The gently effervescent mixture was stirred at room temperature for 90 minutes, forming an orange solution. A solution of lithium diisopropylamide was prepared by the addition of n-butyllithium (2.5 M, hexanes; 100 cm3) to a stirred solution of diisopropylamine (35 cm3) in dry tetrahydrofuran (250 cm3) at 0° C. under nitrogen. The solution was cooled to −78° C. for 15 minutes, followed by the dropwise addition of a solution of methyl 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)acetate (45 g) in dry tetrahydrofuran (50 cm3) at −78° C. The yellow enolate solution was stirred at −78° C. for 20 minutes, followed by addition of the imidazolide solution dropwise via cannula. After stirring at −78° C. for 45 minutes the bright yellow suspension was warmed to room temperature. The mixture was poured into aqueous hydrochloric acid (1.3 M; 700 cm3) and washed with hexane (200 cm3). The aqueous solution was basified to pH 3 with aqueous sodium hydroxide (4 M) and then to pH 7 with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate. The neutralised solution was extracted with dichloromethane (2×400 cm3). The organic extracts were washed with brine (300 cm3), dried (magnesium sulphate), filtered and concentrated to give a brown oil that crystallised on standing.
