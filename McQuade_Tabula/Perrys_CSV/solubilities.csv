"GroupCompoundFormulaCASH, atmRating**The ratings reflect DIPPR® ESP's effort to provide a critical evaluation and quality assessment of each data point with 15 being thehighest score possible. The rating is not directly correlated with the estimated experimental uncertainty.†Henry's constant is a strong nonlinear function of temperature. A single value measured at one temperature, if used for calculationat a different temperature, can lead to serious errors. Procedures for extrapolation of single-point values over the ambienttemperature range (4°C < T < 50°C) are presented in Sec. 22, under ""Air Pollution Control"" > ""Biological APC Technologies"" >""Estimating Henry's law constants"". Estimation procedures for the larger range (4°C < T < 200°C) are presented in F. L. Smith and A.H. Harvey, ""Avoid Common Pitfalls When Using Henry's Law,"" Chem. Eng. Prog., 103(9), 2007.
