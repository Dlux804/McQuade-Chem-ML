W., McLinden, M. O., and Huber, M. L., NISTStandard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport PropertiesREFPROP, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, Md., 2002, Version 7.1). The primary source for thethermodynamic properties is Lemmon, E. W., and Span, R., ""Short Fundamental Equations of State for 20 Industrial Fluids,"" J. Chem.Eng. Data, 51(3):785850, 2006. Validated equations for the viscosity and thermal conductivity are not currently available for thisfluid.Properties at the triple point temperature and the critical point temperature are given in the first and last entries of the saturationtables, respectively. In the single-phase table, when the temperature range for a given isobar includes a vapor-liquid phase boundary,the temperature of phase equilibrium is noted, and properties for both the saturated liquid and saturated vapor are given (with liquidproperties given in the upper line). Lines are omitted from the temperature-pressure grid of the single-phase table, when the systemwould be in the solid phase or if there are potential problems with the source property surface.The uncertainties in the equation of state are 0.1% in the saturated liquid density between 280 and 310 K, 0.5% in density in the liquidphase below 380 K, and 1% in density elsewhere, including all states at pressures above 100 MPa. The uncertainties in vaporpressure are 0.5% above 270 K (0.25% between 290 and 390 K), and the uncertainties in heat capacities and speeds of sound are 1%.These uncertainties (in caloric properties and sound speeds) may be higher at pressures above the saturation pressure and attemperatures above 320 K in the liquid phase and at supercritical conditions.Table 2-110 Thermodynamic Properties of AirTempePressuDensitVolumInt.EnthalEntropCvCpSoundJoule-Therm.Viscosiraturere MPayeenergypyykJ/(mokJ/(mospeedThomscond.tyKmol/ddm3/mkJ/molkJ/molkJ/(mol·K)l·K)m/sonmW/(m?Pa·sm3oll·K)K/MPa·K)Saturated Properties0.005233.0670.0302?1.061?1.061?0.0150.03400.05501030.3?0.407171.43376.6459.7565429736116485600.005533.0310.0302?1.048?1.048?0.0150.03390.05501028.3?0.407171.02371.9246751013556243610.006732.8880.0304?0.993?0.992?0.0140.03370.05501020.3?0.405169.40353.839706088722316065620.008232.7450.0305?0.938?0.937?0.0130.03350.05501012.2?0.403167.78336.917039037833126275630.009932.6010.0306?0.882?0.882?0.0120.03320.05501004.0?0.401166.16321.099474986745986973640.012032.4570.0308?0.827?0.827?0.0110.03300.0550995.77?0.399164.53306.270010925558898158650.014332.3120.0309?0.772?0.772?0.0100.03280.0550987.48?0.397162.91292.392049864173849829660.016932.1660.0310?0.717?0.717?0.0090.03260.0551979.13?0.394161.28279.388889772589832085670.020032.0200.0312?0.662?0.662?0.0090.03240.0551970.72?0.392159.65267.174231670506864827",,,,,,,,,,,,

W., McLinden, M. O., and Huber, M. L.,NIST Standard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport PropertiesREFPROP, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, Md., 2002, Version 7.1). The primary source for thethermodynamic properties is Tillner-Roth, R., Harms-Watzenberg, F., and Baehr, H. D., ""Eine neue Fundamentalgleichung fuerAmmoniak,"" DKV-Tagungsbericht, 20:167181, 1993. The source for viscosity is Fenghour, A., Wakeham, W. A., Vesovic, V., Watson,J. T. R., Millat, J., and Vogel, E., ""The Viscosity of Ammonia,"" J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data  24:16491667, 1995. The source for thermalconductivity is Tufeu, R., Ivanov, D. Y., Garrabos, Y., and Le Neindre, B., ""Thermal Conductivity of Ammonia in a Large Temperatureand Pressure Range Including the Critical Region,"" Ber. Bunsenges. Phys. Chem. 88:422427, 1984.Properties at the triple point temperature and the critical point temperature are given in the first and last entries of the saturationtables, respectively. In the single-phase table, when the temperature range for a given isobar includes a vapor-liquid phase boundary,the temperature of phase equilibrium is noted, and properties for both the saturated liquid and saturated vapor are given (with liquidproperties given in the upper line). Lines are omitted from the temperature-pressure grid of the single-phase table, when the systemwould be in the solid phase or if there are potential problems with the source property surface.The uncertainties of the equation of state are 0.2% in density, 2% in heat capacity, and 2% in the speed of sound, except in thecritical region.

W., McLinden, M. O., and Huber, M. L.,NIST Standard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport PropertiesREFPROP, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, Md., 2002, Version 7.1). The primary source for thethermodynamic properties is Span, R., and Wagner, W., ""A New Equation of State for Carbon Dioxide Covering the Fluid Region fromthe Triple-Point Temperature to 1100 K at Pressures up to 800 MPa,"" J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 25(6):15091596, 1996. The sourcefor viscosity is Fenghour, A., Wakeham, W. A., and Vesovic, V., ""The Viscosity of Carbon Dioxide,"" J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data  27:3144,1998. The source for thermal conductivity is Vesovic, V., Wakeham, W. A., Olchowy, G. A., Sengers, J. V., Watson, J. T. R., and Millat,J., ""The Transport Properties of Carbon Dioxide,"" J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data  19:763808, 1990.Properties at the triple point temperature and the critical point temperature are given in the first and last entries of the saturationtables, respectively. In the single-phase table, when the temperature range for a given isobar includes a vapor-liquid phase boundary,the temperature of phase equilibrium is noted, and properties for both the saturated liquid and saturated vapor are given (with liquidproperties given in the upper line).

W., McLinden, M. O., and Huber, M. L.,NIST Standard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport PropertiesREFPROP, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, Md., 2002, Version 7.1). The primary source for thethermodynamic properties is Younglove, B. A., ""Thermophysical Properties of Fluids. I. Argon, Ethylene, Parahydrogen, Nitrogen,Nitrogen Trifluoride, and Oxygen,"" J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data , Suppl. 1, 11: 111, 1982. The source for viscosity is McCarty, R. D., andWeber, L. A., ""Thermophysical Properties of Parahydrogen from the Freezing Liquid Line to 5000 R for Pressures to 10,000 psia,""N.B.S. Tech. Note 617, 1972. The source for thermal conductivity is McCarty, R. D., and Weber, L. A., ""Thermophysical Properties ofParahydrogen from the Freezing Liquid Line to 5000 R for Pressures to 10,000 psia,"" N.B.S. Tech. Note 617, 1972.Properties at the triple point temperature and the critical point temperature are given in the first and last entries of the saturationtables, respectively. In the single-phase table, when the temperature range for a given isobar includes a vapor-liquid phase boundary,the temperature of phase equilibrium is noted, and properties for both the saturated liquid and saturated vapor are given (with liquidproperties given in the upper line). Lines are omitted from the temperature-pressure grid of the single-phase table, when the systemwould be in the solid phase or if there are potential problems with the source property surface.The uncertainties in density are 0.1% in the liquid phase, 0.25% in the vapor phase, and 0.2% in the supercritical region.

Note 1325, 1989.Properties at the triple point temperature and the critical point temperature are given in the first and last entries of the saturationtables, respectively. In the single-phase table, when the temperature range for a given isobar includes a vapor-liquid phase boundary,the temperature of phase equilibrium is noted, and properties for both the saturated liquid and saturated vapor are given (with liquidproperties given in the upper line). Lines are omitted from the temperature-pressure grid of the single-phase table, when the systemwould be in the solid phase or if there are potential problems with the source property surface.The uncertainties in density are 0.03% for pressures below 12 MPa and temperatures below 350 K and up to 0.07% for pressuresless than 50 MPa. For the speed of sound, the uncertainty ranges from 0.03% (in the vapor phase) to 0.3% depending ontemperature and pressure. Heat capacities may be generally calculated within an uncertainty of 1%. The uncertainty in viscosity is2%, except in the critical region which is 5%. The uncertainty in thermal conductivity of the dilute gas between 130 and 625 K is 2.5%.For temperatures below 130 K, the uncertainty is less than 10%. Excluding the dilute gas, the uncertainty is 2% between 110 and 725K at pressures up to 70 MPa, except near the critical point which has an uncertainty of 5% or greater. For the vapor at lowertemperatures and the dense liquid near the triple point, an uncertainty of 10% is possible.Table 2-120 Thermodynamic Properties of MethanolTemperaPressureDensityVolumeInt.EnthalpyEntropyCvCpSoundJoule-ture KMPamol/dm3dm3/molenergykJ/molkJ/(mol·kJ/(mol·kJ/(mol·speedThomsonkJ/molK)K)K)m/sK/MPaSaturated Properties175.611.8635E-28.2300.035423?12.440?12.440?0.049520.0567280.0703901625.1?0.40884074180.003.7619E-28.0960.035592?12.130?12.130?0.047780.0566890.0707501590.2?0.40373071195.003.2175E-27.6290.036194?11.067?11.067?0.042100.0566040.0708971496.4?0.39791068",,,,,,,,,,

W., McLinden, M. O., and Huber, M. L.,NIST Standard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport PropertiesREFPROP, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, Md., 2002, Version 7.1). The primary source for thethermodynamic properties is de Reuck, K. M., and Craven, R. J. B., ""Methanol, International Thermodynamic Tables of the Fluid State12,"" IUPAC, Blackwell Scientific Publications, London, 1993.

"The values in these tables were generated from the NIST REFPROP software (Lemmon, E. W., McLinden, M. O., and Huber, M. L.,NIST Standard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport PropertiesREFPROP, National Institute ofStandards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, Md., 2002, Version 7.1). The primary source for thethermodynamic properties is Lemmon, E. W., ""Pseudo Pure-Fluid Equations of State for the Refrigerant Blends R-410A, R-404A, R-507A, and R-407C,"" Int. J. Thermophys. 24(4):9911006, 2003. Validated equations for the viscosity and thermal conductivity are notcurrently available for this fluid.Properties at the critical point temperature are given in the last entry of the saturation tables. In the single-phase table, when thetemperature range for a given isobar includes a vapor-liquid phase boundary, the temperature of phase equilibrium is noted, andproperties for both the saturated liquid and saturated vapor are given (with liquid properties given in the upper line). Lines areomitted from the temperature-pressure grid of the single-phase table, when the system would be in the solid phase or if there arepotential problems with the source property surface.The estimated uncertainty of density values calculated with the equation of state is 0.1%. The estimated uncertainty of calculatedheat capacities and speed of sound values is 0.5%. Uncertainties of bubble and dew point pressures are 0.5%.",,,,,,,,,,,
