I have been using this sunscreen since 2012. I can only say that I can't live without wearing it even for one day. Specially during summer I never get sunburn by using it. Thanks nutrogena for this great product.
My wife loves it.
"I bought this last summer with some hesitation because I really hate the way sunscreen makes my skin feel, but after using it all summer I can say with certainty that this sunscreen is amazing! It goes on like lotion, and doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy at all! My face never gets burned when I go out in the sun, and it doesn't make my skin break out! I love it!"
"This is the only facial sunscreen that I have used since it came out. Even at 53, everything seems to give me zits. This sunscreen actually improves the quality of my skin. I do stick with the lower spf, 70. I liked the 55, but it's no longer being made. I'm afraid the 110 would be thick enough to cause acne. Exfoliate your skin well at night, and this stuff works great with minimal white residue at the lower spf."
"I used the 55 for a year - loved it, left my skin smooth and natural looking and kept me from getting burned. I am very fair and when the 70 dried I looked like an apparition - ghost. I guess if you don't bring back 55 we can all use chalk instead of sunscreen - it would give us the same affect. Bring back the 55 and let us make the decision, I'll bet your sales went down after you stopped making the 55."
"I don't usually have a problem with sunscreen burning my eyes, but if this product gets ANYWHERE near your eyes, it burns for hours. And it tends to run into the eyes with perspiration. I had to flush it out for hours with an eye solution. I can't believe that a product meant for use on the face would contain ingredients that are so hard on the eyes. I am throwing it out!"
I'm a medium toned woman who recently tried Age Shield Face Sunblock Lotion SPF 70. I was disappointed when the lotion turned my skin cloudy white when it dried to matte. I appreciate the matte finish but think it is a product flaw or oversight that it turns white. I do not suspect Neutrogena bothered to test this product on woman of color or this issue would have presented itself and hopefully would have been corrected. I will have to give this to a fair-skinned friend.
"For the past 20+ years, I have only used Neutrogena face moisturizers & sunscreens. As a darker-skinned black woman, I do sometimes find that products with high SPF will leave a bit of white residue/slightly ashen look, but I can usually cover that pretty easily with makeup or a adding a small amount of a low-SPF moisturizer. Not so with this - I looked ridiculous!! There was no covering the strange white film I was left with, it looked (and also felt) like I was wearing heavy Halloween makeuo. Very disappointed."
"I used this in place of the fantastic Age Shield and Repair SPF 55 from Neutrogena (please bring that back. It was amazing) and while it left my face soft it left my light brown skin so white that I looked like I was wearing white makeup clowns use on their faces. Therefore, I only use it a night moisturizer to give my skin a chance to return to its normal color by morning. My skin does look great in the morning though due to its other ingredients."
"i have sensitive skin and have used other neutrogena products with great success, however this lotion made my face break out, especially around my mouth and jawline. Now that I paid so much for a product I cannot use - can I get a refund for the 3/4 of the tube that remains?"
"This sunscreen, as another reviewer said, leaves a hideous white residue. It takes 7 minutes to rub in and I'll look back in the mirror a few minutes later and there will be white smudges everywhere as if i hadn't rubbed it in at all. The times I've worn it people have stared and my friends tell me i have smudges on my face. One even asked if i had some kind of acne cream on my face! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!!!!!"
"I have an olive complexion and usually just use a moisturizer and liquid makeup because I rarely burn. Since I work outside my friends have encouraged me to use sunscreen. I bought this stuff 2 days ago. I very rarely burn, but don't want to wrinkle up either. Everywhere I put the stuff I am burned. My face is swollen and red, as are my neck, and ears. With no sunscreen at all this has never happened. Hate!!! Beware!!!"
"Bought this product to replace Age Shield & Repair. Bring it back. I miss the perfect formula with soy makes a difference. It was light, non greasy & perfect for under makeup. Face Shield SPF 70 is too heavy, greasy & gave me a face rash. Please bring back Age Shield & Repair SPF 55!"
"I used the Neutrogena Age Shield face sunblock lotion SPF 70 for months now. I ran out and bought this, which I though was the same, as a replacement. It is not. It has fragrance now; a strong fragrance. I specifically wanted fragrance-free. It would appear Neutrogena added fragrance to all face sunblock lotions. I will be finding a new brand now."
"I have been using this product for a year and loved it. My skin looks really young and when I started using it, people noticed right away. I recently ran out and could not find it in any stores so bought a different product. What a disappointment! I have an age spot that was starting to disappear but now is darker and my skin does not glow like it did with this product. I will be ordering this on line if I cannot find it anywhere."
"I take it everywhere and I try to use it as much as I can. Sometimes I forget to use it daily but if I go outdoors itÂ´s a must !! I LOVE this product! Thanks for making such great products ! I wish it were sold here in Chile ! I just run out of it and bought the same but SPF110 , I bet it as great as this one !"
This works great. I would get it again
"I do not care for this sunscreen, It leaves my face feeling greasy & it cakes."
Nice coverage that is moisturizing. Absorbs into skin nicely and can apply makeup shortly after. Love the silky feel. I'm 55 and always get asked what I use that makes my face look so nice. I've been using this for two years.
Does not absorb well. A little goes a long way. Burns really bad if get into eyes. Helped my acne scars form getting darker. Overall complexion has improved. Will reorder.
I have been using this product for 2 years. I use it under foundation makeup and it gives my skin a beautiful glow. It actually does protect my skin from the sun and from wrinkles. It does not leave my skin feeling oily.
"I have been using this product for 3 years. I use it every day in a sunny country. I'm 55 years old and it actually does protect my skin from the sun and from wrinkles. I have a very oily skin and it does not leave my skin feeling oily. It's a pitty Neutrogena do not bring this to Brazil, so I need to purchase it at USA."
"sunblocks are the best aging protection. Since I always loved Neutrogena I tried this product. To my disappointment, my skin started to become rough and looking dirty. I stopped using this product and in about 2 days my skin was just like it was before. Now I use ""Pure and free baby"" and its working perfectly. I found out I am not the only one who had problems with this new Helioplex ingredient."
"My girlfriend bought this product. And immediately (4-5 hours later) after using it, she was itching.Later her whole body was red and swelled."
It protects me from the sun year around. I live in imperial county were it gets up to 120 in the summer. Everyone tells me that my skin looks nice and young. It makes my face glow. I love your products and I've been using them for years.
"This is a good sunscreen. It'll keep you from getting burnt but I did notice that it makes me break out. I've got oily skin and where i put this sunscreen is where breakouts flared up. But if you dont have sensitive skin then by all means, buy it!"
I have an allegey to the sun and any part of me exposed breaks out in huge welts. I have tried every sunscreen on the market with no success until this. I am all but welt free and very excited about my summer for the first time in years!
"I bought this item because it had a higher SPF (70) than the Coppertone product I had been using. It is a little thicker than the Coppertone product which makes it slightly more difficult to spread, but it will probably do a better job of protection. Of course, I have not used it long enough to know at this time."
"My face is generally dry, and I've had a really hard time trying to find a good sunscreen that doesn't smell too strong or make me break out. This one seems to be working at the present; I just have to make sure I cover every part of my face, even under the jaw line. Every sunscreen has some kind of odor, this one is very light, doesn't give me a headache, but, like all that I've tried, still dries out my eyes after wearing it for hours. We'll see....."
"I've used Neurtogena Dry Feel Sunscreen and been very happy with it - but I thought I'd try the Age Shield this summer. It certainly protects against sunburn - but it feels sticky and after a couple of hours on the golf course, if I rub my neck or face to get rid of sweat, I get a handful of sticky, white flakes. I'm going back to Dry Feel!"
"I have been using this product for over a year and love it! I have combination/oily skin and with other SPF brands my face would be incredibly oily in a matter of hours. This sunblock left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated, not oily/shiny. I wear it over my moisturizer and under my make-up and would recommend it to anyone. I have sensitive skin and have never had a negative reaction."
"We don't need spf 70. The 55 spf is enough, more repair - less block!"
"Non-greasy, can wear under make up. Love this!! Have never been able to wear a moisturizer with an SPF above 25 w/o burning sensation and breakouts."
"Unless I don't know how to apply a cream/lotion on my face, this product doesn't absorb into the skin. Instead it leaves a white residue that looks hideous. Rubbing it in makes the problem even worse."
The best sunscreen I have found for my face. It was originally recommended by my dermatologist. I wear it under my makeup and always get compliments on my skin.
"I've resisted putting sunscreen on my face daily because I have sensitive skin. This product just disappears and is not oily at all. The Sun is intense here in Kansas, now I'll wear sunscreen AND a hat."
"For many years I used Neutrogena Sun Screen - Age Shield and it had a great effect on my face. However, I began to notice a significant difference, and, I finally realized that Neutrogena, unannounced, had discontinued the vitamins in my product. Why not charge more and maintain the quality??? So Disappointing!!! Recently, a friend had a small tube of your product that had sun-less tanning, as well as vitamins in it. Please tell me how I can get this this item? Would love to hear from you! Thank you!"
"I purchased this product because of the Neutrogena name. Unfortunately, it dried out my face around my mouth and lips. I have to use almond oil around my mouth before I use this product and continue to use some sort of oil or lotion during the day. Pretty disappointed."
"I LOVE the original Ultra Sheer SPF 70 face lotion, but not the Age Shield. It did the job by protecting my skin from the sun, but whatever they've added to it made my skin break out bad. I had a rash on my face that took three days and a tube of hydrocortisone cream to fade away! So this product is definitely NOT recommended for sensitive skin!"
It caused blisters and burning on the back of my neck and face. My skin is now red and peeling from it.
I have pale sensitive skin and Age Shield Face lotion has been my go-to moisturizer. Too bad they couldn't leave it alone. Now it has fragrance that makes my eyes water. Now have to find something else.
"I am all about sunscreen to prevent wrinkles and spots, but the scent of this product is off putting. Smells medicinal, to the point that my boyfriend asked why my face smelled like acne cream..not good."
"I used this product for the beach and pool, and I haven't experienced burns.!"
made my face oily & slick. Ultra Sheer was better. Returned product
