I USE THIS AT NIGHT AND ITS SO NICE AND SMOOTH AND SO IS MY FACE..MELTS INTO MY SKIN AND I AWAKE WITH A NEW IMPROVED FACE..SO SOFT AND NOT DRY..LOVE THIS TOO.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one great moisturizer. I use it at night and it is creamy and rich and hydrates my skin well. It could be used lightly for the day, however it may be too heavy unless your skin is really dry. My cheeks do get dry and this does the trick in the day for me. It has a slight fragrance to it and contains no parabens. It really works well when my skin is flaky and irritated. Definitely a keeper for me......and affordable."
"I use this product every night. My complexion looks good. I no longer wear foundation every day, just a day time moisturizer. My skin looks so much healthier. As far as ""defying age""...I am only 28 years old, but my worry lines on my forehead appear smoother."
"This night cream is wonderful! I've only used it twice because I just got it, and it's already doing its job. This morning when I saw my reflection in the mirrow I could not believe how fresh I looked. No oily nose or dry cheek patches, just clean and clear skin. It's magic!!"
This cream is good! Oh yes it is so good I can't go without. It literally healed my acne and my skin looks flawless! I love the smell. Very fresh and feminine. It is worth every penny. I used to spend OMG lots of money at the mall but then one day I said let me see how Olay is at the drug store because I honestly got tired of getting creams that cost in to the hundreds that don't do what they promised. I am telling you that this cream it is amazing! Buy it and you will say the same as I say!!!
I absolutely love this night cream. The scent is very mild and it makes my skin feel amazing. Very reasonably priced for what it accomplishes. I prefer it to the day cream with the SPF because I'm very sensitive to smells and the SPF it just stinks. I do wear SPF when I'm truly out in the sun but for everyday just going in and out of the office I don't need an SPF and those can tend to clog your pores. So this night version is absolutely excellent!
"I use this night cream all the time, for many years [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Olay , and this gift sent to my wife . She uses it everynight ... I think she loves me more than yesterday . You guys , follow me !"
"Like all Olay products this moisturizer is also gentle on my sensitive skin, and is at a reasonable price."
This night cream is a dream! It moisturizes without being heavy! My skin felt dewy and soft after only a few uses! Love this!
"This product is amazing, does not break you out and works great on African Canadian skin tone. I've been using this product for the past 6 months at nights and my skin looks so flawless in the morning. I do recommend this to everyone."
"I noticed that maybe it's the old smell just ""plus"" something, but it is BAD. The cream doesn't feel the same, the smell isnt the same and the results.....well folks..... They aren't the same either. Since using this new version, which olay swears isn't new, my skin is just not happy. This stuff has changed though and I am a bit upset that you (olay) are telling everyone it's the same. I buy cream before I run out and I had almost half a jar to compare this to and Glob A does not match Glob B."
"Reading through other comments I am clearly not the only person who's noticed and is disappointed by the obvious formula/scent change of this product. Really really frustrating to see Olay's team keep commenting that they're ""confused"" to every single comment when clearly we're not all making this up. You changed the product. We're asking you to change it back."
Have used for years. Love it. I ordered on line as is kept in locked display case at store.
"I have been using this cream for close to a year now & like I stated above I have no complaints about it at all. It does make my face feel so soft, I LOVE the scent of it, & it doesn't feel like so many other night creams that are SO heavy & greasy. I will continue to use it for sure! However I just saw another Olay ""age defying anti-wrinkle night cream"" & I'm not quite sure what is the difference between the two? Maybe just an updated version of it? Anyone that knows please leave a comment. Thanks."
"I have been using this product for years (over a decade?!?) because it feels great on my skin, I do in fact look younger than I am and have few wrinkles, and it used to have a great smell. Unfortunately it now has a very intense perfume smell that is quite bothersome. I was hoping that something had just gone wrong with the particular batch of night cream that I had picked up, but after finding this webpage, it sounds like the product has actually changed. :-/"
I have used other Olay products and needed a night cream so decided to try this...excellent!
This product is one of the best products I have ever used! I would definitely recommend this to family and friends. Try it out and you will love it.
"I am so annoyed. I have used the age defying night cream with chamomile for years. The pink gel-cream texture and scent were perfect! Why get rid of a good thing? Idk what to use as night cream anymore and my skin is looking cruddy. This product smells like the baby powder I use on my toddler, who wants their face to smell like that? Ugh."
"Bad Bad to change a product that I and many people like. Please stop changing the box and the product. If you are selling it, leavie like that. I love oil of ole defying nigh pink not the white. and it is sooooo difficult to find it. If you ever don't make it again I will stop using Oil of Ole."
"I just bought a new jar of this cream and I DO NOT like the smell and didn't prefer the pink color of the cream. I am trying to find the Age Defying night cream that is white in color, has a very peasant smell to it, and feels so creamy on my face. Please answer this review that can steer me to the Olay night cream that is age defying or anti wrinkle and doesn't have retinol in it. I used a night cream before that had beta hydroxy ingredient but was white in color and smelled so good."
"I have been an Olay user for well over 20 years. There was no nighttime moisturizer better than the Olay Age Defying Classic Night Cream. However, as other have pointed out, it has changed. The scent is different and not as pleasant, the cream is thinner and not as substantial, I go through the jar quicker than before, and it doesn't work the way it used to. I wake up in the morning and my face always feels dry. I will not be purchasing this any more."
"I've discovered with my recent purchase that Olay has two Night Creams that appear EXTREMELY similar in packaging. My favorite was white, wonderful cream with a dreamy soft scent. The box/jar had Night Cream and Age defying and ""Anti wrinkle"" on it. The other new one just says Night Cream Age Defying - ""Classic."" This cream is tinted pink and has a different feel and scent. I highly recommend that Olay resolve this confusing issue for their valued customers."
I have used Olay face products for over 50 years and have always loved them. I still use the serum(hard to find) the day moisturizer and Olay body wash but had to start using Aveno night cream because I can't use anything perfume. You definitely changed the formula and can not use it. So sorry the old peach colored cream was so nice I could have put it all over me. Annie
"I used to really love this cream. But the newest jar I bought has a strong perfume scent that really bothers me. I thought I was going crazy, that maybe I had forgotten the way it smelled when the jar was full--but no, it is different. The other reviews confirmed it. It's different and I don't like it. I'm returning it and I am on the hunt for a new night cream!"
What did they do to the smell? The night cream used to have a subtle pleasing scent. What happened? It also feels less creamy than in the past and contains a slightly different tint that makes it seem like a bunch of chemicals. I will no longer purchase the night cream. Hope they don't change the day cream -- that one I still love and it provides the perfect blend of lightness and creaminess for my face. I prefer it without the sunscreen since the sunscreen versions feel too heavy.
"I have used this product for years. I am sensitive to fragrances and it always was so soothing. It reminded me of my mom, who used Olay products as long as I can remember. The new smell is TERRIBLE. The Marketing genius who thought the change was a good idea didn't know her audience. I am looking for a new night cream."
"I have used this product for many many years. I feel it is the reason I have few wrinkles for my age. A few months back the lotion I purchased had a terrible, strong perfume smell.I don't like it! I even went to some smaller stores to see if I could find an older version. Now I am PLEADING please make an older batch and I will buy several jars... and from the other reviews I am reading so will others. Please please help, loyal life long customer!"
"I loved this product and have used it for decades faithfully. But I bought a new bottle last night only to discover upon application that they have changed the fragrance and it is very unpleasant and strong for me. Even my husband commented on the ""smell"". Disappointed, I washed it off and will no longer be able to use it. =["
"I was surprised to see how the color, texture, and smell of the cream has changed. I've been using Olay for years as well as my mom and grandmother did when it was ""Oil of Olay"". The scent is what really reminds me of my grandmother and how wonderful Olay products are. I'm all about bettering and innovating products but I feel this product has taken a step back."
"I've been using this night cream for years. Exceptional product. Occasionally I'll try a more expensive cream, only to return to Olay. I recently purchased a new jar and was sooooo dissapointed in the scent change. Its the most offensive, perfume-y smell. Had to wash it off, not tolerable. I tried a second jar from another source..same thing. Just awful. Will not purchase again."
"My Mother is 97 and uses her Oil of Olay every day. Her skin is beautiful. When you ask her what she wants for her birthday or other occasions , she will say ""my cream"". I would be happy to send you her picture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Light gel like consistency, has a light fragrance that is nice. Once you put it on you can feel it working. Is better than the expensive brand I used to use. Doesn't break out skin but makes it clear and feel moisturized. Love this product. Please don't stop making this!!!"
"i bought this 3 times before i discovered the active hydrating sensitive skin beauty fluid, which i now prefer. but while i was using this night cream i loved it, it's lightly scented like soft petals and clean air (weird but it fits i think :)) it is cream-gel like in texture and non-greasy, a great over-all cream that i found firmed the face nicely as well :)"
"I began using this product approximately six months ago and have loved it from the first night! It makes my skin feel soft and moist from the time I put it on until I wash up the next morning. I love the fact that it does cost a fortune to buy, thank you Olay!"
"I really like this product. I use it regularly every night. I'm not at a place where I really need to fight wrinkles or lines, just prevent them, so this is great for me. I put it on at night and when I wake up in the morning my skin still feels very hydrated. I have a furrow in my brow that kind of lingers sometimes and this has helped keep that small wrinkle at bay."
"I have been using this for consecutively 2 weeks. I like the product and my skin feels hydrated in the morning. My only dislike is that it has a weird fragrance to it which I feel cheapens the product, and I haven't noticed any skin tightening feeling right after I put it on or in the morning."
I wouldn't be without it it's the best and a great price last for a long time too.
It works great!
Good and inexpensive night cream. Can see a difference when i don't use it. Smells good - don't know what it used to smell like but it certainly is horrible as some state.
I have used this lotion for a very long time and was very upset when they changed the smell. I have searched all of the local stores in hopes of finding an old one with no luck. I will not be buying this product anymore until it is changed back.
I've used this product for years. Just bought a new jar and found out they changed the ingredients and scent. So disappointed...not as good as the original...too strong and where's the chamomile? Please change it back!
Very disappointed with my new jar of Age Defying Classic night cream (like other reviews I've just read). I've been using Olay for years; now I'll have to change products. This new one will go in the trash! Very sad!
"after apply this lotion, the sensation is different, feels so soft, and after 2-3 days you can see the difference on your skin, simply the best !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin since using the classic night cream feels soft and moisturized. I only need to use a small amount nightly to get great results, Olay products are affordable and my skin thanks me daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just dot this cream over my face and gently smooth in. It feels wonderful, smells very light, and leaves my face moisturized and fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As I have aged, my skin has gone from super oily to really dry. This night cream continues to soften my skin despite those changes. Love the scent too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this face moisturizer twice a day as part of my skin regimen. I love that it keeps my skin young looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"this was the first cream that i purchased from Olay. The ingredients in the cream were excellent, not to harsh on my skin. when i woke up in the morning my skin felt soft and tighter with each night. i say its a great starting out product."
"I read some good reviews on this and the price is so cheap so I gave it a try. The result is disappointing, I do not see any skin improvements overnight after using this, and I had better result using other affordable night creams, like American Beauty Beauty Boost Overnight Radiance Cream. To be fair, I will continue using this bottle and see if there will be any results over time. I'm 25, Asian."
"Overall no complaints, product has a lovely light scent and feel."
This is one of the best nourishing creams on the market! It made my skin feel so soft and smooth...I will continue using this product forever!!!
"I love this product, the texture and smell are amazing!"
Why have you changed this classic formula fragrance? The smell is bad please can you change it back
"i like the smell, but i don't see any difference since i am using that creme"
I used this night cream for a while. I loved it. Makes my skin soft and glowing.
