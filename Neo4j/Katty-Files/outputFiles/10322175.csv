I have been using Oil of Olay consistently for over 34 years! I get asked consistently for over 34 years what do I use on my skin? I don't need or use all the expensive non-wrinkle products out there because Oil of Olay does the job.
"This is a light sunscreen that wont break out your face. My sister died from melanoma when I was 26, so Ive worn sunscreen everyday through my 20s, 30s and now into my 40s. I know a thing or two about sunscreen brands. Okay did not disappoint with this one."
This cream works well for me. It gives my skin the proper moisture it needs.
Have used this for years. I'm 75 & get complimented on my skin often. Wish the rest of me looked as young as my face!
So far it is helping with the bags and wrinkles around my eyes only used for 1 week but shows improvement
I have been using dept. store brands for many years! I started using Olay anti-wrinkle lotion about a month ago and the difference in my skin is so remarkable I will continue to use it and not go back to the other brands!!
I have enjoyed this product. It is not greasy or messy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the light weight formula and light fresh scent. I tend to this before my primer. I also like the low cost. For drugstore face lotion this is a good buy.
"Great product that doesnt clog my pores or irritate my skin. Ive been using Olay for years and dont plan on switching! I works wonders and I highly recommend this product to all skin types, especially combination!"
"I really like the Olay Complete with SPF 15, so I decided to give the Age Defying version a try. It seems a bit gritty and I have a hard time applying my foundation over the top of it. I don't see that anyone else has that complaint, which is surprising to me. Definitely going back to Olay Complete as it's a smoother formula."
've been using Olay for sometime now and can visibly feel my skin smoothed out. The pores and lines seem less obvious and my face has a soft glow.
"Olay lotion moisturizes your skin without leaving it looking or feeling greasy, and its a great weapon against anti aging and sun damage. Your face will feel so smooth, plump and rejuvenated. I recommend it to everyone and would most definitely buy again."
Love this product. I use this product everyday right after washing my face in the morning and right before bed after taking off my make up. Keeps my skin healthy looking even in the cold winter. The packaging was nice and this is my 2nd bottle so definitely recommend it.
This gentle lotion is my go to daily cream. Very gentle feels great and love that it has SPF 15 to protect my skin everyday. Even in the bitter cold of winter my skin always feels hydrated. The bottle lasts forever and just a small amount is all you need.
"Im not old and I dont really have wrinkles but this has prevented from the wrinkles beginning and it also has helped the scars on my face while keeping my face moisturized. I love that it has SPF 15 in it because im pale lol, but I wish that the lotion didnt smell like it."
"I have been using this lotion for it's suncreen effects rather than for it's anti-wrinkle purposes, so I cannot write from that perspective. However the lotion feels very light on the skin and can be worn under makeup. It also has a little bit of a smell but not unpleasant."
"I'm someone who does not have to worry about wrinkles quite yet, but this stuff has been a staple in my morning skincare routine for about two years now. It soaks right into my skin, and creates a solid base for makeup. It's a very affordable product, and a little bit goes a long way which makes it last longer as well. I have dry skin, and I'll often add a drop of oil to this product which ends up being perfect."
Great value. A lot of product for your money. This is my go to moisturizer since it's affordable. No greasy residue. It does its job for sure. It goes on under my makeup and I like to let it fully absorb before I begin my routine. I will use this again and again.
"I love it! I have only started to use this. It has a light fresh scent and it blends easily into the skin. I like that it is not like regular sunscreen where it is white and streaky. I have oily skin, and this cream doesn't make me oilier, which I like. My skin absorbs it fast! I wear glasses and would notice that my nose was getting darker because of the sun, and the eye area was light. Well, this sunscreen has stopped that! It really has! Now I can't stop using it!"
It is an amazing product. Many olay products are amazing. I use their products often from skincare to body care. Their packing on any product is always on point the only problem is that it's a little small. Olay is gentle with touch and or sensitive skin they will have you so soft and make you feel so amazing.
Perfect!! It completely protects my dry skin from the sun!! One thing I have noticed in Olay products is that once you stop using them you lose your progress. Like your skin just reverts to how it used to be. I'm not sure if that's the case with other people but it is with me. So a 5/5 with the sun protection part but Olay need to upper their game when it comes to permanent results!!
"Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Day Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 15 pulls double duty. It keeps your wrinkling at bay, moisturizes your skin and the Spf 15 protects your skin from the harmful rays of the sun. Easy open and Close packaging. It's light and doesn't feel heavy on your skin."
"Doesn't seem any different than Complete, just comes in a smaller bottle and cost more."
Great cream. Lasts a while. Lots of moisture. Little goes a long way. Very affordable and smell is minimal
Soo smooth and helps to keep my skin fresh throughout the day even in the driest weathers I experience in California
"This is great if you get burnt easing or if you love the sun but dont want to age to quickly, hydrates skin and leaves for a soft finish ."
One of the best product that I've used. It literally gives freshness to my skin. Highly recommended Olay. Try it now.
Love this so much I love all their products can never go wrong. Amazing price I always pick up a bottle when I can
"this product was kinda pricey, but you pay for what you get good value smell is very strong but Im sensitive"
I absolutely love this product. It is very gentle on the skin. A little oily but I have combination skin so it didnt mess with it to much. Very nice and small packaging. I would definitely recommend. Its a great product.
"This is my favorite. Ive always seen my mom wear this, and Ive been using it since I was little, and its absolutely amazing. It makes your skin so soft and just protects it from the sun. It really works. Love it"
Ive used this product for years and have tried many other products and always return to this product. It makes my skin feel so great in the morning and in the evening before going to bed! This Product is very reasonably priced as well.
"Just ok for me. I'm not a fan of the smell, its seems more of an older lady fragrance in my opinion. My skin is dry and I felt like I had to reapply at least 3 times to get adequate moisture."
Light and nice scent. Moisturizes quite well. Not horribly priced for quality. Olay Complete Lotion All Day Moisturizer With Spf 15 For Normal Skin It meets my expectations. Easy to find and super easy to use.
Olay age defying Anti-wrinkle Day Lotion is light weight and less greasy then most sunscreens. I enjoy this product because it was effective and did not irritate my skin. Id like to look for this produce with a higher SPF.
Ive been using OOO products since 15 and im about to be 49 with almost no wrinkles. There is definite benefits to using a good facial moisturizer like Olay.
Good day lotion. Isn't greasy. Light scent. Like that it has spf in it to help protect face. Very gentle. Olay is a trusted brand I've used for years. A little pricey but worth it.
This moisturizer is great for daily use during the day love how it protects my face against the sun nice and gentle and keeps from having more dark spots at a affordable price!!
"This was really helpful during summer , the day lotion with the sunscreen broad spectrum spf 15 helps as a shield to protect the skin from harmful rays"
"I know it's old school, but I can never quit Olay facial lotion. I often try new lotions, but always go back to Olay. Plus, it is reasonably priced compared to others and available everywhere."
I have been using this cream for the longest time and I swear by it. I love it and will continue to use it. I would recommend this product for daily use. Thanks.
This is my go to for my daily moisturizer. I've been using this for awhile now. Winter time I have really dry skin & this is such a good product for that! Definitely satisfied & I'll be purchasing again!
I have used this product in the past and the only reason i dont use it anymore is because of the price. The packaging is great an product is great but i found something more affordable #.
Olay Age Defying Anti-wrinkle Day Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 15 I noticed the glow and smoothness on my face after applying this day lotion . It is very effective and a great product!
"Thank you Olay. I have been using your products since I was 18 years of age. I am now one month shy of being 51 and have been carded for a purchase of cooking wine this past year. Most people think I'm in my 30s. That is such an awsome feeling. If asked, I always let people know that I've been using Olay products for over 40 years. THANKS AGAIN!"
My go to since highschool. It's very light and does that job. Great product for everyday
I've used this since I was a teenager and I can only imagine what my skin would look like without it. Thank goodness for the spf!
I love the way this makes my skin feel it's so amazing and it smells so good n makes everything smell good and doesn't leave greecey hands
I like this it makes my skin feel nice and soft and it's effective. The packaging is great and it's affordable.
Oh how much I love this. Wrinkle free anything I love. And a plus point is it has spf sunscreen 15 love that
It is so great it helps minimize my wrinkles and sometimes my strechmarks it helps me calm down from a stressful day.
love to put this under my foundation leaves my face so moisturized smells good it has spectrum spf 15 witch is great
I love the anti aging product since I have mature skin. It helps plump it back up and makes it look young again. Helps with my sun damaged skin.
"It works really well for me. I love, love, love the beautiful scent it gives off. It soft it's presented amazingly."
This is not one of my favorite olay products. I don't feel like it moisturizes my skin as well as it should.
Have utiluzed this product for longer than 20 years. My face loves it and the smell is so calming and refreshing..
"This bottle contains more than the small jar, it's perfect for any day use. Sunscreen mixed in really helps me save time in the morning!!"
Definitely worth the money. No need to buy high end and is easily accessible to all! It is non greasy and absorbs quickly.
"I use this everday, it works good as a moisturizer. a sunscreen, i feel like i see a difference. I use it all the time in the summer to sit outside."
Love this product! Helps so much with moisturizing and fine wrinkles. I use it under my make up because of the spf protection.
I've been using this product for years and years. I prefer the oil free and higher spf. I also use the Aveeno. Tend to like Aveeno better.
This product is truly amazing! It leaves your skin feeling so healthy. It exceeded my expectations!
Lowe this product is not greasy goes faster on your skin the face after using fell wery soft and nice i recommend
I used this mostly because it has sunscreen. I recommend since it's very hydrating. My face felt very soft and hydrated as soon as I put it on.
Once applied to the skin it does a very good job with keeping it nice smooth and looking tight highly recommended for All skin Types
Keeps my face from drying out. I use everyday because I like it and the price is good for my budget. I will keep using this product
"The lotion is good for all skin types and absorbs very easily without leaving a residue or dripping when you sweat, like Regenerist (I apply prior to going out for my morning runs or hikes)."
"love this cream! It's very soothing on the skin. It isn't greasy like a lot of other facial creams. It's so refreshing and light. I have sensitive skin as well as combination to oily skin. I'm always worried about break outs when try different skin products, but so far so good with this one. I highly recommend this product! It absorbs well through the night and in the morning. It leaves my pores feeling clean and clear and I'm constantly have people thinking I'm a teenager. That's a great feeling at 38 years old."
"This is a great beauty product on a budget. I only tried this once at my aunt's house, but it smelled good, moisturized my skin, and hopefully protected me from harmful sun rays. It was slightly greasier than I would normally like, but the ""dewy"" look wasn't terrible. Would recommend!"
"I use this in the summer for a light moisturizing sun screen and I like it a lot. It tends to feel a little heavy when first applied but doesn't leave a layer on top of the skin. Keeps my skin protected from any harsh sun for casual use, but wouldn't use it for a full beach day."
"This lotion is great for people with dry and sensitive skin, but also prone to sunlight. After cleansing my face I wear this lotion to moisturise my skin and to prepare myself for a day outside. Olay is a great brand generally for dry skin as it fully hydrates and smoothens the skin."
"Easy use. Let soak in. I am older but I used the original pink since I was about 12( stole it from my older sister) I don't really have any wrinkles except for upper lip. The product is not the same as back then I think it's made in Mexico now. With all its good for all over and can be carried in you purse, sometimes I just use it on my hands."
"I use this lotion underneath my foundation. At first, I thought it was not hydrating enough for my dry skin. So, the 2nd time I used it, I applied more & it was fine. I love the texture because it is not sticky & too thick. I also love the scent!! It smells very fresh & clean. Another feature, I like is the bottle. It doesn't take up a lot of room & it's easy to store. As long as Olay continues to sell this...I will continue to buy it!!! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have always used Oil of Olay Day moisturizer. It feels so good going on, and protects me with the SPF factor. I am Irish and very light skinned so I have to be careful in the sun. I have used Oil of Olay for over 15 years now. People think I use an expensive fancy lotion. I say this because I am 42, and people think I'm ten years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I especially like the day formula that has Spf 15. I recently had to see a wound care specialist for an infection on my face. He strongly recommended staying out of the sun and using sunscreen. I do not sit in the sun, but feel I have added protection outdoors with this Olay formula. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This olay lotion has a nice smell it's a nice texture but if you have sensitive skin like myself it will leave you with red rash on your skin and it only takes overnight so do not buy unless you Don't have sesitive skin I just use around eye area so I don't have to throw it away but I would recommend it if your skin is not sensitive its a nice lotion just a little harsh for skin like mine
"I am 28. I just started to take care of my skin two years ago. I have been using Olay original, Total Effect, and Age Defying. So far this one has been my favourite with the lightly nice fragrance. Plus, it has SPF to prevent from sun burn. My Mom even realizes my skin look fresh, glowing. My friends ask me what do I use. I tell them about Olay!!!! Please don't discontinue this one."
Great lightweight moisturizer. I use this daily or Olay Age Defying Protective Renewal Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15. I stock up on both whenever I find coupons. I have been using these for years and use no other moisturizer or night cream.
"I love this product, and I use it every morning along with the Olay's Regenerist Regenerating Serum. It's light, smells lovely, and it definitely keeps my skin well hydrated all day long. I also love that it has sunscreen, because I am outdoors a lot during the summer, and it's a relief to know that my face is protected so well! So inexpensive and so wonderful. This item is a must for all women who want their skin to look as good or, as in my case, even better than it did when I was in my 20's!"
"I searched for years for a moisterizer with sunscreen that did not irritate my skin. This wworks perfect for me. I am 61 and no one believes me. I have used Olay since i bought my first astringent in the 60's. I have tried all the expensive brands and always come back to Olay.Can't beat the amount you recieve for the price. And most importantly, you can't beat the results!!! Thanks so much Olay!"
"This particular product is excellent. I use it for the SPF benefits and hydration it provides. Over time I have even noticed the tone of my skin becoming brighter, with less occasional breakouts, especially during certain times of the month. I highly recommend it."
Tried and true. This is a consistent moisturizer that I have been purchasing for years.
"Goes on smooth and isn't greasy feeling. This was a good price, too."
Goes on smoothly and I always feel comfort knowing I have sunscreen on my fave daily.
Goes on thin. Not thick like some sunscreen lotions. Great for use in all seasons! Highly recommend
Some of my favorite stuff for your face! The smell is amazing which is very important to me. But it makes my skin feel so fresh and so clean. I will continue to recommend this and continue to use it as well.
I used this mostly in the summer and it worked great bc I am very pale and it helped me not get sun burnt . I am glad that I used this product . I would definitely recommend it for other people to use
Easy to use moisturizer. I wouldn't say it was bad but I wouldn't say it was great either. Got the job done to say the least. Smells fine and has a good consistency for a lotion. I don't think I'll be rebuying.
I have been using this facial lotion forever! It's pretty good! I just wish the SPF was a bit higher. It's nicely packaged and had a pleasant scent to it. This lotion meets my expectations and I would recommend this to others!
Great moisturizer! Very affordable with decent results. Moisturizing without being greasy or sticky. Lasts through out the day without feeling the need to reapply. Great for sensitive skin and with the added bonus of an SPF!
There was a time that i use this lotion day and night i just use to put this on and then m ready to go out. I loved it but after using 3 bottles it stop suiting my skin and i had to stop using it and switch some other stuff
I had recently ran out of this and was using up some old facial lotion. Soon I noticed my sun spots or age spots or whatever spots were coming back. I'll never run out again!
This cream is so smooth and works great on your skin. I like to use this during the day time to help protect my skin. It goes on very nice and is not thick at all. I would use again and recommend to anyone looking for something light.
"I use this lotion daily. I love the smell and feel of it, and it doesn't leave a greasy feel on my skin. It helps keep away those unwanted age spots. It's absolutely age defying!"
"I turn 50 this year and have been using Olay products for over 30 years. I love the Olay Age Defying Anti Wrinkle Day Lotion with Sunscreen, it is simply the best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Moisturizes without feeling greasy, easily absorbed into the skin, sunscreen included, so easy to use every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion has totally changed my skin. I can use as much as I want to condition my skin and improves its tone. My makeup even looks better over my skin now. Thank Oil of Olay!
"I used this lotion for a couple of days and it made my skin very sensitive. I would love to keep my skin wrinkle free, but not if the product causes discomfort."
"Love this product apply after the shower ! Simply amazing,I would recommend this product and will continue to use."
"I first bought this for the Added sunscreen, but after using it, I make sure to buy and wear for all weather"
This is the perfect product. Very useful. Also worth buying. I refer this product to my friends and my family.
Nice and light. Good for daily use but not for complete sun coverage if you are going to be outside a lot.
"Love love love. This is my daily go-to, and life sucks without it. It leaves my skin feeling so quenched and smooth."
Love this anit-wrinkle lotion! Its very moisturizing and applies amazing into the skin. This product is in my skin care routine.
"I was kinda disappointed in this product.. I expected more from it, but didn't get the results I was looking for.."
The stuffily is at 1 of my favorites. The smell isn't that great. I'm not a fan of the texture. But it's okay when it comes to hydrating.
A great daily moisturizer!! Don't leave skin feeling over oily... nice smooth feeling and fresh scent that won't break the bank too!!
I enjoy this lotion. It's really moisturizing and the spf is excellent for my skin. Any protection I can get for my face the better!
It was alright. I realky like the olay complete woth the spf in it as a moisturizer better. I feel like it gives me better/more noticeable results
This product works very well not everything is a miracle worker but you can definitely see the difference within two weeks.
I think it works. But time will tell. I do feel that it has worked in the past. But now that in 35 I may need to go to something stronger.
This product works as described & I've had good results. Recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
great inexpensive lightweight moisturizer. great for warmer days when a cream is too heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Must have sunscreen to keep skin protected. Smells great but not too strong. Love it.
Feels light on my skin and blends well with my makeup base. Love the sunscreen in the lotion.
A traditional brand that's perfect for every day use. Not oily or greasy. The added SPF is perfect.
Used this since a teenager--people cannot believe I'll be 60 next year!!
"Used for several months, day in and day out...no change"
Smell good.
