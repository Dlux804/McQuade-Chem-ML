"I bought this product ONE day ago, and my skin is already radiant. These past few months, my skin changed from being non-sensitive to VERY sensitive, and I was weary about trying products. This one seemed to have each category I was looking for, so I figured it would be worth the money. I am excited to see what further results this product has for my skin!! Thank you, Aveeno! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use Aveeno face moisturizer year long for protection of the sun. I love that it is creamy yet light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I have been using it now for 4 months on my face and neck. It's a great moisturizer and smells really nice too. Very happy with it and will continue using it.
"this is an easy to apply daily moisterizer with the spf added. since i have only used it for 3 days i cant speak to the effectiveness as a cream that also evens skin of blemishes. but again so far i like the feel during application, its not to thick/thin as i havent had to re-apply throughout the day."
I have loved Aveeno moisturizers with sun protection for some time. I would give it 5 stars except that I want Aveeno to move to biodegradable or 100% recycled packaging.
"I bought this moisturizer hoping it would help smooth my skin out after using a different product for a while. The first time I put it on it felt good. The next day I woke up with a very swollen, red, and irritated bumpy rash all over my face and neck. I am obviously allergic to something in this moisturizer. Not hypoallergenic. Very disappointed. Was hoping for a good product as I love their eczema lotion for my hands!"
"Like others I have been using the spf 15 version for years. I do not have sensitive skin and have no allergies to anything..... except the spf 30 version. After 2 uses my eye lids are red and swollen, my face has bumps all over it, and it itches like crazy, the perfume smell is also a huge turn off."
The pump stops despensing with at least 1/3 of the product left in the bottle. Which means you spend weeks screwing off the top and banging the product out of the top.
The only problem I have with this product is that Wal-Mart does not carry this in the stores. I haven't figured this out. They carry the 15 sunscreen in the moisturizer but not the 30.
I bought this product because it includes a SPF30 and moisturizes my face at the same time. It is not greasy and the results show quickly on your skin.
"I've been using this moisturizer for over 8 years, and I will continue to use it forever. I've tried a couple other moisturizers in the past (just to try and change things up a bit), and not a single one has worked for me as well as this one has. It doesn't leave your skin oily whatsoever, it's very lightweight, and has a nice clean scent. Love love LOVE."
I use AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® Daily Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 daily under my make-up. It works great and isn't oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I need a moisturizer that has an SPF of 30, and other products I've tried have a smell that does not agree with me. This one has a wonderful scent and I don't feel like I have sun screen on. I will always use this product!"
Thank you. I have finally found a product to help my dry flaky face. I have been using the product for about 2 months. My brown spots are lighting up and it helps with my fine lines. I have used prescription RetinA and it didn't lessen the appearance as much as this has. Thank you.
"I have to say that I'm a high end department store moisturizer snob. I was given this to try and I have to say this is a fantastic moisturizer! It is lightweight considering it has the SPF, it absorbs in a reasonable time and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. I plan on continuing it use and will be saving a bundle of money in the long run. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"i was recommended by a lady at a cosmetic store to purchase this product for my 15 year old daughter, she had and uneven skin tone due to sunburn and started to feel uncomfortable with it . After i bought this product she used it for three days and started to get dryness on the fourth day her face started to flake ,what is the reason for this is it a normal thing , should she continue using this or stop . If she should stop could you recommend something for her uneven skin tone i would be so grateful THANK YOU."
I have used many different products for my dry skin. I started using this product about 2 months ago and I love the results. I no longer need to wear face make up. I just put on a little mascara and go. I have already recommended this product to friends and family.
"I used this product for about 3 weeks every night with the positively radiant daily scrub, and then all of a sudden I got bumps all over my nose that I thought was just a breakout of pimples, but I never get pimples so I thought it was strange.. My skin is very sensitive and that is why I thought Aveeno would be perfect for my skin. A couple days after the nose breakout, I put the moisturizer on,, just like I always do, and I got raised red hive like bumps on my left cheek and chin. DO NOT USE THIS IS YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!!!"
"I had severe acne. After continuos visits to my dermatologist, my acne has stopped but there were still acne scars. My derm. suggested this product, after the first use u see a difference. Non greasy, clean smell, and it adds a beautiful glow. Approx. after a few weeks i realized fading of my acne scars. This product also has sunscreen which is great during the winter and summer in order to prevent from future scarring. Absolutely Love it!"
"I have very sensitive skin, so this might not be the case for everyone, but I found the moisturizer fine up until the first week of use. After that, I started to break out in unusual places, somewhat symmetrically. The moisturizer was the only thing I changed in my daily routine. It left me with painful red bumps near my eyes, on my cheeks, and under my lip line. Unfortunately, I wanted to like this product because I need something with high SPF and I do like the smell. I just can't use it with the irritation it causes my skin."
I am absolutely in love with everything Aveeno! I am getting ready to turn 62 and was told a couple of weeks after using the cleanser and moisurizer that I must be very happy and content in this phase of my life because I positively glowed. I even was able to sell 3 bottles of Aveeno moisturizer while standing in the store where I bought the product from. Got rid of every other product and can't wait to buy more Aveeno.
"While at a graduation ceremony this summer, I noticed the complexion of one of the guests and asked her, what make-up do you use? She replied, Aveeno cleaser and moisturizer. I was stunned, for I do not like the feel of makeup and her skin was so radiant and natural looking, I am trying it and so far I am very pleased. My skin has began to be even toned! I love it!!!Thank you, for I have searched for years for you!!!"
"I used this product the first time and my face turned red, had a fine rash and itched so unbelievably badly! There were 2 other things that might have caused the same reaction. I eliminate those and tried this product again and the same thing happened. I use other Aveeno products and am so surprised! Will definitely not be using this product again."
"At 38 years old I have tried and tested many products. I have the type of skin that changes from one day to next, dry, or greasy or sometimes spotty or sometimes all together...I am so pleased to have found a daily moisturiser that makes my skin 'normal' and as an added bonus it also has sunscreen. The only thing I would change is the container, so much is wasted in the bottom of the pump bottle, bring on a pot!"
"before using Aveeno my skin texture wasn't smooth but after using it for some days it really changed. My face skin became softer and brighter and I love it. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family and I have already done it. Aveeno is now my main moisturizer for daily use. it's great that you can really soften your skin and protect it from the sun at the same time and it doesn't feel greasy. In my opinion is an awesome product,"
"About a year ago, I began to really notice the ""age spots"" along my jaw bone and lower cheek area, as well as overall dullness to my skin. A relative recommended Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer and I began to notice changes within a couple of weeks. The dark spots are barely visible without foundation. I now use Daily Cleanser, Scrub and Positively ageless eye cream. No problems or irritations. I am well pleased with these products. I love being able to go without make-up and have confidence in my appearance."
"I have great skin, never have problems, and I decided to add a daily routine in the morning for skin care I used the Daily Moisturizer & the Daily scrub, for 4 days and each day my skin got dry, and now stings terribly. My skin is so painful, can't put anything on my skin right now, not even make up due to the fact it hurts & burns. Never had any issues like this before. Very disappointed & in Pain :("
"I bought this product about 2 weeks ago after seeing the ad on tv for years. Let's face it, who doesn't want to look as good as Jennifer Aniston. I have been using it once a day, in the morning before I put my makeup on. While driving today, I looked in the mirror and saw how glowing my skin looks. I have a few light age spots and honestly I can't see them with makeup on now. Around my eyes looks firmer too. I am definitely pleased and will continue to use this product."
"I recently purchase the Aveeno Men Face Wash and needed a Moisturizer but Aveeno didn't have a Men's SPF Moisturizer .. so I purchase this product and is great, very hydrating .. I have one suggestion to consider possibly adding the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Ingredients Into like Aveeno's Men Face Wash Bottle but as a Moisturizer because I really love your products and In need of a Moisturizer with SPF."
"I bought this product after the darker patches on my face began to get worse and my skin was becoming incredibly uneven. I was afraid of using fade creams as they tend to irritate and dry out my skin. This product gradually evened out my skin tone and actually IMPROVED the texture of my skin instead of drying it out and making my skin irritated. I would highly recommend this product to everyone of all ages, because it was effective without being harsh on my skin. Thank you Aveeno for giving me beautiful skin :)"
"My skin is not sensitive at all, nor do I break out often. I usually trust Aveeno products, but this lotion made my skin completely rough, bumpy and irritated. I stopped using it and within a few days my skin is back to normal. Do not recommend this product."
"I had dry skin during this whole winter and I was hoping this would help with not just my dry skin but also even out my skin tone, but after using it for 2 days, I started to notice a few breakouts on my cheek. I haven't changed my skin care routine except for adding this daily moisturizer in. It also didn't help with my dry skin whatsoever. I had high hopes for Aveeno and really wanted this product to work out. I wouldn't recommend this if you have oily skin either."
"I have been eagerly awaiting a product like this, it is amazing and does exactly what it says it will. I am happy with the results derived and I will continue using it. I started seeing results in about 4 weeks after using it twice daily. If you are looking for beautiful glowing flawless skin, try Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer."
"I used this moisturizer a few years ago along with the brightening cleanser and it worked great. I stopped using for a while and I recently purchased it about 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately, a few spots on my skin have started to peel and turn red. I really wanted this moisturizer to work especially for the Spring/ Summer. Now i'm scared to try any other Aveeno moisturizer."
"I'm a person who loves Aveeno, and has used Aveeno's body wash, body lotion, facial cleanser, and hair conditioner. When I bought this product, I was very excited to try it out. However, after I applied some to my face, I started to break out a couple minutes afterwards. There was a burning sensation, and I had bumps all over my face. I am fairly disappointed in this brand, as I had full faith in your products."
"...after using this product. I was so excited to find a moisturizer with a high spf sunscreen, but this product made my face rough, dry, and old looking. Sooooo disappointed because Aveeno is supposed to be gently on the skin. Now I don't know how to make my skin go back to normal."
"I wanted to use this product because I heard that Aveeno was good for people with sensitive skin. Unfortunately not for me, as soon as I put this cream on it stings my face like mad! Im not sure what ingredient is giving me such a harsh reaction but I returned this product quite quickly sorry!"
"I bought this product because I need a moisturizer that with added sun screen. After a using for 2 days, I felt tingling when I applied it. After that by skin was red and soooo dry, itchy and flaky. In fact I have red swelling. I stopped using it and bought ponds dry skin cream and cortisone. It cleared out after a week. Is there any way I can return it."
"I used to use this product a lot, but I stopped purchasing it. I recently decided to repurchase it and when I applied it, the skin surrounding the eye area, not the eye area itself, started to burn. it felt fine on my forehead and my cheeks and chin, but the area surrounding the eye just burned like crazy. Which I thought to be pretty strange since I don't have sensitive skin."
"I have the old version of this product, that was fragrance free. I cannot seem to find the fragrance free version anywhere now? What happened to it? why can't I find it anymore? This one is ok but the fragrance gives my skin a slight burning sensation. Had to switch to Olay that has a fragrance free, oil free spf lotion. Sad I can no long use Aveeno :("
"I have combination skin, with an oily t-zone and dry cheeks. This moisturizer is very lightweight, especially compared to other moisturizers on the market, so it works perfectly for applying every morning before makeup. It moisturizes my dry skin enough that makeup applies smoothly, but doesn't add extra oil to my t-zone. My face looks and feels great. The only downside is that it is very lightweight, so it can't be used as a deep moisturizer without applying a lot of product."
"I have been using this moisturizer for the last couple of years, probably at least 8 bottles. I have very dry, sun-sensitive skin and the product is very good for that purpose. I get a nice silky texture and do not need an extra sunscreen. However, it does NOT remove brown spots. Getting rid of my brown spots has become my obsession and this is NOT the product to do that."
"I wear this under my makeup every day, and I love it! I have pale skin and moderate acne, and this protects my skin from the sun while fading my acne scars! My only complaint is that it's a little heavy for my oily skin, but it's fine once it absorbs!"
"Really evens out you skin tone. I have combination and have had acne scars :(. To my surprise not only does this product protect me from the sun but it has helped even out my skin tone along with my acne scars they are not so noticeable. My mom, my sister, and I use this product every single day. This product is just truly amazing I highly recommend it."
"I buy Aveeno because I have incredibly sensitive skin and allergies, and their products are usually scentless and gentle. Not this one. The heavy perfume smell is instantly overpowering, and I could feel my nose running and eye watering immediately after I opened it. I tried to wear it to see if the scent would lessen as the day wore on, but it didn't, and I ended up washing it off and taking tons of benadryl to stave off a full-blown allergic reaction. If you are sensitive AT ALL to strong scents DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
"I have been very satisfied with the results of this product. My skin is actually brighter, and my age spots have diminished significantly. I hope Johnson and Johnson would consider producing an overall moisturizer with the same ingredients so the rest of my body could have the same results as my face."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. This moisturizer provides spf 30 without feeling greasy or too heavy, and it absorbs into the skin quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft for hours afterwards. I'm looking forward to evening my skin tone through regular use. I like that one moisturizer can provide multiple benefits."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. This is a great moisturizer that I have been using every day. I have noticed that my skin is much clearer and looks more radiant than before. It has a good balance of keeping my skin moisturized but not feeling oily."
"I wanted to love this ""daily moisturizer"" and bought it in conjunction with the targeted tone corrector to even my skin tone. By my 4th day of use, however, the skin around my chin and jawline began to burn when I applied it. I tried again on day 5, after which that area of my face, along with my cheeks, became incredibly dry and itchy with flaking and peeling. I stopped use, but it took another 3 days of frequent cortisone applications to restore my skin."
"I bought this moisturizer hoping it would help me with the increased dryness my face suffers from during the winter months. I began using it daily, and the first two days were awesome. It smelled great and I loved it. But each day from then on, when I applied this lotion my face would burn. The burning got worse the more times I put it on, so I had to stop using this less than a week after purchasing it."
"I misplaced my bottle of positively radiant dail moisturizer , then bought a new one upon finishing the new bottle I found the old bottle and was happy I did not have to buy a new one but when I looked carefully , I realized the this old bottle had expired since the 3rd month of this year...is this bottle still usable, , will it cause damage....Help"
I bought this for my daughter and she had a bad reaction to it after using it 3 times. Needed Benadryl and cortisone to help it get better. Stopped using it immediately. She had used other Aveeno lotions for years with no problems. Not sure what's in this one that made it so harsh on her skin.
"i have used almost every products in the market and even pricey department store products.everything makes my skin greasy ,breaking out all the time.i have a combination oily skin.but finally i have found a amazing product!!i love you aveeno!! it did wonders to my skin feels so good on my face.its been a month now i dint break out!!dont stop this product for ever aveeno!! this is my lifetime moisturizer i wont change it for ever!!"
"My sister reccommended this product about a month ago,,,I had to go buy my own bottle. I don't like to wear a lot of makeup but need to even out some redness etc. This little bottle does exactly that! This moisturizer is so light non greasy it goes on so smooth. Go out and get your self a bottle! I am 50 and this is all I use any more. Thank you!"
"I have been using the Clear Complexion Cleansing pads for about one year and absolutely love the results. I decided to try the Positively Radiant daily moisturizer and the targeted tone corrector. Sadly, after about 2 or so days of use, I broke out with a facial rash. I was so disappointed because I really liked how the moisturizer did not add an oily appearance to my face. I hope it clears soon as I am a bit embarrassed, having to be at work with a facial rash. Maybe it does better for those who don't have sensitive skin."
"In your product mentioned above, Aveeno Active Naturals daily moisturizing lotion, the ingredients include Cetyl Alcohol and Benzy Alcohol. I heard Alcohol included in lotion is drying on the skin. Is this true? Would this lotion be good for my extremely dry skin, especially the hands. Is it good for the face. I will appreciate your reply. Sue Adams"
"I've tried other moisturizers over the years, but I always find myself -- especially if someone I'm staying with while traveling has it in their medicine cabinet: shhh -- coming back to this daily facial moisturizer. It not only has the sunscreen protection that I look for, but it also smells amazing, and feels light on my face. If there is a better moisturizer our there, I have yet to find it. SPOILER ALERT: there isn't. Thanks Aveeno!! (:"
"I am extremely disappointed at this product. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to a beauty product and when my dermatologist recommended this product for evening skin tone, I was really excited to try it. Within 2 minutes of use, my face broke out into a rash, it was burning and itchy. I'm shocked that this product is promoted as being hypoallergenic."
I have been using Aveeno positively radiant for the past 5 years and plan on using it for another 5 +. After years of searching for an affordable moisturizer with SPF in it I found perfection in this little bottle. It evens out my skin tone and doesn't feel too heavy on my face.
I usualy use a different product. My local store was out and I needed something. I love Aveeno body lotion so I thought I would give it a try. I am very fair skin and need the spf 30. I hate the smell and it leaves my skin oily ( I have dry skin). It has also made my skin break out. Very disapponited! Should have went to another store to get my usual!
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. Having the addition of using Aveeno to my normal daily routine was a great expereience. Nothing kept my face as natural and soft as Aveeno. I kept my face looking bright, reduced my spots, and help soften my skin upon application. I would recommend this product to all especially since it has SPF30 its a bonus! I"
"It's a lie!! I have been using this product for over a year. I had some slight sun spots on my cheeks. Well, the spots are still there. Advertising that this product makes brown disappear is a false statement and false advertising. The only thing it does is provide temporary brightening."
"Clinically proven? By whom? Was it a double blind long term study? Who funded it? This does not ""improve: - Tone - Texture - Brown Spots - Dullness - Blotchiness"". And there is nothing in this product that will do that. It does have some ingredients that will make these issues appear faded temporarily (as in a few hours after applying it). If you are thinking of buying this product for any of these claims skip it."
"I started using this a few weeks ago and I'm pretty impressed by it. It doesn't make me break out like other moisturizers do. It doesn't aggravate acne that's already there. In fact, it eases them so they don't turn into scars. I use this in the morning and at night before going to sleep and it's been getting rid of the dark circles under the eyes and the overall redness around the eyes. I will definitely keep using this and see what else it does!"
"I've been using this product for about 2 years now. And let me say, it is amazing! It goes on very smoothly, it isn't heavy, and most importantly it is effective. It actually does even out your skin tone. It fades dark spots. I can't leave the house without wearing since, I can't wear makeup. It makes my skin look brighter and more awake. I defiantly recommend this awesome product."
"I tried Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer and absolutely love it! I immediately felt it working! It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and smells great!! I use it daily and I have had some of my friends use it and they loved it and went right out and bought some!"
"This is an awesome product. I requested it for Christmas and to make sure my family bought me the right one, I picked it out myself. I have been using every day since I opened it and it is truly Amazing. I love how soft my skin feels in this winter season because with the heaters and dry air, my skin takes a beating and this is an Awesome product. Thank you.!"
I am currently on vacation and spend a lot of time travelling in the car. The car has tinted windows and I always wear huge sunglasses and apply sun screen. I used aveeno spf 30 as directed (reapplied every 2 hours) and still got burned. Is there a way to get the money back? To be fair it does a good job moisturizing the skin and really is non-comedogenic.
I have been using this moisturizer for over a year now. I think my complexion has improved with its use. On the weekend I can just wear it with blush if I don't want to wear foundation . I would feel confident enough to go out without foundation. I also don't find the scent of it offensive. I don't think it's too greasy or heavy either. I'm very happy with it.
"I love this product and it last a long time! You get more than your money's worth with this product! It soothes, conditions, hydrates, protects, and calms the skin. I have tried the department store brands & they always break me out and don't feel the same. With this product I feel it working and I see it working on my face! It protects me from the sun and prevent redness. I love it and I hope you never mess with the scent! I love the scent!"
"This product isn't too heavy, but isn't too light. If you have dry skin I wouldn't recommend it, but if you have combination/ oily skin it might work for you. The one thing I don't like about it is that you can tell you are putting sunscreen on your face (not the greasy kind, but the same texture). I would like it much better if it felt more like a moisturizer and less like sunscreen."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I enjoyed using the sample because it did not leave my skin oily, but I did not notice any skin conditions improve such as tone, texture, brown spots. I used it every day before I went outside to work, and it was very effective for sun protection. I would use again but only for sun protection and not necessarily for skin improvement."
"I love this moisturizer! It makes my skin soft and smooth, and really seems to even out the redness I usually experience after taking a shower. The bonus part is that it has SPF30 to protect my face from sun exposure all day. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I tried Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer as a Crowdtap mission. I was very impressed by the way my skin felt after I used my trials. It left my skin feeling wonderful, not oily or dry. It left my skin with a healthy glow. My brown age spots and blemishes have faded. It is oil free and hypoallergenic which is great for my sensitive skin."
"Light and airy and never greasy, is just part of the amazing virtues of all Aveeno products! It feels amazing on your skin, adds so much moisture it ought to be against the law and never leaves your face feeling oily or heavy. It soaks into the skin almost immediately and stays on all day or night and leaves your skin feeling great and younger!"
The single most important thing I can do for my skin is SPF. Living in South Florida it is very important to put a high SPF on every day. I am 46 and learned many years ago that a combo product of SPF and daily moisturizer is the way to go.. This is one of the best available.
I'm glad I finally gave soy a chance after trying everything else and spending a lot of money on products that did nothing for me. I was very surprised that soy actually worked and it's been so gentle. Recently I added a retinol product to my skin care and the fading has increased even more! I think the retinol is allowing the soy to penetrate my skin further.
"I have to wear a high SPF daily due to my history of skin cancer. Not only does Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer have the SPF I need, but it makes my face look more radiant than makeup. I used to try to cover up my freckles with concealer, but after trying this product, it's all I wear. I look radiant! Thank you Aveeno!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I have dry sensitive skin and have tried almost every moisturizer available. This one is probably one of my favorites. Its gentle and definitely helps with my dry skin. Its thick enough without being annoying. Ive also noticed a small change in skin tone."
"I love this product, it feels amazing on my skin and I couldn't be happier with the results I see and feel. I love how soft it makes my skin feel! I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
I love this product and am very satisfied with its performance. My skin is more even since using it and of course sun protection is very important to me. Other sunscreens I've used are greasy and since I live in an area with high humidity...it's been a challenge to find one that is not! My only suggestion is for Aveeno to sell a larger quantity.....perhaps 4oz container!
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I was so excited to try this . Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 left my skin feeling smooth and fresh . My uneven skin tone is now a thing of the past . Thank You Aveeno"
"I have always used Aveeno products,,,especially liked the Positively Radiant TINTED Moisturizor."
"It seems like you don't offer the ""tinted "" version anymore. I used it also as a light coverup..."
"I will use moisturizer...but it was the ""tint"" that sold me on the product... Hopefully at some point you will again offer it,,,"
"I've been using this moisturizer for about a year and a half now, and it works amazing on my face! It makes it feel so smooth, and after about a month of daily use before applying my usual makeup routine, it instantly brightens my face and I have never gotten pimples since I started using it. I love it. The scent isn't too bad, it smells like a normal lotion."
I switch between products all the time. This is my favorite though. It goes on quick. Moisturizes my face and makes me look polished as if I'd spent time putting on make-up. I tend to be cheap but I think this is a product I will invest in again. All I need is 1 1/2 pushes of the pump.
"I have pale skin,freckles,anxiety that has caused many lines in my face and dull skin. This product did more then I imagined it would. I put it on every day for the last week and I already see a texture change. I also loved how it smelled and didn't go on like oil. I loved everything I read on this product and loved how it made my skin feel. I will be purchasing!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. This product made my skin feel fabulous. It works better than any other product I've used. I love how you can instantly feel the moisture, and it blends in to your skin perfectly. I would highly recommend, and will be adding this to my beauty regimen."
"I felt like this was such a great overall product. I got a free sample to try from Crowdtap and was pleasantly surprised. I'm very picky about the feel of the moisturizer that I use. This was a great consistency. Nice and thick, but not too thick. It worked well on my very dry skin and I felt like it lasted all day. Definitely a product I would buy again and again!"
"I am a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program, and Aveeno sent me samples of its Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to review. It goes on easy and has a light clean scent to it. It moisturizes as expected and works perfect for my on the go lifestyle of shuttling kids from practices, games, and club meetings."
I received a sample of Aveeno positively radiant to review. I love it! My skin is so soft but the product doesn't feel heavy. It has a light pleasant scent and isn't greasy. It lasted all day after I put it on early in the morning. It also worked wonderful under my makeup. After using it for a few days I could tell a difference in the condition of my skin. Its a big hit with me. Highly recommend!
"I have used this lotion for aprox 3 years, and it's the best moisturizer I have owned, and I have used plenty of them. It was recommended by my dermatologist because of skin discolorations and it clears out my skin, although its a long process but it does its job and serves as a moisturizer and has sunscreen protection. Highly recommended!"
"Decided to try this to help even out my skin tone and help with scars and spots. I've been using it for a few months now, and I had even ended up giving it a second chance. This does not help even skin tone or help with scars. It doesn't remotely do anything that it even advertises. Waste of money, not happy with it at all. Also leave my skin very splotchy and red all day."

I am a member of CrowdTap and was given the opportunity to sample this product for free and review the product. I have always loved AVEENO products and was excited to try this one. Other product ts tend to leavey skin feeling greasy but AVEENO moisturizer is totally different. It left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. I also enjoyed the scent very much. I would recommend his product to anyone looking for a great moisturizer with added SPF protection.
"I got this moisturizer as a test sample from Crowdtap. This great moisturizer for oily skin. Its light weight, doesn't have too much of a smell and after using it for a few days my skin feels softer and is starting to look better. With the 30 SPF I don't have to worry about getting a sunburn."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. The lotion was a little thicker than I thought, but it disappeared into my skin without it feeling greasy. I have oily and acne prone skin, and this lotion did not cause break-outs."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I love the way it moisturizes my skin while keeping it protected ,the smell was nice ,made my skin feel soft and smooth while evening texture and dark spots ,tone . a must have and I recommend it ."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I have oily skin and the moisturizer was great but I noticed that my skin got more oily throughout the day and I'd have to dab my face. Instead of wearing it during the day I may wear it at night instead."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I loved this lotion. It keeps my hands smooth for days and smells great too. Many lotions have too strong of a fragrance, but not this one. I love it!"
"I haven't used this for 4 weeks yet, so I can't speak to those claims, but I like it enough to continue using it. It's really light and absorbs quickly. It's not greasy and it didn't make me shiny. The scent is light and doesn't last too long, like a perfume. I did receive a free sample from crowdtap, but all opinions are my own."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I like that this product is a moisturizer and provides spf 30 protection, instead of the spf 15 that most other products of this nature have. This light formula did not clog my pores and provided all day moisture. Aveeno Positively Radiant gave my skin a soft, even texture. I can't wait to see if it lightens my brown spots."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.

"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” The product was very easy to apply. Absorption was quick. It was pleasant smelling and not greasy feeling. My skin looks brighter and feels very soft and smooth."
"I love that it absorbes fast. It doesn't have a nasty smell. It lasts all day. I live in Arizona so it is important to have something with SPF in it. It's great that I can get a great lotion and SPF all in one. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program, and Aveeno sent me a sample of its POSITIVELY RADIANT DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"After trying out this product for several days in a row, I was pleasantly surprised that not only does it go on completely non-greasy, but it didn't break out my very sensitie skin. It has a good amount of SPF, and my face didn't get burnt any of the days I was out in direct sun light."
"As a member of the Crowdtap sample and review Aveeno Team, I was provided a sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer. I immediately liked the smell of it, very pleasant and feminine. This brand is known for being hypoallergenic, but I still spot-tested it as I have very sensitive skin, and I had no problems. Used it for a full week, and am very pleased with how soft my skin is, and how even my skin tone is. DEFINITELY buying the full-sized product!"
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” This went on great, not runny and not greasy. The scent was light and fresh. My skin felt great after use."

"My skin is dry, dry, DRY! When I was given a chance to try Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with SPF30, I was thrilled! Aveeno helped moisturize my skin without leaving it feeling greasy, and the sun protection was an extra bonus! if you have dry skin, you must try this product!! I received a sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant in exchange for my honest opinion."
"I really enjoyed using this lotion my skin tone is so much more even and brighter . I love how it keeps my skin protected from the sun without breaking out my skin. It feels lightweight and smells great. I love how it easily melts into my skin without leaving the streaky look some products with SPF leave. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"This moisturizer made my skin feel so soft and supple! It has a nice pleasant scent, not stron just natural. It absorbs into my skin quickly and didn't leave it feeling greasy. I also like that it has SPF 30 in it so it includes sunscreen all while keeping my skin hydrated. The best thing is I can use it all year long! Thanks Aveeno I would definitely recommend!"
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I loved the way the product felt on my skin.It felt like it has helped improved the texture of the skin and hopefully with time , it will help improve my uneven skin tone and dark spots."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I am so pleased with this moisturizer! I my face felt smooth and soft. I felt that I had a glow to my skin as well. I like this moisturizer has a sunscreen as well. I no my face is protected against dryness and the sun. The moisturizer doesn't leave an oily residue which I can appreciate. I highly recommend this product."
"I really like this lotion, i walk about 2.5 miles daily and live in florida, i noticed around my eyes i felt discomfort, im not sure if it is the scent or the lotion itself but i have had to be more careful around my eyes. But i do really like the lotion it has an spf30 and its very moisturizing."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. For the few days that I have used this product I have been 100% satisfied, my skin has never felt so soft and smooth. The SPF30 is a major bonus since the weather has been wonderful and I have been outside non stop!! Would highly recommend!!!"
"I enjoyed using this product and how well it moisturized my skin without feeling heavy. I have not used it long enough to attest to whether it will improve the look of brown spots. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"This stuff is amazing. I switched off of this in the winter when I felt that I needed more hydration, but I am back to using this again. I switched to a gentle cleanser and now this provides the perfect hydration. So if like me you think you need more hydration I'd consider switching cleansers first. I have rosacea and I have never had a problem with this and I can see that my skin tone is more even."
"I've been searching for a daily facial moisturizer with SPF 30 and the other's I've tried have left a heavy/coated feeling on my face. I have sensitive, dry skin. This product is feather-weight, non-greasy, & I like the fresh, light fragrance and ""glow"" it has to it. It doesn't dry out my skin or cause flaking. I haven't been using it long enough to comment on whether or not it will help even out my skin tone, but I'll continue to use it for the SPF 30."
"This is the first time I used this moisturizer. I like that it does a great job softening my skin and goes on easily, and isn't oily. I think it is better used at night because powder makeup gets a little cakey over the moisturizer but otherwise I liked it a lot."
"I really enjoyed trying this moisturizer. It goes on so smoothly and makes your skin feel soft. I like that it has SPF so you get good sun protection as well. It's nice and light weight not at all greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has a decent smell also which is nice. overall a very nice moisturizer. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I didn't have long to use this product (<1 wk), but I can definitely feel a difference in my skin so far. I look forward to using this longer to see the changes in my skin's texture."
I recently tried Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 and loved it ! It was gentle on my very sensitive skin and also provided me with protection from the sun which I also need. I loved how it did not have a strong fragrance nor did it smell like sunscreen products that are currently on the market. I loved how light and sheer it was and it absorbed quickly.
"I love how well this moisturized and that it provided the additional benefit of sun protection. It absorbed well into my skin without feeling greasy. It left my skin feeling refreshed all day. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
"I really liked that Aveeno's POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 was not greasy and had a pleasant, mild scent. As soon as I applied the moisturizer my skin felt silky, which I loved. After working a 12-hour day, I returned to work to have a co-worker ask how I could look so ""fresh"" after such a long shift and returning for a morning shift. I smiled and said: ""It must be the Aveeno!"" Plan on adding Aveeno to my beauty shopping list. Thanks."
"Great product, makes my skin feel protect and moisture. I high recommend to anyone I know,. Im a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
Super picky with moisturizers but this one has been great. I have been using for a little less than a month and my skin texture is great. It does not feel cakey or like you have anything on your face which i love. I already bought my second bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I spent years trying to find a good moisturizer and when I found Aveeno I just knew that this was going to be the one that will be amazing I use this with the face wash and then as soon as I get out of the shower every single day I put this moisturizer on and it just helps hydrate my skin so well. I've been using this product now for probably over 2 years and I do not get any other moisturizer this has been the best moisturizer I have ever used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Goes on thin but does a great job of smoothing the skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Lightweight. Smells good. Been using it religiously and it made my skin very smooth. Helped a lot with sun exposure as well.
I received this for free. This review is my own opinion. I love this light non greasy formula plus it is great at a sunscreen. Use it daily in the summer for dure
"This product is great! I started using it and it toned out my skin, but you have to use the facial wash because it will help out alot. it moustirizes and its great for after shave as well."
"This is a wonderful moisturizer. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Intensive Renewal Serum to review.”"
Was recommended by my skin doctors So I listened and it was an improvement in my skin You ladies must try it. You men also. It works for both genders.
"Perfect for my sensitive skin. Another very popular, highly rated brand caused huge bumps on my face. I've been using Aveeno for several months now daily. LOVE IT!!"
My dermatologist gave me some samples to test because I was having issues with my face. I have exzema & dryness especially on the forehead and behind my ears. I am very satisfied with this product. My skin feels and looks richer and clearer.
"My old daily moisturizer with SPF 30 changed ingredients, and it was so thick it ""pilled"" when I put on my foundation. I switched to this Aveeno product, and so far, I just love it. I hope to update to excellent after a couple of weeks!"
"I absolutely love Avveno's Daily Moisturizing Lotion, so I was really disappointed with this product. It burns even an hour or so after using it. Especially around the eyes (even though I leave a good gap around my eyes when applying)."
I use this both in the summer and winter and alone or under makeup. Moisturizes without feeling heavy or greasy and it really does even out skin tone. I use it everyday.
I have very sensitive skin and have broken out in rashes and dry itchy skin from several products until I tried Aveeno tinted mosturizer. I will never buy anything else!
"I was given samples of this product, and I love it! It has a nice scent, goes on light, and my face feels moisturized. I have sensitive skin and the lotion feels great!"
After using this product my face got very red and irritated my eyes were red and teary I had to stay home from work I have never had such an adverse reaction to a skin product before I thought aveeno was supposed to be gentle.
"At first it goes on kind of greasy, but absorbs really fast. I do not notice a strong fragrance like others have reviewed. I have used this for a week now, and looking forward to seeing an improvement in the 4 weeks mentioned. We'll see."
"first few days worked well, but by the third afternoon my face feels uncomfortable, red and puffy like an allergy. I have always simply trusted all your Aveeno products and purchase one or at one least every other week."
I USED THIS FOR THREE DAYS AND STARTED BREAKING OUT. I THAN WOULD GET VERY RED AND BLOTCHY AND ALSO GET MAJOR DRY SPOTS. I so wanted to use this because all of the good reviews.
"It hydrates, leaving skin soft and smooth without being greasy! Usually I can feel the oil on my forehead about mid-day, but not with this SPF Moisturizer! My skin tone seems brighter and lighter too!"
"Just bought this and applied it for the first time. My initial reaction is that the fragrance is WAY too strong. I like the lotion better, much milder. May take it back for that reason."
"I bought this cream with excitement. After two tries, I developed a rash on my face. It is very disappointing ! I am not sure what ingredients this moisturizer has that make my skin develop a rash. !"
ive used this product for years with and without the concealer and now i just use this product everyday instead of makeup and it works great...thank you aveeno for making a product that does what it says :)
i use this after a shower on my face because it gets to dry and i works really well and keeps my face from getting dry but not oily. Ive used it for a long time and would continue using it because it makes my skin feel fresh and clean.
I fell in love with this product and it worked for everytpne in my home my husband my kids all loved it I will be getting more as soon as I can I got this free to try and give honest review about it and am just amazed about it
"I bought this product couple months ago and I am very happy and pleased. It really works, leave my skin soft and glow.i highly recommend this product."
"Loved the softness of my skin, but because of the sent I get dizzy. Sounds strange but I am allergic to strong perfume,flowers,etc.. Maybe if they make it scent free I will try it."
"This stuff actually works, I have tried other brands but nothing work. It removes my dark spots and even my skin tone. I'm going to keep on using it."
"i bought this product bc i ran out and i didn't have time to get my usual. it has a strong scent, caused a stinging sensation, and made my skin very rough and dry"
"I bought this about a week ago, and have been using it every morning and night. Since I started using it I have been break out so badly. I have acne prone also. But I thought this wouldn't break me out, but I was wrong. I will never buy this again."
"its an okay moisturizer, it makes my skin soft. it does make my skin glowy but that could be because of all the spf reflecting the light? so my skin looks like its glowing? other than that, i was not impressed."
This lotion is really good. I normally try to use the same lotion all the time but when given the chance to try this I decided to. It smells nice and has a smooth even texture to it. It glides on evenly without tugging.
"I wanted to love this! Miss Glamorazzi (from Youtube) loves it so I thought it'd be a great replacement for my more expensive moisturizers. However, it breaks me out every single time. And I never break out! Sorry Aveeno, I'll have to pass."
While using Aveeno positively Radiant moisturizer spf 30 I noticed how soft and smooth it leaves my skin. Using it left me confident about going into the sun and going out without makeup. I love it and will continue to buy it.
I am a red head and I work out-of-doors. It was recommended by my Dermatologist that I use a good moisurizer as well as a sun screen with at least an SPF of 30. This one product gives me both in one application. I love it.
"I really like this product. It evens out dark spots in my face. However, where can I purchase this in the Philippines? I tried looking for this products in leading supermarkets in Manila, but, I failed to find one."
I was using it but I didn't like the fact that it made my face appear a little red. It tingles maybe I just have a sensitive skin. I'm switching to a different one. I want to try the Aveeno calming one instead.
"I didn't find anything spectacular about this product. It didn't make my skin feel any better. It can help you from burning your face, but I didn't feel like it did anything else."
"AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 was wonderfully lightweight and didn't have an overwhelming scent. My skin stayed moist for a very long time and looked ""repaired"" after using it."
Aveenos positively radiant leaves the skin looking great and feeling great. It takes care of the spots on a persons face. I absolutely love this product!
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. This is a great product that moisturized and protected my skin from the sun."
I had that chance to try Aveeno Positively Radiant through Crowd Tap and I must say I love the feeling of my skin and the amazing scent it had it didn't irritated my skin at all and is just wonderful knowing the it is protecting my skin .
"I have used this for about a week now and my kids (boys) cannot stop touching my skin. When I ask them to stop they say no, your sooo soft mom. They also compliment me on how good I smell. It moisturizes all day and doesn't feel greasy"
I've only used this product for a short while but so far it has made my skin feel smooth and silky without being overly oily. The tone of my skin is even starting to become more consistent. Would definately recommend to a friend.
I absolutely loved sampling Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer. My skin is very sensitive and a lot of products make me break out. Aveeno didn't make me break out. My skin is so smooth without the greasy feeling.
I am so excited that I was able to receive free samples to try of the aveeno positively radiant daily mostiurizer! It left my skin feeling and looking amazing. Love how it is oil free and improves the look of my skin.
"After about a week of daily use, my skin is glowing and feels incredible soft. I noticed an improvement in a small brown spot that I had. I love Aveeno products and this moisturizer is the best."
I normally have dull uneven skin but after using this my skin has become brighter and more clear! I love how light it is and how it isn't messy to apply. It works great and I highly recommend.
I liked the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisterizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 because it left my skin feeling soft. I also like the added bonus of the SPF 30 to protect my skin from the sun.
Love how weightless and smooth it goes on. Very light and pleasant smell. Makes my skin feel so hydrated and soft without feeling oily. Great product at a great price.
"I think this is a nice product for use outdoors, however I would not use it for an extended period of time indoors on in place of my regular daily moisturizer."

"I love this product. If you want a smooth tone you have found what you are looking for. My face glows on a daily basis, that's why I use it. I'm not just saying that other women that I know stop me and tell me I have a beautiful complexion. I'm telling the truth. I recommend Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer SF 30 one hundred percent (100%). Guess what? 6lyrs, old."
great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is excellent product. I am using this product over the 4 years and fits perfectly for my skin.
i have been pleasingly been using this product for a few years now and absolutely love it. unfortunately for me i suffer from acne and scaring and this product definitely does make a difference in fading dark spots. i also like that it is spf30. i use it every day.

"This daily moisturizer has a pleasant smell to it with just a hint of sunscreen smell as well. The texture is very pleasing, its not too oily and rubs in very well. It keeps your skin feeling soft and moisturized for hours. It also has spf 30 to protect your skin from the harmful uv rays. Thanks to Crowdtap I was able to sample this product for free for the purpose of my review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I was very happy to open the package.

I switched to Aveeno because of Crowtap and I'm so glad I did. My skin not only looks great but it feels great too. I have switched brands and am 100% happy that I did."
"I received a free sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to try. I loved the feel of the moisturizer on my skin...so light and it just melted right in, leaving my skin feeling soft, clean, and fresh. The best bonus is the SPF 30 sun protection that is built right in. So not only can I look great, but I can be confident that my skin is protected as well! Thanks, Aveeno, for a great product that I can't do without!"
Does not leave the face sticky nor does it have a bad smell. Very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Didn't really live up to expectations and the product keeps getting dry in the bottle. It has a good smell though.
This is my favorite moisturizer. It's very light and refreshing to put on in the mornings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product works fairly well for a drugstore brand cream and has good spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product makes my skin soft when moisturizing and also has a glow to it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This products leaves my skin soft to the touch every morning, when I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I brought this a week ago because I loved their other products only to find out how terribly it affected my eyes. It burns and makes my eyes teary for hours. Initially I thought it was because of my mascara and the weather that I was getting allergic to but no I noticed it's the moisturizer. Extremely disappointed with my purchase of this product.
What am I going to use now? I used this as my base for years. I always got compliments on my skin.
I love how light this moisturizer applies and it leaves my skin feeling soft and brighter!
I have used Aveeno for several years. I am very thankful that I am NOT allergic to Aveeno because it surely improves of the appearance of my face.
I used this for 3 montsh and I love it. I'm sensitive skin oily T zone and this works perfect to me! Ready to try with tint!
SEEMS LIKE REALLY GREAT LOTION BUT THE SMELL IS VERY VERY STRONG REALLY NEED A FRAGRANCE FREE VERSION
This was the first Aveeno product I ever used. I absolutely love it and since switching I have not used any other lotion on my face.
i love this product i used it for a week now and i already see the difference... my brown spots are fading... i wish they make a NIGHT CREAM TOO.
This is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. I have sensitive skin and will be sticking with this Aveeno product for good.
I really liked the thickness of this product. Smell wasn't overpowering and I felt protected while wearing it.
Have used the product for over a year! I like it and need SPF 30 since I am a redhead but this product only comes in 2.5 fl. oz. Very Frustrated!
"Very greasy and oily looking, yuck! No need for the SPF cause you wont be going out in the day time with this on."
"It lists the product as hypoallergenic, but it has fragrance listed as an ingredient which could especially aggrevate patients with fragrance allergy"
I really like it. Is natural with soy. Absorbe quickly. No fragance. Is very light so a wear before I put makeup on. I will recommend try it!
been using for yrs how ever don't like pump bottle you lose 1/4 of cream should package in jars to get moneys worth.
i've been trying a varity of lotions with sunscreen since turning 40. this lotion may be it! my skin is so soft!
I was able to sample this product from #CrowdTap and I must say I loved it!! My face looks and feels amazing!!!
I noticed a difference in a matter of days. I noticed brown spots were starting to fade. I would recommend this to everyone!
"I like this product very much, I BEEN USE FOR 3- MONTHS IT STAY ON GOOD [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My go to facial sunscreen for the summer. Really like that it has SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had a wonderful experience with this product. I have brown marks on my face due to sun damage and I now notice a lightening of those marks along with now having protection from future damage .
"I received a sample to try for free and I have to say I really do love this product. It went on easy, absorbs right in, none greasy, creamy, and made my skin feel super soft with no breakouts."
"I have many skin allergies and have been using this for years, as it was recommended by my allergist. This product is now causing allergic reactions and skin infections. The moisturizer now has a new fragrance. The ingredients must have been changed."
"I've been using this moisturizer for a couple of years and been relatively happy until now. Recently, I bought a new bottle and now my skin is so incredibly oily that I have to continuously wipe the thick layer of grease away all day. Nothing else in my skincare routine or diet have changed except for this new bottle of Aveeno. I'm so disappointed that I have to find something else."
I have been using this product for many years and I was always very impressed with the texture and how it had a whipped cream feel to it. Well now they changed the name to it slightly and the formula. It's now called Sheer Daily Moisturizer and it's kind of runny. I would've given the old product a higher rating.
"The reason I wanted to try AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is because it has sunscreen. So many lotions do not have any sun protection and I have very fair skin and need that SPF. My skin, which often times feels dry during the day, felt very nourished, but not greasy. I really liked this product and will be adding it to my daily routine."
I like the fact that Aveeno Active Naturals contains sunscreen and is made from soy. Another plus was it is non greasy when applied. My experience with the product was not all that grand. After using for several days I did not notice a change in the the tone or texture of my face. I have dry skin and it did nothing for it. My cheeks did break out with small pimples witch is not normal for me.
I'm really excited about the smoothness and the improvement of my brown spots. I love that Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 contains the sun screen. I live in Florida and I am not always as diligent as I should be with sunscreen application. I plan to continue using this product!
"I suffer from dryness on my face all year round and have tried product after product. This product has made such a difference. I no longer have excess amounts of oil on my face. The problem area which is mostly around my nose for dryness has subsided. I am very pleased with this product!

I have VERY oily skin and this product left me feeling greasy, sticky, caked and very uncomfortable.

"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. This is the perfect moisturizer for me to add under my makeup or no makeup to head out with my family. So smooth yet not greasy."
"I love the rich creamy feel of this product. It goes on really smooth, doesn't take much to cover the face and it absorbs quickly into the skin. It DOESN'T leave a greasy feeling and my skin feels smooth and more hydrated. I am really interested to see the benefits after I have finished the entire tube. I love that it has an SPF 30 built into the cream so that I don't have to add another layer of products under my make up."
"I was provided a free sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 from Crowdtap. I enjoyed this product. It moisturized my face, and I loved knowing that I had some SPF protection to keep my face protected from sun damage. Went on smoothly on my skin and worked well under my foundation. I would definitely purchase this product and use on a regular basis."

I am a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno Rewards program and they sent me a free sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF30 to review. I love this product! It made my skin so soft and smooth and more youthful looking. It doesn't have a scent which is great for me since my skin is sensitive to fragrance. I will definitely be purchasing this product!!
"I tried this when I received a sample from Crowdtap. I have been using it for a couple of days and can feel a difference in my skin. I have combo normal/dry skin and I like that it does not leave my skin greasy and I noticed some hydration. I will continue to use this product and see how much better my skin will get. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I really enjoyed sampling this moisturizer- it was very light for a moisturizer with a high SPF, smoothed on easily and absorbed quickly."
"I loved this moisturizer. It went on smooth and didn't have a scent, which I love because I am sensitive to scented products. When I used Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer my skin looked soft and smooth and had a youthful glow. It didn't feel greasy, which was great. I will definitely be purchasing this product and will recommend it to others."
"I have been using for about a week now, love how it absorbs fast, no sticky residue. I haven't noticed if my brown spots are fading yet. It leaves my skin soft and smells good, not like perfume. Its great because it has spf 30 in it, so I only have to apply one thing, definitely will e buying a big bottle of my own. . “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
I have started using a lot of Aveeno products in the last few months. This moisturizer is absolutely wonderful. I feel that it works at least as well as other more expensive products I have used. My skin feels very good and never oily. Plus I love the added spf so I don't have to worry about applying extra sunscreen when I go out. I feel like my pores look better and my coloring is more even. I'm hooked on this moisturizer until I find something that works even better for the same great price.
"I love AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30! Within a few weeks my face is softer and my tone is brighter! Plus I love the fact that it has spf 30 in so I don't have to work about protection when I am just running errands or do mom chores! I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer is amazing! My skin looks smooth and has a brighter look to it! I am impressed by this moisturizer, a plus is the SPF 30 for protection. Started to notice results after only one week. Would definitely recommend this to friends and family. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
"I have fairly sensitive skin, so I like to use Aveeno products since their gentle. I really enjoyed the smell and the way my skin felt after using this product, and I would recommend it.

"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I love this stuff. I love the fact that it makes my skin extremely soft and radiant but at the same time it protects my skin from the sun's harmful Ray's."
"I have been using Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer (w/ SPF30) for almost a week now. So far, this has been a great moisturizer that I apply before makeup. I like that it has SPF30, as I have very fair skin and am sensitive to the sun. It smells very fresh and light. An added bonus is the ""light diffusers"" that give your complexion a more ""airbrushed look"". It's difficult to find a product that doesn't break my skin out, so I'll continue to keep this one in my skincare rotation!"
I love Aveeno products and use them all the time so when I received this sample to try for free I was extremely excited. I used the product in the morning before putting on my makeup and noticed that night that my face was very red. I didn't think much of it so I tried again the next day. Same thing. I am sure it's just my skin because I use other Aveeno products with no problem. I will still recommend this to my friends and family because as a brand Aveeno is AMAZING!!!!!!!!
"I didn't get to sample the product for 4 weeks to see if it actually evened my skin tone and texture BUT I did like the product. it did seem to go on heavier than I thought (more like a sunscreen than lotion). seemed to keep my skin hydrated for most of the day. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
"I love this product! It made my skin feel soft and I had no break outs! Smells good not over powering. I wore this for 15 hours and my face still looked good! I will buy this when I run out. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I really was surprised by how light and not over powering this smells. I was happy to get the chance to try out another Aveeno product as it was easy to use and I really like the spf 30 in a moisturizer. It did not make my skin feel oily or greasy which I have experienced in other moisturizers."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” This moisturizer is nice, leaves skin soft and is great for daily use. Skin was glowing after use but I did not notice a reduction in brown spots."
"I received a sample of this moisturizer a few days ago. I'm 39 years old and have started noticing some age-related imperfections in my skin. I have tried other moisturizers, but many feel too greasy or don't seem to run in easily or cause irritation to my sensitive skin. I am so thrilled with this product , I can't stop using it! It's very light and dries quickly so there is no greasy residue. My skin feels so soft! I can't wait to see the long-term effects! I also plan to look for more Aveeno products to get maximum results!"
"I wore this for a tailgate, and it provided great sun protection while also being light enough for a hot day. I have patches of severely dry skin on my face, and this fit the bill! I'll definitely buy again. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I only had about one day to try it out before my review was due. The product has a lotion like scent. It is not greasy and absorbs well. I can only imagine what results I may get after 4 weeks of use like the product describes, but I appreciate the free sample."
I just received my sample so have only had the chance to use it for a week. It feels good not to oily or greasy. The scent is nice not to powerful. But i have not noticed any difference in my skin maybe because i have not used it that long but have applied it every day for a week.will keep using to see if it makes a difference with skin tone. and review again if it does.
"I only had a few days to try it so I can't really attest to the results promised above. I do have a few dark spots so I will look forward to seeing if it does help minimize them. I appreciate getting the samples and the opportunity to try them; however, I wish my review could've waited a couple of weeks to make sure that I could leave a thorough review. It does feel nice in the fact that it doesn't feel greasy and absorbs quickly. The scent is nice and light."
"smells like sun screen but I really don't notice ant difference, besides the fact my face didn't get sunburn I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. But, that does not affect my opinion of the product. I am using this on my face, and it makes it feel softer. Also, it has a very nice scent as well. I like it."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” When i tried Aveeno I was surprised how moisturized my face felt after i applied it. My face was not greasy and the scent was just great. I will definitely be buying more after i finish my samples."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” Super excited to try this and I'm blown away!! My skin feels so darn soft and not oily at all . Love that it has an spf of 30 I never remember sunscreen.. Didn't break my skin out at all and has a super pleasant smell. Def will be buying this!"
"Bought this for use on my face. If you are looking for fragrance free, skip this one."
I love how this product works but I find the scent unpleasant. Any plans for an unscented version?
Made my skin so soft and cleared my breakouts. Love it so much!!
"Made my face look like I had a horrible sunburn. It turned bright red, was puffy and itchy. Awful!"
This product is so wonderful. It's so refreshing!!
I love this stuff it takes the dullness out of my face and leaves it soft with no greasy feeling
i really love that i can use this on my oily skin and its not heavy and it absorbs well
Left my skin feeling beautiful and smooth and clean
have seen a big improvement over all in healthy skin!!!
After just a couple of weeks of use my skin feels amazing!
I love that you get the coverage with out having it feel heavy.
"MY Skin feels Soft, with a Smooth, Radiant Texture, Radiant that luminates"
"Used this one time and the next morning, my face was red, itching and on fire, I returned it."
First time using it and Loveee it. Sounds feels so soft and fresh.
The best!!! does not leave me feeling coated or oily! Absolutely LOVE!!
Bought this product because of the SPF 30. I like how smooth it goes on. Will def order again.
I was excited to try this but not didn't use it too long because it has a really bad strong scent that I don't like.
"This stuff leaves my skin so soft, I am loving it. Living in California I am in need of SPF daily, so this is a great find for me."
"I have been using this sunscreen for years and swear by it. I have sensitive, combination skin. Other sunscreens make me breakout. This is light weight and has never given me issues. I love this product and use it daily."
"I use this product daily, and I have noticed a great difference in the redness on my face. I used makeup daily to cover this up but now I only use this product! Decent priced, very easy to use."
"I am a member of the aveeno crowd tap crowd and received this as a sample,I would totally recommend this product.my skin hasn't looked this good in forever and I feel 100 percent protected.with this product you have beauty and protection in 1."
I liked the feel if it and how it made my skin feel after. I would definitely recommend it. I received this sample free from Crowdtap and the opinions are my own.
After trying the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 I have noticed how soft my face is and the dullness that it had is not so much anymore and my brown spots are slightly lighter.
Ave enough Positively Radiant moisturizer works great! It's a lightweight moisturizer that soaks in right away & doesn't leave my face feeling tacky. I love that it's a double duty product. Moisturizer & sunblock all in one.
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” This product is easy to apply on your face, smooth creamy consistency. great smell"
"This skin cream is very good consistency, easy to spread and does a good job at lightening my slight discolorations. My only dislike is the fragrance; it is too heavy a smell, and it stays all day - in fact, I can still smell it as I move and every time I think again how much I do not like the odor of it. I am returning to a different product because of my objection."
"I bought this to help streamine my morning routine, but this is not the right product for me. This is very greasy on my combo/oily skin. It doesn't seem to absorb properly like other moisutrizers so. It also burns my eyes after about four hours. I am constantly wiping grease and tears off my face."
"At first I was falling in love with this moisturizer because it made my skin feel smooth and didn't get oily throughout the day which I loved. But after using it for several days, my face broke out into a crazy itchy rash. Hoping it'll heal up soon. It's a shame really but as other reviewers said, probably better for those who don't have sensitive skin. I wouldn't recommend using if you have even slightly sensitive skin."
"Although this is labelled as hypoallergenic, it is in fact highly fragranced. The consistency and feel of this moisturizer is very good but unfortunately the fragrance is so strong and lasts long after the moisturizer is absorbed into the skin, a shame....."
"I have very SENSITIVE skin and not all products work for me, and also make me break out. This PRODUCT is AMAZING, leaves your face feeling fresh and moisturized. I use it every morning and this all I need, also leaves you with an amazing after glow. HIGHLY reccomend for daily use, great product."
"I have been using this product for over 5 years. It is lightweight and I use it day and night. It does not help with lightening of hyperpigmented skin or acne scars. It moisturizes well and I wear make up over top of it. It does not make me break out or clog my pores. Non-greasy feel. When the moisturizer is almost finished, there is always a little bit remaining at the bottom which I have to try to empty out, wish there was a better design so I don't waste the product."
I absolutwly love this product and am so sad that I have had difficulty finding it. I hope you haven't discontinued it. This product is one of a kind.
It isn't heavy but adds color and protects from the sun. I even used it in Costa Rica and didn't get a sunburn on my face.
I have tried other face moisturizers and they always burn when I put them on and this does not do that. I also have combo skin so it can get oily easy but this does a great job of not making my skin to oily and has enough to make my skin oh so soft. #WalmartContest
"The product had a great, light texture and scent. My skin felt so smooth after I put it on. It was great on its own, but also held up well under some light makeup. The only con was when I went running about a half hour after applying -- my face and neck became an oil slick like never before which was a little uncomfortable. Overall, I really liked this and definitely appreciated the 30 SPF. Would buy and recommend to friends."
"I love this product, Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer with sunscreen. Broad Spectrum SPF 30. I was amazed how natural this made my face feel. The skin was soft and had no greasy feel you get from suntan lotion. I highly recommend this product to everyone. It really does do what it suppose to do."
"I have only gotten to use this for a day or two because the sample came a couple days before my reprt was due but so far so good will be using it more.“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review and I must say Im in love with it! I love the scent of the lotion, I like the fact that it is light and refreshing. I have used it for a week and I already notice that my skin is softer and smoother. I love the fact that this lotion also has SPF30 in it because I believe you should always have some sun protection on everyday!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I used this product for a few days and I loved the way it made my skin feel. Some products leave your skin feeling too oily or greasy or have a heavy scent. Aveen Positively Radiant made my skin feel perfectly moisturized without feeling too like or greasy. I love the fact that it has SPF30 also. The scent was light and pleasant."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I have really enjoyed using this moisturizer, but haven't had enough time to see much in the way of results yet. My skin has been much softer since starting to use it a few days ago. It's a very light, smooth moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy at all. With continued use I think it might become a permanent staple for me."
I received this product from Aveeno and CrowdTap complimentary to test and review and I am so pleased with my results from using this moisturizer! I love that is does not leave your skin feeling oily and greasy and that it has a high protection from the sun as well. My skin is naturally very dry so this puts just the right amount of moisture back into my face to leave it feeling hydrated and healthy!
"Shaves time off of my morning routine by combining several benefits into one product so I only have to apply one lotion for maximum results. I wish the SPF was higher than 30 in this product, but overall I am satisfied with its performance and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® Rewards Program, and Aveeno® sent me samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."

I was very excited to try this product because it contains SPF30 sunscreen and it is also fragrance free. After trying it, I am sold! Not only does it have the sunscreen built into the formula, I love that it has no odor and I love that it dries right after rubbing it into my skin. It is not oily or greasy, which is awesome! So far I'm impressed."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. The samples made my skin soft and silky after only being able to use it one day. I recommend this very much"

I absolutlely love this product. I have never really tried Aveeno products and this is one that i am going to recommend to a friend. I love how soft and smooth my skin feels as well as the way it looks. I love Aveeno and will definatey be purchasing this again
"I felt this really moisturized my face well, but the fragrance in the product stayed too long on my hands even after washing them with soap a couple times that if I ate anything it would have a taste like the Aveeno lotion. Same thing when I first used it I wasn't so cargul about when I applied it close to my lips so then every time I ate, drank, or licked my lips the taste was there. I usually like perfumes in my lotions, but this I would prefer none art all. I am a member of crowdtap. # crowdtap, #sponsored, #Aveeno"
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” I must admit that I was a little bit scared to try this because my skin is very sensitive due to me having LUPUS. I am so glad that I was chosen to sample this!! I will be purchasing this ALL OF THE TIME now!"
"I received a free sample of AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 through Crowdtap. I have only had a few days to use this lotion, but I am very happy with it so far. It is light and absorbs quickly. There is no greasy feeling afterwards. The SPF30 is great. I have not used it long enough to tell a difference in my skin as far as tone, texture, etc. Overall, I think it is a great product that I will continue to use."

The scent is pleasing and my skin does not feel greasy after use. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program and Aveeno sent me a sample of its POSITIVELY RADIANT DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. That said, I would totally buy this product. As a bonus it has the 30 SPF my dermatologist recommended."
"I'm always looking for a great moisturizer, and this is it! I have dry skin sometimes, and this is great! It's natural, and contains SPH 30. It has medium consistency, it's not thick or watery.

It felt great knowing I was protecting and moisturizing my skin at the same time. I would recommend this products to others!"
Higher end price doesn't always mean higher end product! I am thrilled to find a product that works so well for such a great price! Leaves my skin feeling fresh and moisturizeed all day long. I noticed my makeup went on more smooth also. I've only been using it a short time but im anxious to see how it treats my dark spots.
"I received the Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer with sunscreen free form Crowdtap and Aveeno to try for testing and for an honest review. I love how soft my face feels after using this product. It soaks right into my skin, and gives me a nice soft moisturized feeling for hours. I really appreciate that it has sunscreen with an spf of 30 already in it, because then I get two great products in one. Great product I highly recommend."
"I have only been using this product for a little over a week. This makes it hard for me to know if the results will be as claimed after four weeks of use. I like the texture of the product and my brown spots seem to be fading a little. The product moisturizes and makes my skin feel soft. Since I have skin that does not have a nice texture, I look forward to seeing the results of a full four weeks of use."
"I used this sample until completely gone, and I loved it. I have already replaced what I used and love how soft it makes my face feel.

Nice scent too!"
"I've only been using Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for little over a week but I must say I love how smooth and subtle my skin feels.

I was able to give Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisture Broad Spectrum SPF 30 at no cost thanks to Aveeno and Crowdtap! I have been using this lotion for a few months now and absolutely love how soft and healthy its made my skin feel! The moisturizer is light and doesn't leave a yucky residue on your skin like many other moisturizers with SPF in them!

To me its another top quality product from Aveeno"

I tried this product in a sample and I loved it! It was a great light moisturizer that has a great smell. My skin felt soft and moisturized all day without feeling greasy or like I was wearing something heavy. I live in a hot dry climate so this is really important to me. i will recommend this to friends and family.
"I finally received my Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer a couple of days ago and so far, I really like it. It feels good going on and it absorbs well. I like the light fragrance it has and I also like that it's SPF 30. I wasn't comfortable giving it 5 stars since I've only been using it a few days and haven't yet seen the full effect. I will definitely continue to use it until it's gone and if I'm satisfied with what I see/feel, I will probably continue to use Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer everyday."
"This product has been great to use in these last days if summer. I spent the whole weekend outside with the kiddos at various parks and family activities. Aveeno kept my skin well protected from the scorching sun. The moisturizer left my skin feeling fresh and vibrant. It was light and air and didn't leave my skin skin feeling heavy or oily. Wasn't to keen on the sunscreen smell, but overall very satisfied and will continue using."

"I received a sample Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer in the mail and am so excited about this product. My skin has never felt and looked this good, in years. Ever since I was a teenager, I have had very blotchy places on my face and by using this product, I found that the redness almost totally subsided. I also have a noticeably large brown spot along my jawline and it's faded so much that friends and family asked if I was having it lasered off. I told them that I found an amazing product that they all needed to try."
"In my line of work I really need a moisturizer that protects as well hydrates. Aveeno has done that. I work outside 6 days a week. My skin gets dry quickly. Aveeno helps stop that and keeps your skin feeling wonderful. The Spf defiantly helps being out in the sun all day you need a good SPF. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"

"I am a member of Crowdtap Aveeno ® group and was sent samples to review. I like the way the product feels. I also like that it doesn't have a strong scent. However, it did seem to add an oily feel to my skin, so I would only use it on days that I do not wear makeup."
"I started using this skin product about 10 day ago. I have already seen the difference, not strongly but a small difference. My overall skin texture is a lot more firmer and my pores seem smaller.

My skin was silky smooth, but still felt fresh and light, not weighed down. The moisturizer also left a nice glow on my skin. The scent is wonderful, very vague so it doesn't linger. Overall I would say this is the best moisturizer I have ever tried and will be continuing to use it."
"I've been using this moisturizer for a week now and I'm starting to see results. Before my skin had uneven tone, was very dull and just needed some life to it.

Over the next week I started notice that my skin was more radiant and the dark spots started to fade. I don't have to use as much make-up. I never knew this was possible.
"For a sunscreen, this is much better than most I have tried. It goes on easily and doesn't leave that greasy feel. As an everyday moisturizer with sunscreen, it is wonderful. The only think I don't like is that is still smells so much like a sunscreen. I don't like smelling like I put sunscreen on everyday."

I'm in my late 20s with oily/combination skin and this moisturizer is a little too rich for me however I feel would be perfect for someone with normal/dry skin. It's very hydrating and feels soothing to the skin, also smells really good!"
I like the fact that there is a non greasy feel and it makes my skin feel soft. There is a soft smell that is not overpowering and is not bothersome to any others around. I like that it soaks in and lasts longer than regular lotions. Highly recommend and will go buy more for all over.

I started using it too and love that after a couple days, you start noticing that your skin almost has a glow to it! I always look for a product with SPF to prevent any further sun damage. I just turned 30 and you can't start soon enough protecting your skin from the sun!"

"This daily moisturizer is a light product that is easy to apply and you can feel your skin soaking it up. I love the way my skin looked refreshed and younger while using this product. I feel my skin was younger looking, more even toned and natural. I will be adding this to my daily morning routine for sure."

Not oily or greasy and doesn't feel thick."
AVEENO POSITIVELY RADIANT DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 definitely works. It evens out my dark spots and leaves my skin feeling healthier. Very good for dry skin and of course with the SPF30 you get the protection from the sun that you need.
Wow! This stuff is really great! I was very happy with the smooth texture and how easy it went on to my skin. The positively radiant sunscreen was easy to apply and did not leave my skin sticky or feeling like there was something on it. It also didn't have that awful smell you get most times.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.

I decided to review this product in the hopes of finding something for the dryness of my face. I have found this to hold up to its name and claim. In the last few days of using it my face has went from dry and itchy to soft and silky once again. Thank you for such a great product.
I usually use Aveeno products to get the moisture i need due to having dry skin and eczema! So I do get excited when a new Aveeno product comes out! I'm very happy with the sample I recieved from Crowdtap Of AVEENO POSITIVELY RADIANT DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30!! I'm always careful of what products I use on my skin especially my face so I give this Aveeno product that I trust a thumbs up!! Can't wait to purchase the full size bottle!!!
"I've been using another daily moisturizer for a long time and got this to try and so far I'm very pleased with it. Upon first trying this it felt a bit greasy, but it absorbed right into my skin without leaving it looking or feeling greasy at all. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I've been using this daily for a week and so far I'm very pleased with it.

I was pleasantly surprised by this product! I have used other Aveeno products and they were ok but not great. I loved the light feel of the positively radiant daily moisturizer. It didn't feel oily or heavy. It left me with a nice glow and I will be buying this product in the future.
I received a sample product from Crowdtap to try and I'm glad I did ! I usually just pit Aveeno lotion to my face but with Aveeno Positively Radiant I'm not only using moustirizer but applying sunblock and at the same time is going to help me out to even out my tone.
"I really like this product!!! It does what it says. My skin feels great and looks great. No more dullness!!! I am going to continue using this product!!!!

I have always been one that doesn't use lotion that often cause I dislike that greasy lotion feel! With Aveeno Positively Radiant I didn't have that greasy feeling! I love it! And the fact that it has an SPF 30 makes it even better! Yesterday I was in the sun all day & it protected my skin from sunburn & I still has smooth skin! I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased opinion & this will definitely be a staple in my house!
"Great product-spreads easily and absorbs nicely, without leaving that greasy residue that sometimes happens with other moisturizers. Nice light scent that is not overpowering. Overall, makes my skin feel soft and smooth, as well as protected from the effects of the sun."
I love trying the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer. It definitely does what it claims and that's evening the tine and texture of my skin. I love the smell and the texture of the moisture. Non-greasy and it makes my skin radiant. Can't imagine using anything else now.
AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 is a very good product. I have sensitive skin and like the feel of it. It doesn't make my skin break out and does exactly what it is supposed to do...protect my skin while adding moisture to it. I recommend this to anyone. The light feel to it is wonderful and it does a fine job for me.
Not often does a product name honestly depict what the product truly does...after trying this product I learned that Positively Radiant is exactly what my skin feels and looks like! Many products have too much oil and make my face break out...not Aveeno Positively Radiant! Aveeno sent me a free trial size to review...but my review is completely my own feelings. I am sold on this product! And intend to use this as a stocking stuffer at my next Christmas Party!
"I loved this being that it has sunscreen in it . it help you not o have to worry about putting 2 didnter things on your face it didn't make your face oily either.

Having an SPF in it is an added bonus and the smell is great! After trying my samples, I will for sure be buying this!"

After you use it you skin feels so fresh and you feel ready for the day. I would highly recommend it and will buy it again. I received this product free from crowdtap for my honest opinion!"
I received a sample for free for testing purposes. I love 2 in 1s. They save time and money. I get to moisturize and protect my skin from the sun at the same time.

But I love it and intend to buy more.
"AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 is so clean and fresh smelling, I love how smoothly it is to apply and how it makes my face feel.

"I've recently have been trying out a lot of different daily moisturizers that have SPF in them. I have very fair skin that is also prone to oil, so to layer on sunscreen over my daily moisturizer was creating a mess of my face. I received a free sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant® Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to try and I really like it! It goes on smoothly and quickly, no thick lotion to have to rub in forever.

With that being said, I am in love with this product now! It is absolutely amazing and something I had known about before now. I love the moisture it provides my poor dry skin and the level of SPF protection is just right for use during every day errands and outings."
"I was given this product to try for a review. I have to say that it is rather thick for my liking, but I really appreciate the high spf that it contains. As it soaks into my skin, It does feel rather heavy compared to similar products that I am used to. It hasn't seemed to lighten my dark spots at all, but maybe I just have to give it more time. Overall, my skin is soft and supple, and it may work better for other skin types. I'd highly recommend it to friends that were looking for a day lotion with high spf included."
"I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer. It has a beautiful clean fresh scent. It is thick and rich and creamy. It absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves no greasy oily feeling or residue.It specializes in evening out skin tone and texture. Aveeno is a name brand I can trust. It also helps prevent sunburn. Use daily and you can notice a significant difference in your skin. Tone is evening out, skin is nourished, soft and brightened. I love this product."

No sunburn for me."
"I LOVE Aveeno products and this one did not disappoint. I use this once daily on my face after cleaning my face with clear complexion wipes from Aveeno. The SPF protection is an added bonus even though I really do not need it. My face was slightly more greasy than when I use the Aveeno daily moisture lotion. None the less I still give this 5 stars. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I really like this product!! It goes on smooth and it doesn't feel too cakey or too oily on my skin!!

A great product, and I would use it again!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.

"i got the chance to try this from crowdtap AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30, i love how it goes on so smoothe, how it makes my skin feel, and it smells amazing."

"Thank you Crowdtap for the samples. Product goes on smoothly, not greasy, no overwelming smells, and leaves skin soft. I will definitely be looking for this product."
I use this facial lotion every morning. It a very good product that helps me with my skin problem. Love it's SPE 30 protection. Keeps my face smooth and feeling fresh.
"This is just another cheap SPF moisturizer that claims to protect you from UV rays and then fails to keep you from getting burned. AcquaCures Hydrasun SPF 30 from Preston Wynne Spa is a far better SPF moisturizer. I burn really easily and have tried so many spf moisturizers, all of which couldn't protect my skin. This is the only one that does it for me."
"This little cream has leaving my face super soft and so far I have not had any reactions to it, I put it after shower on my face and neck and it leaves my skin soft all day long, I don't know if it has improved my skin tone since I have only a week with it but while it leaves it soft I'm happy."
I bought this due to a discontinuation of a previous product I used and I was very excited to try the naturals line. I used it and it burned the skin on my eyelids. I thought it must have been something else I used so I tried it again a few days later and the same thing happened.
What did you do to this product?? I have been using this moisturizer for 5 years and loved it. I recently bought a new bottle and OMG the perfume smell is Terrible. The lotion itself is thinner and feels sticky on my skin. I no longer feel comfortable putting this on my face since the ingredients have changed. I will be in search of a new daily moisturizer with spf and No stinky scent. Good bye Aveeno
I can't rate the moisturizing effects because I can't get past the smell!
It's perfect for wearing under make up and it's non greasy as stated.
"I like how it make my face soft,pertect my face from sun ray to kept from getting damage."
