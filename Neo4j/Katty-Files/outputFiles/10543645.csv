I use this in the morning and it seems to be working as advertised. My skin does seem firmer. I've already bought my next jar to have on hand. Quite pleased and the price is excellent.
"even in humidity it seems to cling and stay there so you don't feel dried out..i am not a big AC person.. I like something to attract moisture. anyway I really like it and it smells great and feels light and silky. I know it is for nite but I use it in the day too, just not as much"
"This night cream is wonderful! I won't use any other and believe me, I have tried most from cheap to pricey. This one actually works and at such an awesome price, I am a L'OREAL lifer!!"
"I have this sitting on my nightstand to remind me to apply it to my face before I go to bed. It has a nice, light scent and feels so good going on. Taking responsibility to take care of my skin makes me feel good. Love this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I purchased this with high hopes but I've been using it for a couple months now and I don't see any results. I love Loreal products but this one just hasn't worked for me not to say that it won't be great for someone else. I guess I'll have to try something else.
I have tried them all. This one seems to just sit on your face & a bit white after applying. Its NOT greasy but it does NOT feel that great on. I have used better. I will not purchase again! Even the equate brand like it is the same way. You are basically buying the name & this does not do much for their name brand!
"The cream has a nice texture but the scent is so overwhelming I had to rinse it off. It has the smell of a perfume a ninety year woman would wear. You smell her well before she arrives, hold your breath when shes near and the scent lingers after she's gone. What were they thinking putting such a strong perfume in this cream? Into the trash. Money down the drain!"
I can't rate the store - everyone knows Walmart. Its a great place to get everything - even in the middle of the night in most places. The dream is divine. Rich and full of good stuff that makes you look and feel ten years younger - I know this would have aged me far worse if it wasn't for Look Younger by L'oreal. L'oreal rocks.
"I'm on a tight budget but want to take care of my skin. I got the Revitalift day cream and love it, but I just now opened the Age Perfect night cream I bought, and the smell is so overpowering that I'm going to have to wash it off and run out to buy something else. It smells like Raid bug spray! I can't tolerate overpowering scents and don't want to be breathing this in all night."
First time I tried i like it since i am using it
...but not anymore. It's changed. There are little gritty beads in it as you're applying. It left my skin rough and dry in the morning.
"The cream appears to spread yet a close inspection, hours later, shows that is settles in the fine (and not so fine) lines -- like spackle! Clearly, it doesn't absorb. Leaves a waxy feel on my skin."
I've been using the L'Oréal Age Perfect products for quite awhile. I love the richness. I am a mother of three and Grammie of 11.. and 60 years old- young!
"This actually does as it claims and is very good for nighttime hydration. It can be overly hydrating though, so recommended only for those who its designed for."
Just got this and have used it for a week; I love how moisturizing it is and a little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is my go-to moisturizer before going to bed every night. It's not heavy at all and it leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated. #sponsored [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this every morning for years. Even if I cannot get to a sink to wash my face, I will put this on. I don't get out much so spf isn't a concern. I've tried others, but always come back to this."
"I just can't get over the smell of this product. Every time I put it on, I think I need to contact Loreal and ask why they made this good moisturizer smell like cheap perfume. I hate wearing it to bed, it makes my pillow smell. Please, in the future, use clean, natural smells for the face."
LOVE THIS . NOTICED IMPROVEMENT IMMEDIATELY
Love this cream. Makes my skin feel soft.
This works great. I just started using it but it seems to be working
The night cream leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized. It is really creamy and easy to apply. I liked everything about it except the smell...it was way to strong for me. I prefer a fragrance free product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am almost 50 and I take very good care of my skin every single day and night. I use sunscreen daily and don't sit out in the sun but I worry about those wrinkles and crinkles. I was excited to try this night cream from Loreal since it seemed more focused on my issues like reducing sagging and eliminating age spots. it really has been working nicely to keep my skin looking soft and dewy when I wake up and it lasts during the day. The fine lines look a little better too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Nice thick cream - applies easily. I did notice more hydration and a softness in some of my ""fine lines"", some fading of age spots and a slight firmness. This is a good night cream, but not a miracle cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Exceptional product for the price. Not too heavy and perfect amount of hydration without feeling greasy or sticky on the skin. I like that natural ingredients are used in product. I have fine lines and age spots which are reduced. Keep this product around. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been very impressed with the night cream and day cream. They are not greasy, feel really good and I've seen a noticeable improvement in fine lines, crow's feet, etc. I will definitely continue using these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Loreal Age Perfect Night Cream for approximately four weeks, the first thing I noticed was how well this cream absorbed into my skin, never greasy while feeling so smooth on my face. I have experienced a great improvement in the firmness of my skin, as well as reducing my eye puffiness and crow's feet. Hurray a product that actually delivered! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This felt nice on my dry, acne prone skin, but it has a lot of ingredients that i try not to use as they can be very bad for acne prone skin and can clog your pores,such as,mineral oil, myristyl myristate,urea, stearyl alcohol,palmitic acid,etc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Awesome !
Great quality. Easy to apply and last all day. No problem with this product. One of the best I bet used.
"Very happy with product , first product I found that I do not have break outs especially along the jaw line , very smooth has improved my fine lines, firmed up skin, will purchase again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After four weeks, my skin was softer and more supple. The texture was better and the crepiness was diminished. However, it felt too heavy on my skin and it did not absorb very easily. I found the fragrance overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Been using this on my face for years -- my skin is sensitive and has dry patches. Tried other brands--some way more expensive--this works best for my skin. Very moisturizing yet not heavy or greasy AND it lasts all day whereas others I've used dry skin appears later in the day (I use it daytime as well). Especially great in dry, colder months. Sometimes in summer when it's hot I use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion during the day."
"Just turned 60, and having been using the cream nightly for about a month and a half. I saw an immediate improvement in the appearance of the skin on the neck/chest area. Although I haven't yet seen a significant difference in the lines/wrinkles on my face, the skin does seem much firmer and fuller yet softer, and some of the 'age marks' have faded. Very good moisturizer - I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My 60ish skin absolutely loves this product. Not only does it hydrate deeply without leaving a greasy residue, but I have noticed a definite improvement in firmness and tone. The department stores can keep their overpriced products because this night cream does twice the job at a quarter of the price. I absolutely recommend it without reservation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Age Perfect Night Cream for several weeks now. I like how it is quickly absorbed and how soft and moisturized my face feels. The feeling is almost immediate. If it were UNSCENTED it would be the perfect cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Because the product contains fragrance, I chose to use it on my throat and décolleté. The formula is silky and feels lovely. I do believe that my aging skin has shown marked improvement after 30 days of continuous use. I just wish the formula did not contain fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this night cream for the past two weeks and found it really made my skin feel hydrated and smoother each morning. Unlike many night creams, it is not too heavy or greasy. My skin is softer and has a healthier glow than before. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this Night Cream for approximately four weeks. I love the fragrance and the way it quickly absorbed into my skin. I cannot say that I've experienced any great improvement in the firmness of my skin, but it does appear to be softer and less greasy in the morning. I really like the product and will likely purchase it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as part of a trial package including both day and night creams. The night cream is fabulous! It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and my skin looks much better in the morning. Thanks for the opportunity to trial this. I will certainly purchase this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the night cream worked really well to help renew my skin overnight, especially since I have rather dry skin. I awoke with more supple and soft skin in the mornings. My face normally feels somewhat tight after my evening shower, and the cream made it feel really smooth. I would tell my friends about LOreals Age Perfect cream for mature skin for sure! Is that enough info? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product along with the day cream. It is non-greasy, and I have even used it during the day under my makeup. My skin feels soft and firm. My lines seem less noticeable. I would definitely recommend this to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the scent and, along with the Age Perfect Day Cream, I can really see a big difference in the condition of my skin. The one thing about this cream though is that when I wake up on the morning my face feels really greasy but maybe that is why my skin looks better - because it is more hydrated than it has been in years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the expensive department store brands, for many years. About 8 weeks ago, I tried the L'Oreal Age Perfect Skincare Line. My skin looks and feels so much BETTER, than with the department store brand. This night cream is soft and moisturizes well. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels soft and looks radiant. I look well-rested. I'll never go back. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After cleaning my face I used the l'oreal age perfect night cream every night for the past month. I honestly see a difference in my skin. Rich, intensely moisturizing, it feels soft and brings balance to my complexion. I believe it makes me look more youthful! Despite its thickness you will notice how quickly it absorbs into your skin. Love the light scent also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a keeper. If I have blemishes or discoloration when I go to bed, I can wake up to a flawless face by morning. It really is a great night cream and I will keep using it to improve the look of my face and neck. I love how my skin feels and is a joy to use as it does not take much to do the job of clearing up imperfections. Thanks for letting me experience this amazing product for mature skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very happy with this moisturizer! I have been using for 4 weeks and my complexion seems a bit dewier! The texture, the smell... There is nothing I don't like about this moisturizer! And, I have bought a lot of different moisturizers over the years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This night moisturizer is the best moisturizer I have ever used in my 60 yrs and I have tried many different brands. My skin is very dry and sensitive and this cream makes my skin so soft with no irritation. I would highly recommend this cream for the benefits it provides but also for its price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this Night Cream. It is soft and velvety to the touch, and provides great overnight moisture to my skin. Since I started using this product, I've noticed that my skin is softer than it had been before, and definitely not as dry. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in any way. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a consistently dependable night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product after using Avon for 20 years. I use Age Perfect day cream and love it. The night Cream is much heavier. I have oily/dry combo skin, so for now, I'm using it on my neck and cheeks only at night, but I think when winter comes and my skin gets dryer, I'll be using it all over my face. It doesn't clog my pores, and the price is much lower than my old brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used an expensive department store brand of skincare, for over 30 years. About a year ago, I purchased the L'Oreal Age Perfect Skincare Line. My skin looks and feels BETTER, than with the department store brand. This night cream is soft and moisturizes well. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels soft and looks radiant. I look well-rested. Thanks, L'Oreal! Oh, this jar is 2.5 oz., unlike the department store creams (1.7 oz.)."
this is an amazing product that you should really try out!!!!
I have been using ths for about a week and am noticing a lift already
I have used this product for some time and this is the best price so far.
Love it. Nice light cream. Doesn't make skin feel sticky. Skin looks great the next day
Use this cream day/night works well with my skin nice / smooth also under makeup.
"This night cream is very versatile and light weight on my face. And yet, moisturizes really well. I buy it all the time. :)"
This night cream went on easily and made my skin feel smooth and soft right away. In the morning it had been completely absorbed into my skin and my skin was well hydrated. I looked great!
I have very dry and sun damaged skin. This product does what it says and offers deep hydration. It's very soothing from the moment I put it on. I'll continue to use this product. It works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night cream goes on nice and light and is not greasy. It also has a nice fragrance and I can see that my skin looks hydrated and healthy since I've been using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oreal age perfect cream. It goes on smooth and feels great on my skin and smells great. I really think it makes a difference, making my skin look and feel smoother and softens fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This night cream is creamy and perfect for a moisturizing night cream. I will definitely continue to use it and will refer it to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Luxurious feeling! Very impressed with how it helped fade age stops and fine lines. Especiallly around my eyes. Started using it on my hands too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very dry skin and get especially dry overnight. The first time I used this night cream my skin felt soft and hydrated the next morning. I will also try the day cream and the eye cream.
Easy to say that this cream exceeds my expectations! It is velvety and smooth on the skin a real quench to my face at Nighttime. I love it and recommend this cream to all!
"Loreal has never dissappointed me. They are a good price high quality product! This crean is like vitamins for your skin. It leaves me feeling so soft and renewed in the morning! I truely am turning back the clock as well! It is light but moist that your skin ""drinks"" up by morning."
"I tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It was a little thick for me. I do not like ""goopy"" feeling stuff on my face. I also tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15. I really liked it. It was a great moisturizer and I can see my age spots fading! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is probably the best moisturizing product I have tried. It is not greasy, it is silky and soaks fast, and best of all a little goes a long way. The packaging is a glass pot that is sleak and sturdy. The only negative is that the product does have a fairly strong fragrance but is dissipates over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect night cream did absolute wonders to my face and complexion. I have never had a night cream make my face feel so silky and radiant. This is after the use of 2 weeks. I work non stop plus I'm a mom of 5 so I run on fumes and most times I look like it but with using this cream I even noticed that my eyes didn't look so tired. I started to look alive. This cream is wonderful for daily use. It's not greasy and has a sweet soft smell. I highly recommend trying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this nighttime face cream. My skin feels so soft and moisturized. I have noticed since using this cream that my face does appear to be firmer and my fine lines are not as noticeable. I think I wake up looking more refreshed. I wish I had been able to use the product longer before giving a review. I would recommend this product to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the texture of this cream, it was thicker than most creams but not too greasy. It went on smoothly and I didn't feel oily after putting it on. The scent was very light, I didn't mind it at all. It wasn't a sweet perfumey smell, more just clean. I haven't noticed any changes in my skin since wearing this for about a week as opposed to my normal Roc serum but it does feel nice to put on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal age perfect night Cream is the perfect before bed moisturizer. It leaves your skin feeling hydrated with a fresh scent. After a few uses, you can feel your skin becoming firmer. Both the day and night cream have become my ritual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can see where the product would be good for someone with a different skin type. I have combination skin and the product tended to accelerate breakouts (pimples) on my face. it seemed to work well enough on my neck but seeing as I am not bothered by issues with my neck I did not see a need for it. It did provide moisture but not any more or less than the product i have been using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin was dry and flaky. This product definitely made my skin feel soft and moisturized. It even softened the deep wrinkle between my eyebrows. My friends even commented on how good my skin looked lately, wondering what I had done! I'm a satisfied customer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a good, rich night cream that absorbs quickly and softens my skin. I love this product, but I am not crazy about scents in my face lotion. This was a little heavier scent than I would have liked, but overall the product was just what I was looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product I noticed a big difference in the way my skin felt. It was so soft and wasn't as dry as it has been lately. I was quite impressed with this, since I have tried other products and had no results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product and I was surprised at how smooth it made my skin. I used this more than the day cream since it tends to be a heavy cream. I just lathered it on my face and neck and woke up feeling smooth as butter. I have sensitive skin so I was very hesitant about using this all over my face, but happily haven't had any problems so far! I will continue to use the night cream, but decided not to continue with the day cream due to it making me look and feel so greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I tried L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream, I was sold! The way it tightened my skin and moisturized at the same time was amazing. I love the creamy texture; and the light scent does not bother my allergies one bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is completely absorbed by the skin as soon as it is applied. You can immediately feel your skin cooler and softer. After several days of use the skin feels revitalized and less tired. It also does not look so gray anymore. I can really reccommend it for ladies like me over 50 years old. It made me feel a lot better about my appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product felt very nice on my skin. I would take my makeup off at night and wash my face then apply it. When I woke in the morning my face felt supple, soft and even younger looking with no breakouts. I would definitely suggest this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream was a good compliment product for the day cream. It felt nice to have the extra level of moisturize. The product did not feel heavy on my skin and it had a light, pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised by this night cream. It was the perfect extra moisturizer I needed for the evening but not too greasy. Absorbed right in and could easily be applied to dry areas. Highly recommend this. Has a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way this feels on my skin, and I love the way it makes my skin feel and look! I had gotten so used to my skin feeling dry, that I never realized what I was missing - I love this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a very oily face and after applying the night cream I would wake up to my face looking like an oil slick. I love how the product smells and it does leave my face feeling fuller, but I just can't use it due to my own skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream hours on smoothly and I like the way it glides on. It feels wonderful on dry winter skin. The cream sinks in quickly so it doesn't get all over my pillow. In the morning my skin feels hydrated and fine lines are minimized. I wish the scent was less overpowering. Too much of a perfume scent for me. While pleasant, I don't want it interfering with my nightly lavender scented oils. I like the way my skin looks, less fine lines and plumper, so this is a thumbs up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let's start with the areas for growth/improvement: the scent of the night cream is a bit too strong and it feels a little drying unless used in conjunction with an additional moisturizer. Positives: the cream goes on smoothly and leaves no residue. The cream is easy to find and eliminates the pricey tags of department store creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Age Perfect Facial Night Cream really makes my skin soft and smooth! I've been applying it at night after my face wash, and noticed how I no longer have dry patches or tight/itchy skin because of the weather. This cream really makes a difference, and I'd recommend this to anyone dealing with dry or flaky skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must say I enjoyed using the L'Oreal Paris facial night cream. I have very dry skin and have used many products but this how far has been the best product that shows great improvements to my skin, which comsume more melanin. Once applied at night and upon waking up in the morning my face feels soft and smooth. Can I say it help on aging, unsure, but it does have a wonderful feeing in the morning. Moisture is ok, it is not greasy or sticky which is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like the light texture of this moisturizer and my skin drank it right in. The fragrance of the night time Cream, however, is much stronger than the day time Cream. I found it too overpowering. For this reason, I would not use it on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Night Cream is amazing! Leaves my face feeling refreshed before going to bed. Doesn't leave a heavy feeling on your face and no grassy residue. Which is a big plus! Already told my mom and sisters that this is a must buy item! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the L'Oreal Paris Age Prefect Facial Night Cream. It is a great addition to my skin care routine. My skin has recently began to get more dry and since using this product I've noticed a positive change in my skin tone and it's much more hydrated than before! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It is a think heavy moisturizer which goes on smooth, and soaks in evenly. I can tell you after using for it a few days, my skin already feels less dry - and looks smoother! If moisture means fewer wrinkles, than it is doing the trick! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face is so soft and supple was the first thing that I have noticed after using for a couple weeks so far. The jars are good sized and you really don't need to use a lot. I am seeing a noticeable reduction in the lines around my eyes and the hereditary frown line is less pronounced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had never used a night cream before, usually I would just moisturize in the morning after my shower so this was new for me! I was worried it would be greasy and make my face oily overnight but it didn't! It was a light moisturizer that works well without being heavy! My skin felt clean and smooth so I would definitely recommend this night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved both of the creams , I used both but really liked the night one better because it seemed to be thicker , I live in a very dry climate and used it in the morning more ,made my face and neck feel softer and moisturized more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pros: This product helps maintain a highly moisturized skin condition overnight. During a whole month of using this night cream, my skin looks brighter and whiter. Cons: Not quite effective when talking about lightening up the spots (causing from the sun) on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ive been using this miracle in a jar! My face has never felted this soft and Ive noticed spots from the sun have lighten up . Ive had my sisters ask what I'm using ! You really have made this my new skin cream for life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
There are pros and cons to the day cream. I like how it sinks into my skin and isn't greasy. It does a good job of moisturizing and removing dead skin. I'm not crazy about the packaging. I'd prefer a tube so I'm not potentially contaminating the pot with my fingers each time I use it. I would also prefer something without soy and parabens. This has both. My skin was sensitive to the night formula and it made my face itchy but most people probable wouldn't experience that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is the perfect thickness. It goes on smooth and does not leave a sticky feeling on your skin. That was the first thing I noticed about the night cream. After using for several weeks I could tell a difference that it made in my skin. Winter is here and my skin dries out very easily so far I have not had that happen. My skin is smoother and my coloring is evened out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the night cream for 4 weeks. I noticed the my skin is softer, less prone to acne, and my age spots from pregnancy are starting to lighten up. The cream is not greasy at all which is important for me since I have acne prone skin. I use this product with Age Perfect Day Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried both the day and night creams. I really wanted to like the creams but I couldn't get past the scent. The scent was way to strong and overwhelming. The day cream was too thick and didn't absorb that quickly. I felt like I needed to wait a while before I could put on my makeup. I ended up using both the day and night creams on my hands. My hands felt really soft and the scent was bearable away from my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream makes my skin smooth, which is great. but I haven't seen results yet, I think just because I haven't used it long enough to see the results. It seems like you start seeing results in 4-8 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for about 4 weeks. I love this product. It's not greasy, is lovely and fresh and it makes my skin feel hydrated and silky. Wake up with extremely soft skin and my lines and wrinkles show improvement. I use on face and neck. I consistently use this and the day cream and can't imagine that the expensive department store brands would do any better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this creme. The combination of the day and night creme added to my regular daily routine has made all the difference in the world. I feel the it makes my skin feel tougher and softer. Definitely keeping this in the rotation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'oral night cream works wonders. I have baggy eyes and so far this cream is making them disappear before my eyes! The fragrance smells wonderful and the texture is so smooth. It makes my face feel fabulous!! Thank you L'oreal for this amazing product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this cream. It leaves my face feeling clean and soft!!! I highly recommend this to anyone in their late 30s and older. This night cream is truly better than any night cream I have ever used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't even been consistent with using the night cream and I can still tell a difference with the lines on my forehead and around my mouth. I also use it on my hands and the back of my hands haven't looked this smooth since I was 22. The results I'm getting are encouraging me to use the night cream more consistently. The scent is lovely, but it would be nice if it came in an unscented version, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. It seemed to fade out lines on my face within just a few weeks. I do however have oily skin and did notice an increase in acne, however I am not 100% sure it was this product or something else. I will definitely use this product in the future if it is not the cause! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After a couple of weeks this works great. I can already see the the lines under my eyes are starting to firm up and fade some more. And again, I also love that this does not smell strong. It isn't greasy either. I can't express how happy I am with this.I will definitely by again. I put the day cream on and finish with the night and little by little those lines are disappearing. If you're thinking about buying this do it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This silky smooth product glides on my skin and produces the smoothest skin ever. It doesn't clog pores, cause irritation or acne, and the results are so impressive. In fact, it visibly reduces the signs of aging. The wrinkled area around much mouth a forehead are much less pronounced than before. This product is so impressive! I will definitely repurchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this night cream! It feels amazing on my neck that tends to get super dry with the drier colder air. I wake up with my face and neck still feeling moisturized and smooth. The only complaint I have is the strong fragrance and that it made my skin break out for the first few weeks I used this product. I will definitely continue to use this pair of product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night cream is an awesome product. My skin before was dry and dull. Since using this product My skin stays hydrated and has brightened up as well. Another thing I like is that it's not greasy and rubs in very well. I highly recommend this night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the night cream! My face is no longer and dry. It is soft. The elasticity in my face is amazing. My complexion has cleared up. The lines around my eyes are not as deep. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend. The product seems to last a while. You do not have to use very much at all. Well worth Using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this night cream. It isn't heavy and greasy feeling, but moisturizes the skin well leaving it feeling very refreshed. I can definitely tell a difference in my skin since I've been using it. My complexion is more even and my skin looks so much healthier. Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It felt really good and my skin felt tighter, but I could not see any difference in my skin. Would not buy this product, not a noticeable difference in my appearance, and caused my sensitive skin to break out by clogging my pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using this night cream for a few weeks. It leaves my skin feeling supple but not greasy. If you dont like scent you may not like this cream but I do like my cream to have a fragrance and this one is a clean scent. I cant say that my dark spots have gotten any better but maybe it just takes time. My skin does appear my supple and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream long enough that I should be seeing some results. It is a little greasy feeling. If you wet your hands just a little, it will be easier to spread. I have not noticed any change in the appearance of my skin in the past 3 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream was less exciting than the day cream in my opinion. The night cream had an almost oily feel to it which I wasn't crazy about and the scent was very off putting. I tried to like it, but it had a very medicine-y smell to it which was hard to like. I didn't notice any significant tightening or firming or reduction of lines when using either. It seemed to keep my skin hydrated though the night and that was about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Perfect night moisturizer, not sticky, greasy or any of the negative things you find in a lot of night moisturizers. I will purchase this in the future. The packaging is awesome and the size is great. Good price point, trusted name, winner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love how this L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream feels on my dry face. It absorbs quickly and does not feel heavy. I have put my expensive day creams aside and will continue to use this cream as it is giving me great results~that's what matters! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using for a few weeks I really really like the night cream now! We've finally turned the heat on and this year I don't feel sandpaper when I touch my face! Really working to keep my skin hydrated! Not sticky or greasy at all-I tend towards dry skin though so very rare for me to go oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this stuff!! It's thick but not greasy or heavy. My skin absorbs it easily. It has a nice light and soft fragrance. My skin feels soft and smooth after the first application. I will definitely use continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream for several weeks, nightly, I can't say I've noticed any change in my skin's elasticity or moisture level. It did give me an increase in acne, and my skin is usually clear and bright. Not clear to me that this product has much to offer besides marketing hype. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal product line smells great!I loved how smooth the product applied to my face and was quick to absorb. This is super important to me because I don't want to be wiping it all over my pillow and my boyfriend doesn't like kissing a greasy face. The night cream left my face feeling super soft and moisturized. When I exfoliated before applying the cream, I would wake up feeling like I just had left a spa! I would totally recommend this product to a friend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is still working after several weeks in softening my dry spots completely. Even crepy skin under my neck is disappearing as well. I will continue using the product, but the the difference in my skin is amazing. Will recommend to friends and also purchase more. So many creams on the market, but this one is remarkable in the short amount of time. Being over 60 yrs to see a product really work is almost a miracle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I too experienced sensitivity to the fragrance near my eyes. This product I did like the silky feeling of my skin once applied. Again to accurately determine the benefits of this product you need to use for around 6 weeks. I do not feel it help with firmness, lines around my mouth, nor lighten up dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Fell in love with the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It was not oily on my skin and did not moisturize my pillow but my face. In the morning when I wake up my skin feels rejuvenated. I will continue to use L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream every night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'Oreal Age Perfect night cream. I enjoyed the subtle but pleasantly soothing scent. It made my skin feel soft and supple. My only issue with it is that it left my skin feeling a little greasy, particularly in my t zone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream for almost a month now. The smell of this product is so strong that I've only used it intermittently. It smells like men's cologne mixed with Noxema. It's the strangest thing. The moisture it provides my oily to combo skin is just ok. Nothing to write home about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this night cream. It blends in right away and does not leave a residue on my pillow. The texture is just right...not too thick or thin. It smells great. I can't stop touching my face after I put it on...that is not good but I can't help it! My face looks so good in the morning....like I had a great night's sleep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this night cream. It is thick and creamy but goes on very smoothly. It has a nice subtle scent, and makes my skin feel hydrated. I wake up to softer, smoother skin. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the way this felt on my face; not too heavy and not as oily/greasy feeling as most night time moisturizers. My face definitely felt 'healthier' in the morning and seemed to 'glow' a bit. I will use this product year 'round. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved the way this night cream smells. It has a very clean light scent. The formula of this cream is very light and moisturizing. I noticed this cream helps lighten and reduce the appearance of age spots. I loved the feeling of waking up in the morning with hydrated, plumper skin. I will definetely continue to use this night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great night cream. It kept my face moisturized and not feeling dry and crackly. It comes In a nice container and is easy to open for someone who has arthritis. It does not leave a greasy film on your hands either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can already see the difference in using the day and night cream.it does not leave your face greasy like other face creams the smell is just right not to strong.I have senseitive skin and this cream is perfect for my skin absolutely love this product.I would definitely tell woman to try this product amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not saying this product doesn't work for everybody, its just not for me. i have to wash my face at night and apply nothing after or my face breaks out. i did apply it on during the day and it feels fine non oily and non greasy. for the people out there that like applying night cream to their faces then i would definitely try this product.

"I was fighting fine wrinkles, sagging skin and age spots. All of these have improved since I began using L'Oreal Paris night cream. I highly recommend this product and look forward to seeing my results after another few weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using these products consistently for almost 1 month now. I like the light weight of the lotions, both the day and night cream. The smell is light and clean. I use both on my face, neck and down to my décolleté area. It is to soon to see much of an improvement I think, although I feel like I have a nice hydrated glow to my skin. My skin feels soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great product and I will use this every day and night. My skin as never felt this good and soft and its works great for taking dark circles away from my eye. I would recommend this product to all woman. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i really like how this night cream in light and not oily. I have combination skin and I have found with some moisturizers that it makes my skin even more oily and it doesn't help my skin. I have used this for a few weeks and feel like it is helping to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I typically have issues with night creams being to thick and greasy. My face is prone to breakouts and night creams have not worked for me until now. This Age Perfect cream has worked out great. No breakouts, it's not greasy and it has improved the firmness of my face. I haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines yet (2 weeks of use), but my face is softer and smoother. It has a stronger fragrance than I tend to care for but that's the only downfall I've experienced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would buy this one again! I feel like the night cream really plumped up my skin and I noticed a difference in the morning . The frangerence was not as strong as the day cream. It didn't feel greasey or filmy at all. What a great drug store find! I have even used this on clients before I do makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that this face cream was creamy but not too rich. It does a good job with moisturizing . I didn't notice any reduction of my bags or wrinkles during the time that I used the cream (only for 1 week and 1/2}. It had a medicine like fragrance but it wasn't to bad for me. I would definitely continue use to see how the outcome is. I have sensitive skin and this cream wasn't harsh on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my sample last week and have only been able to try it twice. I have not had any noticeable difference yet for any fine lines or wrinkles. My skin did feel a little softer in the morning after both times that I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this night cream. After using it for a few weeks I notice that my skin looks healthier, feels softer, and the annoying dark spots I have from sun damage have gotten visibly lighter. I also appreciate that while the scent is pleasant it is not overwhelming. The only downside is that it's a bit thicker than I'd like. I'm aware of the fact that I've applied it, however this isn't a big enough deal to turn me off from the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream for a few weeks now and while I like the feel of the Night Cream better than the Day Cream, it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy, I cannot get over how strongly scented the Night Cream is. No matter how well the Night Cream works I will not continue using it due to the overpowering perfumy scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is very creamy. It seems to work very well. My cheeks, which are normally dry, are very soft since I've been using this for the last 2.5 weeks. The container is very large, seems like it would last 2 months or more. I was worried it would be greasy or make my skin breakout more. But, it seems to soak right into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the night cream for about 2 weeks and absolutely LOVE it. It makes my skin smooth and soft. I love how a small amount goes a long way with both these products. Highly recommend this night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream for about three weeks. I like that t comes in a nice size jar. The scent is pleasing and it goes on without a greasy feeling. It has made my face feeling softer and less dry and it smoothed out my wrinkles which is always a good thing. I wake up in the morning with my face feeling moister and smoother. I will definitely meep using the night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried both products and I saw results. There are 2 things I would look at changing. The scent of the creams is strong at first. After using the producrs several days I got used ti it. Also after the first couple weeks of using the product you have to dip your fingers in and the cream gets under your nails. Maybe a squeeze tube would be better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I suffer from dark age spots (sad face) all I can say is TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!! It goes on silky smooth. It's almost a shame to sleep on this delicate face!! I have always loved L'Oreal products now I can add this to the list!! (smiley face) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Along with trying many moisturizers, I think I have tried even more night creams!! My face has always been a combination of dry and oily, and can easily go to the other side quickly if I am not careful! I loved this product. I woke up in the morning feeling rejuvenated. I used a little of the day cream for the perfect combination. My skin is left feeling great all day!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked using this cream in combination with the day cream. Both creams are emollient and creamy. My skin felt hydrated and soft. My skin is oily so I think this would be best for me in the dry winter months. I could definitely tell the difference in my skin when I woke up--it felt much softer and repaired. I liked the scent--it's very light and fresh but it is scented and the scent lasts a while so you if you don't like any scent at all you may not like this aspect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am impressed with L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream. I was expecting my skin to feel extremely taut after applying. To the contrary, my skin felt moisturized and replenished. The fine lines around my mouth and eyes are less noticeable. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is now a part of my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is wonderful! Does not feel greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I have slowly seen the wrinkles on my neck become less and less. I love that I can put this on and go to bed immediately and not have to wait for my skin to absorb it or blot it off. A great product, It does what it says. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product not really expecting much but i was wrong! The night cream was totally ungreasy and smelled pleasant, which is important when you are trying to sleep. Upon waking my skin felt smoother and moisturized. Upon continued use i can definately see an improvement in the fine lines and moisturization of my face. I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could tell you how awesome this product is. How it makes my skin soft and supple with a slight healthy glow. How it smells fresh and doesn't go on thick and greasy. But my favorite part is that if you miss a night (or two), the results are still there. It's an amazing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the first time I've ever used a moisturizer specifically for night. The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream smells AMAZING! It takes only a small amount to completely cover your face and neck area. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels so soft, which is amazing considering it's starting to turn from autumn into winter weather here - which means super dry skin. This is definitely a keeper for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many night creams to help with the wrinkles and the drooping around the eyes. This has done the trick. I love this night cream will never have to look again. Thank you L'Oréal for this amazing product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My 40th birthday is coming this weekend. I have laugh lines around my eyes and a few age spots from sun exposure to try and diminish. This product is smooth and rich. I don't notice as much of an order as with the day cream to this set. I hope with time, my face looks a bit refreshed. It is definitely help moisturize my skin. I already notice a difference that way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like the day cream I didn't notice a huge difference in fine lines, but it makes the skin feel great. I don't usually like to wear any lotions or creams at night due to waking up feeling oily. This doesn't do that, I wake up with healthy looking skin, not dry or too oily. I'm going to keep using to see if I notice a difference in the fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product claims to hydrate skin immediately, and that by 4 weeks, skin will tighten and fine lines and wrinkles will be reduced. It is a great moisturizer and hydrates well, but at 3 weeks of twice daily use, I don't see any difference in the texture of my skin. I've attached a before (left) and after (right) pic for evidence. (Please excuse my makeupless face!) I will keep using it daily and hope that it will live up to its claims about fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream was nice to put on and didn't make me feel like I was going to bed with a wet face like other creams have. In the short time I've been using the cream it has helped make my skin not be so dry throughout the day yet not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just didn't love this enough to change from what I currently use. I didn't feel that it really hydrated my skin enough, plus I have some oil control issues to deal with. It seemed to create more sebum issues. My skin is now over producing due to not getting enough help from this product. It just did not work well for me in the long run and I won't be using it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love that this night face cream gives me the extra moisture my skin is craving. I had dry skin on the side of my nose that was flaking. After continued use before bed the crust on the side of my nose is gone. The cream is not oily and absorbs well into my skin. The cream has a light floral scent. I felt a slight tingle on my face after applying but I figure it was getting to work. Overall plesantly suprised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the night cream that I received for free from bzzagent. The night cream left my face very soft. I have sensitive skin and my skin was fine with this cream. It does have a fragrance so if you are sensitive to fragrances this is not the cream for you. My dislike was the fragrance, it gave me a runny nose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I put this on every night and I wake up with the softest skin I've ever felt. My family has told me that I look like I am glowing. I was a person that never left the house without foundation on...but after using this product for only 6-7 nights, I don't need to put any makeup on because my face is so soft and smooth because there are no spots anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This night cream feels light when you spread it on your face. It spreads easily and has a pleasant scent. I used the product a few times but since I don't normally use night cream on my face it was hard to remember to use it every night. I did intend to but that extra step didn't work for me. It is a quality product but I don't believe I will use it in the future because I don't usually apply cream at night and I doubt I will start now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am totally impressed with this night cream. I instantly noticed the hydrated feeling on my face when i first used it. I tend to have dryer skin as the seasons change. Within a week of use I could feel smoother and tighter skin. I also noticed the longer I use it my complexion became less red and brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have not had the product long enough to notice a reduction of fine lines or age spots. I do like how light the cream feels. A little goes a long way. The fragrance is not too strong. So far I would recommend this cream. I have put my other face cream away and will continue to use this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed having the night cream on my face, it felt like a treat. I thought the smell was pretty good but a bit strong. I have sensitive skin and it really helped with dryness. I would tell others this is a nice calming face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the moisture and firmness I'm finding when I wake in the morning. The cream does go on a bit heavy though, and it's made me have to wash my pillow case twice a week because the cream makes the fabric feel sticky and greasy. No big deal, but cod do without that bit. Overall great results and no breakouts. I joined the campaign late so I have not seen any lightning of my dark spots but look forward to continuing my test drive, and anticipate outstanding results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought that this product was very good. I have been using it every night and it really makes my face feel more firm and smooth. It is not greasy and you really only need a very small amount to cover your entire face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never been very consistent with my night time beauty routine, but I have been trying to do better since I turned 40. I added this cream to my new routine, and have been quite impressed. It goes on smooth and feels good all night. When I wash my face the next morning, I can still feel the moisture from the night before. On the days I forget to apply it, I can definitely tell the difference. I would definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream before I went to bed each night and have noticed a significant difference in my face feeling nicely hydrated in the morning. I typically have dry skin which is typically worse in the winter and this product definitely helps with that. It has a nice fragrant scent which I like when I put it on, but by morning, it's not there anymore. It's easy to spread on the face and doesn't leave my fingertips oily which is nice as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product! First off, the smell reminded me of my grandmother. It was very perfumy. It wasn't bad, just strong. The smell faded quickly, though. The cream isn't too thick and spreads easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have naturally dry skin especially during the colder months when thew heat is on. After using this product for a little while now I notice a significant difference. My skin has more moisture and feels softer. Another wonderful product by L'oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this cream for night use. Not too fragrant and it melts right in just like the day cream. I would consider repurchasing this cream because it is emollient without the stickiness and my skin feels great the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been trying the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream and I have to say that I find it amazing! It's light. I don't like thick, greasy feeling creams. It does seem to have had some effect on a couple age spots that I have, and that is a wonderful plus. It has a light fragrance, definitely not overwhelming. I can absolutely see an improvement of my facial tone and texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night cream was my favorite of the two creams I tried. It was easy to incorporate into my nightly routine. I feel that the night cream definitely went on smooth and absorbed quickly. I understand to see optimum results it is ideal to use for 4 weeks. I am on week 2 and LOVING IT! I'm already noticing visible changes!! I can't wait to see before and after pics when it's been the full 4 week time period. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great night time moisturizer! Honestly I didn't think I needed a nighttime one but I Woke up with soft skin and no oiliness. I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I liked the day cream, the night cream made me fall in love with it! It has such a lovely rich feel to it which was almost decadent. It was absorbed quickly and gave my skin an immediate refreshed feel. The aroma was pleasant and not overbearing. I woke the next morning with noticeably softer and more supple skin. This night cream will be a permanent addition to my night table for many years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Age Perfect Night Cream goes on smooth and is non-greasy! The smell is light and doesn't overpower you before sleep. After a few days, I noticed my skin felt softer and looked smoother! I haven't noticed any changes in spots yet, but I will keep using and see! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I could not wait to get these two products to use. My skin is thanking them now. Both products work so well. My skin is so soft and brighter from using them. I am for sure sticking with the L'Oréal day and night cream after these are gone. My skin has never felt so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just like the day cream, the smell was great. I love that there's a night cream to compliment the day cream. I wash my face & apply the cream every night before I go to bed. It does make your face feel light & healthier just after putting it on. Both night & day helps with my dry spots & even out the dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream! At first I was a little skeptical about liking it because it has a scent that is stronger than what I'm used to for a night cream. But the scent isn't that strong on my face and it's such a non-greasy formula that I can overlook it. I would really like for it to be less scented is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I woke up and felt like my face was moisturized and looked better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't think I've been using this product for long enough to speak to how it works on age spots. I can however attest to how well it moisturizes my face, revitalized (brightened) my complection and seemed to tighten my skin (though I don't have wrinkles) but leaves it feeling soft. It's even been great as a hand mousti. I also love the fresh, clean, rose-y scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved how light and fast absorbing the cream was. I did not like the fragrance. It bothered me so much that a few times I had to wash it off my face . Helped with dryness, no change in sagging skin or slight wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the smell of this night cream, but using it in combination with the day cream caused me to break out all over my face and neck. I have switched back to my regular skincare regumine and the acne is going away, but I felt so incredibly self conscious this past couple weeks. No amount of concealer can cover these blemishes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a little thicker than I would prefer. However, I did like the benefits of the cream, which left my skin feeling clean and radiant. The had was quite heavy, as was the product inside. I would use this cream more often if it went on a little more smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must say this is a very nice moisturizer but the fragrance is just too much for me, it has a strong floral perfume smell however my skin was very moisturized after using this product. It goes on smooth and my skin soaked it up, it didn't leave any residue behind and it lasted until the next morning. It would have been a definite purchase for in future but I would prefer a fragrance free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It absorbs quick and easy. I use this all over my neck and the entire face and does not doesn't leave a greasy feel when I put it on at night at bedtime. Wake up with extremely soft skin and my lines and wrinkles show improvement. I can detect a slight effect of the ""anti-sagging"" feature. Will continue to use this product.

I really like the night cream. I like how it feels on my skin and It made my face much softer. I did notice under my eyes are not as puffy in the morning. I am looking forward to giving it more time hoping to see more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My facial cleansing and care routine is super simple, and this was a welcome addition. My skin tends to get pretty dry as the weather gets cooler and even more so when the dry heat of our house starts blasting. This night cream left my skin feeling fresh and moisturized. It doesn't feel heavy or sticky, and once applied my skin soaked it up nicely. Leaving me with a very fresh feeling. My skin felt rejuvenated, especially after cleaning the days make up off.

I am in love with this product along with the day cream. I have to say the scent is amazing and the results are also. I have been using this product alone with the day cream for several weeks and have noticed a huge difference in my complexion. This product has made my skin softer and has lessoned the appearance of lines and wrinkles. I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family.

I found L'Oreal Age Perfect Night to be an average drug store moisturizer. It was quite thick and heavy and did not go on as light as I would like. I find the container to be quite heavy and the amount of product it holds to be smaller than expected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a little hesitant at first as I don't use face creams very much but honestly once I tried it I was hooked. It feels really smooth on the skin and has a very floral smell, I noticed a bit of tightness on my face after using it but not too much . I also liked the fact that it doesn't have that burning tingling feel like some creams have, I will definitely continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone looking for a good night time face cream.

"I'm not very pleased with it, I have been using a gel based moisturizer and this just okay. Personally the gel base seem more light weight.

I really like the L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It is silky smooth and absorbs into my skin well. It makes my skin feel hydrated without feeling greasy.

I've been using this for about ten days and my skin seems to be getting better but I do think it will take some more time for the final results to appear. My dark spots are less noticeable and wrinkles seem to be getting better. I am optimistic that I will want to continue to purchase this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I noticed a change in my skin after I turned 40 and I now need a thicker cream. And my mom keeps admonishing me to use a night cream. So, all right mom, I'm listening! This night cream was more heavily fragranced than the day cream. Not unpleasant, I just noticed a stronger scent. Very thick it absorbs well. I have noticed some hyper pigmentation on my forehead fading after two weeks, so I am suitably impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Age Perfect Night Cream was mediocre at the best. At night I'm really looking for a silky deep Moisturizer, and this just didn't make the cut. It felt slathered on top and greasy. But not soaked in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a woman with an oily complexion, even in my mid 40s, this was not a winner. The cream feels great but once it was on my face it was way too much. A night cream is an important step, but this one didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the night cream it makes my face so smooth and the smell is wonderful. Is not greasy and you dont have to worry about a mess in your pillow. My husband likes the smell that is a big plus for me :). In the next morning your face feels and looks amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Normally by this time of year, living in the north I am seeing signs of eczema on my face. Not this year since using the night cream nightly my skins has stated hydrated. I have combination skin and my skin is evening out nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I haven't been using the cream long enough to notice any results, I do enjoy having the specific night moisturizer. The downside to the moisturizer is that the scent is really strong (though it is pleasant) and the formula is slightly oily. I typically prefer unscented moisturizers because my skin is very sensitive, but the scent has not had any negative effects either. Had a had a little but longer to review the product, I could give a more honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't realize L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial was for an age range of 60+ when I first tried it. However, I decided to give it a go and see how my face would feel/look after a week. I must say my face looks so much better! My face isn't as dry as it used to be and the red marks that were there in the morning have reduced significantly. It doesn't leave the gross film like some Facial products do when you use them. My face feels clean and I'm very happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product wasn't really any better than other creams I have tried in the past. It did make my face feel moisturized though. May need a longer amount of time to actually see more of a difference I'm not entirely sure. I don't think I'd purchase this product without seeing more of an improvement in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The night cream from L'Oréal is so wonderful! It's easy to use and doesn't get all over your pillow! I wake up and my skin is soft and feels wonderful! It doesn't take very much so it lasts a while. It has helped take a way the little crows feet I have and lighten the age spots I have on my temples. I would recommend this product to anyone facing the issues of getting older! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying L'Oreal's Age Perfect Facial Night Cream for a few nights, I woke up to skin still feeling hydrated, even 8 or more hours after applying it. However, I have combination skin that can vary from dry to oily, and some mornings it did feel a little too oily in the mornings. My guess is that this works best with dry to normal skin. If you have oily or combination skin like me it may be a little too intense. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was very nice & non-greasy feeling. My skin in the morning was also very clean feeling & after a few weeks it felt like it was getting tighter. Would definitely recommend this product to everyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did really enjoy the product and used it alongside the day cream. It seems to have tightened my skin and small wrinkles around my eyes. My only complaint is the overpowering, flowery smell. It was too strong for me in a product that I would be using daily. I would not recommend it for sensitive users. Overall, it is an amazing product and I would definitely use it again if the smell was not so strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scent was a little strong but not overpowering. I didn't notice much of a difference between this and my previous night cream, but I like how my face felt and looked after using both the day and night cream for several days. I would continue to use them together but am not sure I would use this one alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the night cream and was worried about trying it. I have sensitive skin and someone's develop rashes. I did not have a problem with this cream and I liked the way my skin felt. I do wish it was not scented though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"it does what it says, i feel great in themorning when i wake my ace feels soft and not dry no more , the only thing i dont like about the night cream is the smell. i know i only have to deal with it until i fall asleep but if they coul make it smell like the day cream that would make it even better then what it is now. i love the complements i get though...im 35 and some people said i look 27 ...yes ,L'oreal!

I usually don't use a night cream as I often forget to use it. I did however try this product and didnt really see and clear changes. I did like the fact that it hydrates and makes my face few smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Absolutely love that I can put this on and sleep away my wrinkles! I suggest using both the day and night cream for a full 24 hours of anti aging! The only thing I found with this product that I did not like was it felt a little greasy on my skin. However it was being used at night so that part did not bother me at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never used a more luxurious night cream! I love the way it glides on and how my skin just drinks it all in. I woke up the next morning to smooth and soft skin. I used it the second night after micro-needling my face and my morning results were even better than the night before! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This would be a great product for someone who is middle aged or a senior citizen. Unfortunately,this product irritated my skin and was way too greasy for my combination skin.After I put it on,my eyes began to burn and water. I did not put it on my eyelids .I had to wash it off immediately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using L'Oréal Paris age perfect night cream for 2 weeks now. I have been using it every night and it moisturize my skin and feels nice. My face is still nice and soft in the morning. I love this cream and will buy it again. I am 60 with sensitive skin, no issues at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this night cream is not greasy and it's fresh. I am very pleased with how it feels when applied. The scent is lovely and fresh and it makes my skin feel hydrated and silky, I use it every night and it moistrizers my skin and feels good overall it's an awesome product, I highly recommend it.

"I normally have extremely dry skin, but in the fall and winter it gets even worse. I've always used the same night cream but they stopped making it. So, after trying several brands, I came across L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect. I really like its scent and that it absorbs quickly without being greasy. I've used it for a few weeks and I'm pretty happy with how it makes my skin feel soft. I can't wait to see if it actually works on wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using L'Oréal Paris age perfect night cream for a couple weeks now and I'm noticing the lines around my mouth are beginning to fade. I had one deep one that is barely noticeable and the small ones are gone. I love this cream. I can still feel the moisture in the morning and that let's me know it's still working. At age 57 this is important. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this night cream! At first I thought the cream might be too heavy for my face, what I did not know was how much my needed this! After two days my face was smoother and softer and more hydrated than ever before. My coworkers noticed a difference in less than two weeks. While talking around the water cooler, they asked me about my glowing skin. I told them I just started using a new night cream. They are sold too!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Age Perfect Night Cream for 2 weeks. I have this product 4 stars because it's very moisturizing and you only need to use a few dabs as a little goes a long way. The container can last a good 4-6 months if used every night. It felt good going on and big plus is that it's not heavily fragranced. I'll have to use it longer to report long-term effects. But so far, I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really dry skin so I wasn't sure how well this product would work for me. However, after two weeks of use my skin was smoother and tighter. I give this product two thumbs up and said goodbye to dry skin. Thanks L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first this night cream smells a little bit perfume-y and goes on feeling pretty thick and greasy. But it absorbs after not too long and leaves your skin feeling amazing! I can't speak to whether or not it helps with wrinkles and age spots since i don't have a lot of either yet, and I only used it for about 2 weeks. But My skin is seriously the softest it's ever been. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris night cream is a great night time moisturizer. The product goes on smooth on your face. The product has a strong but great fragrance. It did reduce wrinkles and fine lines on my face. The product went on oily. It would be great for dry skin. I have sensitive skin. The cream did cause a little irritation to my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect night cream for almost 3 weeks now. It doesn't go on greasy nor does it feel greasy. It has a nice scent to it. I have noticed an improvement with my skin. It is firmer, tighter, younger looking, more flexible. It is almost as if i have lost 5 years off of my face. I have tried other age creams with no results. I would highly and have highly recommend(ed) this product. I will also continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great cream with a nice soft feeling in the morning, however, I seem to have an initial breakout after the first couple days. Being 53, I'm not used to that so I was NOT HAPPY about pimples! Had no noticeable firming, as promised, but did seem to make my complexion nice and bright. I will finish the sample but probably not buy the night version of this cream. The Facial Day cream, however, was very good and I will buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my first time trying a night cream and actually sticking to the regiment of using it every single night for a prolonged period of time and I can honestly say my skin is better for it. I have noticed a decrease in my fine lines around my eyes and mouth and I would say that overall my skin texture is more hydrated. My only regret is not taking before and after pictures. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is not bad, but it is not my favorite night moisturizer either. It was a bit TOO moisturizing for me ) However, I do not have ""mature"" skin""(I'm 30 and have combination skin), so for someone who does have dry skin, this may work very well. It is fragranced and smells like all other L'Oreal products, which I personally love the smell of! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is supposed to be very anti aging and smooth out your skin. I didn't get the anti-aging benefits in the amount of time I used it, but I sure did wake up with super soft skin. My husband loves feeling my super soft skin, and that makes me very happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly love this product. It doesn't leave that post-moisturizer greasy feeling on the skin and my skin feels better after trying this product every night for the last two weeks. My faint spots have faded away, and my skin feels healthier. I am loving the scent of this product as well, faint but not gone, yet not over-powering! Simply perfect for a nightly moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream exceded my expectations. I have never tried a night cream before now. It was great. No greasy pillow or bedding (something I was worried about). It melted right into my skin and felt amazing. This is definetly a cream I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This luxurious overnight repair cream worked like one of the highend salon brands, but a small fraction of the cost. My skin felt silky soft and looked like my youthful glowing past skin. Loreal thank you you did again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night cream was wonderful. I loved the fact that it was not greasy or left a heavy residue on my face. It left my face soft and hydrated throughout the night. I noticed my skin become brighter and also a little less sagging in my cheeks. I love this cream and will continue to keep it in my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surprised by this cream; I really thought it would feel gross on my skin, but it doesn't. I enjoy the smell of it...not too strong or weak. I have combination type skin, some dry, some oily, and this cream went on smoothly on my whole face. I do think I'll give some to my mom to try out on her more ""mature"" skin :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The packaging for this night cream is very attractive and the glass jar is appreciated. I really love how light yet effective it is for a night cream. Not greasy at all and very moisturising. Much better than a serum. There's a nice combination of botanical ingredients that give me a lot more confidence on putting it in my skin. Very clean and pleasant aroma. I could definitely get used to as part of my nightly routine. Very well balanced product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this night cream in exchange for my honest feedback. The first time I used this night Cream, it has a pleasant, but a much stronger scent than the day cream. It was a bit greasy at first but probably because it being a night cream. I usually use the same moisturizer I use for day. I notice the next day, my face so soft. I will definitely get this cream again for nighttime use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found the jars to be cumbersome and difficult to remove all the product. I used the night cream a few times but I don't feel it was necessary to need both a day and night cream at my age (30). The cream did have a pleasing scent and made my skin softer but I felt twice a day creams are too much right now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using this night cream for a week I can say that it is a great moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated soft and smooth. After a shower my skin feels very tight and dry and this cream gives me relief. A big plus for me that it is light and absorbs quickly. I am generally sensitive to scents and this cream does have a mild to moderate fragrance but I find it quite pleasant. I am 35 and thus cannot speak of the properties against aging.

"I have been using both the Day and Night Cream for one week now and they are fantastic. They are light, do not feel oily and smell fantastic! My skin feels great and I know in time my skin will look even younger! I will purchase this from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream smells great, and feels great! The night cream feels lighter, and not as thick as the day cream. It is smooth and silky feeling and does a great job moisturizing my face. As far as it diminishing the dark spots on my face I cannot tell that it has helped with that, but it's a nice moisturizer with a great smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is working great! The first couple nights I used it, I could feel a tingling sensation on my face. But it has made my face brighter and and I notice it is firmer. I also used it on my hands and a brown age spot has gotten lighter since using the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Skin is plumper, soft and has a youthful glow after using this product for about 14 days. The cream is a little thick (love in a night cream) and has a light pleasant smell. I was worried it was a little oily (since I have adult acne) but it has not affected my acne one bit. Bottom line I will definitely purchase this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far i love the moisturizer part of the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Creme but i have not noticed any other added benefits. I will continue to use this sample to monitor the results in hopes to see added benefits. (of course thank you L'Oreal for the FREE full size sample) i love the smell. its very faint, not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been enjoying trying out both the day n night cream. The benefits are amazing. My skin is so smooth n soft. I've told my friends at work about it n about how I got the opportunity to try it. The smell is so amazing as well. I usually don't like putting things on my face because I have oily skin but this product doesn't affect that at all. This stuff is what my niece would call awesome sauce. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, I really enjoyed this product. The scent was nice and not too strong - perfect for not being distracting while trying to fall asleep. It was easy to apply to my face, and quickly absorbed into my skin - so I didn't have to worry about it rubbing off on my pillow as soon as I went to bed. While this is not a product I would typically use, I am interested in continuing to use it, along with the day cream, to see if I notice a difference in my face after using it for a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I never liked night creams because of the smell that most have but this one smells great. I wear it every night and love it. My face feels so fresh in the morning and looks so much better after I been using this. Def will be buying more of this when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Sleep is an important function of the body. We store memories and heal wounds. Overnight our skin has a chance to repair from daily damage. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is great because I feel like my dry skin is moistured and being repaired while I sleep. Sleep is important and I may as well get the extra benefit of L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product made my skin softer and moisturized well. The fragrance is too strong. I have a fragrance allergy and this product made my nose run and my eyes irritated each day I used it. I will have to discontinue using it after this review. I do not recommend it for women with a fragrance allergy. It would be a great product for women that are not bothered by a strong fragrance.

"I really did like the night cream. It was very creamy, had a great fragrence and after using for 10 nights I found that there were a lot of fine lines missing. I would recommend this product for fine lines on facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Age Perfect Night Cream is amazing, it does not leave my face feeling greasy and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. Unlike many of the other creams on the market, L'Oreal Age Perfect Night Cream comes in a full size jar, not some little mini jar. I have to admit, I love it so much, I rub a little on my hands and arms too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has made my face feel great, I have been using it in combination with the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15. I love the combination, and the way it makes me feel. I think I will continue using this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream has given my skin a new softness. This cream has a pleasant fragrance. I wake up in the morning and my face feels rejuvenated. I will keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's too heavy for my skin which tends to be a little loo oily, but it has a nice scent and feel. More like a hand cream though. I used it nightly and didn't notice any more breakouts, but it did feel like too much moisture for my skin. It would probably be great for dry skin. Also didn't notice any difference in fine lines or wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product just won me over. I can definitely feel how its moisturizing my skin. Feels softer. I just started 3 days ago but looks good so far. I also like how the product specifies the products you should combine it with in order to obtain better results. This phase in live take a toll on us mature women. Skin is changing, hormones, etc. Glad someone thought of us because we want to look beautiful as well. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the night cream the day I received it. I have to admit, I was impressed. The night cream was creamy but not greasy at all. It also moisturizer excellently! I was worried at first about possibly breaking out, but going on over a week and my skin is great. I'm definitely going to keep using this product to bright, moisturize, and firm my skin! The night cream does have a strong perfume fragrance compared to the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Loreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is outstanding. It is a very thick cream, so I worried about breakouts. I had none. My skin is soft and feels cushion. In two weeks, I have not noticed a change in fine lines or wrinkles. However, I will continue to use this night cream because my skin not only feels better, but looks brighter. I highly recommend this product to women of any age who want softer, smoother, and brighter skin.n [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product works well. I used it for one night only and I noticed a reduced amount of dark circles in the morning. However, the scent is way too strong. I have sensitive eyes, can't wear mascara or liquid eyeliner. If it was unscented I would probably continue using it, But my eyes just couldn't handle the it.

"The age perfect night cream is great. My face is dry to normal skin and very sensitive, so trying new creams is rare. When I starting his cream the first thing I noticed is how my skin felt so soft and hydrated not dry. It smells good, isn't oily, and feels refreshing. I would certainly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Firstly, the great news is that this didn't have a strong smell which I find to sometimes be a problem. Directions are straight forward and it went on easy. Didn't seem to leave behind any sort of residue which is great. But two weeks in and I'm having breakouts where I didn't before. My skin also feels kind of funny in some spots. I think that if I didn't have combination skin, this would've worked perfectly for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the feel and smell of the cream. At first my skin broke out a little around my temples but that cleared up fairly quickly. I may be a liitle on the young side of the cream usage and that lead to the breakout. Overall my skin is looking healthier and younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked that there was a different night cream since you don't need SPF at night but I just don't think I'm old enough for this cream yet. I'm not yet 50- which seems to be the target age for this cream- so my skin isn't dry yet. Once my skin dries out a little more I will be sure to try this again since it went on well and felt good but I just don't need it yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream the day I received it. After about a week, I noticed my face and neck were smoother and much softer. The cream has a pleasant light scent. This cream was very light weight and I did not experience any breakouts with this. I will definitely continue to use L'Oreal age perfect night cream. I am excited to see what longer use will do! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the night cream and I decided to try it for a couple of days. The night cream is somewhat oily and when I woke up it would get in my eyes. But on another side my skin is super smooth and tone looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this product worked great. I was very nice to put on at night and leave on all night. It was not greasy or heavy feeling which other brands have been.

"L'oreal age perfect night crème is not a product I would have purchased on my single mom budget, but getting it for free was a nice treat. I've pampered myself this past week, adding age perfect to my bedtime routine. My face feels full of moisture, the zits went away and I am enjoying the fragrance as I smooth it into my skin.

I really liked the L'Oreal Paris age facial night cream. It absorbed very easily. It immediately made my skin feel soft and satiny.

"I really enjoyed this product. As I'm maturing my skin needs more moisture and I like using a true night cream to really sink into my skin. At first use, the cream was rich yet lightweight- not oily or greasy at all. It easily absorbed into my skin and felt very smooth. After a few minutes it was fully absorbed with no tacky or sticky feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how this cream makes my face feel. I've been using it for over 2 weeks now and love the way my skin is improving, i def see a change.

This product was great to use after removing my makeup at night. Scent is very light and product is not too greasy. I found it great to use on top of my hands also.

"I received this cream hesitant on weather I old like it or not. Every time I change up something in my face routine I break out . With these age perfect creams I did not! I love it. My face feels smoother, doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy just moisturized. I may have found my forever cream. In the short time I have been using it, I feel my tone has become more even.

I love L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It is nice and thick and has a very powerful moisturizing effect.

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream does what it says, I am using it daily with the day cream. I observed a decrease in skin spots, my skin is more soft and smooth with lesser lines. it has a nice fragrance too, which gives a nice clean feel to skin before sleeping. i also observed that this cream moisturizes my skin perfectly. i have dry and flaky skin which has improved considerably after the use of these creams. i am definitely going to continue my use.

"I have been using this product for the past few weeks. Its a great product. Silky texture, and a little goes a long way. It has helped my combination skin with no problems or break outs. It has helped with dry areas, tightened my skin and helped even out the tone. I would have given this 5 stars, but the scent of this product is a little overpowering to me. Its not a bad scent, just too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the night cream. It is light and luxurious. My skin feels great after using it. I have oily skin and tend to have problems using products that moisturize. Not so with this product. My skin feels supple. The scent is soothing and not too strong. It is a light scent that helps me relax. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The night cream is not heavy. The scent is a little overpowering, would be nice to have a lavender fragrance for nighttime. The day and night cream containers look similar. A different color top for night cream would help decipher the two. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm 64 years old and I really loved this Product. After cleansing my face I applied the L'Oreal Age Perfect Night Cream. My face felt wonderful I also applied it to my neck. I noticed the lines in my face were smooth and wasn't dry. The next morning I had more color in my face. I love this product I also used the L'OREAL Age Perfect Day Cream.

"I was horrible at cleaning my face before bed, but with the Paris Night Cream I cannot wait to put it on my face. I feel so refreshed, soft and moisturized before bed I actually sleep better. I am allergic to a lot of fragrances but this cream has really worked for me. I did not break out and I can see my skin glowing. I LOVE IT! ❤️❤️❤️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Not a huge moisturizer user but after trying this product i realize how dry your skin can be. I use it each night before bed and when i wash my face in the morning i can feel how soft and moisturized my face is. It has a nice light scent. Not too greasy feeling and you only have to use a little dime to nickel size to the job. My skin looks nice and hydrated after use. Have not noticed yet if it helped with my fine lines after a month.

I have been using the cream for 2 weeks now and really haven't seen any difference in my wrinkles or spots but I am 60 so it may take a while. I have noticed that my face is softer to the touch. I also like the feel of the cream I might buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love it, After a long day I would wash my face and apply the night cream not greasey real smooth and wow I would wake up and my face is soft and it did a great job moisturizing my skin. Love It!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The day I got the products I tried the night cream then in the morning I got up and used the day cream. Using the product it is very light on the skin. After using it for a week my skin feels very soft and moist. The first day or so wasn't sure if my sensitive skin would be able to do the product but it is very good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer is really good, but it feels too heavy to me for night. I prefer something lighter and ""feel"" it less. It certainly doesn't leave stains on my pillowcase or anything, just uncomfortable for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this night Cream, my face usually feels tight and itchy after a shower, however after using this cream it's gone! It does have a light scent but not strong or prufumy. The texture is very creamy but light weight so my face doesn't feel greasy either. Really loving this cream. Going to try the day cream soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It is rich and luxurious on my skin. Feels like a great deep moisturizer and my skin still feels ""dewy "" in the morning. I think this product is comparable to any of the expensive, department store counter moisturizers. ..and I have tried many of them. The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream (2.5 oz) is a great price for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal night cream feels so good on my face after a great shower! My skin feels so hydrated and the dryness I had on my nose and forehead has really diminished! I have a light spot on my cheek its an age spot it looks like it my be lightening! This cream has made my face feel so smooth and my skin is tightening up and is more resilient and radiant! I am changing and making this my night cream before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I haven't really ever used any cream for my face. So going in to try this I waswnr expecting much. But I was wrong just after about a week and a half of using it I have noticed a difference. I tend to have really dry skin in the winter and fall. Out house is big and cold. My skin is noticeabley less dry and I have noticed a new brightness in my skin. I am definitely hooked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a wonderful product. It's not as greasy as most night time creams, and it made my skin more supple with moderate wrinkle reduction. The scent could be improved on, but other than that, I thought it was great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't really noticed a significant difference in my skin. i have no complaints about the cream though. it's a smooth texture that my skin absorbs well and i am not left feeling greasy. amazing smell! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the L'Oréal day and night cream and I love it. My skin felt smooth immediately and over 2 weeks now I noticed some tightening in my skin. No strong fragrance which I love. I plan on continuing using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great night cream. It is creamy and light. The scent is also very light but luxurious at the same time. You can really feel it moisturizing which helps prevent wrinkles overnight. I have had compliments on how smooth and soft my skin is. I also like to put it on my neck and hands at night to keep those looking young too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the L'Oréal Paris Age perfect facial night cream. I use it each night before bed and lately on my hands as well. I do a lot of home construction work on the weekends and then work in the office during the work week. It has really helped decrease the dryness of my skin on my face and hands.

"I think the L'Oreal Paris Age Facial Day and Night cream, makes my skin feel smooth and soft. It has no strong odor and I only use a small amount for maximum coverage. I have noticed a tighten in my skin. I would definitely recommend this product to any woman of any age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the smell of the Night Cream! Used this every night before bed. My face feels firmer, Lines are smoother. Wasn't heavy feeling on my face. My face felt hydrated! Love it. It will be my go to night cream for now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for a week, I really started noticing the difference in how my skin felt. It felt moisturized and toned. I will definitely be purchasing this product once my free sample from BZZAgent runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been intermittently using the L'Oréal Paris age perfect facial night cream - it has the lightest scent and is nice and creamy, not thick & greasy. Unfortunately, I don't remember to use the cream every night. The nights I do use it, my skin feels hydrated and heathy in the morning. I think not seeing any difference in my skin is my own fault and I am going to start diligently using it every night and hope to see a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this night cream well enough; it smells fantastic (even my husband commented when I went to bed after applying it). I didn't notice brand new skin or anything, but it definitely hydrates and doesn't feel thick or sticky, which I hate. I would recommend this product as a good staple night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried the L'Oreal Paris age perfect night cream for almost 2 weeks. My skin feels softer smoother and has more moisture. It does not make my skin feel oily. In fact in fact it is actually helped my face heal a break out I had faster than they usually would!I would recommend this product especially if you have a dry skin. I will update in another week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just tried the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. I use it after washing my face for the night. The cream is very smooth to put on. I put a dab on my forehead, cheeks, chin and nose and rub in. The next morning my skin is very soft to the touch. My face isn't too bad for my age so I'm counting on keeping my skin soft and ""age free"" by using this L'Oréal Paris Age Night Cream. My skin is really soft by the next morning. My husband loves to feel my soft face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, it's interesting that I was given this product to review because it is made for women older than myself, but I am still giving it a try. The scent of this cream is really nice. It goes on quite thick which I think will be nice during the cold months when my skin tends to get very dry. It's actually too greasy for me at the moment. If you tend to battle dry skin, this is a great product for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is honestly one of the best night cream I have used in a long while. The cream is very luxurious but not heavy or greasy at all. I can honestly say that my skin is much smoother and softer. The fine lines on my face are much less noticeable than before. The scent is really the only thing that I didn't like. It was a little strong in my opinion but I'm hoping that may be an improvement to the product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is thick and has a pleasant smell. I used it nightly and found my skin more dewy when I would wake up! I used it on my face and neck. Overall, I was very pleased and will continue to use it. I also liked the size of the containers, they are small enough to tuck in the drawer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin's texture has softened so beautifully since I began using the Age perfect products. The cream itself is lightly fragrances, soft and silky feeling. It does not leave a greasy feeling and smoothes right into your skin. I love the softer supple skin that I have in just a handful of day's use. It is now my go to moisturizer of choice! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night cream has a nice non-overpowering scent. Plus I seem to do better at remembering to put lotion on at night. Unfortunately I had to stop using the problem because my face started to break out. I have very sensitive skin and I just couldn't deal with the acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've only been using the night cream for a few weeks but I think it is fantastic! It's not heavy when you put it on and the scent isn't overpowering. I have noticed some fine lines got smaller...and my skin is softer. I am excited to keep using this product during the winter months since my skin usually gets very dry and flaky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The night cream is decadent and luxurious feeling. It's thick but doesn't feel heavy on the skin and absorbs nicely. The fragrance is a little strong for my preference but not completely unbearable. Woke up to soft skin that felt moisturized and refreshing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream was fabulously light feeling for night time. It absorbed quickly and I felt like it stayed on my face instead of rubbing off on my pillow. My only downfall with this cream is after the first few mornings of using it, I woke up with break outs on my face. After a few days of using it however, I know long had new blemishes in the morning. It has a nice light scent like the day cream. I'm excited to see how it will affect my skin with long term use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product . It feels so moisturizing and nourishing on my skin. My skin feels so lovely in the morning.....very soft. The scent is just right....very pleasant. Not too strong at all. Love this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way the product smells. It goes on smooth and has a very silky feel to it. I've only been using the product for about 2 weeks and have already noticed a difference in my skins appearance. Can't wait to see what another 2 weeks will reveal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a lovely cream that is very rich and nourishing. I loved putting it on my cleansed skin at night and feeling it sink it. I have not been using it long enough to notice a huge change in my skin but it definitely feels softer and my skin looks more refreshed in the morning. I am 46 years old and I am always looking for a fountain of youth and while this may not completely turn back the hands of time, it sure helps lessen the ravages of again.

"Product absorbs well into the skin, not greasy or sticky. I love the way my skin felt in the morning. It had a nice perfume-y smell, but if you're very sensitive to that, you may not like it. I can't wait to see results over am extended time period. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used the day and night cream and I liked the day cream, however, the night cream seemed to make my oily skin even worse in the mornings. Not a big problem for others I'm sure but if you have oily skin already, proceed with caution. The perfume smell of this product was not pleasing to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream is great. I've used it for about 5 days now before I wanted to buzz about this product. Overall, it smells great, keeps you hydrated throughout the night, tightens so when you wake up, you're not tired looking and you still feels as your skin is refreshed. I don't have any cons about this product and so everyone knows, I did not get an allergic reaction or any skin problems. I'm very sensitive to products so def a plus in my book.

This product was great. it made me skin feel so soft in the morning after I used it. I loved the creaminess and how it smelled. It was great to use. I used it every night and I know my skin was softer and more supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sceptical that this cream would work, let alone work quickly. I have to say I am amazed at how soon I began to see a difference. I have been using this cream and the day cream for two weeks now. My wrinkles and laugh lines became smaller and my skin seemed tighter. My skin also glowed and appeared more smooth. I am delighted with these products and will continue to use them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is great. I have been using it nightly and it makes my skin feel great. I love the smell and how lightweight it is. I haven't been using it long enough to tell a significant difference in my skin, but I love the way the skin feels while using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"During the cooler months when the air is so dry I have issues with my sensitive skin drying out and cracking, which emphasizes my laugh lines and the dark circles under my eyes. This cream worked well at combating this overnight dryness and its hydrating properties helped smooth out my crinkles. My skin felt more supple and soft in the morning. And even though my facial skin is very sensitive, the cream did not cause any allergic reactions or irritations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the night cream for almost 2 weeks before writing this review to be sure I could provide accurate information. I really like it! It goes on smoothly with a pleasant smell and doesn't burn my skin or the skin around my eyes like other creams have done. My skin looks healthier in the morning and using this in combination with the day cream has really made a difference. I also love that it is readily available at the drugstore. I will definitely use the entire container! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I wasn't too keen on the day cream, the night cream is a whole different ballgame. I loved the smell and it was really light and non-greasy. It also absorbed nicely. My skin has been looking better every morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed this night cream immeansly. I often wear the night cream during the day as I don't like SPF on my face. The night cream has a light scent which I was not fond of but it would not stop me from using it. The cream goes on nicely and is not oily. My face felt nourished day and night.

"I have applied this product lightly for the last week every evening before bedtime. So far, it seems to keep my skin soft but I don't think enough time has passed for me to see any age-defying effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using expensive department store products and find that these creams work almost as well. I have aging, sensitive skin and the night cream feels especially good after cleansing my face. I like the day cream also but use SPF 45 on top of the day cream as soon as it soaks in. They are great products, especially considering the price difference!

"I really enjoyed this night cream. It was long lasting, through the night, without making my skin greasy. It has a very nice smell that is not overpowering. This cream has helped with some of my fine line around my eyes and has helped bring a more supple appearance to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the cream is good. The smell and the texture of the cream is just right light and fluffy and the sent is fresh and not to over powering. Its light and smooth on the skin however to my taste it felt a little to watery when rubbed on my skin. As for result i did see a couple. My skin felt tighter and the pigmentation was evening out. Nothing much on the crows feet yet so im excited to see more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVE the Perfect Facial Night Cream!!! They could not have chosen a better name because it is PERFECT! I have been using it in conjunction with the day cream as well for over a week and my skin has been healthier than ever. Fine lines are disappearing by the second!

i have been using this night cream for about two weeks. i have found it to be very nice smelling and easy to apply. it glides over the skin to leave it feeling like a baby's skin. it felt very soothing after cleaning my face to apply this cream. in the morning my skin still felt moisturized.

"I loved the Night Cream by L'Oreal. It had a good thickness to it and a little went a long way. While within a weeks try I did not see wrinkles erased, I did notice that my neck excess was tighter and less visible. I can't wait to see after a months use. Also, I didn't care for the scent, while it was mild ( my daughter thought it smelled like talc) I would have preferred none to little scent at night.

"I really never used a night time moisturizer before so this was my first time. I have been using the product for close to two weeks now. It is thick yet not too heavy. It does a great job at moisturizing & I've received compliments on what great skin I have. However, I'm not sure if this cream delivers on it's anti-aging claims. I do think my skin is softer and more supple, but I don't think it has reduced the appearance of fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried other night time moisturizers before. And the next morning I wash my face and it feels dry and horrible, like whatever I put on did nothing for me over night. Not so with L'Oréal ParisAge Perfect Facial Night Cream. I wake up with a face that feels moisturized and ready to face the day. Washing doesn't leave me dry and feeling like nothing happened. My face is firmer, and my skin is ready for whatever the new day may bring. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, it's hard for me to remember to use these types of products at night. Could be because I'm in denial and think that I'm still 22, lol. Nonetheless, I have been using this for the past two weeks and can tell that my skin in much smoother and there are NO dry patches on my face. I will continue to use this as long as I can remember to do it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do not have any input on the ageless benefit, however, the night cream is a wonderful companion to the day cream. I have seen dark spots start to diminish as well as a subtle evening of my skin tone. My skin is always fresh and smooth in the morning and the combo of the day and night cream helps make my skin feel hydrated, elastic and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream goes on easily, and like the day cream it requires a decent sized glob to cover your face. It makes my skin feel soft after using it but it does irritate my sensitive skin a little and the scent is a bit too strong for me. It is a fairly mild scent, and not a bad one, but I just don't do well with scented creams on my face. I've only used it a handful of times since it's irritating, so I cannot comment on it's long term affect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually hate to try products like this because they leave my skin feeling greasy. Not so with L'Oréal night cream. I was able to lay down on my pillow after putting it on and not worry about a grease spot on my pillow. My skin glowed the next morning. This product it great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product not only smells good, but it also has been great for my dry skin. I initially thought it might be a little heavy as I do tend to still have breakouts but I haven't had any issues. I do also notice a lightening in some of my acne scars, and age spots. Overall, great product for the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product is so strongly scented that I can't stand to use it! I am used to using unscented products because of my sensitive skin and nose. And it is particularly unpleasant to use at night because the smell keeps waking me up. The daytime cream works well and is less heavily scented. I tried this once, but the strong smell was just too much, which was disappointing. I would try it again if they came out with an unscented version.

"As someone with naturally oily skin, even at my age, I always thought a night cream or any kind of moisturizer wouldn't be necessary. But when those little lines started appearing and my skin starting feeling that it had no life, I began to think differently. The Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is exactly what it says...perfect! My skin feels firmer and I'm beginning to notice a reduction in the fine lines. And no extra oiliness or breakouts! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got to try this product for free through BzzAgent. I am thoroughly impressed with my L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. My skin has never looked and felt smoother! It was easy to add into my nightly routine and takes so very little to use when I apply it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm loving this cream. I have a hard time finding a good cream for my face, because I have sensitive skin and I have break outs, but after using this I truly love it. It don't break my skin out and it's making my skin more even. I have dark circles under my eyes and with in the time I have been using it, the circles are not as dark. I love that it's not greasy, seeing that my skin it oily. My skin is softer and smother. I will definitely continue to use this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Couldn't get past day 5 of this cream due to the smell. Need something much more subtle or no scent. Also forgot to mention on my day cream review but these also made my face breakout, went back to my cream and my face cleared up in two days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream was simply amazing. It feels smooth and silky without feeling greasy. My skin literally feels like it is drinking it up. It doesn't sit on top of your skin and it doesn't feel oily. It is a wonderful moisturizer. When I woke up in the morning, my skin felt better after just one use. A week later, there is significant improvement. No more dry, itchy skin. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Made my skin feel refreshed throughout the night. I'm 34 and it definitely helped my under eye circles and mosturize my skin in the dry places that I have. I would definitely pay for this product and use again in the future. Didn't leave my skin oily or acne prone. A great night cream for sure [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a mother to three children and this product helps me hide it. The first time I used the cream my youngest daughter had just turn a month old. I applied it before I went to bed and when I woke up my face was glowing. The bags under my eyes were almost non existent. I would buy this cream time and again. It is amazing.

"Out of the Day and Night cream I prefer this one.. It's lightly scented, and soaks right into my skin leaving it feeling incredibly smooth and soft I LOVE It! I have noticed some fine lines smoothing out.. I don't have age spots so I can't speak for that.. But I do recommend this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so impressed by the way my skin felt the following morning using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Facial Cream. My skin felt tighter and firmer as well as radiant and soft. I had used other products that by morning my skin felt dry and flaky, but unlike that experience, I look forward to letting sleep and rest along with this cream do the magic that my face has been craving for, for years.

"Love this thick, luxurious feeling night cream. It melts into my skin and gives my super dry, yet still somehow oily skin the moisture it needs without feeling at all greasy or heavy. I have not seen any of the anti aging benefits so far, but maybe I will with more time....either way, I love it as a night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Night cream is awesome! It has all the qualities of the day cream (minus the SPF), but for night time. It is a little thicker than the day cream, but that is expected. It still smooths on my skin just as easily. It's not greasy, so I didn't break out. Actually my skin cleared up after about 3 days of continued day/night cream. The scent is a light floral that smells so good. My skin feels so much softer and clearer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I believe that I may not be of an age that this product is what I am looking for. I am 33 years old and the formula caused me to break out. If you are prone to breakouts, like me, this might not be the product for you. On the plus side it did smell really nice and felt very smooth going on.

"I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream For 2 weeks now and I can honest say I absolutely love it! My skin feels softer, smoother and healthier! I love the smell and texture as well. I wake up each morning feeling refreshed and ready to start my day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've noticed that my skin is Alot smoother in the morning after the night cream. I let my mom and grandma try it out and they both agree that there skin is much smoother the morning after using the night cream. Now with the day cream I noticed my face get a little to oily after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for about 2 weeks now. I love the scent, however for those that are sensitive to perfumes, you may not like this. My skin does feel softer, but no reduction in lines yet. Too soon to tell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is a great pair with the SPF15 Day Cream. It made my skin soft and gave it a healthy glow. I haven't seen any reduction in age spots or wrinkles yet, but I've been trying the product with my 65-year-old mother to see if she has better results. I might consider adding this to my regimen as a way to reduce the impact of aging, but I don't know how much repair it can do on the wrinkles I already have.

"I am always on the hunt for a good night cream. I require a lotion that absorbs quickly, doesn't cause excessive oiliness, and with a light to no scent. This one delivers on the first two. I like the thicker consistency of the cream and the ease to apply. I do not like scents in my face lotions, and this one had a stronger scent out of the bottle - but it was gone quickly after application. I think my skin looks smoother and feels softer after this week or so of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for about 2 weeks. I've noticed a big difference in the minimizing/disappearance of tiny age spots on my face. My skin feels hydrated and soft. Since it doesn't take much product, I think it will last a long time. It barely looks like I've taken anything out of the jar! I use it on my face and my neck,too. Good value! I did not find the smell a problem--It's light and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was an excellent product. The non-greasy formula didn't make my skin breakout and made it feel soft and moisturized. I noticed a slight difference in my overall appearance after a couple of weeks; I would imagine a larger difference would be noted over time. The only thing I wish is that this product was paraben free. Other than that, I recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the daytime and night cream for two weeks now. I have to say I love both. They are lightly scented and non greasy. My skin looks so smooth. I haven't used it long enough to know if it will help decrease age spot appearance but I am hopeful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day & night cream. It smells great. Only takes a small amount to get the job done. My face definitely look more refreshed in the morning. I've noticed though my wrinkle in between my eyebrows and forehead have lessened/smoothed out some. The only con I have found about the product that may just be my skin is it broke out in acne a small bit. Other than that a product that I will continue to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was surprised that this product didn't feel greasy or heavy! Most night creams make me have weird acne but not with this product. I am a loyal Mary Kay user and this product BLEW my nighttime moisturizer out the door. This is a lightweight but focused product that helps moisterize and tighten all in one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The night cream definitely moisturized my very dry skin. I woke up with a softer, smoother tone as a result. My only complaint is it did make me break out. I have particularly sensitive, acne prone skin so it isn't something I would use again, however, I would recommend it in a heartbeat to a friend whose skin wasn't acne prone. It didn't have an overwhelming smell, and didn't leave a greasy feeling. Honestly, I wish it was a product I could use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's very light. It does not leave your face feeling greasy. When you wake up in the morning, been after first use, nor face feels softer and fresh. After using for about a week, lines don't seem as noticeable and your skin feels great- smooth and soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is awesome. I normally do not use night creams but I noticed with this one it really works great. Its not overly oily and leaves my skin smooth the next day. I have only been using the product for a few days and I'm already noticing a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a good cream, but it needs some improvements. For example the scent is really strong and can be really annoying at nights that you need to sleep. Plus, it is really heavy and greasy. I would love something more hydrating but not greasy and heavy. Still it is a good cream. #l'oreal #bzzagent #ageperfect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My first time trying L'Oreal's Age Perfect Night cream. I'm in my 40's and I was excited to use it because of its claims to help with sagging and age spots. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The crème feels super heavy like my skin cant breathe and its clogging my pores I put it on my face felt heavy and the perfume smell is overwhelming and does not dissipate and burned my eyes. Also dont like the soy in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing i noticed about this product was the light, fresh fragrance.It feels as nice as it smells, going on like silk and not at all heavy or stickyI used it under foundation and saw results instantly! The fine lines around my lips and eyes were much less noticeable!What a nice surprise! After a week of daily use, I'm very happy with the way my skin looks and feels!I plan on using this product every day now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried using this product over the last few weeks in the hope that I would get used to the strong scent. True is I have a little but I should not expect most people would give it time to get used to the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the feel/texture of the night cream. I've. Even using a week nOw and still no noticeable results. I have some hyper pigmentation from old acne scars and I couldn't tell that where any lighter at all. However it did provide good moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the night cream is wonderful feels so good on your face. It rejuvenates your skin. You don't have to use very much of the cream. A jar will last along time which I like. I have wrinkles and fine lines that have diminished. So easy to use put the cream ,on rub in and watch the results. Your skin feels soft. You can feel it working as soon as you put it on. I would recommend this product to everyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
•L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream (2.5 oz) is amazing. Age spots are already fading after only a week of use. A friend said my face looked brighter. I think it's too early to give results on results of wrinkles but very happy with product so far. Thanks BzzAgent for allowing me to try •L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream . I will update and couple weeks with results of fading wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received this & was skeptical since have tried so many & believe at 58yrs.,i've tried a lot.Have only been using the L'Oréal for about a week now & I have to say so far I really like it. Does not irritate my skin, has not caused any break-outs, goes on smooth & silky & most of all it seems to be helping lessen my lines. Will re-post more as time goes, but so far a liking the L'Oreal Night Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream smells great and soaks right into your skin with a light touch. It does not feel greasy like some that I have tried. I must say that I am now waking up to firmer skin and no longer have my red splotchy spots, must be the right stuff for me!! Please give this night cream a try you will not regret it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is light, non-greasy and feels great. It absorbs easily into my dry skin. I love the fully hydrated feeling I get at night after applying this wonderful product. My skin feels soft, more supple, less dry and happy. I wake up with less wrinkles. I would recommend this cream to anyone else with dry skin that needs hydrating overnight! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this night cream by L'Oreal. It's just the right lightness so it's not greasy all over my pillow, and I do feel like I wake up with firmer skin. Also in conjunction with the day cream I feel like my skin looks brighter. It's also a nice texture so I can tell it's getting hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that my face looks brighter and tighter. I should have identified the spots that were darkest to really evaluate whether they were getting lighter, but I do feel that without make up on my face looks brighter. Also I din't have a lot of sagging, but noticed in a picture the other day how tight the skin on my chin looked -in a good way. I gave it a four because it seems a little greasy when I put my makeup on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm loving this product so far. Feels good on my skin and has a nice scent that's not too powerful. I've already noticed an improvement in my skin since using for a week. Would definitely use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did really appreciate the glass jar packaging. The cream itself was very hydrating withou being too greasy. My skin really soaked it up. I woke up feeling my skin had been quenched. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 was the scent of the night cream. It was a little strong for my liking. I do have a sensitive nose so keep this in mind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the night cream every night after washing my face and so far I really like it! It has a nice scent that isn't overpowering, and I only need to use a very little bit each time. My experience with other nighttime creams has been that it leaves my face feeling greasy, and/or breaks me out, but so far I haven't noticed that with this one. My skin does seem plumper and a bit brighter too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it goes on smooth and makes your skin feel silky not greesy doesn't give u pimples .You should try loreal age perfection its a great product it provides soy seed proteins anti age spot action and deep hydration give loreal a try its a great product.

I really love the pampering my face has been getting using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream my skin feels softer and hydrated and more balanced instead of being oily in one place and dry in another . I have also notice my skin seems to be tighter. I would definitely recommend and will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never used night cream before, but I just turned 33 and have been thinking about adding this to my night regime. I have been using this for a week and I don't really see much of a difference. I give it 3 stars because I do love how it makes my face feel. I love the scent of it. And I also love how it's not greasy. I really just didn't see much of a difference in my skin as far as spotting or sagging. I was more of a fan of the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always skeptical of face creams that make big promises, but I have to say, after using this cream even for the first time, I thought I looked more refreshed / bright in the morning. I didn't realize at first that it's meant for slightly older women. I'm 36 with VERY light skin that's starting to wrinkle and look dull. This product definitely isn't only for older women - I will continue to use it. I've been using it for about a week now with continually good results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is wonderful! I love the scent and the feel of this cream- not too thick, not too thin. I've been using it for about a week and I can already tell a difference in my skin tone. My skin looks hydrated and my freckle/sun spots appear to be fading! I'm excited to see what my skin will look like after a month! This is definitely a keeper!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried this night cream for about a couple weeks now and am very impressed. I'm about 36 weeks pregnant and have horribly dry skin so this sample came in nick of time. My skin feels softer and smoother and rarely has any dry skin. I like how the night cream doesn't make my face feel greasy but it effectively moisturizes it. Plus, it smells AMAZING! My husband comments all the time how much he likes the way it smells. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this cream makes my face feel and look smoother. I've been using it along with the day cream and the results are great. It absorbs quickly and feels light on my skin. I will definitely continue to use this facial cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product too. I use it in combination with the day cream. My face feels great. No greasy feeling. And it's ok on my oh so sensitive skin. Must try. I will purchase more after what I have runs out. I've already recommended to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"am delighted with my L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect creams, the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream has SPF 15 Age Perfect Day Creamwhich is always good and the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream it won't stay sticky on your face and it has a very pleasant smell, it's a lot of product, I love L'Oreal.

"This product is creamy and has a lovely scent ! Clean your face , and smooth all over your face and neck area. Your face feels very soft. No dryness in the morning, no cracking skin, just smooth, soft skin. Love this product as it is readily available and affordable ! Thanks ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has been a few weeks since I started the creams.Getting older,there are places on my face I am concerned about.Wrinkles,turkey neck.My face feels firmer,less noticeable wrinkles,and still waiting for help on my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I have only been using it for about a week I have not seen any real result but It does take time for this product to work. Hoping to rid myself of the under eye bags and the beginning of the sagging chin area. Hopefully it helps to keep my younger look. The cream goes on smooth and has a nice scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is what I've been looking for! Besides having a great scent that is not overpowering, this night cream also goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave me feeling greasy! I prefer it to all the high-end and beauty box brands I have rolling around in my cabinet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this is a great product and I will continue to use it day and night. It has brightened my face and reduced the my wrinkles I feel more confident about my appearance. I noticed the changes in my skin in about two weeks I even felt the change in my skin how soft and smooth its way I will continue the use of this product from now on I LOVE IT. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very skeptical this night cream because of the promises boasted on the packaging. However, this night cream is great! The first time I put it on I just slathered it on and forgot about it. The next day I was washing my hands and looking in the mirror wondering why my face and neck looked so soft and smooth. The only thing different in my routine was this night cream! I was shocked at how well this actually worked for me. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal night cream feels a little heavy on my slightly oily skin but I may get used to that feeling over time. The scent is stronger than the day cream but I actually enjoy a more scented product at night. After a week of use, I am seeing a slight improvement in skin texture and fine lines. I hope that continues over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, I like this cream for it's consistency. It's light, smooth, and a little goes a long way. It was easy to rub in and made my face feel less dry almost immediately. However, when I woke up the following morning, my face was just greasy. It's never been like that before! I don't know what happened. I tried it a second night, using a lighter application, and the same thing happened. I was very disappointed, especially after such promising results after first putting it on.

"Being almost 63, I gave up on Night Creams along time ago, (decided to let nature take its course). Soo when I got L'Oreal Night Cream, thought I would try it. Lawd I Love it!! My face feels so soft and smooth. It smells so good! Can't wait till 8 weeks (lines and wrinkles disappear). I actually can see results afte 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was the first facial night cream I have ever used so I really didn't know what to expect. I absolutely loved this product. It had a creamy texture that absorbed quickly into my skin leaving it feeling silky smooth. I found the light scent to be very pleasant. In the morning my face and neck felt very smooth and well hydrated with no greasy residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'oreal Paris Age Perfect night cream is so soft and feels so good when applying. It absorbs quickly, and feel almost like velvet on the skin. I apply it to my face, neck, decolete and even my hands. There is no oily residue on my skin in the morning, and my skin appears smoother, especially on my hands. It is a little thicker than the day cream and therefore you don't need to apply a lot. This makes the cream last much longer too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream felt so light and it was so easy to smooth on. Some creams are heavy and it feels like you are tugging at your skin. My skin, which is super dry, felt better right away after application. This time of year, with the Santa Ana winds blowing, L'Oreal gave my face a nice lift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this cream for the past week. I wash my face and apply, right before going to bed. My face feels OK. Not sure exactly what night cream does but I've always used it anyways. I HAVE NOT seen a reduction in age spots. But there have been no seemingly negative effects. I wake up, wash my face and go about my day. My usual night time cream from Clinique seems to do the trick. I feel no need to switch over to L'Oreal, though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never tried a night or day cream before. After trying the L'Oreal Age Perfection Day and Night Cream for Mature Skin I'm hooked. My skin feels so much tighter and hydrated it feels wonderful. Thank you L'Oreal for making such a great product. You have a customer for life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal Day and Night Cream. It's been about a week now, I can see my wrinkles going away, but it makes my face feel greasy, I rub the lotion in, but still feels the same. My face feels some what softer, but I am not sure this product is right for me. I will continue using it... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never used a night cream before so I wasn't sure what to expect. When I opened the container, the smell was not pleasant. (Doesn't smell like the day cream). Aside from the smell, which does seems to fade once the cream is on, overall a good product. Skin doesn't feel oily or greasy, and now that the winter cold is here, stays hydrated better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using this product a few days, but I am loving it so far. It does not make my oily skin, more oily. I love anything that is working while I sleep. The price for both these products is far more reasonable then most anti-aging products. I will keep you posted as the campaign progresses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's been almost two weeks and I have to say that the nighttime cream is great. I have dry skin under my eyes and it kept it moist all night after my shower. My eyes seem less puffy in the morning as well. I like the light scent and overall I plan to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not used to wearing a night cream but I desperately need some moisture infused into my skin as well as help with sagging/wrinkles/tone. Unfortunately, I didn't get past the first night with it on. In fact, I almost got up to wash it off. The scent is so perfume-y that it gave me a slight headache and nauseous feeling. I couldn't force myself to use it again. It's too bad because I liked the texture and I actually thought my face looked brighter and much less dry in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly I was expecting far more from this item. I stopped my normal routine and replaced it with the day & night cream. In order to get a more accurate result I used it for 10 days. I didn't notice any reduction in lines or firming of my skin sadly. I liked how lightweight it was, that was a nice bonus. I was not a fan of the overly heavy perfume smell in the night cream, it gave me headaches. I also had massive breakouts which is abnormal for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never used to use a night cream so getting used to doing this daily has been a challenge. I do like the product, not too heavy, not greasy at all. the scent however is strong. I can smell it long after i have applied it and even after washing my hands completely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nice creamy feel and goes on smooth. I haven't noticed any changes in my wrinkles yet, but it's only been a week. What I am having a hard time with is the smell. It has a very strong perfume type scent, and not in a pleasant way. Putting it on right before bed leaves me sniffing that as I'm trying to fall asleep. My husband is not a fan of it either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product absorbs quickly into the skin and does not feel at all greasy. In the morning my skin still feels great, so soft and smooth. I do not normally use night creams so this is a new experience for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream for a week. I have noticed my face is firmer and seems to be more of a ""glow"". I am not normally a face cream person, however after using L'Oréal's new creams I will use them everyday. The only downfall of the night cream is that it feels very greasy and heavy when first applied, however no breakouts and by morning my face was ""grease"" free and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
A little more scented then the daytime version but still very light overall. On application it was light weight and did not leave my face feeling smothered or greasy. It seemed to absorb more thoroughly than the daytime version maybe due to the SPF factor in the day version. My skin can be sensitive to heavy perfumes or chemicals this did not cause any itching or redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"WOW! My friends and myself couldn't believe how silky smooth my face felt after only a few days of using the night cream. Awesome product. My daughter tried to get me to let her try it, but I said No Way! I was not sharing. LOL. Anyway, thank you guys for allowing the pleasure of trying this night cream. It was a wonderful experience.

After five nights of using loreal age perfect night cream. All my friends say my face looks more softer and an awesome glow. Everyone noticed i have an improvements in my lovely young skin.

"I think that the Loreal Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is the best cream to come on the market in a very long time! I noticed a softening of lines on my forhead and around my mouth after just two days of use! My skin is softer, more pliable, and no more saggy jowels! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have how my face feels when I wake up in the morning, soft and smooth. I didn't know what my face was missing. This is my first time using a night cream and I am surely surprised with my skin. Can't wait to see how it looks in six weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the moisturizer I've been looking for. It absorbs really quickly, which is important to me, since I usually wash my face and moisturize right before bed. No worrying about it ending up on my pillowcase with this moisturizer. Left my skin feeling soft and healthy. LOVE it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the night cream is great I have been using it for a week every night after I wash my make up off I put the night cream on and can feel it working it kinda tingles. It smells great it helps keep my skin hydrated and and keeps it silky smooth. When I run out of the day and night cream I will be purchasing it and I have recommended it to my Mom. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this night cream has just the right consistency, it's thick but still creamy. It went on smooth and absorbed into my skin fairly quickly. I like that it didn't make my skin super shiny or make my skin feel moist. I find that some facial creams can be too heavy and can almost make your face feel wet after you apply them. This one was the opposite of that, it felt light, airy, and hydrating. I also find it to be effective, my skin looked youthful after applying this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this for about 5 nights now and really feel and see a difference. My eyes in the morning are not as tired looking and my skin feels great. It is not greasy at all. It absorbs so well and really helps fine lines for me. I think using this with the day cream is very complimentary as they both are high quality and effective skin products.

"I love this night cream. It is the perfect texture for a before-bed face cream. I love that it works on my signs of aging overnight and keeps my skin moisturized all night long, so when I wake up I have a soft , younger looking face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the new L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. It is smooth, easy to apply and really works. I noticed a difference after three days and I can't wait to see the changes as I keep using the product. Great One!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream for a couple of days now and the first thing that I have noticed about it is the way my face no longer feels dry. My skin on my face feels hydrated and smooth and overall healthier. I am looking forward to continuing usage to see what other things I notice with my skin. So far, I give this product rave reviews!

I really enjoyed how the night cream makes my skin feel! My skin feels really moisturized without the weighty feeling of other moisturizers. I am also prone to breakouts and this cream has really cleared my skin! It smells great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I opened the jar, the first thing that struck me was the fragrance! Due to health issues, I can not tolerate strong fragrances. This one is delightful! Light, clean and fresh! It reduced ""crepiness"" the first night! What a pleasure to wake up and find that my skin DID look better! And it felt great. This will be one of my ""must-haves"".

"I can't wait until the end of the day to apply my Night Cream, I absolutely love the fragrance and what it does for my skin. I can feel it working almost immediately. It's never greasy, always goes on evenly. My skin is hydrated and definitely more firm! Definitely a five star product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have naturally dry skin and this cream did a great job on keeping my skin moisturized throughout the night and there is NO strong smell. I apply it after taking my makeup off right before bed and wake up in the morning with my skin still feeling hydrated (but not oily). Overall this is a great buy, especially if paired with the day cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually skip out on more straight in my face because I don't have time. The L'Oreal night cream is super easy to apply and I am in bed within minutes. I usually apply it after I exit the shower and having washed my face. I brush my teeth and then apply the cream. I love the fresh fragrance and it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or mucky with product. I totally approve this product for skin care maintenance!

The smell of the cream is clean and it's very light weight. I can't wait to see how my skin will benefit from it. It's too soon to tell since I've only tried it for two nights. I'm so excited to see how my skin will look in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love both the day and night cream...it goes in so smoothly and leaves my skin feeling nourished and brighter somehow...the added perks being the lines in my forehead and the few lines near my eyes are diminishing....so amazing...I'll be buying more when this runs out!

"I think that the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is a wonderful product for anyone! It has a nice light scent and keeps your face hydrated after a long day of stress!

I have only been using the product for a couple of weeks but I love the way my skin feels! At first I was a little over powered by the scent of the night cream because I tend to stay away from scented products but even the smell has grown on me. I can't wait to see what my face is like after a few more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has already improved the resilience and firmness of the area around my jaw line which had significant sagging. its very thick and creamy without feeling heavy. It felt very hydrating and seemed to soak right in. If there are any drawbacks its in the fragrance which seemed much to much like chemicals and the texture seemed a bit gritty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When using the L'Oréal Age Perfect Facial Night Cream I find when I get up in the morning my skin feels as if I just applied the Cream. This product is a must have for every woman. If you haven't tried it I suggest that you do. When you use L'Oréal Age Perfect Facial Day Cream along with L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Night Cream it is nothing short of PERFECT. It's right in the name. Where can you go wrong. Come on let's get yours today!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this night cream. It's very light, not greasy. It quickly absorbs into the skin. I have dry skin and this cream kept it soft all night. It's not heavily scented which is great. I'm very happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well, the cream has a rich, yet light texture, that leaves the skin hydrated and smooth. The scent is discreet and pleasant. The first couple of times that I used it, I felt a very slight burn on my skin. The kind you get when there is some fruit acid present, but I consider that to be a positive thing. Generally, I would say that I'm pleased with it and I wI'll definitely continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is insanely good as a result of using this every other day. The cream its not greasy and doesn't have a thick feeling after applying it on.

"I think the L'Oréal Paris Night cream help my skin feel and look healthier. I use it every evening before going to bed. I wouldn't change anything about this product. The smell, texture, and price is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this nightly after I wash my face for about a week. I think it may be too early to tell if it truly does what it says but I do like the smell and how moisturized it makes my skin feel. It absorbs very quickly and doesn't feel greasy to me. The texture of my skin seems better but as far as helping with sagging and wrinkles, the consensus is still out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow this stuff made my face feel great from the very first application. It smells good to. I have very dry skin on my nose and under my eyes. My husband noticed a big difference in just a few days. I can't wait to see how it will look in 30 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Thanks L'Oréal for making a product that truly works. I have tried a lot of night creams and this one is the best yet. This night cream keeps my face well hydrated and very supple. There is no drying irritating feeling that I have felt using other creams. This cream leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and refreshed. I will definitely keep using this product.

Wasn't entirely impressed in the L'Oreal Paris age perfect facial night cream. It was a little heavier than I would like for when I go to bed at night it was a little greasy I would probably recommend a different product at least for myself. Yes some people may like it but I didn't. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is an awesome product. The night cream 1st ingredient is water that rehydrates, and that's exactly what this product does. I'm 69 yrs old and I have used this product for 10 days, and I can feel my face plumping up. And I love the smell, not perfumie but delicate and fresh. This is now my go to night cream. See below my crows feet on the side of my eyes are practically gone. I will consentrate on under my eyes next. Awesome producer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love that I had an opportunity to try out this wonderful L'oreal Night Cream AgePerfect cream now that this is officially fall weather. This was a perfect hangers in my routine. I love how this makes my skin feels tight and much more firm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream did help make my skin a little more form. However, I had a similar experience to the day cream in that it felt like I was wearing a mask. The fragarance got to be a little to strong after a while. I would recommend the product as long as you don't mind the mask-like feel or the fragarance. I tried adding a photo but I couldn't upload one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream comes in a nice size jar, has a very light smell, a little seems like it will go a long way. The only thing I didn't like too much is it feels really thick on my face. I'll try again tomorrow night and maybe just use a little bit less than I did today [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream is a great product. It has a slight sweet smell which is nice and not overwhelming. The product is smooth and not greasy. I do believe that it makes my skin look more healthy and youthful/fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I began using this product in conjunction with the Loreal Age Perfect Day Cream 2 weeks ago! My skin was very dry and dull but after using this product for just a couple of days, there is a noticable difference! My skin is now much more hydrated! It is also much more firm! It smells very good! I took a star off because the night cream has a bit of a heavy/sticky feeling when applied. Overall, it is a great product & I will continue using it!

"I have been using this night cream for a week now and my skin feels so soft and hydrated. I have been using this with the daytime SPF moisturizer and I can't get over how soft my skin feels all day long. My skin is normal (not too oily and not too dry) and hasn't had any reactions to the lotion. I have found my new, favorite moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like the scent of this product. It is cool and the texture is smooth. I tried it once all over my face in the evening after using the Day Cream that morning. It seemed a bit too much moisturizing for my combination skin to use both products. I will continue to use it but not all over my face, only on dry patches. It is a very nice product and I recommend women in menopause should give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of the two products, this one is my favorite! It is a thick cream and it doesn't immediately soak into the skin, which I love! I love the scent of this one too. It doesn't smell like the typical cold creams I am used to. It has a slightly sweet smell to it. This cream is also very soothing and cooling. It helped to cool my skin down after spending the day in the sun and wind. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product every single day for the last two weeks and I'm really happy with it. It's very creamy, it smells good, and a little bit goes a long way. I've noticed that once it's been absorbed, my face feels like it has a pearl-like feel - very smooth and soft. I haven't seen any dramatic difference in the fine lines, but it's only been two weeks and the jar is still almost full. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a woman of color, I've always had to use a night time moisturizer. L'Oréal night cream, is delightful. It also provides a gentle scrub while applying that seems to awaken the pores. I'm very impressed. Will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was dubious about whether the cream would work well, but I was pleasantly surprised. It is thick and creamy, and it smells great! (That's an added bonus, the smell is very soothing.) After about 3 days, there was a noticeable improvement in the look and feel of my skin. Would definitely buy this product and use it long term. Also, seems like a great value because a little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Personally I felt like even for my very very dry skin this was a bit oily and heavy for my personal liking. That being said I let my mom try it and she absolutely loves it. It has in just 3 days show drastic reduction of her finer lines and some of the looseness of her skin. It really does help repair your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Dry winter skin had started and this has beaten it. I tried the day version and loved it so much after a week I had to switch to this night cream and after only a few nights I love the difference I'm seeing. My skin is noticeably more hydrated and tighter. I can't wait to see the results after using for longer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was the first time I've used this product. This left my face so very moist all nite. It relaxed me after a long day. My skin even felt softer in the morning, alot better than ususl. I will buy this product. Loved it! We shall.see about these age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way my skin feels after I put the night cream on. My face feels soft and silky. And the light scent smells clean and fresh. A small amount was all it took to cover my face and neck. I am very interested in the results I might see after using this product for a couple weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First time trying this product. It is lightly scented and doesn't feel heavy or too oily. You can feel a difference in your skin after just 1 night. Also it seems like it will go a long way and be worth buying it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't used a night cream for a long time because the ones I tried before were too heavy and greasy, but this night cream is different - lightweight and leaves my face smooth and dewy. In the morning my face feels soft, with no flaky dry spots like I had before I started using this night cream. It's taken me a little bit to get in the habit of applying it at night, but it's worth the effort! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product. It goes on without feeling greasy, absorbs nicely. I also have sensitive skin prone to break outs. I've been using it for about a week and I haven't had any break outs so major plus [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product, I'm glad that l got this campaign, l have been looking for a perfect night cream, the only problem is that when l apply this cream on my skin the fragrance is too strong for me, even like that l love how l feel my skin, l have been using it for couple nights already and l recommend this product, it hidratante and its anti age :) how good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never tried a night cream before. I usually would just put a dab of Vaseline on my face and it did the trick. After washing my face, it feels a bit dry. I started using this night cream and my face feels great! Doesn't feel greasy, goes on so smoothly and I only need a very small amount. I've been using it for about a week and I feel like it has helped. Let's see what happens after using it for a month. I'm excited to see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used a night creme before so I was a little hesitant to try this but the clock is ticking on my skin and winter approaches so...I gave it a shot! It goes on smooth, doesn't feel greasy and a little goes a long way. Tonight I'm gong to start using it on the backs of my hands too! I've only had the product a week so not big changes yet but I'm definitely going to continue using it. OH, there is a very light scent but that didn't impact my allergies at all so YAY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it's a great product. I've been using it for almost a week. I can notice a difference in my skin's firmness. The day cream is also nice to use. I am going to implement both in my skin regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I felt a difference in my skin after one night of using the cream. My skin looks and feels great. I suffer from dry skin and L'Oreal night cream has restored moisture to my skin. I highly recommend it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! The night cream was very light, smooth, and had a pleasant and calming smell. It left my face feeling soft and smooth and non-greasy! Even in the morning when I woke up, there were no oily spots, but my face still felt smooth and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Feels very smooth and makes my skin feel wonderful. I would recommend for us ladies nearing fifty. Easy to use. Just a day and night cream you put on a clean face when you get up and when you take off your makeup in the evenings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"...you may not care for this product. I tried it at bedtime but am not used to a scent in my moisturizing cream. I don't like the perfume-y smell of this cream. I can't speak to the claims it makes because I won't continue using it, sadly. I would love an unscented version to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this works nicely, however I didn't see the results I'd hoped for. I applied the night cream at night and the day cream in the morning. My skin felt instantly hydrated but as far as my fine wrinkles and lines it was a no go. I would buy this product for moisturizing but would look elsewhere as far as anti aging regimes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I do like this night cream. It smells better than the day cream. I found a little goes a long way. It feels great on my skin after taking my makeup off for the day. I will continue to use the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The very first thing I noticed about this cream is the scent. Some people aren't a fan of how it smells, but it reminds me of a scent my mother used to wear long ago and I adore it. The cream is very rich, so you don't need to use much to achieve desired effects. When I did use a little too much it felt a bit greasy, but that was fixed simply by adjusting how much I used. This cream makes my skin feel really soft and so far I love it! I hope to keep it as a part of my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't a fan of the smell of the product in the jar, but once on my face it was actually quite nice. It soaked into my skin quickly and wasn't greasy, which is a big plus! Normally when i wake up in the morning, my face is pretty oily. I have combination skin...but the face cream really cut that down! You could barely see any oil on my face! Thumbs up from me! This is staying in my beauty regimen for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I also need to put cream on before bed because I have dry skin but the cream after a while does stay on but with this new night cream I feel so refreshed in the morning, it works great on my dry skin.love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"ii never think about how much important is to take care of my face skin, i start to use the cream and i feel a diference in the texture, color, damagee everything, definitrvly this gonna be my favorite producto forever [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using both of these products for the last two days & nights. I really like the texture of these cremes. They are very creamy and not oily. It drys very quickly also. Has a nice smell & not perfume. I'm excited to see the results of these products & share them with other consumers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Well I haven't had this night Cream for long, but it feels great! I have a hard time with lotions and moisturizer on my face, they tend to make me break out. But so far this one feels nice and light, and my skin feels less tight and dry. As a bonus my little kitty man, Emmett, adores the box! Not sure which one of us is more excited! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say a lot about this night cream. First , when I put it on I felt immediate results.It's very hydrating. Also ,I use the day cream with it . Its the perfect combination. If your looking for eal results try them together and I promise as a user that you wont be disappointed. And,the price s amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never bought any creams to take care of my face and after trying L'oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream last night I fell in love with it! My face and neck felt so fresh and soft after putting it on, the cream texture wasn't thick or greasy and it had a nice smell nothing too strong wich I really liked that. I gotta say that I'm impressed and if you haven't tried this cream yet I would recommend that you do, you won't be disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super hydrating night cream. I'm in my mid 30's so I need a good night cream. I did not like the smell. I found it way too over powering. I also ended up with small red bumps after the first use. I must be sensitive to something in the cream. I do not normally have sensitivity issues so that was strange. Overall I did not care for this night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm in my mid thirties and have combination skin with fine lines starting to appear on my forehead. A lot of aging creams seem heavy and overly perfumed but the Loreal Age Perfect Night Cream was perfect. It absorbed right into my skin and was very lightly scented. I woke up this morning with soft smooth skin that wasn't greasy or oily. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think I'm in love with L'Oreal facial night cream, which left my skin smooth, soft. And this cream is non greasy and absorbed easily. Love it and my skin waking up refreshed ,hydrated and radiant. Never disappointed by this cream and looking forward to see more and more results the next few days. love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream! It made my face feel so smooth. I really like that has a suttle scent. My skin was hydrated by the next day. I have only used it for a few days and can't wait to see more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Love being a BzzAgent and getting to try products, This by far is one of my favorites to try. I really love how smooth my skin looks and feels with just a few days of using the L'Oreal Paris Facial Night Cream. My skin is not dry and looks radiant since i started using Paris Facial Night Cream. Wow the cost is very reasonable also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream. At first, it is a little greasy when you put it on, but it does work. I also used the day cream and loved that one as well. I work at a retail store that sells these products and for the price, it is worth it. I have noticed a difference only after using it 3 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way this felt putting it on. I'm only giving 3 stars because when I signed up for the campaign I didn't realize I would actually be joining it. I think this cream would work a little better on my mother but I will definitely keep trying it out. It's not greasy which is great. The smell is not as strong as the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try this product! It's my 38th birthday next week and my aging skin could use a little love. It is advertised for mature skin but I feel like it's great for all skin. The cream is silky smooth and smells beautiful. It's a very feminine scent, clean and floral. My skin didn't feel oily at all. I will have to post results in a couple weeks but really like this product so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was hesitant to give this a try. I doubt most products that are geared towards aging. But after the first try i could actually feel my skin tighten. It's soothing but not greasy at all. The one thing i didn't like however was the light floral scent. To me it smells like something my grandma would wear. Just because I'm getting older doesn't mean i need to smell like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night Cream is such a great moisturizer! I have extremely dry skin. So to be able to find a moisturizer that will keep my face hydrated throughout the night in incredible! I have finally found a moisturizer that does everything I need in a cream! The search is over! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is lightweight and has a really nice scent. I love how soft my skin feels. It has only been 2 days since I have started using it so I cannot comment on whether or not it has any affects on fine lines. I will report back later once I have used the product longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"it felt nice, and I love the packaging, but I honestly didn't notice any difference other than a (possibly coincidental and unrelated) giant breakout! I was disinclined to use this repeatedly since i broke out so badly after the first time. I wasn't in love with the scent, it just smells like lotion. I think this is intended for older skin than mine, given that it has comments about post-menopause on the tub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After several tries of the night cream I found myself unable to wear it for long. The fragrance was so over powering I found my self having to remove or wipe it off shortly after applying. My skin did feel smooth after removing and makes me wish I could keep it on over night but the fragrance was just so strong I couldn't get past it to get its benefits. If this was available in a fragrance free option would gladly try again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the night cream for a week so far and so far so good, the first couple nights I used it I could feel the skin tightening around my eyes and making me feel like it was shrinking my wrinkles haha. I also love the smell of this lotion for night time it seems calming and doesn't feel greasy so I don't have to worry about getting it on my pillow. The lotion feels smooth and is easy to apply. I will definitely be adding this to my night time regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Tried this last night & I was really impressed this morning. I expected to wake up with my skin super oily but it was actually not. My skin is glowing & feels more firm. It has a nice light scent as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to be honest the night creme caused my skin around my nose to feel like it was burning , and the morning after I used it I had red marks in that area. I haven't used it again as I'm afraid it will damage my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think these products are a miracle in a jar.Ive used the L'Oreal creams now for five days and can see the difference already! Ive had other people ask what Ive been doing for my skin care.I would totally recommend this. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thrilled with this product. I, personally, struggle with finding a nightly cream that isn't as thick as mud and/or doesn't have a horribly strong smell, UNTIL NOW. This night cream does not feel heavy at all and there is a SLIGHT smell, but nothing that I can smell all night long while trying to sleep. My face feels incredibly soft and I've only used it twice so far. Really a great cream for aging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a great way to end my day! I dabbed on this wonderful night cream and gently rubbed into my face and neck. It has a nice scent and it feels good - it is not greasy. I liked the way my skin felt in the morning and there was a slight glow to my face! I will see what (if any) difference I have in a week or two of using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this night cream. The consistency of the actual cream is perfect, the smell is great, and it leaves my face feeling moisturized and protected all night long. I see a difference in the overall look on my face with regards to certain areas that have dryness and discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the night cream. After using my face feels smooth, and soft. And my skin is looking much younger. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't bother me at all. It smells great, it's very heavy and absorbs quickly. I would definitely purchase this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this product and honestly didn't know anything about it before trying it. L'Oreal Paris Perfect Facial Night Cream gave my face the moisture that I now know it was missing. The smooth and clear skin that I had been trying to obtain through using other products, I found it in this cream. It's light and does not require more than a quarter size amount to apply to your face and neck. I will continue to recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to bzzagent I recently had the opportunity to try loreal Paris age perfect night cream. My face has problem areas from dry to oily skin. At night after removing my make up I simply applied the night cream, which literally took a minute. It was that simple. The next day my skin felt firmer and those saggy bags under my eyes were less noticeable. Amazing results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always thought night cream was for my mom, if not my grandma. I don't have wrinkles, so it's not for me. How wrong I was! Just a few nights of using L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream has left my skin hydrated and smooth, with less redness and blotchiness. I love its thick, rich texture and clean, fresh scent. No breakouts to speak of, even with my sensitive skin. I'm a believer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't really express how much I love this stuff. As the days go by and I use it daily, my skin is radiant and smooth and soft. It goes on so silky and moisturizes your face like you wouldn't believe. I'm so happy I got chosen to give my opinion of this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the feel of this night cream. It is light, and makes your skin feel very soft. It has a little bit of a greasy feeling but nothing too major. The scent might be too ""perfumey"" for some. I personally prefer a lighter scent. Overall, it's a nice night cream and works very well for what it's intended for. I'd definitely recommend it to any woman who wants to restore their skin to a more youthful feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this product it makes my skin so soft and shiny. I love the fact it's a big sample Thank you so much. I used it the first day i got it i will tell everyone i know about it actually i already told a few and there going to buy it to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got my bzzz box today and it came at a great time. It's been a rough month and it's definitely taken a toll on my skin. Being it was the evening I tried the night time cream first and I love it so far...doesn't leave any residue like some creams and this feels silky smooth on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So technically this product is for mature skin and I'm only 34. I have really dry skin though and that makes fine lines show up early. After using the night cream just a few times I noticed that my skin was softer and showed less imperfections. What can I say it's a great product from a great company . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
SO this cream is for mature skin which I don't have yet (30yo) but I could feel the difference in the morning! I used it after washing the makeup off my face and went to bed. When I woke up my skin was so soft and firm. This was just from one night I can't wait to see the results in a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A lot of times night creams that are working make my skin feel super tight. This cream so far as left my skin feeling great but I gave it a 4 out of a 5 because the absorb rate is a little slow for me. I have to remember to put the product on maybe 20 minutes before I go to sleep so not to see any residue on my pillow, or I could always try using less of it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use L'Oreal products and I find that they do a good job of what they advertise. I love the feel of the L'Oreal Night cream it feel good on the skin and the product makes my skin very soft and bright. I have also use the Day Cream and that is a very good product too. I like that both of the creams absorbs easily into the skin and neither products are greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Honestly, this could be the best product on the market. I couldn't tell you because I can't get past its smell. It's so strong and it gave me a headache within minutes of wearing it. I washed it off in under 10 minutes. When I tried it again the next time, same thing. I am unable to tell you anything about this product. Loose the smell.

I tried the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night cream last night. I was pleasantly surprised! It had a light scent and much lighter in weight on my face than I expected. It had a coolness to it when rubbed in. I didn't get the tight feeling like I did with the day cream. When I woke up this morning it didn't feel like I had makeup on like the day cream did on through the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream a days ago and I love it! It goes on smooth and light. It smells great and doesn't leave any greasy residue. My skin feels soft and clean in the morning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I washed my face right away so that i could use the night cream. I followed the directions my face felt clean & soft. I woke up & my face was still smooth as if i first applied. I then used the Perfect facial day cream. I applied it then waited 30 minuets and applied my makeup. What a difference. I will be using up the set and buying more.

This is one of the better night creams that I have tried throughout my journey to find what works with my aging skin. Goes on light and clean. After a few days I can notice the difference in the elasticity of my skin and age spots. Great product L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream has a nice thick smooth feel to it with a fresh light scent. It smooths on nice with only a small amount needed and it absorbs fairly quickly. Leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated, a little greasy - but I like that in a night cream. I have extremely dry skin in the winter and this really has helped. Time will tell if it helps with fine lines and age spots. Overall it is a great night cream and I highly recommend you try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product claims to hydrate your skin immediately and I can attest that it does just that. After using it for 24 hours my face feels soft and hydrated. It is creamy and goes on easily. It does have more fragrance than I am used to but that won't stop me from continuing to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's curious that I got a product geared toward mature women over 50 when I am only 32. However, since I love trying new product I was game to try this. After my first night using this cream, I can definitely feel my skin is softer and comfortably hydrated. I especially love that it has a very light scent that doesn't bother you while sleeping. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's hard to find a good night cream that does not leave behind a greasy mess, but L'Oréal has made one. It absorbs lightly into skin and I've noticed the difference right away. Glad to have finally found one I can keep using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received this product and have used it for two nights. So Far, the best thing is that it is not greasy. The cream is light and absorbs quickly. There is no ""greasy"" residue lingering on my hands or face. It is a bit too early to see if it works for saggy skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my first time trying this product and I am so happy with the quick results! I thought the heavy creamy look of it when I first opened the jar was going to be too thick for my face but looks were deceiving!! It goes on more like a serum, it's silky and not heavy at all! Great product and the best part IT WORKS! It makes my large pores not look so terrible!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received the package, and so I thought I would take pictures of opening and my face after the first night cream. I will review after the first day, and review the night cream again if I notice a difference. I do not usually use moisturizer on my face, even though I should. It felt oily this first try, but I am willing to try the whole time of this trial and see if there is a difference. The smell is odd as well. It smells a little too ""perfumey"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Amazing product, great fresh clean smell. I am so satisfied that this did not make my face feel oily at all. I typically would break out. This was not an issue this time. You wake up in the morning with amazing smooth soft silky skin. This is a non greasy product, does not stain your bed sheets. Worth every penny. Please stop and give this a try you may just give up on am old product and have found a new love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin especially in the winter months. I'VE tried TONS of moisturizers, and I don't usually put night creams on because they feel to greasy on my face, but this product is great! It isn't real thick and doesn't have that greasy feel. Ready to try out the day cream next! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! It goes on smooth and it's not greasy. You feel it working right away, which is great. I can't wait to see the results! This is a must try night cream.

Hey everyone! Tonight I got out of the shower and applied the night Cream it was very light and lightly scented I noticed immediately it made my skin very soft so far I love it I have very sensitive skin so fragrance free is definitely a plus also dries and doesn't leave a greasy residue on your skin . I'll be trying the day cream tomorrow morning .. the quality and quanity is very nice also [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I Received It Yesterday Evening And So I Followed Directions And I Also Read Info Online About The 2 Creams. I Used L'Oréal Anti-Sagging and Ultra Hydrating Night Cream Last Night. The Fragrance Is Not Over Powering And Its A Silky Cream. Felt Great On Skin And Absorbed Well. I Woke Up Today And My Skin Looked Good, No Rash Or Redness At All! I Will Give More Info Later After A Week Or So On The Day And Night Creams... Very Happy With This Product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This NIGHT and DAY Cream is like a mini MIRACLE, to me. My skin has always been dry & the aging process has made this worse..UNTIL, I tried this line of product! I feel it myself, and my family notices the difference in my skin!! BRAVO! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and sometimes I break out with certain products. I was very pleased that not only did the night cream actually make my skin soft but I didn't break out at all. Most lotions and creams these days have this strange smell and I expected as much from this, but even the smell that was left was really lovely. Not too strong and nice on the nose. The cream goes on a but thick but after rubbing it in, I can almost feel the softness immediately. Great job L'ORÉAL. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Loreal Age Perfect Night Cream many times and I enjoy the way it makes my skin feel and look. I have used it sporadically in the past but now that I'm turning 51 next week, I plan to use it every night. Lucky for me it is soft but not greasy and it is light enough to sleep in and not break my face out. Good stuff :) So happy to receive my BzzKit today with both the night and the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One word: WOW! I was a bit skeptical thinking that most night creams are heavy, oily, or just a waste of money. This one changed that. It was light and didn't feel like an oily slick. When I woke, my skin felt clean and to me it looked healthy. I didn't see bags under my eyes and my skin felt tight. I was amazed. Way to go L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is a keeper! I am very picky about scents and how cream feel and this one knocks it out of the park. I love the light scent and also how the night cream made my skin soft as could be. I can't wait to see how it works on my dark spots, but so far, I'm more than impressed!

I received my package yesterday and tried the night creme first..it felt so smooth across my skin and when i woke my skin still felt smooth i will try the day creme age perfection today and show results every 4 days on my skin ..i have sent a day one picture of side of myface more pics to come [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that it is contributing to a flare-up of my rosacea. I double-checked the ingredients after waking up several days in a row with bright red cheek patches. No glycolic product, which has caused me problems before. I will continue to use this for another week but if the rosacea flare-up continues I will discontinue use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't like the smell. That's my only con. It smells like older women perfume no offense. I love the cream otherwise! It doesn't feel greasy and when I woke up my skin was soft and there was no residue on my pillow. I absolutely LOVE that the product is filled up to the top. It's going to last awhile and that's great. Love both the day and night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm amazed after one use just how well this product works! My skin was a bit dry from having the heat on in our house- I used this product and my skin felt almost instantly moisturized.

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream! An amazing experience awaits you when using this lovely night cream. I washed my face, to prepare for bed, and applied the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream. Zzzzz. Yes, that means I was sleeping like a baby and awakened in the morning to a feeling that I never felt before. My skin felt tight and soft at the same time. How is that? L'Oreal has figured a way to make us ladies feel fabulous early in the A.M. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never really been fond of night creams that you dont wash off because of them causing skin irritation but this cream has not done that it didn't burn my skin and going into it I was Leary of trying it for overnight. My face feels softer and I have noticed a difference in my skin after just one night of using it. I definetly will recommend this product especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product which overall has made my face feel smoother, however when i first put it on it makes my face tingle. After 30 minutes that seems to go away. Overall my face has felt smoother using the day and not combo. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream smells great! Not oily but moisturizing and a pleasant feeling to my nightly routine. I shall update after a few more uses on any changes to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my kit in the mail today. I just applied the night cream and the very first thing I can say about it is that it smells SO good! It is a very light cream, too - not greasy at all. Honestly I don't usually put creams on my face but so far I love how this product feels! Hopefully it will deliver on the advertised results. I can't wait to try the day cream tomorrow. I hope it feels and smells just as good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I finally received my product today and I started with the night cream. I liked the container it came in. It had a smooth white lid easy to screw open. Looking at the container it didn't look like it would last long. But my initial reaction is completely wrong. The cream is thick so you don't need very much when you use it. My skin feels completely hydrated and it has been 30 min. I can't wait to see how it feels in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this loreal night cream feels amazing on my skin. I don't feel any oily feeling on my skin very soft and smooth. Has a very light clean smell and not overpowering. I am looking forward to using the loreal day cream and seeing the results with as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a really good product. Right after I used it my face felt super soft & I could instantly feel it starting to firm my face up. I can definitely see a difference in the decrease redness on my face. I like that I can use this daily. My face is dry usually & it definitely puts some oils back into my face without it feeling oily. I will definitely continue to use for firming & softening my face on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so excited to try this day and night facial regimen! This is only day one and the cream not only smells wonderful it feels great on my face. Its light and makes my skin feel so soft. I will review more as the days go one but as of right now I would definitely recommend this face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this today and immediately added it in to my nightly regiment. I'm only 40, but have noticed my skin drying excessively lately. It feels very silky to the touch and doesn't make my skin oily at all. I'm looking forward to a week from now when I've used it nightly to see if I break out like I normally do when I use a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is something special it isn't heavy on the skin. I couldn't believe how well it hydrates your skin. I was skeptical because i have tried other face creams and nothing comes close to this! Now, i can't stop touching my face because it is so silky smooth. I am definitely sold on this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great moisturizer! It gives my skin a silky feeling when I wake up in the morning.

"So let me start off by saying, I was not one to use night creams on a daily basis. Yes, I had good intentions but never quite lived up to them! Enter L'Oréal Perfect Night cream. My 42 year old skin must have sighed in relief! This night cream is thick and luxurious. After washing my face the cream just soaks in and feels fabulous. I have sensitive skin and it does not cause any irritation. I go to bed at night feeling like I've just fed my skin and it is happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I am going to try the day cream too. I am really seeing some results around my mouth. I am enjoying this product. I would really like to try out other products too. Thanks again for letting me participate! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is such a luxurious cream. It makes my skin feel good and looks a lot smoother. I literally can see my face looking younger and the tiny lines and wrinkles either softened, or gone! What's not to love about it?! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try my first sample that I actually unwrapped it like a Christmas present, super fast. All I have to say is wow . For one thing it was bigger then I expected it to be. I am just in love with the facial cream. The texture feels thin so all you can think is oh yeah just another lotion. But no I put it on to test it out and immediately my skin was really soft. I am starting to receive my wrinkles now that I am getting a bit older so I am glad this product is catching them early. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I put on the Facial Night Cream this evening and it feels so soft on my skin. It was very creamy and felt very smooth to go on. I cannot wait to try the Day Cream in the am. I really think this product will do exactly what it says it will do- I want it to tone my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'Oreal Age Perfect Night Cream is fantastic! I normally only use a day cream but since using this- I will continue to put this in my nightly routine! It's lightweight but left my skin feeling silly smooth. The jar is large enough for at least 2 months! There was no residue on my pillows and I woke up with my skin as soft as the night before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
All I can say is WOW. My skin is usually dry by the end of the day but this night time cream has done wonders. My face is so soft & the cream also smells great. I definitely recommend this night cream & I plan to buy more of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm really a fan of how this night cream works. My skin can get so dry during the winter, but this night cream really moisturizes my skin and makes it look & feel soft. I also love that the scent of this cream is delicate and pleasant. Plus, it absorbs into my skin quickly without leaving any oily residue, so my pillows stay clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the night cream for the first time, and must say it felt light on my skin, non-greasy, & a nice mild fragrance. Considering I have super oily T-zone, this made the shine go away, and gave that clean feeling. Definitely a hydrating moisturizer, I will review the Anti-aging part after using it for a while. For now, it's a keep for sure!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I am wowed by both of these products I have so enjoyed them my skin feels absolutely amazing. I would recommend these products to all. Thank you so much for letting me try them out wow love them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"If you have sensitive skin and/or combination skin and you are having trouble with dry patches that will not go away, then this night cream is for you. It is non-greasy, yet moisturizers very well. Little to no scent ; I have sensitive skin and prefer creams with little to no fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a nice cream. My skin feels great after using it. Despite Walmart Savings Catcher error..... no lower price found, This product is overpriced in Walmart. I found it for under $9.00 online with many other products o could easily add to order for free shipping."
"I really like this product. It's very creamy and doesn't feel greasy and does a good job of moisturizing my skin. My only complaint would be that it has a strong fragrance that disrupted my sleep the first night. However, I got used to it very quickly and use it every night. I would give this product 5 stars if it were fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of the best night-time moisturizers that I've found so far. What I liked best about it is that it is that it doesn't have a perfumey scent and is also non-greasy. This product goes a long way so don't use too much or it might become cakey. I'll definitely purchase it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I highly recommend the Night Cream Age Perfect Moisturizer to all women who are still searching for a product that works for a mature skin. After a week of using this product, I felt the amazing result of waking up with a smoother skin and it truly helped with the fine lines on my face, age spots is truly less visible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this cream on my 60+ face for the past few weeks with wonderful results. I smooth it on over my freshly washed face and it glides over my skin. My skin feels silky and looks refreshed and clear in the morning when I get up. The cream has very little scent which is great for me because I am allergic to most scents. I would definitely recommend it not only for mature skin but for anyone who wants to keep silky smooth skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very skeptical that this night cream would perform as well as it does. My skin is very hydrated and looks very refreshed when I wake in the morning. It also has the appearance of less sagging. I am using it with the age perfect day cream SPF 15. I would definitely buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can not go to bed without night cream on my face and neck. I wake up every morning to soft skin after using this product. I'm glad to see a product for us ""over 50"" women. The more brands cater to us the better!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Gave 5 stars because realized I have been going out more without makeup and feeling good. Little blush and lipstick because my face actually looks better without makeup now. it went on with a slight heavy feeling but did absorb quickly and my skin appeared more supple and toned the next morning. Used this product for 3 weeks before reviewing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a luxurious great smiling product. My skin looks dewy and small pored. A lovely result for 66 year old skin. I found that I needed 3 weeks to see improvement. So, keep applying as instructed and enjoy your beautiful skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great product. Applied this at night before bed. My skin appears somewhat better with some fading of dark spots and just a more radiant appearance to my skin. The only complaint I have is the fragrance. I would have preferred fragrance free or to have it toned down a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very satisfied with this night cream. I have been using the Age Perfect for Mature skin Day and Night cream for over 2 weeks and can already see and feel results. It goes on silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. I definitely recommend. As for the sagging, I am not positive it has helped but I do feel my skin appears to have more elasticity. I will keep using and review again after a couple of months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked using Age Perfect's Night Cream in combination with the day cream. They made moisturizing my face a simple process and I felt like my skin was a little firmer after using it for just a few days. I am still using both products and will buy new jars of each when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Hello, I really love the deep Hydration of the overnight cream. I have not seen a big difference in my sagging skin, or age spots. The smell is I think should be a lavender smell since it is a night cream. But overall I do like the way it makes my skin feel and not greasy and does not leave an oily feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the way it absorbed quickly into my skin. It left my skin, soft and glowing. It still felt soft in the morning. The only thing I wish could be changed is the strong scent. I would like little or no scent like the day cream has. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Now that I'm in my mid 50s, my skin is so much drier and this always feels so nurturing when I put it on at night. I was very eager to try it because I really love all the Age Perfect products I've tried. This one didn't disappoint and my skin feels so much better when I wake up now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i was using a VERY expensive product for two years and was quite satisfied. However, I had the chance to try Age Perfect and my skin feels much firmer and resilient. I am going to continue to use this night cream rather than order more of the brand that was twice as expensive. My only criticism is the fragrance, it is much too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this moisturizer, not heavy at all. My skin feels plump in the morning. Although I don't have many wrinkles, the little ones around my eyes are smoothing out and my eyes seem to feel lifted. I will continue to use this product; very happy with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Using Age Perfect Night Cream was a very satisfying experience - the cream went on smoothly and disappeared into my skin without a lot of rubbing. The smell was really very nice not mediciney like some of the more expensive brands. After using it for a few weeks, I noticed my lines were softter and my spots were starting to fade. At this rate, my lines and spots will disappear within a few more weeks. Really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this cream. It's light but really does a good job. My skin felt wonderful after I put it on and I woke up in the morning with a fresher looking face. I don't have age spots so I can't offer anything on how it works with them. I do know that it didn't take a lot to cover my face and neck and the scent was very pleasant. I was very pleased with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample of the Age Perfect Night Cream to try and review. This night cream was amazing! When applied it soaked right into my skin and truly hydrated it.

"I was pleasantly surprised after discovering the cost of this cream. It feels so luxurious and creamy that I thought it must be very expensive. I was thankful to review this product and can see and feel some improvement in my skin tone. It doesn't take much of the product to cover well, so it's a bargain in that sense. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i have been using ROC products at night for many years. I feel this moisturizer works better for many reasons. It absorbs quickly, with a fresh clean smell, and my skin is still moisturized in the morning. It does not seem to exfoliate at all, so if I continue to use I will need to find another product for this purpose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Age perfect night cream is perfect for my ageing facial skin. My skin is radiant the next morning , smooth and wrinkles deminished.I wouldnt use any night cream but age perfect for my sensitive skin. Love age perfect!In the past i have tried other face creams but since i have started useing age perfect, its the only cream that i will buy."
"I don't have ""mature"" skin, but I have extremely sensitive skin that gets dry and flaky in the winter months, and breaks out with most thick creams. This is the BEST face cream I have ever used. Thick, moisturizing, and it leaves my face so soft. My husband noticed the difference in texture and a co-worker noticed the change in my skin's appearance and asked why I was glowing! This product dramatically changed my skin... I would upload a photo as proof. I wish I could buy this by the gallon!"
great price for a nice night cream. it works well and moisturizes well my skin.
