"I just wanted to say thank you for your great products! I have been using Regenerist for a couple of years and noticed a difference. Last month I changed to Total Effect 7 night firming cream and really saw a difference. However....last night, someone I haven't seen in a little over a month asked me if I had a face lift!!!! I couldn't believe my ears! At my age, a compliment like that is REALLY appreciated! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!"
Very good quality. The cream is cool to the touch and makes your skin feel almost a smooth as silk. I use it on my hands too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Every day
"Total Effects Night Firming Cream was the only product I ever used that showed visible change overnight. The first night, and every night after, the results were unbelievable. I can't wait each night to use this product. The eye area showed reduced, to no lines and puffiness. I saw an overall lift in my face the very first morning after using this product the night before. Wow, keep up the good work and research!!!"
"I was skeptical of Olay's claims for firming--after all, I've tried much more expensive products without much luck, so what hope did Olay have? But, I tried it. And I couldn't believe my eyes--in just a few days, my jaw was visiblly firmer. The product works wonderfully, and I've replaced a total of four products with this one single night cream. What an incredible value for the money! I'm inspired to try other Olay products now. I have truly never been so delighted with a skin care product. Thank you Olay!!!!!"
"I've been using olay products for over 2 years and my favorite is the night firming cream. i have a more even skin tone, with a brighter and healthy glow. it may sound cliche, but it is the truth - nobody believes i am over 50. i have been complimented on the smoothness of my face!! thanks to olay!! pleeeeze, don't ever go away!!"
"My Mom is the one who gave tis product to me. I was like ""OK Thanks"" I'll try it. Well I did and EVERYONE tells me how beautiful my skin is! Now I use it as well as other OLAY products on a daily basis. It is the best. Compared to the higher priced brands - it wins hands down for me. Thank you OLAY!"
Use it every night as my beauty ritual. Creates a smooth and soft finish to my skin. No greasy or heavy feeling. Very creamy and absorbent.
"I've used this product for years, it's the only one that doesn't break my face out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I follow the instructions in the container, good product and Great price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The clean smell is amazing. The results are great. You should also try the lotion. Same clean scent
"I have been using Olay for over twenty years. I also try many other pricey brands and after a few months I just want my Olay back. I use the sops, night cream, illuminous cream, daily cream ,eye cream,etc. Olay 7 still ranks for me"
I purchased the Total Effects Night Firming Cream to try a month before my 15 year class reunion. Within a couple of weeks I started noticing a substantial difference in the firmness and beauty of my skin! I am still using it to this day! Buy it and try it now!
Good product. Moisturizes and makes skin smooth and soft.
My face started to sting as soon as it went on. Giving it 1 star only because you have to in order to post a review.
I have a dark spot on my face and I've been using this for 2 weeks and I can already see the dark spots going away my skin looks great and brighter
"I love this facial cream - I know it is advertised as a night cream, but I use it in morning as my daily moisturizer. I am only able to find it now at Walmart and the ordering process was easy and delivery occurred 8 days ahead of time."
"Often I try a skin care product and just give up after a while because it doesn't make that much of a difference. This product, however, is fabulous and I just finished my first jar. The benefits were noticable within a few days. I highly recommend it."
"I purhased Total Effects Night Firming Cream some time ago and used it on a rotating basis with other products in my ""aresenal"" Olay and otherwise. Recently I decided to stick to one product for day and one for night to get a truer idea of what they could do for me. My nighttime choice was TEFNC and I have been getting nothing but compliments on my appearance, rested, relaxed, happy etc....I think it's the night cream!"
"I like OLAY products very much! And recommend this cream to my friends! It is so easy: apply before sleeping and in the morning my scin is soft and goodlooking!I use night firming cream when the weather is cool or windy, when its hot, I usually use night firming moisturiser!"
Find it to be a bit drying and no moisture to my skin. Won't reorder.
Felt really creamy to the touch but left a film on my face and never really absorbed in my skin.
Great shopping experience. Quick delivery. Thank you for free gift!
All round happy with the product
I noticed a difference after using this product. My skin especially on my neck was firmer and overall am very pleased.
"The product promises: "" Instantly evens skin tone appearance and Instantly reduces the look of dark spots"". I have been using it for months now, and dark spots are completely unchanged. Just an ordinary moisturizer. I'd ;like my money back please."
"Even though I'm not even 30 yet, I've began to use this cream a few a week since before I was 25 and my skin gets smooth every time. This review was made to enter a #contest, however, the cream is spectacular"
I always feel so fresh and clean when I use this product. The smell is wonderful and it leaves my face feeling smooth and silky. I hate to wash it off in the morning.
I love this! It has helped my acne scars fade. I have super sensitive skin and breakout immediately with most products but since using this I have felt my skin so moisturized and no acne yet! I Love Olay products and this paired with the Cleansing wipes have made my life 10X Better
"I used this product for a few years. I dab it on around my eyes before bed. It tightens the skin around the eyes. I feel like it helped reduce any puffiness or wrinkling around my eyes. Also, I AVOID THE SUN! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this forever and I will never stop. This is an amazing product. You will look and feel years younger! My daughter thought I looked so young that she started using it too! She's slso been using it forever now!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Through the years my mother used only Olay products with great results. Into old age she received many compliments. I started young and see only improvements in the products I use. A busy real estate agent I need to look and feel my best. Olay is my friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"saw improvement on elasticity of my skin and the minimizing of wrinkles, specially around my eyes, neck and mouth. I love that it not oiling and the it make my complexion better. Thank Olay. your are my one facil product that i use ans will never change you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The formula change ruined this product! I assumed it was the same but then began to notice my skin isn't the same! Dark spots are more noticeable, skin tone is uneven. This product is now just an expensive OK moisturizer with no benefits that justify the price. Now I need to start the search for another brand even though I've been a loyal fan for many many years."
"My review is long overdue. This product used to be so good but it no longer works on my skin after formula change last year. The previous formula sank in, skin glowed, next day face glowed. gradually cleared up uneven skin tone. But after formula change, the very moment I noticed that it was not sinking in and stayed oily on my skin. It makes my face oily and even worse uneven skin tone is back. Please fix. I am huge olay fan."
I could not believe the change in my face even after one use. Washing my face and going out in the sun year after year left me looking not like the woman I would like. Florida has that way about it. I started using this and I feel a lot better about my looks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started to use this skin care kit and after a few days thought not working but after about three weeks I started to notice smoother firmer skin.I was so Happy with m y results I called my sister and told her about the product then I called my friends lol.Now every one our ages will have smoother firmer skin Thank you Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have incredibly sensitive skin and am often hesitant to try night creams. This treatment truly feels so luxurious going on and I wake with an equally great feeling. I would definitely recommend this product as a dependable beauty ritual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product does every thing it states it does. from reducing the appearance of fine lines, gives skin a firmer look,Helps balance , helps balance skin tone, helps with dryness, gives skin a healthy-looking glow. I think this is one of the best products Olay has to offer. I use it faithfully. I even went and bought some for my mom so she could use it. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this cream, after about one week you can start seeing a difference. I been using it for 2 month now and it really shows now. Worth the money compare to some of does night creams that cost so much more. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The name basically says it all. I am a stressed out 48year old woman and before I started using the Total Effects Night Firming Cream, my age was quite obvious. Now all my friends keep asking me if I got Botox injection or a min face lift. When I tell them that this is the only product I'm using, they are amazed. I tell them try it for awhile and let me know what they think. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love everything about this whole line of products. They are gentle on the skin, make mine totally soft and luminous looking, which is not easy on 62 year old skin. Although helped by the hiding from sun for 50++ years*!* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found the night cream to be very smoothe and applies easily . The scent is mild and has a non irritating texture. I could easily feel the facial skin becoming softer and more noticeable when I wear it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the night firming creme-so many other products leave the face/neck area feeling tacky or like you are wearing a film over your skin. this total effects product goes on smoothly and absorbs right in. Not only does it feel good but my skin looks improved by morning! The fine lines are going away and the skin feels plumped up and looks noticeably younger. Extremely happy with the results so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As I get older (62) my skin is losing some elasticity but this serum really helps put the oomph back into my skin. A 40-year-old man recently asked me how I kept my skin looking so young. No better 'review' than that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is by far one of my favorite products. I use it at night after applying the Regenerist eye roller. Between these two products, when I wake in the morning, there is a noticeable difference in my whole face. Skin is tighter and eyes are not puffy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The lifting cream has amazing features that give you the results you are craving. I felt the results immediately! The cream is smooth and rich with that hint of luxury you expect. Blends effortlessly. Be prepared to indulge yourself because you will see a definition in previous sagging jaw and fewer fine lines [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Night Firming Cream in the PM and Moisturizer in the AM....two very important products for me. I use Night Firming Cream every night and have for the last 10-12 yrs. Always looking for products on sale when I can buy one and get one. Thank You Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I always use this product,and I love it.every night i clean my face and apply this product.almost more than five years i am using this product.i try lots of other product but for me this is a best one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this in the evening before bed. When I wake up in the morning my face seems dewy and illuminating. It's great if you need to moisturize. The product goes on smoothly and has a pleasant fragrance [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Total Effects Night Firming Treatment is really great! It has an awesome,light fragrance and is very effective. When you use it, it feels like you're really doing something nice for yourself. It is light and pure, which is important to someone like myself, who suffers from rosacea. This product would be exceptional for any skin-types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In general I was pleased with this product. I have sensitive skin and I had no negative reaction. The product felt nice on my skin and it seemed to give me with a well rested look. No, I didn't look as if I had a facelift, but I didn't expect that either. For the price I think it's a high value product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Oil of Olay for many years. I have tried other expensive products and always seem to return to Oil of Olay. This product helps with my deep wrinkles better than any other product I have tried. Highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, this product acts like a great moisturizer in the PM hours. Not sure of the firming ability, that's why I rated 3 stars. My daughter, age 25, has very dry skin and she loves this product for it's moisturizing effect. Nice light cream that sinks into the skin like the entire Total Effects line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Olay's Regenerist for the past two years and recently began purchasing Total Effects. I love this! The Total Effects is something that I am sticking to. I am very pleased with this. I love the scent and the way my skin feels in the morning is nothing compared to what Regnerist left me with. Thanks Olay!
This lotion is just amazing! It has a slight smell but it's not overpowering (I'm a migraine sufferer so am very sensitive to scents and this doesn't bother me). This lotion absorbs quickly but I do take the time to massage it in. My skin is just glowing in the morning! I highly recommend this product!
"First time I purchase a olay product must say my skin and I are totally impressed. The minute I massaged it on my face I felt the firmness and softness. The next morning my skin felt soft and had a refresh look, I love it, I also bought other olay products due to the extensive research about lotions/creams, and olay was always number 1. I haven't tried the other products yet, but will post results as i use them."
I love this product! My skin feels so soft and smooth in the morning. I like to take my time and message the night cream deep into my skin. I feel that taking two minutes longer and really take the time to message the cream deep into your pores makes a big difference when you see the results in the future. I just love oil of olay!!
"""provides 7 anti aging benefits in 1 product all while you sleep"" Problem is that it is so heavily scented that it keeps you awake and you are unable to sleep. Had to get up and wash it off. So no idea how the product actually performs. The Daily moisturizer comes in an unscented version. Why would this not also be true for the night cream? Why would a NIGHT firming cream need to be scented? Who are you trying to impress while you are sleeping?"
"I have been using one of the ""EXPENSIVE"" creams for awhile now as well as my mom. We both decided to try the OLAY products. I am amazed to say the least by the results of this cream. Absorbs easily, fresh clean scent. I swear it has taken years offf my face. I do tend to break out easily and I have had NO breakouts. Thank you so much OLAY. If anyone out there is hesitant dont be. My mom prefers the Regenerist line. I am in love.......with this particular line. I cant say enough. It delivers what it says."
"I have a combination skin type, it's dry but also oily sometimes. I just started using it a week ago and I love this product. It feels so good in my skin, it lighten my face, smells good but the bad thing, it makes my face oily when I wake up in the morning. Still I will continue to use this coz I really like the result. I can take oily face just when I wake up, everyone washes their face when they wake up in the morning anyway."
It absorbs quickly on skin which I like. No sticky feeling
have not noticed any difference so far...time will tell!
I have been using this for two weeks.. The skin toned has evened out and you can definitely see the difference from before. The skin feels firmer than before.
I love Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Night Firming Cream. It really moisturizer my face and I wake up with my skin still feeling great and look ready to start the day.
I REALLY need the old formula. I'd been using all olay products before the formula change for over 16 years. Now I can't find something that gives the same results on my skin. PLEASE bring back the old formula.
