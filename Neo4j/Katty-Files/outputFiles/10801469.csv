"I've tried many different ache medicines ,but most of them were too aggressive and my face was almost all ways super dry and irritated. Another problem would be that some were really watery and would wash off with sweat and then burn my eyes really bad but this was the perfect bottle of face medicine I've have ever found it never dried my face and never got in my eyes yet .so I would say i cant live without this liquid gold."
"This product does moisturize and it does not cause breakouts - at all. If you need a moisturizer and are exasperated trying to find one that does not cause varying degrees of acne, give this a go."
"I am from South Africa. I have a terribly oily skin with breakouts and black spots on face. I have been using the moisturizer for two weeks now, and my skin is clearer than ever before. I am more confident now."
I would definitely recommend this product.
"This product is the best! It's the only moisturizer that has 100% worked for me and is great for acne! 1 or 2 pumps is all you need. 3 is good when your skin is breaking out (maybe not if you have sensitive skin). With this product, my skin is almost perfect now and I've been using it less than a week!!!"
So im in my 20's and i suffer from acne. I was always on the look for a product that would do its job. But i never got it right. Until one day i came along this right here. I started to see the difference within the first week . My skin was soft hydrated but not oily which is a big deal. And i started to see my acne reduce significantly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best moisturizer I've tried. This pump is great, no mess, and it absorbs quickly without a greasy feeling. Skin is left quite soft without the nasty peeling most salicylic acid products cause."
I really wanted to give this product a 5 because I love the Clean & Clear line. It broke my skin out more and it's suppose to prevent pimples. It does smell good and it did keep my face hydrated when I was using it but it made my pimples bigger and my face red. It just irritated my skin and made my more self-conscious. I think they really need to come up with another formula to actually prevent pimples and make one for sensitive skin. I no longer use this product.
I started using this when I was 22 and I am now 30. It has cleared my skin. I had pretty bad acne and I can now say I have great skin. It keeps me clear of breakouts and keeps me moisturized throughout the day without feeling greasy. When I put it on daily it sort of helps exfoliate the skin a bit because of the salicylic acid in it. Please do not stop making this product. It is a holy grail for me.
"I have a weird type of skin. I have sensitive skin but yet most stuffon my skin doesn't break me out except for Neutrogena grapefru it cleaning wipes, this moisturizer, and Halloween cheap makeup. When I put it on my face or starts to tingle nor really bad but it's there. It's for the most part moisturizing but I wish it had spf in it."
"This is a nice moisturizer for summer! Even at age of almost 61 I have a very oily t zone, and this is light and effective enough!"
"I have been using this product for many years. I use it to moisturize my face each morning after I shower. It has always worked well, and it is the only product I use."
"Pore clogger!!!!!!! If you have acne prone skin this product with be absolute trash for you! Has a terrible chemical smell, it IS a comedogenic and I can't stress that enough!!! After it clogs your pores it will cause your face to sweat, and absolutely CAUSES breakouts!! Please do NOT put this product on your face!!!"
"I have used this moisturizer for years. Occasionally I will try another moisturizer but then always go back to this. I love the way this makes my face feel so fresh (almost a light tingle). I don't really have sensitive skin or struggle with many breakouts, but think this is such a good product that I use it anyway. I do have slightly oily skin so I like that it is oil free. I also am shocked that it doesn't burn my eyes as other moisturizers sometimes can. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was hesitant at first to try this moisturizer because I was afraid it would irritate my skin since it targets acne but I'm so glad I gave it a try! It was just what I was looking for: a light moisturizer that does not leave a residue. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all! Plus I love how it leaves your skin with a fresh and clean cooling feeling after application. It also has a fresh floral scent which is nice. Overall I love this product and would recommend it for daily use!
I love using this product I've been using it for a few years after I was my face before i do my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I read a couple of reviews about this product and everyone says ""wow its amazing"" ""It doesn't break me out"" .... so i decided to try it out. WOW! my forehead was with those little pimples that you cant even notice so i try it one night. I wake up the next morning-- GONE! everything was gone. The best part of it is that it leaves your skin feeling so soft and fresh. THIS REALLY WORKS AND DOES NOT BREAK OUT! I LOVE IT!"
"I haven't ever really used a moisturizer before until a few years ago. I have always had really oily skin and figured that a moisturizer would make me break out. But, in winter my skin started getting so dry and itchy I couldn't stand it any longer. So, luckily clean and clear dual moisturizer was the first product I tried and I absolutely love it. It's light, doesn't break my skin out, and it makes my skin tingle! Not to mention how soft my skin is. Thank you for such an awesome product clean and clear!"
"I am in my 50's and still come back to this product, the 0.5 salicylic acid is just high enough to keep my skin soft and smooth. It is better than clinique's turnaround cream. And the price is great. I use this at night, if using during the day remember there is no SPF in it."
"I never used a moisturizer before since i have oily skin, but i decided to try this since it said it was oil free and treats pimples. I got SO much more than I expected! It clears up my face in like, one day, and it left my skin GLOWING!! Also, i have these weird lines on my forhead even though im only 23, I figured i would just have them forever, but they dissapeared after just a few days of using this!! I totally recomend it especially if you have oily skin like me!!"
"I've never come across something that works as well as this. Other things similar to this dry out my skin, leave a thin white film, smell bad, or have a strange consistency. This stuff is awesome! It's gentle, although effective (X12!!!), and soothing as well. I would recommend this to anybody, of any skin type."
"I have used this stuff for over a year now. I put it on about twice a day. I have oily skin so I was worried moisturizer would make my skin super oily and shiny, but this stuff doesn't. It helps to keep my skin smooth and soft and it helps prevent acne."
"I have been using this product for 2 weeks now, i didn't expect it to work straight away. I expected more spots to come because it's a new product. I got alot more acne on my cheek and around my mouth, chin, nose and forehead where i applied it. It's still all there so the reducing spots property doesn't work and the worst thing i get dry skin around my mouth and chin and i apply it every morning and every morning it does nothing and stays dry. What a waste of money."
I have tried many moisturizers that in conclusion made my skin more oily and even made me breakout. Even The popular Aveno moisturizer did no good. When I saw this product and the fact that it says oil-free I knew I had to give this a shot. I have been using this product for 3 months now and it has yet to disappoint me! It has salicylic acid and once I put it on it gives a ool touch leaving my skin oil free. The best part is that it doesn't make me Breakout! I love this stuff and will continue to use it
I put this on my face before bed and it started to tingle and burn which was kind of painful. The next morning I woke up and had a huge red rash all over my face and it itched really bad. Luckily I washed my face with Clean and Clear morning burst and put Benadryl cream or however you spell it on my face and it slowly went away before school.
my skin is a combo of oily and dry so i was always scared to try a Moisturizer cause im prone to breakouts in my T-zone but this is great. it cotrols my oil zones but keeps the dry parts soft! my skin has never looked better and i can skip all the makeup now!
"Well, I have dry skin and I was looking for a product to moisturize my skin and to also help my breakouts. This Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer definetly helped my with my dry skin issue, however, I still had many pimples, and I think that even more pimples have appeared on my face since I started using it! I will continue to use the product to see how it works out, (mostly cause I checked on the Web, and most people posted good reviews) but I'll see how it goes. So far, not TOO impressed, but I don't hate it."
"Clean & Clear is an amazing brand, don't get me wrong, but this moisturizer was horrible (for me, anyways). When I put it on, it literally burned. I couldn't even stand to have it on. In the spot where I put it, I broke out. This surprised me, because I'm not usually one to break out. I was very disappointed with this, as Clean & Clear products usually work wonders on my skin. I don't know if it's just me or what. I know it works on my sister, I guess it's just not for everyone."
"Within 2 weeks, I started to get compliments on my skin. I had less bumps, red spots, etc. I've used this, and the 3 in 1 face wash, for years now. I tried another product (Aveen Positively Radient) and within 2 weeks my face broke out. I quickly went back to Clean and Clear. Thank goodness I found what works for me."
I absolutely LOVE this product. This moisturizer totally saved my skin. I suffer from severe acne and I have tried every single product you could imagine and I finally found the perfect moisturizer. This cleared up my skin in just a week and left my skin feeling and looking smooth. Amazing results.
This moisturizer is the holy grail. It keeps your skin smooth and flawless. The formula is super light and oil free so it won't clog your pores. It doesn't take much product to cover your entire face so the bottle lasts forever. I've been using this multiple times a day for years and I won't be stopping anytime soon. I don't know what I'd ever do if they stopped making this product.
"I have been using Clean & Clear for most of my adult life. The moisturizer is my favorite, BUT what happened to the moisturizer with sunscreen????? I do not want to use two products, so hopefully this product will be back very soon, or I will have to go elswhere."
"This moisturizer makes my skin look and feel awesome! Soft, smooth, and supple, while also controlling and preventing breakouts. There's not really any noticeable fragrance, though. I wish there was an SPF version of this for use during the day, but I use this moisturizer (usually) at night. :)"
"This product moisturized my skin without having me break out. I have very dry skin and I tried out so many different moisturizers but every time I would use one, I would wake up with a bunch of little whiteheads all over my nose and face. When I found out about this one I went straight to the store to buy it and I noticed that my acne was getting clearer because of the medication in this moisturizer. This is the only moisturizer that not only moisturized my face with no tacky residue, but also helped clear my acne."
"My face wash I use from clean and clear dries out my skin very bad to the point of dry patches all over my skin, but if I put this on right after I cleanse my face I don't have that problem. Plus, the tingly feeling it gives me helps with waking me up in the morning. Unlike most moisturizers it doesn't make my skin feel oily, but yet my skin still feels moisturized."
I started using this product like 2 weeks ago and I felt like it was doing the job until my skin started feeling like chalk and I thought it was normal for it to like burn after you apply it. Anyways after it felt chalky it started to get super red and super itchy. I thought ok ill use it once a day. Every time I put it on it burned like heck. Couldnt even put baby lotion on my face without my skin burning. Never again
I have no or hardly any acne and my skin is blemish free. I have used this product regularly for a long time . I have t-zone skin and my face does not have excess oil because of the lotion. it gives my skin the moisture it needs to stay young and healthy looking. I love it.
"For years I have been trying to prevent blemishes. Most products I have used dried out my skin, and so this lotion was a nice change. The lotion doesn't sit on top of the skin. I can feel it shrinking my pores. Great for the face after a shower or in the morning."
"I love love LOVE this moisturizer! For a while, I couldn't use any kind of moisturizer because my face would get irritated. But I bought this moisturizer and it doesn't bother my face at all. My face glows and looks amazing after I use it. Sure, I still have acne, but it's very rarely and the moisturizer helps a lot!!!! I also recommend the ACNE TRIPLE CLEAR Cleansing Clay Mask. It's great."
"I would not reccomend this product for anyone who has dry skin, as it left me with dry patches! It also did provoke some pimples to arise, and I'm not the type to get acne. However I'm sure everyone person's skin type is different, so I maybe give it a try but don't have high expectations. With that being said, I do not regret using this product as it has taught me that my skin needs an oil-based moisturizer and is very sensitive."
"I have oily skin with a couple of dry, rough, sensitive patches. This moisturizer helped so much with calming the itchy, burning sensation that comes with having dry patches on your face. And when it comes to my oily skin, it didn't make me over shiny or oily looking! But a plus to this is after you fully rub it into your skin it has a nice cooling and fresh sensation."
"Ive suffered with very picky skin since I was young. To the point my face was always red, dry and peeling because moisturizers I used would burn or didn't work. Clean and clear is the best and only moisturizer I'll use. It makes my skin super soft and keeps it clear too."
"I love this sooooo much!! It doesn't have a bad smell and I use it every night. With other products I had to put another layer on to help my skin not look dry, and later it would make it look oily.But this doesn't!! For me it doesn't help clear my pimples up though. Thanks for making such an awesome product!! I 101% recommed this for your daily moisturizer."
I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have super dry skin around my nose & mouth area around the winter & sometimes the summer. I use this every time after I'm done washing my face because it tends to be very dry. This lotion soothes my dry skin & really moisturizes it without it leaving a greasy/oily residue on my skin. It's perfect. It lasts me a good month and I always make sure to get more when I run out. The price is super great too compared to other face moisturizers.
Not sure why but i love this product. I have probably used it for over 10 years. Its just the right amount of moisture my skin needs. Plus it keeps my breakouts low.. when i stop using it and start using high end moisturizer is when i break out.. also love the astringet that is orange colored. my skin is normal to oily.
"This product seems like it does the job after you wash your face, but the combo of toner and moistourizer doesn't work. It made my skin EXTREMELY dry and papery, along with the fact that it caused many many breakouts on my face. It burns and does the exact opposite of what it claims to do. It's supposed to help acne and moistoirize your skin; it dries up my skin and caused breakouts."
I have been using this for the past two years and I love it I use it after I use my spot cleanser in the morning and after I was my face with water before bed this works amazingly I noticed that once I put it on a spot it almost instantly reduces redness and recently I have started getting spots on my back from stress and I started using this on them and my spot have reduced in size and the redness has gone Omg Love I could not tell u how much more amazing this is!
I use this product in my everyday skin care routine but I started experiencing dryness and a burning sensation after each application. I bought it to treat dryness and pimples as recommend however it made my skin worse than it was before I started using the product. I have combination skin and the product however did help with the oiliness in my T-zone area.
I decided to buy this one because it says it prevents pimples!! And in the first week of using it i have gotten 3 pimples!! When my face was all clear!!! I am so mad because of course nobody likes pimples on their face!!!! This is disappointing since i have to waste my money on this product that doesnt work!!
"I love how it greats rid of my acne really fast but it leaves my skin really dry and I have rash now. Not so much a moisturizer but still does its job I don't have oily skin after I apply it. I usually apply it before going to bed after I wash my face. Or in the morning after I wash my face then apply make up. Now im looking for a daliy moisturizer with spf and I have sensitive skin, acne, and a combination of oily and dry skin as well."
I have tried various non-comodogenic moisturizers till date and nothing worked like this .. It doesnt flare ur skin up .. moisturizes it ..doesnt make it oily after a couple of hours and definitely fights future break-outs ..i have been using this for a couple of weeks now ..and i will continue this product for ever ... Thanks for this CLEAN AND CLEAR.Love this moisturizer! P.S : i use this after clean and clear 3 in 1 foaming face wash . The could have been bcoz of this combination.
"Lately, since it's so dry where I live, my face has been very dry. The first time I used this, my face felt so moisturized and fresh. It has cleared a lot of my mild acne up even though it has a very low amount of acne medicine in it. Once it's on your face, it has a tingly feeling. This product is great to use with the blue detoxifying morning burst cleanser. I really recommend it!"
"I tested it on my hands, but I applied on both hands' backs. It made my hands have red spots. Even worse, even though I stopped applying it, I used Johnson baby cream. But my hands somehow developed resistance for all such products! My hands keep burning. It's awful. I wish I ahd read these reviews before I bought it!"
Before I used this product I used a different moisturizer and wasn't that satisfied with it. It made my face greasy and oily. I wanted to try a different moisturizer so I pick up this one to go along with my other products. The first time I used it I loved it! My face was very soft after using this product! It doesn't leave my face looking oily or greasy. It is very light on your skin and doesn't clog my pores. I use it daily and love it!
"This product serves it's basic purpose of moisturizing, but it is way too harsh for my sensitive skin. It literally feels like it's burning my skin and i'm afraid it's doing more damage than good. It makes my skin look oily and since my skin gets super dry, it doesn't seem to moisturize it very well. I was pretty disappointed in it."
"I have extremely dry skin and this lotion moisturizes really well. I use it after I wash my face at night and a couple times during the day. It feels very light & refreshing. It also does it's job in ""treating and preventing breakouts"" I haven't seen my skin this clear for a long time and it doesn't get flaky like it used to. It's something I'd defenitely buy again and again. Not that'd I'd need to anytime soon because there's so much in the bottle it could last me awhile. :)"
I would not recommend this product at all DO NOT BUY THIS! At first I really liked it but after a few uses it started making my skin more dry and didn't moisturize at all. Then after a while of using it started burning my face very bad and I really don't have super sensitive skin. So DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless u want dry flaky biting skin.
"My skin has always been… well all of the above my skin is dry, oily,sensitive. So when it comes to moisturizers this one is amazing! I never really had very bad ance but I would always have 3-5 pimples on my face but with this they are all gone! love this product!"
"I am 48 years old and this is the only moisturizer I can use. I have tried so many other brands (and wrinkle creams) over the years and they leave me with break-outs, even ones that are “oil free” I made the mistake one day of being in a rush at the store & bought a generic brand that packaged their product very similar to Clean & Clear (which the store placed right next to the C&C products) and sure enough....I broke-out. I hope they never ever stop making this product!"
I used this moisturizer because I have dry skin on the nose & chin. & I needed something that will also help with my pimples so I gave this a try & noticed a difference the next day. I'm very happy with the results & will continue using this moisturizer everyday
"I have started on a course of Isotretinoin tablets, I am now using this as my oil-free moisturiser but I have started to come out in a bad rash on my face and mainly my neck. This may be because this product doesn't agree with me? Just wondered if anyone else has this problem, thanks."
I've been using this moisturizer for the past 3 years. It's okay. The only thing I do not like about it is that when you first put it on sometimes it makes you're face feel a little funny or when you start getting hot it makes your face sweat profusely. Including I have only skin so this makes my face even more oily by the time I am in the middle of the day. One good thing is that it does help with preventing pimples and outbreaks.
"So i had this big under the skin pimple that hurt and i went to do my nightly routine of cleansing, toning, and moisturizing. And the next morning i wake up and the pimple had shrunk almost completely. I knew it wasnt my cleanser bc i hav used it for years and it never helped to much with the under the skin pimples. I love this product. In my opinion it works best at night bc it has time to do its work. Btw i hav very oily skin and this is not oily at all and it makes my skin feel so soft"
When I started using it I was like OMG what will happen ti my face because it started burning and tingaling after thy my face became red and the next morning the redness went away and my face was so soft and I started using this about a week and all my acne went away
The first day I used product it worked like lotion on my dry face. The first week however it caused my skin to appear flaky and dry but only where I had broken out at. By the end of the week the once dry flaky parts where I had broken out were healing and clearing up. There's a tingling feeling that I love that lets me know its working. My face looks so much better since I started using this with the clean and clear face wash.
"As a mother of a son who battles acne, this moisturizer and acne prevention/treatment moisturizer is a God send. It's economically sound as a skin care investment."
It's difficult to find a dual action moisturizer within my budget that actually works.
"after i cleanse my skin, i put on this moisturizer. it helps becuase after i cleanse my i put on this moisturizer. it feels smooth and helps with the dryness. all i see in this product is a moisturizer, i don't see it as a treatment to help acne. overall, i like this moisturizer."
I have been using this lotion for 15 years and it works so well for my combination skin. I recently had trouble finding this in my local grocery store and tried Cerave SA lotion and had such a problem with oily skin and break outs. I switched back to this and within a couple of days my skin looks beautiful. Feels so cool and refreshing after application.
"I started using this product in the mid-90's. I wanted to start using a daily moisturizer, but I had oily acne prone skin. This product changed my life! It may not work for all skin types, but it is perfect for mine. I have used it as my day moisturizer ever since, and my skin has looked great. It almost seems like it has also had an anti-ageing affect. Please don't ever stop making this! Love it!"
I've been using the clean and clear morning burst facial cleanser for years and I was wanting to find a good moisturizer to help with my dry skin so I bought the dual action moisturizer thinking it would work for my skin and NOPE. I had more breakouts with using this product within a few days and I would not recommend this product.
Be VARY careful with this. The first time I used this I had a slight tingling/burning that I ignored and I used it again the next night... I had to stop using it because now my face is so burned and irritated that I can't even put water on my face. The only thing my skin is taking right now is vasilne. I'm so frustrated and in pain and mind you I have NEVER had sensitive skin before. I know it's this product forsure because I only applied in my t zone and this is exactly where I'm in pain. I just want it to go away!
"I usually use aveeno moisturizer but bought this one because it was half the price and I figured since it's supposed to fight acne, it would be a good substitute at half the price. Nope, I was wrong. I��ve been using this for 2 weeks and my face has broken more than ever. It makes my face super oily and just doesn't do what it's supposed to. I'll be sticking with my normal moisturizer from now on."
This stuff cleard my face up so well my acne is almost gone. After 3 years Ive finally found the mirical i need!
Great product along with the 3 step Clean & Clear essential products that actually helps improve my sons acne condition.
I have used this moisturizer for several years. It is very light and absorbbant. My face and neck always feels smooth and soft after use. One of my favorite daily routine products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product can really make your face feel soft, supple, and refreshed.I think that your face will have results that will change your life.This product is light and although it has 0.5% Salicylic acid it does work"
"I had very dry skin on my face, I decided to purchase this product after watching a youtube video about this product. When I applied it, it made my skin feel fresh, clean, and cool."
"I have occasional zits but some stubborn blackheads. This helped smooth out rough spots and diminish blackheads. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't dry me out. For an occasional zit and overall maintenance of clear skin, it works."
Within a couple of days it majorly broke me out and dried out my skin sooo bad. Which is hard to do since I have oily skin. There's a lot of good reviews so it's probably a good product just definitely not for me.
"I have been using this product for at least 20 years. I absolutely love it. Lately, I have been having difficulty finding it in my local stores. I hope it is not being discontinued! It has kept my skin clear since high school!"
"This product is very effective, but sometimes bringes new pimples to the surface. It's very moisturizing and only takes one dab to cover my entire face. I'd definately buy again but maybe not recommend."
"I been fighting acne most of my life, my breakouts mainly are hormonal reactions. And I've had tried every product there is, I use this moisturizer after I cleanse and tone. Day and night daily,my face has cleared up tremendously."
"easy to use, great price, smells good, oil free, it has a pump, the only down fall is that i wish it had spf in it, didnt break me out more then what acne i already have, and it does moisturize"
"I have been trying different moisturizers because my skin is very dry but at the same time I have oily parts, I buy this one few months ago and it really works for me, it add brightness to my face that makes me look natural. I really like it."
"Applied this product for a month or so, and now I look so good that I've been invited to the prom; also, I'm goin' steady! Keep up the good work, Clean & Clear dual action moisturizer!"
"Everynight I wash my face and put this moisturizer on and when I wake up the next morning, all my acne is gone or close to gone. It hydrates so nicely and it feels so silky !"
"This product may say for all skin types, but that's not the case with me! I have oily/combination/sensitive skin and this moisturizer made my skin breakout worse than it already was! Don't waste your money on this stuff not worth your time!"
"I love this moisturizer because it leaves your skin feeling so smooth and really HELPS your skin clear up. I bought the moisturizer since people have recomended it. I was a little skeptical at first, but then I saw that it worked really well."
"I don't usually have acne, when I do this is my go to product! I use it nightly and absolutely love it! It makes my skin feel amazing and is completely affordable!!"
This stuff is really nice. It dries almost instantly and leaves me skin feeling so smooth and soft. I think it does help with acne. I use it after clean and clear's acne cleanser and my pimples decrease in size by morning. Love!
This lotion is all I can use that won't irritate my skin. I do wish it had a pinch of SPF in it though so I could protect my skin more. All sunscreens bother my facial skin and they feel too oily. Add some SPF please!!!!!
This is the only moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated with out making me break out. I use it 2 times a day and since I started using it I don't break out anymore. Highly recommend this product
"Es excelente los tres pasos acabaron con el acné y la sensación fresca y humectada es genial aún después del maquillaje, recomiendo los tres pasos pues me ha dado muy buen resultado."
"i love this honestly ,one of the best things to have been made , its smooth and it works Instantly , it doesn't dry out skin like some products did. i love this i would never replace this!"
"I can't really tell that it's doing th much to help my breakouts. Maybe they would be a little worse without this product, maybe not. I don't think it makes my acne any worse, I guess that's positive."
"I really like this moisturizer, it doesn't leave my skin feeling too oily and is definitely helping to keep my acne in check. It's basically a must have if you're also using the ADVANTAGE Spot Treatment. Don't expect to see any miracle changes in your acne with this product alone. This is essentially just to help reduce any skin peeling you might experience with other acne products. You honestly can't go wrong with this one!"
so i got this product about a week ago and so far it was working fine.But then these past couple days i've noticed red spots around my mouth and nose where I applied.Usually in the winter my skin gets pretty dry especially around my mouth.It isn't a great moisturizer at all.I had to keep applying it so it would moisturize but it just made the rash work.So from now on I am only using this product as a pimple preventer not moisturizer.
"i started using this moisturiser for a couple of days, and i actually dries my skin, i put it on after a shower and a cleansed face, but when i woke up in the morning my skin was flaking and so dry, but i'm not sure if it's because of my route or the actual moisturiser"
"Writing this review in hopes that you'll never discontinue this product. I get really bad cystic acne on my chin which leads me to trying to use anything and everything that will burn my face off (joking), so typically I have really bad dry skin on my chin and it's gross but I couldn't ever put anything on it without my acne getting worse before I found this! I've only been using it for 2 weeks now and I can honestly say I see great results. No my acne didn't go away completely but this product did help a lot."
moisturizes well but as soon as it is applied it burns very lightly on the skin
"and has salicylic acid, so it is an ok purchase.."
I like the container it is in. It's a great value.
like the way my face looks and feels after using.
"i bought because they advertise as having salicytic acid and acne medication yet i used the whole bottle and not only did my pimples NOT clear up, i continued to receive more. waste of money. You should be ashamed at yourself for advertising a product that doesnt work!"
"I have a weird combo for a skin. Oily yet dries out easily. This moisturiser along with a facial cleanser helped get rid of my acne problem that I had suffered with until I was almost 24. Only problem is it dries my skin out a bit during winter and makes it peel. So wouldn't recommend using this during that time of year, otherwise, go ahead and use this."
"After doing step 1 & 2, I come to the best part which is step 3!! OMG my faces feels so smooth after applying, doesn't grease, and keeps my face refreshed for hours!! And it does help with my acne!! Just Day 1 and can see the difference!! Best moisturizer I have ever used!!"
"I first found out about this product through my sister. Once I tried it out, it made my breakout calm down and I started to see a difference. This product was a instant need in my skincare routine and I recommend it for every skin type as this product works wonders."
"Though this doesn't smell as good as the previous Night moisturizer, it spreads easier and leaves a terrific tingling."
I really wanted to like this product due to the good reviews but it made my sensitive skin worse causing it redness and breakout.
"It may fight breakouts but it does not give your skin the moisture it needs. After I used it on my face it was dry, tight, and flaky."
aging is inevitable and it shows on your skin if not taken cared of early. daily moisturizing is the key!
Excellent for people with dry skin or acne. Use with Selsun Blue and helps to control dandruff or acne.
This is an okay product. It kind of burns your face. Well atleast it did for me like my eyes were burning and watery. I don't recommend this product.
I have used this product before and it was good.
"However, ild like to know if it's safe to use while pregnant??"
This product helps fight acne while moisturizing the skin! I could see it's working after as little as a week. The best part is you can almost feel it working right when you put it on!
"I absolutely love love love this moisturizer, i apply it after washing my face and my skin feels so fresh and well hydrated. It really helps with eliminating my acne since ive been using it. It makes my skin look so soft and smooth."
During the winter my skin gets dry and flakey but this works wonders. Great price and it lasts a long time. Best of all it doesn't irritate my skin or causes break outs. One of the best moisturizers
I have been using this product since I was 15 or so and as I have gotten older I have tried other anti-aging products. Needless to say they don't work and make my skin break out or really dry or really oily. I love this product. I'm done wasting my money on other products.
"This moisturizer is awesome! It moisturizes completely but doesn't feel oily or like there is heavy cream on. After 10 seconds, the feel of lotion is gone, but my skin is remarkably soft! It doesn't clog pores or shine in the light. Also it helps dry out pimples but still hydrate your skin. As a swimmer, chlorine has dried my skin out and my face skin is horribly sensible. This lotion is AWESOME for it. I would definitely buy this product again!"
I recently got 10 zits on my inner cheek and one day later I found this and all of the zits disappeared after 2 weeks. My face tends to get oily and I sweat during sleep but this stuff has kept my skin clear and I'm so happy I only wear it to bed because no spf!!
"I was at the store with my mom and I told her I needed a moisturizer. She picked out this one since it prevented breakouts and I thought that it would do that. Was I wrong? Yes! When I put it on that night after my shower, it felt nice and had a cooling effect. The next morning I woke up and my face was all red and broken out!!!!!! Extremely disappointed!!!"
"I love this moisturizer and its the only one that works best for me and I've tried all sorts of moisturizer. Best under makeup, before bed and whenever i wash my face i put this on afterwards. But i moved to ramos arizpe mexico and i cannot find this moisturizer. Please help J&J"
I can't remember the last time my skin has felt this soft and smooth. I though the only way to have an acne free face was to dry out your skin. My facewash had been drying out my skin and hadn't even been clearing it. Now I tried this moisturizer and my skin is soft smooth AND clear!!
"I use it for the past 2 years, and breakouts are gone. Maybe 1 every 2-3 months. Before I try this one I always had breakouts on my chin, jaws line, sides and forehead. Was skeptical but definitely worth trying it. I am addicted , once I see the results every day. Love it, love it, love it."
"I have been using this moisturizer for over 3+ years. I have very acne prone, sensitive, combination (oily & dry) skin. This is such a cheap and quality moisturizer for me and I would recommend it to anyone. I have switched up moisturizers here and there but if I run out of an expensive one or a different one I'm trying out I always go back to this one. Helps with acne and doesn't dry out your face. Feels very light and refreshing on your face. Definitely an all time favorite for me."
"I have gone through many moisturizers through the years and I couldn't find any that really worked, until I found this one. It is great! Not oily, leaves your skin feeling very smooth and cool. I have been using this product for one month and I have noticed a big difference in my skin. I highly recommend this product!"
"I am 55 and don't have issues with breakouts. However, this is great to use on aging skin. The Sal-Acid works to remove dead skins cells, while providing no-grease moisture. Great smell too. I use this 3-4 times a week, alternating with a face cream for mature skin. I am always getting compliments on my smooth skin and glowing complexion. Great product."
"I like this for the most part. It feels light on my face, makes it soft, and I havent seen any additional acne with its use. However, when I use this before bed when I wake up my face is a bit greasy. Also when I put it on if I get it anywhere near my eyes it burns due to the menthol. If you don't like that cold burn feeling I would not recommend this. Other than that its one of the better moisturizers I've tried."
"It doesn't give me that oily film, it actually sinks into my skin and leaves it soft. I also like using it on my neck, it doesn't give my combination skin any oilyness at all. Being that it's oil free, it feels kind of water based, but I love it because it hasn't broken me out, EVER."
I've been a Neutrogena girl for years but this winter was drying my skin out and the products I was using were actually making the problem worse. One of my problems was dryness. But just one use of the C&C Dual Action moisturizer and the dryness was gone. I love that it moisturizes and helps fight/prevent acne. Perfect combination. I recommend the whole 3-step C&C system.
"when i started caring for my skin, this was the first moisturizer i used and is the only one i've used ever. Even though this is for dry skin, i use it on my oily skin and it still works fine. I can't get into using other ones because some are way too oily on my skin so I recommend this to everyone!"
I bought this because i was looking for a moisturizer that would moisturize my face but not make it too oily. I applied little amounts the first two days as a precaution & ended up with horrible tiny burning red bumps all over my face. I am not sure if it's a rash or just horrible reaction of acne. It looks and feels awful. I will never use this product again and i am very upset about it.
"I'm 59 but still have acne breakouts. Whenever I've tried to use any facial moisturizer--acne. This has salycic acid in it which helps combat the breakouts while keeping my skin moisturized. Nice light fragrance, does not leave skin feeling greasy, actually seems to control oiliness throughout the day. My skin is badly broken out at this time so it will take a while to determine if the product will help stop breakouts."
i recommend this product to any one who have sensitive skin
It's nice and soft with no nasty residue or scent and I LOVE it
It was great for my skin. I am glad I found this product
Love this moisturizer. Use it every day. Thanks for making it!
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! It works so good! I don't even need the astringent!"
Helps with my oily skin and the bottle actually comes in handy
"I love this product, worked with days I can't believe it such amazing product"
"It worked kind of it, the first month it worked for me but like after a month it stoped and just made my skin break out"
Does this product make your skin worst before it gets better ? I'm breaking out but I'm wondering if it's just an initial purge
"This moisturizer works really good for my dry skin. It makes my skin moisturized, hydrated and clear too. Amazing fragrance! Simply loving it."
I've used this product for almost a week and after I applied for about 5 minutes it starts to dry out my face so much . It was terrible.
I used it and its work for my oily skin .i bought it from australia but i couldn't find in my country sri lanka.
this product is amazing!!!! it doesn't cause acne like most moisturizers do and it helps when I have some dry skin patches. I bought this because everybody on YouTube loved it and now I know why.
"ive had a terrible case of dry face since as long as i can remember, and now my face is silky smooth! i use this twice a day after i use the clean and clear deep action scrub and it totally has cleared my face up COMPLETLEY! its a must have"
I use his product at least 2 times a day and it is awesome. It helps prevent pimples and is great for dry skin. It is similar to the cetaphil moisturizer. The dual action moister ooze from clean and clear is the only moisturizer I use.
Love this product. It goes on nice and light; absorbs quickly. Has a good scent. Actually moisturizes and is not too strongly medicated. Good for users who just need a little help. I just use once a day.
"I started using clean and clear dual action moisturizer and within 3 days it had tripled the amount of spots i had. Also when i applied the moisturizer it was a burning feeling, it felt like toothpaste or mint on my face :/"
This product worked great at first! Cleared up my skin but made then it made VERY dry. When I put the product on my face it has been making my face burn.
"I have somewhat sensitive skin and find that rather than cause any irritation, my face is left feeling soothed and refreshed. This product carried me through winter, hydrating my skin during a time of the year where it dries out quickly and often."
I used this product for about 5 months now and I always woke up to a breakout. It doesn't even moisturize my skin it just dries it out. Now I have irritated skin because of it with acne all across my checks. Don't recommend if you have sensitive skin.
"So I searched for a good moisturizer and I thought to buy this, I bougt it few days ago, for a few hours it works really good, the skin is soft, it makes my skin matt, and it makes a bit cold feeling for skin... But when I woke up next morning my chin area was dry, so it doesn't work like it had to."
"I have to say this moisturizer is amazing !!! I had a serious break out phase after using a different brand and I had no idea how to get my skin back or if it was even possible, I ran in to this moisturizer and in about a month or so they were gone. I am still using it to fade away the marks but my skin is recovering!"
"I started using this because my skin was super dry. When I first used it i noticed a tingly minty feeling on my face. But after a couple times using this product, I didn't even notice it anymore. This product makes my skin feel really smooth and soft, even if i have dry patches on my face, this product will make it go away. It also lasts a long time, I've had this product for about 7 months now."
"I have a habit of using to much astringent, so my face becomes very dry. So I decided to try this to help moisturize my skin, and it works! I like to use the Morning Burst skin brightening facial cleanser, then rub some of this moisturizer on, it makes my skin glow!"
"I used this product alone like instructed before bed, I woke up and my cheeks were a little red and dry. I didn't think much of it and applied it after my shower, not even 60 seconds later my face was on fire! I washed it off quickly and had to sit with cold rags on my face for a good hour. 2 days later my face feels like cracked leather, burn, itches and peels like a bad sunburn. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin."
"this product is AMAZING!! in my opinion, it leaves your skin looking beautiful and glowy but NOT OILY, theres a difference. For people saying that it leaves your skin looking oily, i think they have oily skin so thats why i think that this product is only for people with dry skin. it leaves youe skin lookin nice and healthy. i had a pimple and i put this on and it completley removed it leaving no scars. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT"
Made me break out even more. Waste of time and money. Feels greasy on the skin & leaves you looking oily. Not to mention I woke up the next morning with over 15 whitheads. Just as I thought my skin was getting better :/ thought I should use this as a preventative measure. I was wrong. DO NOT BUY THIS
This product leaves my skin feeling amazing I'm an 18yr old girl with a pretty average amount of pimples for my age and my skin was never super dry but this keeps my skin feeling great and I even now go without makeup which I found makes me look way older but the moisturizer helps me few comfortable without makeup plus the moisturizer is cheap if you don't have it in your bathroom yet go get it girl what are you waiting for?
"I usually struggle with blackheads and oilyness in the t-zone so I figured this would be a great moisturiser but I was wrong. After using it for 3 days I began breaking out BAD, probably the worst breakout I've ever had is because of this product. It's to the point where it hurts to wash my face. This one is no for me :("
"This moisturizer is light and non-greasy, dries or sinks in quickly, and makes my face feel so soft. It lasts a long time too. Even with the salicylic acid, I don't think this moisturizer has ever done anything to improve my acne or complexion. I just use it because it's not thick or oily, makes my skin smooth, and doesn't cause me any breakouts."
"I am older and have an oily t-zone, but dry otherwise. I use this all over my face and it works perfectly. My daughter also uses this everyday. She has the normal teenage struggle with pimples once in a while, and never goes anywhere without this. It works really well."
"I have dry skin, and recently started having breakouts around my jawline. A friend recommended I try this moisturizer and I'm so glad I did. It definitely dried me out a bit but I countered that with a heavier moisturizer at night, usually cerave. But this cleared up my breakouts completely within less than a week, I was floored at how fast it worked on my skin. For the price I will keep this on hand at all times for sure."
I bought this product as Clean and Clear products have generally worked really well for me. It has helped to clear my acne and prevent it as well which is a big plus for me! The only downfall to it is that I have to use it about every other day as it has a tendency to dry out my face!
"This product is very useful if I use it in certain ways. I no longer use it for my entire face because it doesn't hydrate my dry areas enough, but for my T-zone, chin, and any oily areas, this is great because it will moisturize as well as prevent acne. I haven't noticed any improvement on how fast breakouts go away, but it does help avoid them and doesn't make it worse. It also has a very nice refreshing feeling to it."
Good for pests
I just bought the 1-2-3 step pack and it burns my face this has never happened before
This moisturizer is a must have in my household with two teenage girls . Prevents breakouts and lives their skin soft.
I thought i would like this but within a short time of application it causes extreme redness and dried out my skin!
I love this product. I've be looking for something perfect for my skin and this is it. I don't have awful acne but it definitely helps when pimples pop up. It has a very light feel. I use it constantly throughout the day. It's great!
Ive tried several other brands and this has always been my go to when I have breakouts no other brands compare most lotions leave my skin feeling greasy not this one its enough moisture but not too much for my sensitive combo skin
"I can not begin to explain how wonderful this stuff is. It helps with acne, and MOISTURIZES my face without making it oily. Absolutely amazing for sensitive faces! Very affordable. Will for sure buy again."
I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now and it hasn't let me down so far. I love how it prevents breakouts yet makes your skin so soft. I will definitely continue using this product!
Every Clean&Clear product that i have works so well. Every other company isnt as good as clean&clear and this product is so well. But of course it wont work if you have very sensitive skin. get the sensitive skin moisturizer.
I just bougnht this product and just used it. I don't know if its god or not but in the beginning it burns my skin ALOT.....but I have acne and I am trying to fight my oilyness.
My face maybe had a few pimples but it was pretty clear compared to what I have now. Maybe this works for some people but I can't even show my face now because it's so terrible.
I've been using this for about a year now. At first it wasn't anything special. It felt nice but left my skin more greasy. BUT after using it for about 5 months it began to work great. NOW it makes my skin less oily and works wonders for breakouts.
I love using this moisturizer. It also give my skin a moisturizer look and a tingly feeling that lets me know it's working on any pimples I could be getting.
This moisturizer seemed great after using it for about a week but then my skin started to burn and get rashes on my t-zone area but not my forehead. It was little whiteheads and whatever I put on my face burned and made me red.
I defiantly don't use all the time but I do use when I have a really bad breakout. DRIES OUT SKIN! I guess you could say I use this as a spot treatment over night. Works great for me.
I absolutely LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER!! Every other moisturizer makes my skin feel really greasy. This also helps with my acne. I use this morning and night and it works great! This is also a great price and never lets you down.
"I suffer from sebhorrea dermatitis and acne ,I use proactiv and this is the only moisturizer compatible with proactiv. please don't ever stop making this formula ,it works !."
i used this product for about 1 week because my face was dry. i stop because my skin got dry after the 1 week. Now i just use it every once and a while. but great product
I have to say I've been using clean & clear since I was 13 or 14 and I have to say I love this moisturizer it makes my skin feel so soft. I highly recommend it to people that have dry or oily skin and needs something that will make them have softer skin.
This lotion is fabulous.........It works wonders and is the only lotion I have ever used that doesn't irritate my face. Words cannot describe how well this stuff works. I don't even think there is another company making just a facial lotion. To the makers of clean and clear facial moisturizer I SALUTE YOU. Thanks for a great product. The morning glow is also just as awesome. Thanks so much.
"I started using this 2 months ago and it works perfectly on my skin. My face felt soft and it was protecting acne. However, from last week my skin has been dry and flacky. When ever I put it on my face starts burning and getting very red. I feel as if i have a face mask on and cant talk due to the dry skin I have now. Its really hard to get the dry skin off and have perfectly soft skin now. Also when ever i put on a different moisturaser my face burns, gives me small rashes and gives me rednesa all found my face."
i bought this product and i felt really confident about using it because it said it would take care of my pimples and moisturize my face so i washed my face before bed with the daily pore cleanser and i put the mostutizer on. i really liked the scent of it and it made my face feel cool. i woke up the next morning and it took care some of my pimples so i used it again in the morning and again at night. after three uses of the moisturizer my skin got very dry. so now I barely use it :(
"I have had horrible acne for a long time now, I started using this along with the facial cleanser and deep cleaning toner to help clear my skin, and this is one of the only things that I can use that helps me! I still get very small pimples here and there like any teenager but usually this helps get rid of them before they ever form into a nasty head. I've tried everything from expensive to inexpensive and this is the best! I've been using this for 3 years now and I won't switch to anything else!"
"I started using this product couple months ago and decided to switch to the morning burst one and realize the morning burst moisturizer broke me out like crazy, recently switched back to this one and now we face is becoming clear again. & I have sensitive skin so I finally found a moisturizer that suites me"
After using my Clean and Clear advantage cleanser i had bought this earlier today i figured it would be good and cleansing my face and applying this my skin started to have a burning sensation and i went online and read the reviews about how others face were burning and how they woke up with a rash!!! I immediately washed this is off! I usually have clear skin but after seeing my face break out i wanted to try something different i see this isnt the product i hope nothing happens to my skin! :(
"leaves my skin cool and fresh, makes me believe my skin is getting moisturized! I'm not sure why it says it works for pimples though. it doesn't, the formula of salicylic acid is so small that you'll still break out. so if you're only buying this for acne, DON'T. you will waste your money."
I actually really like this moisturizer. I have oily skin and this doesn't leave my skin looking oily at all. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because it makes my jaw area itchy after applying it. But after a few minutes the itchiness disappears. I wish it didn't make my face itch though. :/
"I do not personally like this moisturizer because it just makes my skin even more dry! It appears oily when I first put it on, but after that it goes back dry. Of course everyone's skin is different so I can't say I wouldn't recommend other people trying it out or not. That's just my opinion."
"I started using this product because my facewash I normally use causes dry skin. I figured since it helps with acne, it would be perfect for my sensitive acne prone skin. I have used this product for a litte over a month now, and my face is 10x more broken out than it has ever been before! So bad that a dermatologist told me to stop using this product and had to give me a special face wash. This product was NOT worth my money and I will never purchase again ."
"I looooooove this moisturizer. If this works so well, is there a wash that does the same?"
The product is okay the results are not quick though but a good product
I love this product! It is the only moisturizer I have ever been able to use that won't break me out
I have very oily/acne prone skin. This moisturizer isn't too greasy and definitely keeps acne away. I love this moisturizer.
It is a good product that keeps acne away and mostrizes but after a couple of days of using it my face started to breakout again!!
I use this stuff everyday and I love it !It works well for me and my skin without making it too oily.
It's a great product! I use it every day after washing my face in the morning and it really keeps me moisturized without making me oily!
I absolutly hate this product! i used it one time and the next day my whole face broke out in little red bumps.Then it didnt go away until two weeks later.So i dont recomend this product at all.
"I've been using this product for around a week now, and it has been KEY to my skin care routine. Along with Clean and Clear's Rapid Face Scrub these two products have almost completely cleared up my face. I 100% recommend."
I've been looking for a really good moisturizer and this one stood out the most to me! Once I put it on my skin I could feel it working right away! My skin is not oily at all from using this and it helps prevent acne! :)
I take pride in my skin. This moisturizer works miracles. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and cool. I rarely get acne and when I do it disappears in less than a couple days. I definitely recommend this product!
i have sensitve skin and minor acne on my forehead. the second day i used it i realized my acne is getting so much better! it could be st ives cleansing scrub and this mixed together thats doing it. but so far so good
"I love this product. I have been using the 3 step system, and my skin is thanking me for it! The moisturiser is my favourite part of the 3 step system as it leaves my skin glowing and feeling so soft and smooth."
Great for sensitive skin. Absorbs and not too heavy. Goes on smooth. And makes my skin feel supple.
Please make a travel-size version! Please make a travel-size version!
Works great on the face making it feel light and not sticky after facial wash.
"This product moisturizes well and smells decent, worth it."
Face feels moistured but not throughout the day
GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY
This is the best moisturizer! It really has helps fight pimples
"This works great, moisturizes without oily film on my face."
"I washed my face, and after put this product on and with in a minute my skin got extremely dry and it started to tingle, then burn."
I tried it for a couple weeks and it made me break out more. It made my skin super dry. I would not reccomend it at all.
This works great! I haven't really seen it helping my acne clear up but it makes my skin really soft.
This product it helps claer the problem and also makes u feel like a whole different person and thats why i reccomend it.
Love this- works great
Kinda clears acne but leaves face dry. Over all pretty okay.
