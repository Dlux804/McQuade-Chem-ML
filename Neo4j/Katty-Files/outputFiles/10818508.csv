"This product is amazing. I had really bad acne as a teen and was prescribed acutane that stopped my acne but I had scars that just wouldn't go away. Also dry skin and oily at times. I recently bought this on a whim and almost 3 months later my skin is better than ever. It's smooth, glowing, and my acne scars are actually fading! I'm really pleased with this product and will stick with it for a long time to come!"
"Hello, I have been using this product for 5-6 months now and I love it! I've tried some different moisturizers that left my face feeling a little oily and heavy. This product makes my face so soft and refreshed and I get no oily feeling using it. I also love how it clears up my acne too! I definitely recommend this product."
My skin is very oily in certain places. I also have very sensitive skin. I also have dry splotches of skin in certain areas. This product made my skin very moisturized and incredibly soft! Takes care of my acne. I saw how my skin got very soft after first application! Made it easier to apply face powder or concealer on my face now! WOOHOO! Smells great too!
I suffer from really dry skin and most of the products i use for everyday cleansing tend to make my skin drier. I was told to pick up a moisturizer and i chose this one because i've use several of these products before. this does exactly what i need it to without making my skin feel clogged.
I love this product. I've been looking for something that can help my acne & moisturize my face at the same time without leaving my face too oily. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I only use this at night because I need to find a sunscreen to use it with during the day. Best product out there. Thanks Clean and Clear!
This is a great product at a great price!! It does not dry out or irritate skin like most acne moisturizers do. It actually leaves your skin soft and combined with the face wash has been the best thing I've found recently to fight breakouts!!
I've been using this product for about 6 months. I got it because my face had broke out really bad. After a few times of using it my face started to clear up. I use it once a day after I wash my face and it keeps everything under control. I don't go anywhere without it!
"I think this is a decent moisturizer and I would recommend it to people with oily skin. Unfortunately, I have lots of acne, and also very dry skin so it's hard to find a richer moisturizer that won't break me out. This is a little too light for me, so while it helped with my acne, my dry patches got so flaky so I had to switch to something else."
"I was very excited to try this product, since I had been looking for a moisturizer for some time. Since I have acne, I thought this might be a good product for me. NOT! When I first put it, my skin became red and itchy. It also hurt and stung, like if it was pure alcohol. Then a bit later, I noticed some acne forming. This product broke me out! I'm very upset since one the biggest reasons I bought it was for acne. I guess I'll have to keep on looking, very disappointed :("
"While going through chemo during the ""dry"" months of October through December, I tried this product. The chemo caused my face to break out a little and also caused some dryness. My daughter had purchased the Clean & Clear kit but let me try the moisturizer. I was so pleased at how well it worked! It controlled the break outs and the dryness and I still use it for sudden breakouts. I recommend this product!!"
"I am VERY prone to acne and always have to be very careful. I can never miss a day of using astringent or washing my face, etc. because I will break out. With my skin issues in mind I can say this is a great moisturizer. I can use this and I won't break out -thank god."
I am pregnant and my hormones are completely out of whack my face looked like a complete train wreck! I brought this product last night and woke up with my face so much clearer I couldn't believe it! I am in love with this product and will keep using it.
"I am really disappointed with this moisturizer. I use the Clean and Clear Advantage Ache spot, which works wonderfully, and I thought this would be good for my skin too. It wasn't. It just sits on my face and makes my skin even oiler throughout the day. Plus, it made me break out twice as much. I've never had so many zits on my face as I do now. Very disappointing."
well you may have read my other reveiw on the continuous cleanser and i recomaned this too.i have only been using this for a few days now and it has worked all ready! i love this product and it leaves my skin nice and soft. wooohooo smells terrfific lol btw im 11! and i highly recomend using the continuos cleanser at the same time during the night and when u wake up. of corse thats what works for me. and btw use the moisturiser when you use the cleanser then your skin will be even softer hope it helps :)
"This product does make my skin smooth because of the salicylic acid. However, it made my breakouts worse and cause large and red zits that won't go away. I've tried other salicylic acid acne medication and they worked way better this is. I am very dissapointed with this prodcut and will never buy it again"
"I bought this product in hopes of being able to moisturize my face without leaving it oily and gross. Unfortunately the first time i used it, it felt greasy and my skin didn't even absorb it. It kind of just sat on my face. The next morning i had break outs. I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money and time on this."
"You wont be disappointed by this moisturizer. It smells good and always gives my skin a tan glow that I don't get with any other acne moisturizer. My only complaint is that I have to use quite a bit of it for it to work, but it's definitely worth it. This product is worth the money!"
"This moisturizer and the spot treatment are perfect on my skin. The first day I got them they completely erased all the redness from the acne on my forehead. The spot treatment burns a little, but that's a sign it's working. Unlike any of my previous acne moisturizers, this one made my skin extremely soft and hydrated. I hope this product works for you too, but your skin type may reject it. It can happen a lot."
"I have fair combination skin with 1 pimple at most at any time, some blackheads, and many whitheads on forehead.. Pros: smells good, left skin soft, pump worked well. cons: made skin SHINY i could see it reflecting with light out! made nose a tad red. NO SPF I NEED THAT!!!!!! other: didnt harm nor help my acne good pump. every one has different skin! it might make YOUR skin gorgeous or it could break it out!"
"This product is pretty good, its been the first product I use to help prevent acne but the results are not what I expected. The product does help prevent some acne but it hasn't helped fully and I been using this product for almost 2 months. Although it hasn't helped much its still works good."
Ok so i have been using this product for about a year now... and had no result. obviously I've also used this moisturizer with the clean and clear cleanser yet if anything it has only been enhancing my acne rather then solving the problem. The only thing i will say that it has done is help with my oily skin. I would suggest a more natural based moisturizer. I've been using a cucumber cleanser and moisturizer and have been getting great results.
"I bought this moisturizer a few days ago, and I love it! It isn't at all greasy, and it finishes matte, which is something that all my previous moisturizers did, even though they claimed to be for greasy skin. It left my skin with the perfect amount of moisture, and it reduced the redness of my breakouts. I use it in conjunction with the rest of the pimple control range, and it is fantastic!"
I'm 13 and use this for my dry skin and to fight against the breakouts in my nose. My mom recommend me clean and clear and said it was good for teen and she was right this is a awesome product I recommend it for teen with dry skin and to fight against breakouts
I tried so many different moisturizers that my doctors gave me and they did nothing and then i found this product! It keeps my skin clear and make it feel refreshed and clean. I've been using it for about a year and I'll never try something else. Great product!
This is my favorite face lotion EVER!! It has helped my skin so much. However I have been to every store in my area (western washingtion) and have not been able to find it. :( I am heartbroken. Why can't I find it anywhere? I don't want to use a different face lotion.
I use this everyday even when I do not use the exfoliating pore cleanser. It works great as a moisturizer even on my eyelids which had me worried because of the acid but I have not had any side effects. I also believe it helps to keep my pores from getting clogged when I wear makeup everyday and forget to wash it off at night and I have had fewer to no breakouts since using the Advantage line!
"Suffering from breakouts in my twenties, I'm just plain tired. I had perfect skin until the age of 21 when it went haywire. It gets dry very easily and is highly reactive to many many products (and glycolic acid). The low concentration of salicylic acid in this product keeps things in check during the daytime while I pair it with a higher concentration (2%) cleanser at night. So far so good."
I started using this one when they discontinued the morning glow moisturizer with spf 15. At first I tried the dual action but it made my skin really oily. In a desperate attempt I tried another brand with no luck and so I went back to clean and clear and reluctantly tried this lotion. It works pretty good but I don't like the lack of sunscreen and the precaution to stay out of the sun. It makes my skin dry sometimes and I only use once a day. #wish they would bring back morning glow. :(
"I have very sensitive, yet oily skin which frustrates me a lot since I cannot find the perfect match for my skin easily. Most of my facial products would be a bit of expensive, but I want to find a budget friendly and perfect moisturizer that will suit my skin type. While watching a YouTube video, I encountered this product and I immediately wanted to try it out. By the moment I went to the drugstore, I got this and until now I'm not regretting my purchase."
"This product helps moisturize my face, but it leaves a weird tingling feeling in my cheeks. Almost hurts after a little while. Probably won't buy this one again."
This product really works for my skin. I always have pimple breakouts. In the morning and before i go to bed. It helps prevent pimples and i haven't seen one pimple on my face for years! Diffidently recommend you try it!
"I just purchased this product today, but when I was applying it, it went on my face smoothly, it has a pleasant smell, and my face already feels soft! I am very excited to see how it works on my skin!"
When I put it on my face I was hoping to get that nice fresh feeling but I didn't. I feel tingling on my face and my cheeks start slightly starting to burn. Waste of my money sorry but it didn't work for me.
smells amazing but it took a little bit of work for it to actually moisturize. it says acne control but i havent seen a change yet.. really hoping for the best though
"For me, this moisturizer does a good job. It moisturizes my skin, really does help with getting rid of acne, the one downside is that this moisturizer doesn't have an SPF. Would be perfect if it did!"
"I am a teenager with acne! Everyday I wash my face and moisturize with this, and in 2 weeks my main breakout areas were clear and my Face was smooth. I recommend exfoliating then using this product. It help bring out natural glow and puts away acne!"
It burns my skin! I do not normally have sensitive skin but this burns the heck out of my face! It has also left me with drier skin then I started with! Isn't the whole purpose of a moisturizer to moisturize? Not burn or dry out my skin??!!
I love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth and it fights to prevent acne and make the pimples that I have go away faster! Plan to keep using this product!
I have combination skin and I've never had a reaction to any face wash or moisturizer until this one. My skin broke out in red bumps and red patches and is still recovering three days later.
I love this product but recently it has been so hard to find in any stores around me. I thought Clean and Clear got rid of it but I'm so glad to see they didn't because I was panicking!
"I have tried the dual action moisturizer and it keeps my skin red, like a rash, all day long! This one has been my tried and true! Clears my skin and makes my makeup look great on! Couldn't be happier!"
"Gave this a try because the store was out of the other moisturizer (white bottle). This one leaves my skin greasy. I used it for a month and compared it to the other moisturizer, once it was back in stock and I will stick with that one. I noticed more pimples with this one and my skin always looked shiny after using it even when I used the smallest amount."
"This product has definitely cleared up my skin. The acne on my cheeks and forehead is almost completely gone! It is very lightweight and moisturizing, it made my skin feel very soft.I'm disappointed that I couldn't find it at one of my local drugstores but I'm replacing it with a similar product."
I love the clean and clear brand because it's not expensive and it works well with my skin.
"I was very excited to try this product, since I had been looking for a moisturizer for some time. Since I have acne, I thought this might be a good product for me. NOT! When I first put it, my skin became red and itchy. It also hurt and stung, like if it was pure alcohol. Then a bit later, I noticed some acne forming. This product broke me out! I'm very upset since one the biggest reasons I bought it was for acne. I guess I'll have to keep on looking, very disappointed :("
"So I have very oily skin and I always end up using a huge variation of products to keep my skin under control. However, it also includes cleansers that dry out my skin a lot as well, so the oil comes back in full force. This moisturizer is very light weight and gives my skin just enough moisture so that it doesn't get too oily too fast. Most other moisturizers that I have used are too heavy and leave my skin very oily within an hour. I use this product under my bb cream every day! Works so fantasticly."
"This was my first moisturizer from Clean & Clear, and I thought it would be good to have that extra push to treating my troubled breakouts that I've had for years. I didn't really like this product just because it made my skin much more oilier that it already had been on my combination skin, and it didn't moisturize my skin, it just sat on it. I am about almost finished with this bottle, but I definitely reccomend their dual action moisturizer I'll provide below. That stuff rocks."
"Cleared my skin of acne and redness, wish I found it earlier and didn't waste money on Lancôme products"
Anyone can use it. It takes care of acne in a matter of days. My friend recommended it to me and now I just have to replenish it everytime I run out.
I've been using it for 2 months now and have not had any problem. It doesn't make your skin oily at all. 5 stars for that! Its a good moisturizer but doesn't really help so much with the acne problem!
So I tried this product on my acne overnight and it cleared right up. After a few days of using it my face started to burn and itch. If I didn't have a bad reaction to this product I would use it every day!
I have oily skin and this works great! Helps with oil control and along with the face wash I use my skin is clearing and I started using this product on Sunday! Im absolutely in love with this! Just wish it had SPF in it
"I use this product everyday 2 a day. I love it my skin was really dry but after using it my skin was baby smooth ,and it helped keep me from breaking out while mousturising my face!"
This product worked for me in a matter of 2 days. I don't really have acne issues but the past few weeks my face was breaking out. I love facial products and my friend even just recommended the acne spot treatment.
"i have seen many bad reviews about this product, but i must say that this product has definitely kept my skin moisturized, and i have noticed my skin has gotten incredibly soft, and even though i still get acne on my forehead, it smooths out the surface of the acne and makes my skin look clear depite redness. this originally made me breakout, but after using this product for the first month, my skin has begun to clear up"
"Have been using for 3-4 years, if I don't use this I breakout within 2 days. Use 2 times a day after I wash my face. I have dry skin everywhere except my nose, but in the corner of my nose I get flaky, this helps tons. Occasionally I add a drop of tea tree oil when really dry or breaking out."
"Its the only moisturizer i can use without breakouts, my skin feels so soft now"
The tingling sensation feels refreshing but i read that that reaction isn't normal.
This product helped clear my skin and leaves it feeling smooth and soft all day
I love this it blows away the pimples im so happy I got this
it works so good ive used for 2 weeks and all my pimples are gone
Before I used this I had oily skin but now my skin is super dry and peeling around my pimples.
this stuff works miracles it got rid of most of my pimples in 72 hrs
I have been using this lotion for the last 10 years! I have never had a major acne breakout and I thank this lotion for all that it has done for me!
"This helped my acne SO MUCH and leaves my face so soft! I use this twice a day, and it does wonders!!"
"this product is great. A little bit goes a long way with this moisturizer. I've only been using this for a couple days but I really like it so far. I'm sure the bottle will last for a long time because a little bit will cover my entire face. It leaves my face feeling soft,smooth, and moisturized.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good moisturizer."
"I've been using this for sooo long because I used to have normal skin and it worked fine (as a moisterizer) but now, for some odd reason, my skins been getting really dry and whenever I use this, it just feels like a film on my face that doesn't sink in all the way like a good moisterizer should. It feels good when you initially put it on, but then my face gets dry again like I didn't put ANY on. This NEVER worked to help make acne go away, so if that's what you're buying it for, don't bother."
"I was looking for a product to control my breakouts and oily skin. After all the good reviews I saw from this product I decided to try it. Unfortunately, it did NOTHING for me and made my skin break out more. I have been using it for a month now to see if it would ever start working but it was a HUUUGGGEE let down!! My face is....UGHHH...!!!"
I have been using this product for about three years now and it works wonders! I absolutely love it and it is perfect for my skin. My skin is mid oily and very sensitive to products and I do have here and there breakouts. This product helps to maintain my acne and makes my face really smooth. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a good moisturizer.
I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and all it has done is make my skin very dry and flaky I don't know if this is supposed to happen when you first use it. Just today my under eyes were very dry and they were red. Before using this product I was using Lubriderm as my moisturizer and it was so much better than this product. Before using this product my skin was nice soft and hydrated. After it was a disaster.
I've been using this product for about 3 years and really see no difference. My skin still has a good bit of break outs. I have bad acne scars that have appeared since using the product. I've tried changing other products in my skin routines but I still have the same results so this must be the variable keeping my skin the way it is.
"A moisturizer is meant to make your skin soft and smooth, but this made my face red and blotchy. It also caused me to break out, particularely on my chin and cheeks which are spots I had not had acne on my face prier to using this product. I am almost 14, and my skin is already not in an ideal state. I would not recommend this, especially for those my age."
Great product
"This lotion smells super good and is very nice on the face, doesn't leave your skin oily at all and for me it gets rid of redness that is caused by acne but doesn't do a whole lot for the acne itself."
i think i had a reaction to this. i used this and i thought it was amazing and i forced myself to like it but the after the next day I used it again and my face started to itch really bad then my face started to swell up and my face would grow red patches and my face would feel like it was burning hot and i would put ice on my face no matter how much cold i would put on my face nothing would help.
"I used this mosturizer daily-every 2nd day fro a month and needless to say it broke me out, i have sensitive, acne pron, oily skin and at first this product (and the rest of the Advantage line) made my acne much darker then a few days latter after using this product my skin looked DISGUSTING. (very watery thick heavy mosturizer)"
yo use esta crema y cuando te la pones es normal pero luego sientes como que quema :o . Y se siente raro.Yo tengo la piel grasa y la crema se absorbe bien pero se siente caliente luego de que te la untas.La utiliza luego del scrub de fruit infusion el de abajo.
This moisturizer is not fot dry skin if thats what you've got. It does not moisturize your face at all. It feels nice the first 2 minutes but as hours past i feel my face & it dry. Even an article in Seventeen about what products to use for your skin type and this moisturizer was in their but for someone who has oily skin. Maybe clean and clear you should put on your products what skin type its for!!!
"I have used the Dual Action moisturizer for years and I have tried other brands, always come back to Dual Action. This week the store was out of it so I tried this one, since they both have 0.5% salicylic acid. This one smells slightly different and I think had a slightly thicker feel, but it seems to work just as well, if not better, than Dual Action moisturizer. My skin definitely felt less greasy, but smooth and moisturized. I am happy!"
"The moisturizer is relatively hydrating and did create a nice glow on my face however at a cost. After about two weeks of using this product, I started getting major whitehead breakouts that I've never had a problem with before. I'm not sure if it's only my skin it did that on but it was a disappointment nonetheless. A good clean and clear product for breakouts is the blackhead clearing astringent that comes in a purple bottle - but be warned its quite drying."
"This product works great, keeps my acne very much under control. BUT, I only use this product at night. It does not provide enough moisture to wear during the day, when I tried wearing it during the day and it left a white sheen on my face, and my skin looked very dry. But again this product is great if you apply it before bed to fight acne."
"been using this for over 5 year, been using for all my adult ance, tried a bunch of washes and exfoliants what remains constant is this moisturizer!!"
"I will give credit where due; it moisturizes well, but...this is undoubtedly the grossest moisturizer I have ever used or smelled. It has an overpowering chemical scent, like plastic and metal almost. I regret this purchase."
"I tried to give this product a chance for a few months, but it does nothing to reduce the oil or shine on my face. I have really oily skin and am better off not using anything than using this product."
You'll never regret the fact that your face feels as clean as the ocean
This is not available in Sri Lanka so we need it .. Please deliver this product to Sri Lanka ..!! :D tnx
"Sure it mousturizes but it breaks me out worse than the moisturizers WITH oil !!! Lies! It says ""acne control"" it only makes it worse"
"I put this on, then followed by my make up. I broke out really bad. Must of been this product that did it. I returned it to Wal-Mart."
i cant live without this stuff. it makes my face feel and look so nice i deff recommend it
