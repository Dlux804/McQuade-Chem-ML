"I have tried other moisturizers with SPF and they felt sticky and heavy on my skin. This stuff feels lovely; I've been using it for years. It is very light weight and breathable, and yet i feel like only a little bit can easily cover my whole face. I use it daily after showering, underneath makeup. I think ""complete"" is a good name because it has all 3 things i want with one product: moisturize, SPF and antioxidants."
"My skin is tricky. It's very fair so I need daily sunscreen in California, but sunscreens always break me out. The SPF 15 is enough for daily use under my make-up. I use it twice per day, on my hands, neck, chest, and arms. I found I was breaking out from sleeping with heaver lotions on my arms (like I said, tricky). I slather it on, it's so inexpensive. I even put it on my lips to protect them from the sun too. When I need a stronger SPF, I use the Oil of Olay Facial sunscreen in 50 SPF. Love Oil of Olay products!"
I switched to this moisturizer after finding several other brands with SPF included felt a bit thick and greasy on my face. This leaves my skin soft with zero breakouts.
great face moisturizer!!! I love that it has sunblock in it too! It's a light face cream ans does not feel heavy or sticky or thick. This face cream goes on light and smooth! I just love it!
Great for someone with combination skin.
"Is great, inexpensive and helps my face with the oils."
this product has kept my skin a youthful looking and feeling
I have oily skin but the combination/oily Moisturizer leave my face very shinny. I don't need the extra shin.
I first got this moisturizer because I saw a favorite Youtuber mention it. I decided to give it a try because I have oily skin. The first couple days I started using it I saw a drastic change in my skin and how much the oil had reduced. I loved that the moisturizer had sunscreen in it because then I can skip that step in my skincare routine. This moisturizer has no smell which I love and I love the fact that it lasted me a few months. I have been repurchasing this for two years now. #contest
"Even though you have oily/combo skin, you MUST moisturize. And this is a great product for that skin type. My favorite product!!!"
"I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT VERY HIGHLY,THE WAY THAT IT MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL IS TRULY AMAZING I CAN NOT STRESS HOW AMAZING GIVE IT A TRY I'M POSITIVE THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT AS MUCH ARE MORE AS I DO."
My sister recommended this to me and I'm so glad she did. This makes my skin feel amazing. It's so much more hydrated and feels a hundred times better than it used to.
Been using this for years....love it!
"Olay Complte All Day Is a great,much better than some of those expensive lotion."
First time I use a moisturizer cream.And I really loved this one.I have 2 weeks with it.And I can tell the difference on my face..
I bought this product in hopes that it could be added to my daily routine in trying to keep my skin healthy and young unfortunately after the first use my face started to break out and it left my face very shinny and felt a little heavy when I put it on I used it again the next day and my breakouts got worse I have kinda oily skin that may get a pimple once every couple months I wouldn't recommend this product
"I live in FL, where the sun is a constant battle. I enjoy being tan, but I do not want the wrinkles that go along with a tan. I've use Olay daily moisturizer every day and people consistently card me, or think I'm younger than what I look like- I just turned 35yrs old. I think my young look is definitely attributed to the daily use of Olay face moisturizer. I highly recommend that all girls and ladies use this product."
"It still feels greasy on my skin which is weird because it says it is for combo/oily skin. I do not like the way it feels under my make up. Not a fan of the sunscreen scent either. HOWEVER, it does make my skin feel really soft and moisturized. I will continue to use it until I find another Olay product that does not feel so heavy."
"I love all of Olay products that l have used. This being one of my favorites. I love the pretty package, l know right where to go to find it. I love the SPF is there for an added protection and it doesn't leave greasy feeling or smell. It feels so creamy and lush on. I recommend all buy this. I was asked to give my honest opinion from @influenster and @olay so l could join a #contest. This is true and my own opinion. #influenster #olay from @wildfirekristin"

"I was looking and serching for a good moisturizer. This one caught my attention because of all the good stuff it claims to have. I bought it yesterday and oh do it have a strong smell!! It was overwhelming! If I knew, I would probably not buy it. Please take the fragance away! On the positive side I love the feeling and how it held up my makeup."
"I was pleased with the feel of my skin after using the Olay Complete with SPF 15. It has a nice scent, and it is barely noticeable (feeling) on my skin after I apply it. I use topical medication on my face 20 minutes prior to applying Olay Complete, and the Olay Complete does not aggravate my skin or counteract the medication. I am so pleased to have the SPF already in the product because I have had sun damage over the years."
"I hated all face sunscreen because I would always get terrible blocked pores and acne (even cystic). I finally found the one. The sensitive skin one I use is very light weight and doesn&#39;t cause me any problems. It doesn&#39;t feel like sunscreen is on, with that mask-like feeling. You may need to reapply if you&#39;re sunbathing or sweating. Oh yeah, it doesn&#39;t really burn the eyes like so many do. I was happy to find my miracle!"
"I HAVE USED OLAY BEFORE AND DECIDED TO BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE FACE LOTION BUT I CAME BACK TO THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT ""WORKS"" FOR MY OILY SKIN. MY SKIN LOOKS FRESH EVERY MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP. THIS LOTION IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS PRODUCT."
"I used Olay as a teen but then switched to more expensive brands. My skin has changed and became extremely sensitive with age. I now use this product in Sensitive. It is great! Lightweight but seriously moisturizing. The SPF will be tested during the summer months, but I have faith it will hold up to the test.(Most with SPF's break me out with the first use, but not this one.)"
I love the complete lotion. I use it at night before bed and in the morning. It has just enough spf for my face. When I turned 30 I started having acne problems and that led to scarring. I have been using Complete and have noticed a huge difference in my face. I feel confident and my scars are fading. I'm not saying this is fading cream but I believe over time the scars fade and the complete lotion has helped keep my skin healthy and beautiful. I also had acne on my chest. I don't know why but it has also disappeared. I love it.
"This product is great! At first I didn't think it was going to work, and it even made my skin flake a little in the beginning. Though after using the product for about two weeks my skin got use to it and it started completely moisturize my skin. Be a little patient if you are switching moisturizers and let your skin get use to it. It's amazing! The best moisturizer I've used, out of Marykay and Clinique!"
Smells very strongly of sunscreen-not what I want to smell like all day or have to smell. Only used it once and bought Olay moisturizer without it which I really like.

I've been looking for a moisturizer to replace my expensive Clinique one and it looks like I'm still on the hunt. This moisturizer is made for oily/combination skin but all it does it make my skin look worse and cause breakouts.
I have been using Olay products for a long time. I have even tried products that say they are similar and that is not true. My skin looks great from using this lotion.
This product is amazing. When I first started using it I had. Serious lines forming on a very dry face. Now my face is soft again and the lines not so prominent.
I have used this product for years. I was very happy when the sensitive skin formula added SPF to it several years ago. It makes my face feel smooth without feeling greasy.
I have used Olay for many years and would not give it up for anything. I am almost 51 but still have to try and convince people that I am not as young as they think I am.
It's really the best moisturizer to use. It's not greasy and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I've been using it for as long as I can remember and do not plan to switch to any other kind!
"I have used Olay face wash for a long time and decided to try this moisturizer. My skin is an oily/dry combination and I felt like this did not do the job for me. It made my skin feel burnt and very irritated. The smell isn't bad though, I don't mind that it smells like sunblock."

Good moisterizer but doesn't feel heavy on your face. Keeps my face from being too dry and protectsfrom sun while feeling like I'm wearing nothing.
Seems like the formulation changed. This is a bit thinner than the old version and stings my face.
