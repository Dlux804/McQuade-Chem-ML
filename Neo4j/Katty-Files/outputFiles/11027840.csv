I have always used this as it also has a sunscreen in it. Just love it so would love to try their whips also someday. I got 2 of these so I could give one to my husband. He has had dry flaky skin on his forehead lately. I put this on his face and his problem has completely stopped. No more dry flaky forehead. Wow works on me and women both !
"Great for my skin and I love the fact it has sunscreen in it. I use it on my face, neck arms and hands after my shower using Oil of Olay body wash. It is not greasy and absorbs great."
"I am 59. My grandmother used Oil of Olay as her secret to young looking skin. She looked great until she died in her mid 80's. I have used it every day too. It is a great, time proven product."
I have very sensitive skin and this is the only lotion I can use and not break out with acne or bumps/rash. I'm 50 and have no wrinkles and no I have never had plastic surgery or any facials they also make me break out.
"Oh yes! I love this Olay product. The only problem I had I thought I was getting the one for regular skin, not sensitive. I like the regular because it has a citrus fresh smell to it. But this product too has the SPF protection."
My husband and I have used this for years. It doesn't cause breakouts and offers the added benefit of sunscreen. This is a great product.
"I love this facial moisturizer. Not too heavy or thick, but thick enough. I also love that there is some sun protection in this."
Great price with spf 15 for 2
"The moisturizer is one of the few which has zinc in it, which I was specifically looking for. It rubs in easily and isn't greasy feeling or looking. Shipment was about a week later than they promised."
Not the Product had used previously! Cannot use the two bottles I purchased! Description should have specified formula had changed!
It beats the expensive brands
"I have used Oil of Olay,for over 35 years.It is the only product I use other than soap."
I love it.
"Been using for years, My Mom also used it."
"I love this product, I like all Olay products in general but this one is by far my favorite!! It goes on smooth not oily like some face creams and runs in easily. The smell is great and it is very affordable so it won't break your budget!!! I will be an Olay customer for a while thanks Olay"
"I haven't used this product before. It only arrived a week or so ago, so it is too soon to tell if it will have a positive lasting effect on my skin. However, it feels good, applies easily, lasts all day as a moisturizer and is not greasy. It is doing just what it advertised."
I am very happy with this moisturizer. It feels light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.
I use this on the face instead of an aftershave. Works
nice.
Great for sensitive skin.
Could not have worked out better.
I use this product every day morning and night. Love the way it makes my skin feel.
Really like this brand. Sensitive skin version is just what I need during the winter!
I've used this for years. I love it
I have used Olay since I was a teen and now I'm in my 50s. It's not greasy. I love it.
Been using for years. People don't believe me when I tell them my age!!
"I love the texture of this daily moisturizer. I love that it has sunscreen, also. And! I believe that it keeps my face looking younger!"
I have used Oil Of Olay lotion for more than 30 years. It's a great
moisturizer and has sunscreen in it.
"I started using this product about 40 years ago and after trying a few other moisturizers now & again, I always govack to it."
"I have been using Oil of Olay for years and so did my Mom, I think it is really helping my skin stay healthier. I hope to use it for years to come."
I've been using this product for years. It is a great moisturizer as it is not too thick and not greasy. It also has some sun protection. Very good under your makeup.
"I use this for everyday moisture. Sometimes, during the winter months, I have to use a more ""heavy duty"" moisturizer but this works well and doesn't irritate my skin or leave it feeling greasy."
"I've used this moisturizer for several years. A couple years ago, my husband started using it, too. We both like it very much as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin. It's also modestly priced - as skin care products go - and doesn't break the bank to purchase it."
Olay moisturizer is my only choice for my face for fifty plus years and counting.
"I've used this for years, wouldn't use anything else!"
Great value.
Used this product for many years. Good value for price
"I have a very sensitive skin which I can't really trust or try any product on me , but I give this Olay a try and I'm very happy with it . I love this product!!!"
"I actually wanted SPF30 and ordered this by mistake. Feels good, non greasy. Half the price of the Olay SPF30 Complete Defense - wish that was cheaper."
"I have super sensitive, combination to dry skin. Every facial moisturizer with SPF that I've ever tried leaves my face and eyes burning, and that's not even mentioning the nasty smell and gunky feel. I recently purchased this moisturizer and I'm in love! No gunky feel, no fragrance of any kind, and most importantly my face doesn't burn! I highly recommend this product to anyone considering a new facial moisturizer with SPF."
"I love Olay (Oil Olay, Complete)! I have been using your product on my face every day since I was 18 years old. I would work just to be able to buy Oil Olay as it was formerly named. My skin is firmer and smoother. I get compliments all the time about how young I look. I'm 68 years old."
This is the only moisturizer that doesn't break me out! I LOVE IT! I have been using it every day for over a year now. Its great that there's an SPF in it as well because it gives me added protection from the sun throughout the day. I won't use anything else!
"I LOVE the Original formula (pink swirl) Olay and Sam's had sold this dual pack for years! I have been buying this moisturizer since I was 19 years old, so for the last 23 years. All of a sudden Sam's Club only sells the complete formula which breaks my extremely sensitive skin out due to to the SPF:-( I really wish they would continue to carry the original beauty fluid as it is an excellent moisturizer and a much better bargain for me. It is the only facial moisturizer I use."
"This new formula is of lower quality, less effective, and overall inferior to the previous formulation which contained aloe juice (not 'extract'), green tea, and before 2010, chamomile. Please bring back the better formulation and do your consumers and company a favor and clearly state when you change a product. If you change an ingredient or formula, you are in fact SELLING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT."
Im so glad that Oil of Olay listened to its consumers and brought back the classic gentle formula because it is the best spf moisturizer out thier for people with sensitive skin. It doesnt burn my eyes and doesnt feel greasy at all.Love that its oil and fragrance free. Reading the reviews before PLEEEASSSE Oil of Olay don't change the formula of the product again Ive tried everything else and this is the best Ive ever used. Oil of Olay for life.
"This is a good product to always have on hand, all their products are effective."
"I use it every day. It is a nice, light moisturizer and I love that it has sunscreen protection."
I BOUGHT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AND AM HAPPY ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND THE PRICE
I've used this brand for a long time. It gives me just the amount of moisture I need.
The convenience of ordering online makes shipping so easy. I love the oil of Olay and so glad Sam's has large 2 packs.
Took on vaca .Used as sunscreen everyday.Never got burned. Great for sensitive skin .Doesn't bother your eyes.
we use this every day and t's one of the best moisturizer for sensitive skin for the price. Thank you Olay!!
Nothing beats the consistency of this moisturizer. Been using it for years...and I think it's why I generally look younger than I am!
I no longer where foundation so I put this on my face every morning. It gives me a fresh look and feels great. Not oily or thick.
I've been using Olay products for many years now. I'm always told I don't look my age. I owe it all too Olay products!
This is a good moisturizer but I do like something a bit thicker for my aging skin so I gave it 3 stars.
A great moisturizer with a great price. Used for years by myself and friends. Also a SPF. Others are so expensive and do the same thing.
I use it as a moisturizer and sunblock everyday. I wouldn't use it during an extensive duration in the sun.
"I use this when I wil be hanging around the house, in addition to anti-aging products, and a no make-up day."
I have used Complete all day moisture for 30 years and it was passed down from my grandma. Not greasy or oily so I never get black heads or sticky feeling. I love this!
"I have used this for about month now. It is AMAZING! I have extremely sensitive skin (mild rosacea). This is very hydrating, non irritating, light, not greasy, and I love that is has an SPF!"
A little bit goes a long way. Very creamy and smooth. Great moisturizer for my acne prone skin. I've been using it for a couple weeks and my face looks and feels better. (I do use a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide under it.)
I started using this lotion because it was recommended in the acne.org regime. I have always had combination/oily skin and this product helped me control my acne without getting dried out skin.
"Olay, are you reading your negative reviews for your new bottle of this moisturizer? I was on Ulta.com, and the first 5 pages are mostly all complaints about the new formula change with your new bottle that came out this year. I have both bottles, the older one with the yellow sun on bottle and the new one with the black font. I can tell you, the new one is not the same. I hope you take into consideration all the complaints and can make changes."
I use Oil Of Olay on my face and neck and love the feel of my skin.
"Nice price, dependable product and love the spf coverage."
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. MUCH ESIER AND CHEAPER TO BUY AT SAM'S CLUB
I only purchase this at Sams. Best price and service
Awesome product. I have used it for six years.
Have used this product for many years. It was a good price at sams
"I love Olay products, and was thankful to get them at such a good price!"
I like the texture and how easily this product absorbs into my skin. I wear it everyday!
Have used for many years.
"I have used this sensitive skin zinc oxide lotion for as long as I can remember, so has my mom. It's lightly moisturizing, perfect for my combo/acne-prone skin, and keeps my skin clear of uv damage. I burn VERY easily and this daily lotion prevents that. There is no scent, no oil, does not aggravate my acne-prone skin, or break me out, simply perfect :)"
Love it!
"I have been using this product for decades and I love it. Every time I stray to try some other, generally more expensive, product, I end up coming right back. Effective sunscreen and the moisturizer is non-greasy and absoreasily into my skin."
"This will be the last Oil of Olay Complete I purchase. After 25 years i need to find a new facial moisturizer. Terrible odor, even though it is fragrance free for sensitive skin. Why change such a good product. I see that I am not the only one."
been using original for 10 years.ran out and bought another bottle.should be advertised as complete garbage.the formula change is junk and i will be squirting the rest out down my toilet.bring back original or be aware people.do not purchase!!
Good on my oily skin - Skin feels light and not oily all day
Feels nice
works well
good
Great for under make-up
"This is ONE Of muy favorite moisturizer product for now,my face feels really soft, have fast absorption, not oily ,whit SPF 15 is perfect for my,smell like a sunscreen but more light ,I'm Olay fan so I don't have complains. I thrust in this brand %100."
I bought this cream because my skin is sensitive. I like the fact that it is fragrance free. Unfortunately it made me break out a bit and it makes my skin feel dry. I used it 3 years ago but in the lotion formula. Perhaps I should have bought the lotion not the cream formula.
"I found the ""new old"" product. Yippee! The box has the familiar yellow, white and black graphics with a green band at the bottom that says light, non-greasy lotion--FRAGRANCE FREE; and the same green color oval on the top left of the package that says ""Classic Gentle Formula"". Many thanks P&G--a belated but still appreciated return of my beloved zinc oxide formula!"
Love this product!! I have very sensitive skin and it works great.
My skin is super dry & this lotion is all that helps with it!!
This makes my face feel so good!! I will not use anything else on my face! Love it !
I love this product it isnt greasy and also has a little sunscreen in it
This is the only moisturizer I can use. It doesn't cause my skin to burn or get red. I have never broken out from this product. I have tried some of the most expensive products and find this to be the gentlest and most effective.
"I have been using this with clean and clear 3-in-1 cleanser trying to get rid of my pimples but its hasnt worked. It may be the cleanser that is not working but not sure if the lotion is doing anything to make it worse. this is a very light moisturizer and I purchased it for the SPF. It doesn't feel as moisturizing as my other moisturizer because after I put it on, my face still feels a bit dry."
"I live in FL, where the sun is a constant battle. I enjoy being tan, but I do not want the wrinkles that go along with a tan. I've use Olay daily moisturizer every day and people consistently card me, or think I'm younger than what I look like- I just turned 35yrs old. I think my young look is definitely attributed to the daily use of Olay face moisturizer. I highly recommend that all girls and ladies use this product."
A loyal customer for 10 years (daily use) but whatever changed in formulation is not giving same results. switched from another lotion after trying a friend's bottle ~10 years ago and being amazed it was actually clearing up my otherwise frustrating facial skin. Please change formulation back!! As others mention also don't like re-branding - guessing company cost saving measures (removing colored ink and bulk ingredient savings) but may be short-sighted.
I agree with the reviewer who said the formula was changed AGAIN. I used the sensitive formula for over a decade & loved it. I saw when they switched to chemical spf then went back. Then they changed it yet again around 2015 with a “new look” claim but really they switched the aloe juice to aloe extract & added triethoxycaprylylsine as an extra ingredient. I can't use this anymore—it burns my face (& eyes even tho I don't put this near them). Please bring back the original sensitive formula!
"I used the original gentle formula for 10 years. Olay has changed the formula by replacing some ingredients and using SolaSheer. The new formula is not moisturizing enough and I cannot use Olay anymore. I tried other Olay alternatives such as the total effects feather light moisturizer spf 15, but it is not comparable to the beautiful skin results of the original formula of the complete sensitive spf 15. Olay, please bring back the beloved original gentle formula. It was perfect."
"This is my favorite moisturizer!! I have used this product for years and it is great for my sensitive skin. There's no strong scent and it leaves my face feeling fresh and moisturized. A little bit goes a long way, making the bottle last for a long time too! #contest"
"I have been using this moisturizer for 10+ years! I have a problem with lotions being too heavy or greasy on my face, but I find this one very light. I love that it has sunscreen and minimal smell--I am sensitive to smells. It's also very reasonably priced. I use other Olay beauty products too! #contest"
"I've used this lotion for over 10 years. It's great! I have sensitive skin that usually prefers expensive Sephora brands. This is just as good as any $40 moisturizer carried in department stores. The lotion doesn't have a strong scent and doesn't cause any reactions to my skin. It's also not too thick or runny. Lastly, it does very well under makeup. I love it!"

"I want to start by saying this is my first review EVER!! That's how In LOVE I am with this product. I remember my mother using this since I was a child. I have been using this DAILY since I was 16 and I am now 39. I'm always getting compliments on my skin and on how I look like 10 years younger, thanks Oil of Olay!!!"
I live in the Middle East where it's air cons everywhere you go. My skin is parched and couldn't find any cream that suits my dry-combination sensitive skin that won't clog my pores or break me out. I tried all sorts of expensive brands and none of them worked. Finally bought this from a local supermarket and I'm stoked to see the results from such an inexpensive product. It didn't break me out nor clog my pores. Super happy with how well it moisturizes my skin and leaves the skin plump.
"I've been using this moisturizer complete with SPF 15 FOR OVER 10 YRS NOW, I LOVE IT N I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE. IT'S GOT VITAMINS E B3 & C IN IT N I LOVE TO USE IT ON MY FACE N NECK. THANKS OLAY MY FACE LOOKS SO YOUNG BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME ABOUT HOW YOUNG I LOOK N I'M 58 NOW. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK U R DOING ! THANKS !"
"I've struggled with break outs, extreme combination skin, and redness for as long as I can remember. I bought the cleanser and this lotion and my skin hasn't been the same since. Since switching I've found my break outs to be purely hormonal and minimal at that. My skin is much more even in terms of tone and texture and I have noticed the redness I used to experience and stress over is not that noticeable now!"
I really like this moisturizer for its formula and the way it makes my skin feel. I appreciate that zinc oxide is used for its sunscreen ingredients and that it's fragrance-free. I also like how it's quite moisturizing and prefer to use it during the colder months.
I love complete all day moisturizer I use it everyday. I started using it about 12 years ago and never had to buy a different brand.This moisturizer works great and does not make my skin red as I have very sensitive skin. Thanks for the great product!!

"I've been using Oil of Olay since my 20's. I am 63, spent a lot of time in the Sun and proud to admit it my age. I tell every young lady I know to use it. Someday when they're my age they will remember me and thank me for having the beautiful face they'll be proud of also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay products for over twenty years. When the sensitive with sunscreen became available I decided to try it. I love the fact that it is unscented and protects the skin from harmful rays. I am fifty seven years old and have been mistaken for forty many times. I think Olay products are the reason people are surprised at my age. Thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 51 and I have been using Oil of Olay since I was 15. My mother used it before me. People constantly tell me I don't look my age. Some have told me they thought I was only in my late 30's. Some say it's good genes but I give all the credit to Oil of Olay. You have such a wide variety of products for all skin types and no greasy feel. I have always loved Oil of Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works wonders. I had a very deep frown line in my forehead. I had tried other products, but there was no change. I finally chose Oil of Olay moisturizer. I liked that it had sunscreen because I was in the sun a lot and wanted the protection. In only about 2-3 weeks I started noticing that the frown line was not as deep. Before long it was basically gone. I will swear by this product forever ( as long as it continues to work so well). Thank you for such a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product since I was a teenager and I'm in my fortys now,and I also shared this product with my daughter when she was a teenager and she will not use anything else. Thank You for keeping our skin looking great!!!!!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The oil of Olay with 3% zn Oxide and NO orher chemical suncreens is great! It is the only sunscreen I use and as a readhead it is VERY effective. I can not use othe sunscreen chemicals, so really depend on the Zm oxide ONLY formulation with the nano particle size so it's not white on the scin Because I use it, I know the sun protection it provides is much higher that the SPF 16 tested- reality vs a test result! Please leep it in your line!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Complete All-Day Moisturizer since the 1970's - I started with the sunscreen - Sensitive as soon as I became aware of them. I am now 70+ and no one believes me when I tell them my age. I give all the credit for my skin condition to Oil of Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF- Sensitive. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was used by mother-in-law who had beautiful skin. She used it faithfully every night and never showed her age. She died at 82 and was alway complimented on her beautiful skin. I'm trying to do that so I use it every day and usually 2 to 3 times. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this sunscreen on my hands and arms daily. It has adequate UV protection and it keeps my skin from drying out. It I have used it for years due to its effectiveness and its affordability for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product can be very well absorbed very quickly. It doesn't make your face oily at all. I am a person who needs sun protection daily, so I put on some high SPF sun screen cream over this product. The product doesn't mess up your make up either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay Complete since it came out. I love the fact that it is safe for sensitive skin, the SPF 15 sunscreen and the fact that it is so light I often forget I have even put it on. This is the BEST product I have ever used on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used their products for 20 years. My skin is clean and smooth. I have had little problems with aging and I am often told I look younger than I am. I attribute this to the great skin care lines of oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In the line of products for sensitive skin by Olay, this is daily moisturizer is another success. It is unscented, which makes it perfect to use on my skin with fragrance allergy. It is great ti use either in the morning or in the evening, after cleansing. The SPF15 is another great benefit for use during the day, to protect from sunburn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for the last 25+ years. If it had the sunscreen in it when I started, I'm not sure, but I can say with certainty that I love this moisturizer, and it does not cause my skin to break out like other products I have tried. I now pair it with another OLAY ""Regenerist"" product, but there is hardly ever a day that I do not apply this SPF 15 sensitive product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoy this light moisturizer, and have been using it for many years. It is low priced and does the job. I don't particularly require a lot of moisture to my skin, so I appreciate the lightness of this moisturizer. I do have sensitive skin, and am allergic to many products, so I appreciate Olay making a sensitive skin moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15-Sensitive is easy to put on. With some sunscreen you have to do a lot of rubbing to get it worked into your skin but this product is not like that. You only have to use a little to go a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used oil of Olay for years and plan not to ever try change. I have many people compliment me on how nice my skin looks. I tell them I owe it to Oil of O'lay I use it daily and a regenerist micro-sculpting cream at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this moisturizer every day for years. The first thing I do when I get out of the shower is moisturize my face. It feels great and lasts all day. I will continue to use this as long as it is produced. I am told many times that I do not look my age (70) because I have very soft skin and no lines. Thank you, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for over 40 yrs before it became ""complete"" w/sunscreen. Even my dermatologist confirmed my opinion that this was good for my skin- and the sunscreen makes it even better. I use it in morning after cleansing and at night after cleasening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am sixty-four years young & will not trade my Olay Moisturizer with SPF 15 protection for any other product. I have used it for many years & my skin looks great, feels soft & I am told there is no way I am sixty-four years of age. I know the SPF will protect my skin when I am out in the sun & this to me is so important. Thank you for making it a priority for women of all ages to feel there best & also look there best. I truly love my Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE Olay products. I have been using them faithfully for 30 plus years! I constantly receive compliments on my ""beautiful skin"" at age 51, I look like I'm 31!! OLAY is my first pick for beautiful, affordable, healthy skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was 14 years of age when my grandmother who was dutch, gave me a bottle of Olay daily and said she uses this only. With the cold weather in Holland that's all she used, and since then, for 35 plus years that's all I have ever used. My skin is fine, no great. That should tell you what an excellent product this is. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I find this product absorbs in seconds and leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day. It is light and fluid and you really don't need more than a tiny amount each time. It makes a nice base before applying my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this product daily. It provides great moisturizing effect and one gets the SPF protection. This protection comes in handy as many of us forget to use SPF on overcast days, even though we need sun protection on those days too. The face and neck are always exposed! I am excited to see there is now an SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product for individuals with sensitive skin. You can still get protection from the sun and keep your skin soft and smooth without perfumes or other ingredients that clog your pores. I highly recommend it!! It is much better than other name brands that cost much, much more. Thank you Olay. :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this reasonably priced moisturizer for years, and I'm going to be 69 yrs. this September 2015, and friends & family remark how beautiful my skin looks. And they are astonished when I tell them I use Olay and the price. I've tried other well know expensive brands and always to back to Olay products since they do the same job and a lower price. Thanks to you Olay I received many compliments of my facial skin and neck line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Oil of Olay for over 30 years. I have tried other brands, only to immediately realize there is nothing better. I get positive comments about my skin all the time. I think I can thank Oil of Olay for that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Olay Complete for Sensitive skin with SPF is the only moisture I have used for forty plus years. I have allergies to certain chemicals and fragrances and found this product perfect for me. Since I am a senior my skin seems to need more moisture. I am happy that it has the PFT that protects. I can walk outside knowing I am protected from the sun. Being fragrance free is a added bonus.

"I have used All Day Moisturizer for a great many years. I am 70 years now and I think I have used it since I was 40. I have been without it once and my skin was so dry and cracked that I cried. It keeps my skin so smooth and soft that I think I am going on 30 years. I will never change moisturizers, I am Olay branded. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried many facial moisturizers including professional brands that cost 2-3 times as much as Olay. I keep coming back to the Complete All Day Moisturizer. My skin feels great without feeling greasy or heavy. It's light enough to wear under make up or alone. And the spf is a must. Great product, great price. You can't go wrong.

"I have been using Olay products for more than 10 years, even introduced to my mother and sister as well.

I have used this product for over 10 years and have not found one comparable both in product and price. Love the way it feels on my skin. Goes on quickly and smoothly. I know I have the added benefit of SPF. Does not clog the pores or leave me greasy feeling. Use under my BB cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For over forty years I have been using Olay complete Moisturizer. When it came out with sunscreen added, I changed to that. As I aged I changed to Olay Complete Moisturizer with SPF 15 for sensitive skin. It has never failed me and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay moisturizer since I was a teenager and I am know 52. It is not greasy and is kind to my sensitive skin. The added sunscreen is a benefit since I spend alot of time outside and don't always remember to use sunscreen on my face. I love Olay and really can't say enough good things about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My grandmother., mother, myself and now my daughter use Olay moisturizer. My grandmother looked wonderful at 90 when she passed away and she used Olay for as long as I was old enough to remember. Since my teens I have used Olay moisturizer every day and now I am 43. I have never tried anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried other products, however none compare to Oil of Olay. I love how it makes my skin feel. And I especially love that it has sunscreen in it too. Most women would cringe at the thought of putting sunscreen on their face, but this is amazing. Goes on smooth and isn't greasy. I have very sensitive skin, and Olay makes a Complete lotion for sensitive skin. By far, the best skincare line that's on the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Oil of Olay for many, many years. My mom has always used it for as long as I can remember. It makes my skin feel so soft and subtle. My husband always compliments me on my beautiful skin which, to me, is the best reason to continue using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A few years ago I found that sunscreens were ruining all of my clothing. I learned from Olay that it's because Avobenzone is now used in most of them. Olay All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Sensitive doesn't have avobenzone and doesn't stain my clothes like other sunscreens. Since sunscreen is essential, I am committed to using Olay Complete, which feels good on the skin and helps me avoid skin cancer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this every day after scrubbing with the complete cleanser. It moisturizes my skin like no other lotion has. It isn't greasy and I can put my makeup on right over it immediately after applying. I love what it is doing for my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this moisturizer for 10+ years in combination with Olay cleansers, toners, Olay regenerist serum and eye roller. I am 58 years old and have no wrinkles. I believe Olay has played a huge part in that! The products are great and comparable to many department store products that are much more expensive. I recommend them to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the creamy texture of Complete moisturizer. Goes on quickly and cleanly, so I can follow immediately with my foundation. Lasts ALL day without any greasy feeling. Perfect protection for my face when I""m outside for hours. This moisturizer does its job.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product for years. It's light and goes on smooth making it perfect before putting on my makeup. No one ever believes I'm old enough to have a thirty year old son. I thank Olay for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the fact that Olay makes moisturizers for sensitive skin, as my skin is very sensitive to fragrance! The sunscreen is also a big plus. This moisturizer makes my face feel soft but goes on clear and doesn't go on gloppy. A great overall moisturizer for daytime! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is without a doubt the best daily moisturizer. It is not at all greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft. Protects from the sun as you go about your daily activities. It's a staple for me and goes on first thing every morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I watched my mom use Oil of Olay products my whole life so no surprise that I would choose this product also. She had beautiful skin! I like this one because I get sunscreen and it's light. Great base for my make-up, too. Thanks for continuing to produce great products for skin care at any age! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Oil of Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15-Sensitive since I was about 17 and I will be 50 this year. I have been told by many people that I don't look my age and what is my secret. I tell them it is Oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"what can I say, my grandmom started me on Pink Oil of Olay that came in a glass square bottle. I've been using this standard ever since. I am always getting compliments on my skin and how young I look. Is it Olay or good genes? I think it's both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Excellent lightweight moisturizer with sunscreen for morning. It's the only lotion i have found with a sunblock that is also unscented for sensitive skin. I use all Olay products and have been very happy with them for years. Tried other brands but always go back to Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have used Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer for twenty years and it is the best product I have ever used. It is light weight and absorbs instantly, leaving my skin feeling moist and smooth. The smell is not overpowering and it is gentle on my skin. I have tried other lotions, but nothing compares to Olay Complete. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product!! It makes your skin so soft and I get great results when I'm in the sun. I'm always recommending it to family and friends. One time I couldn't find it anywhere around where I live so I wrote to e-mailed to find out where I could find it. It was months before I found it again!! Great product that I will use for a long time!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ourdoor seniors like me need light but powerful moisture protection as well as basic sun protection.

"I have used Oil of Olay facial lotion for over 20 years. At age 41, I get compliments on my skin and appearance. The added benefit of spf is truly a bonus. This is a non-greasy, lotion that I make sure to wear every day, under my make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My mom used this product and I use it and now my daughter has started using it. I find it hydrates my skin without clogging my pores and even though I use a bit of sunscreen, I think this product provides additional sun protection. After coming home from Florida last week, my friend wanted to know if I was using botox for crowsfeet. I told her no, and recommended Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have an issue with a sun allergy on my face. I have tried many high SPF suntan lotions, including those for babies. The only thing that works is the Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with SPF 15. You'd think it wouldn't be enough, since it is only SPF 15, but it works better than the 60+ I have tried. Great to use every day as a moisturizer, too!

"I have used Olay since I turned 18, and upgraded to Complete All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF15 - Sensitive when it first came out. This product provides the moisture & sunscreen my sensitive skin needs without feeling greasy. I recently turned 60 & people can't believe I am ""That Old""! I know this product has a lot to do with this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have highly sensitive skin, and allergic to many scents. I was hesitant to try another moisturizer, that would irritate my skin, or the scent to cause an allergic reaction. I have used many Oil of Olay products and have been satisfied. Once again, I am excited to be able to use this product with no reactions or something or problems. Kudos for making products for those of us with sensitive skin and allergies!!! Thank you!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Complete All Day moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 allows me to feel secure that I am protecting my face from harmful rays of the sun. the smooth feel it gives my face makes me feel like it is being absorbed well. I don't really need the ""sensitive"" kind but use it so as not to add any ingredients to my skin that would make it appear reddened or blotchy, as in an allergic reaction.

"First, I love Olay products without a doubt, but as I get older I need more protection and thought I had found it with all day protection normal. It's hard to find, so I use sensitive. It's the next best thing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Oil of Olay moisturizer every day for as long as I can remember. I always have a bottle waiting; I can't run out. It is part of my daily ritual and my only one. I am not one for makeup. I am 72 years old now and figure I have been using it for about 50 years. People think I am younger than my years. It is all because of my daily use of Oil of Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for many years. When I was in my early 20""s my mother told my to start using Olay moisture on my face and my face wouldn't get so many lines and wrinkles. I took her advise because she had a lovely skin. Now I am in my 60""s and asked by pother friends what I use on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product because when it is applied to the skin does not leave the skin feeling oily. I live in a hot climate (Florida) so this product is perfect for me because makes me look natural even when I sweat and it does not accumulate the sweat underneath the product.

I am very low maintenance woman & fuss free and on the go. Oil of Olay all day moisturizer does the trick for me it is light & covers well. When I was in college I spent lots of money at the beauty counter. I wish I could have the money back that I spent all I need is Oil of Olay moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I first tried this product over 10 years ago when the name changed (from ""Oil of Olay"" to just ""Olay"") since I was familiar with the old ""Oil of Olay"". It was good that P & G improved alot for this brand since it already had a following. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a pale redhead who burns in minutes. This is a great everyday moisturizer and sunscreen that doesn't leave a greasy film on my skin. This moisturizer doesn't cause breakouts and absorbs quickly while keeping the sun at bay. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you have skin issues - sensitive, redness or itchy, this is a good product to use. It's not too heavy and only needs one application. It has no fragrance and so few products fit this requirement and actually work. It's easy to put on in the morning and leave it on all day. Try it and like it.

I have been using this for years. I have a fair completion and very sensitive skin. I can not use anything heavy on my face. I use this year round even during the winter and have had wonderful results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have used this many yrs. Love the non-greasy feel. Use it 2x a day. Morning and evening after my shower and evening. I also use enough for my neck and decollette area. Nice fresh smell and creamy feel. My skin immediately feels nourished and hydrated(not dry). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay's Complete All Day Moisturizer with SPF15 is a fantastic value. I use it everyday. It's a great foundation with sunscreen protection. It comes in a variety of skin types. I usually use either Nornal or Sensitive. I take it with me for use everytime I wash my face; it's part of refreshed glow. It is quickly absorbed and worked wonderfully! Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it has some good qualities like its lightness and non greasiness. I would rather it was more creamy. it does not seem to dry out my face and it may hydrate it a little. but I don't fhi I it moisturizers it much either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Complete All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Sensitive leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized as it protects from the sun's harmful rays even when I am indoors or out on a cloudy day in the rainy weather. When I put this lotion on in the morning, it immediately relieves that dry feeling, yet is light and feels great on my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an excellent moisturizer. My husband's grandmother always used Oil of Olay and she was beautiful. There are so many choices for moisturizers - but, I stick with Oil of Olay. I also love the added benefit of SPF - it is so necessary and good to know it is in my morning lotion. I would prefer SPF30 - but, it is a bit harder to find. This lotion - I apply every day. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Complete is a great all around moisturizer. I use it every day and it keeps my face and neck looking great. It is easy to use and absorbs quite well and is non-greasy. It is nice to have such a versatile moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my everyday go to. I do not start a day without it. It goes on easy and gives great UV protection so you never have to worry about being outdoors. I have used this lotion everyday since college and although I won't tell you how long ago that was, I am always being told I look younger than my years. Thank you Olay.

"Although this product seems a little watery, it absorbs very quickly and does not clog pores. It goes on very smoothly, again a little watery, but seems to work very well. I would use it again and recommend it to others. I picked the sensitive skin kind, so it would be a little less harsh and it does not cause any irritations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is great! Wear it under my make up and on my bare face. My skin glows! My teenage son and husband are both using it daily to protect their face from sun damage. Highly recommend this product for whole family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has been my go-to moisturizer for years...and the one I always come back to after trying others from time to time. It is light yet penetrating, and the sensitive skin formula has no fragrance or irritants, making it safe to use around eyes. I can use it alone or as a base under make-up, and it does not clog my pores or make my face shiny. A classic product for a reason! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Soft, gentle, very well absorbing All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Sensitive keeps your skin young, clean and good looking for years.

"I have very sensitive skin and this product is absolutely perfect for it. Most facial lotions break my face out and make it appear greasy, but not this product! It provides great all day moisture without feeling heavy. And since my skin also burns very easily its nice to have a SPF for everyday protection. LOVE LOVE LOVE it.

This is a Must for me to use everyday!! I use it as soon as I get out of the shower and it really helps my dry skin. The SPF is great too because we all need protection from the sun every time we step outside and the sunscreen in this product works! It feels good knowing when I go outside that my face is protected from the sun and we know that not only can sunscreen help protect us from skin cancer but also help premature aging.

"I have very dry/sensitive skin and this moisturizer is excellent in treating these issues. I apply this in the mornings before applying my make up and it leaves me skin with a dewy finish, just how I like. It is not greasy, no strong scent, and has not caused break outs. I have bought 2 bottles of this moisturizer so far and it lasts a really long time! I see myself making this my holy grail face lotions for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this moisturizer since January and I think it's better than those expensive moisturizers I buy. I noticed a difference in my skin, more so than other expensive lines I've tried in the past. I am also using the Regenerist at night and the luminous serum after moisturizing."
I love the Complete All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15– Sensitive! I've been using it for about a year and absolutely rave about it. I have very sensitive skin and can't wear most sunscreens or moisturizers on my face. It takes a special product so that I don't break out in rashes or acne. This does the trick and keeps my skin looking beautiful!
Thank you for returning to the original formula for Sensitive Skin. I think I must have been one of the first ones to call Customer Service last year stating that eyes were stinging with the re-formulated brand. I love the old formula it works well doesn't feel greasy does not have a scent that makes my eyes water. I use it as do both my teenage girls before any foundation is applied. Please keep this formula and think about a better price. The bottle has decreased in size and the price has gone up.
I wore the original formula about twenty years ago and got many compliments on my glowing skin. I am thrilled to see it back! I love the zinc oxide in the formula I can trust as long as it doesn't change again.Sometimes we cannot improve on what is already excellent. Please consider making a night firming formula or something complete for all ages. I think gentle and non irritating is what everyone loves. Thanks again for returning something I love.
"I was pleased with the feel of my skin after using the Olay Complete with SPF 15. It has a nice scent, and it is barely noticeable (feeling) on my skin after I apply it. I use topical medication on my face 20 minutes prior to applying Olay Complete, and the Olay Complete does not aggravate my skin or counteract the medication. I am so pleased to have the SPF already in the product because I have had sun damage over the years."
"This stuff makes your skin soooo soft and is NOT GREASY at ALL. Use it around your eyes, it helps prevent or reduce thse wrinkles and doesn't burn or make your eyes water if you happen to get a little in your eyes. Use it anywhere to moisten without the greasy feeling, completely absorbes into your skin! Been using it for YEARS!!! SAM'S 2-pack is also the CHEAPEST way to buy it!!!"
"I hated all face sunscreen because I would always get terrible blocked pores and acne (even cystic). I finally found the one. The sensitive skin one I use is very light weight and doesn&#39;t cause me any problems. It doesn&#39;t feel like sunscreen is on, with that mask-like feeling. You may need to reapply if you&#39;re sunbathing or sweating. Oh yeah, it doesn&#39;t really burn the eyes like so many do. I was happy to find my miracle!"
"I used Olay as a teen but then switched to more expensive brands. My skin has changed and became extremely sensitive with age. I now use this product in Sensitive. It is great! Lightweight but seriously moisturizing. The SPF will be tested during the summer months, but I have faith it will hold up to the test.(Most with SPF's break me out with the first use, but not this one.)"
My intention was to buy the combination/oily formula but it wasn't available. I figured the sensitive formula couldn't hurt. I bought the renegerist trio but the deep hydrating cream was too moisturizing for me during the day. This a great lightweight moisturizer for combination/oily skin!
"I am so glad I tried this moisturizer w/ SPF! It's just what I was looking for to complete my daily face regimen, it is perfect for my fair, sensitive skin - it's moisturizing enough to wear on it's own (without layering with another moisturizer) - and I love that it has zinc in it. I wear it everyday! Thanks again, Olay!"
"This product is okay. I try to use as little as possible on my face and neck until my face feels moisturized. If i use what I would consider a normal amount, it doesn't soak in well and my face looks greasy. If this happens I just take a towel and wipe the rest off of my face. Good for the UV protection, but as an overall moisturizer it's just okay."
"Classic sensitive formula is back!!! I almost cried when I found it on the shelf....was about ready to give up. I tried store brands with 6% octinoxate 3% zinc oxide and they didn't irritate my skin, but your formula is the best for creamy, non-greasy moisture."
My rating of this product is still 1 star which means Poor (to say nothing of disappointing and unpleasant). But I am very happy to have finally found the reinstated Classic Gentle Formula which deserves 5 stars. Perhaps you will even give the Classic Gentle Formula its own place on this Website.
"You did it again, changed it, this time you lost me for good."
Love this moisturizer
did not like it
"Not the same, ingredients and order, are Not the same. There is a reason people love these products, and are faithful users, because of formula. So why change it ?"
"I have used this product all of my adult life. It is the best!!! When I used makeup, this was my foundation, now I don't use makeup and this is all I put on my face after I wash it. It is perfect on my skin!!! I recommend it highly!!!"
"I absolutely love this formula, very gentle on my sensitive skin! I have been using this product for years and has no problem with it!! Hugs! Thank you Olay!!!!!!"
This is the only product with zinc in that doesn't clog my pores and turn my face white. It makes my face glow and the moisturizer is light enough so that your natural skin color shows. Thank you Olay!
"This product is amazing because it helps my skin look smoother, healthier, and I also feel young again. It was the best product I could choose, than the others."
I have sensitive skin and this is the only product I can use on my face without irritations. I have been using this for years and would recommend it to anyone. Excellent product.
