This is the best facial cream Ive had. Its nit greasy or bulky nor feels heavy on ones face. It has a light scent and its smooth. Last the whole day. I put it on every morning.
I bought this a month ago and have been using it daily. I love the fact that it isnt heavy like other cremes. Right off I noticed my skin felt and looked better. More hydrated. It prompted me to try other products in the skin care line. BUT THIS I will not go without. It works.
I've been using philosophy hope in a jar for a few years but ordered this on a whim when my most recent jar was running low. I absolutely love Hello Hydration! I am pushing fifty years old with dry skin living in the desert and this cream is perfection for me. I would highly recommend!
"I bought this about a week ago and I'm in love with how light and moisturizing it is. After using it about a week, every time I wash my face I noticed that my skin felt so much smoother and plump compared to before which I was surprised! My skin also looks brighter as well!"
I received this sample of the product with one of my orders. I was very impressed by the ingredients and decided to buy the full product. I have no complaints it's a good moisturizer and leaves your skin full And smooth. It's lightweight enough to use under your make up. I can definitely see myself purchasing this again.
received this as a sample with an order. Product works well. Super hydrating. Would have ordered several jars of this product except the heavy perfumey fragrance just ruined it for me. I keep hoping companies can just keep the fragrance out or let customer choose between fragrance or unscented. ugh
"I received this a a gift a couple of months ago. I'm obsessed with this cream. It's very light, but rich, very moisturizing but not only. I'm having bad dry, flaky skin this winter & this helps immensely. I just order my 3rd jar. Love the ingredients! My skin is sensitive & it responds very well to this cream."
"I recieved a sample in the mail, not expecting much. To my surprise I really love this product! It's so lightweight and comfortable with a light scent. I just bought some more from target. It's a great value and competes with my more expensive moisturizers. I reach for this product often and would recommend to anyone"
"I was using Boots No. 7 serum and day cream, however it was very expensive. I bought this to see how it was and was happily surprised. It is my new holy grail!! I have sensitive skin which is very temperamental. Somedays its dry and others very oily, but since using this along with the booster drops, my skin looks so glowy and pretty. It is light enough to wear under makeup but heavy enough to provide all day moisture."
"I just bought this for the first time. Admittedly, I haven't really used much in the line of moisturizers in the past because they've been super expensive or I didn't like the way they left my skin feeling BUT... This was absolutely fantastic. For 12$ it's a moisturizer that actually leaves my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated and even the smell of it is nice! Definitely will buy again!"
"After I did my entire face routine (toner, serum, etc) , I put this on my face. And its so good! The cream melts in my face immediately and leaves it hydrates for the entire day. It's also very light and doesn't leave that heavy feeling you get when you put on certain lotions or creams I've tried."
"i am super impressed with elf's skin care products. i received a sample of this in one of my orders, decided to give it a try and am very happy i did! light weight but very effective (i am 52 and noticed results in one week). it is absolutely perfect for daytime and i will also use it at night when i'm too lazy to do my whole ""serum"" routine. this is definitely my new go-to moisturizer!"
"I finally bought this after debating for a while and I'm glad I did. When I buy lightweight night creams it can be hard to find a balance between far too rich for my oily skin and so light my skin doesn't get enough out of it. This cream is the perfect level of light richness for my oily skin, both at night and under make up! The fact that it smells lightly of sour peach candy is a fantastic bonus too :D"
I absolutely love this! The only thing that would make this 5/5 would be making it fragrance free. Please elf make this happen!!
"AMAZING!! Total Tatcha dupe with this one! It smells, feels and works the same probably better in my opinion. Sinks right into the skin and don't leave you feeling greasy at all."
I've been liking this so far. It's creamy without being too heavy and makes my skin very soft. It lies beautifully under makeup (I let it sink in for at least 5 minutes before makeup) and leaves me hydrated but not greasy.
"I love this product - it is lightweight while being hydrating, fragrance level is perfect and ever since I've been using it I've had compliments on how good my skin looks!"
This stuff is truly amazing! It's thick but doesn't leave your face shiny at all...such a great hydrating moisturizer for the price! Will be buying regularly.
"i bought this two weeks ago and was so happy with it from the first use! this is so lightweight, not at all oily, but creamy in a good way. my skin absorbs it all and i use it every day!! fully reccommend it! the scent isn't too strong either."
"There are so many fun ELF skin care products I want to try, but those of us with very sensitive skin/reactive skin have to pretty much google every single ingredient list for possible bad ingredients. Just looking at the first 6 ingredients in this moisturizer, 2 are at the top most level for acne/comedogenic ingredients (Stearyl Heptanoate, Isopropyl Isostearate). The rest follow with a few lower rated bad ingredients - ELF, please consider making a sensitive skin care line!"
"This moisturizer belongs in the category of â€˜elite' creams! First off, you get a LOT of product, the $12 price point is superb! This cream doesn't leave me feeling oily, my skin absorbs the product rather quickly. I use this at night before bed and I've also used it as a primer underneath my makeup for the day. The scent is very minimal, but quite nice I may add. I tend to have an oily T-zone and this product does not add to my oiliness problem areas- thank goodness! Definitely try this stuff, you won't be disappointed."
"I received this from e.l.f. a few weeks ago and I was immediately impressed upon opening the jar. It has a thick, smooth texture and a light and pleasant fragrance. I have been using it consistently since receiving it and I will definitely be purchasing. It hasn't broken me out, and it's quite hydrating."
"I was hesitant about this cream since my skin is oily, dry, prone to break outs and is ageing as I am 40 years old. I have been using it every day for 2 weeks and my skin is better than ever. I love it! I have not had one pimple, and my complexion is more even. This cream has helped balance my oily skin and I don't ever want to be with out it. I hope this review helps. :)"
"I want to first say, I have used this every-day twice a day for two weeks (+). This is a high quality moisturizer with a drug store price. This absorbs in the skin almost instantly. It's very lightweight, plumps the skin and keeps me hydrated all day! I have dry skin that flakes because it's so dry! This moisturizer keeps the flakes away. Love it. Try it!"
"I have dry skin after years of combo skin. Getting older is not always kind to your skin. I got this unexpected gift and thought why not? So smooth going on, I love it! I have been using this almost a month and my skin just loves it. I have Rosacea so not all creams are good, but this has been wonderful. Love it!"
"I've been using this cream for a few weeks now and I love it! It's so hydrating and makes my skin feel so soft and plump. I use it overnight after I cleanse to lock in moisture.The packaging is nice and there is a very light, fresh smell that disappears after you put it on. I would recommend this product, especially if you have normal to dry skin. It's like a leave in deep conditioner for your skin."
"This cream does feel hydrating upon applying, and stays nicely on the skin. However after consistent use day & night for 3 days my face broke out immediately. I have rash-like bumps all over my face. No thanks! Ingredients not that great for sensitive skin. I have combo dry skin that's very sensitive to most active ingredients, Cetaphil daily advance lotion works great for me so I'll be going back to that."
"I am really happy with the results of this moisturizer. Lots of great high end ingredients. There is dimethicone though. I have oily combo skin and the hydration was perfect for my type. If you are extra dry, this needs a layer or mix in, like one of the ELF oils. I received this as a wonderful unexpected gift."
"I've been using this for a good week or so and it's been amazing. I can see my skin plump and smooth out as I am putting it on and the effects after a week, I can't believe. This versus a high end brand - there's no real difference except the name and maybe fancy packaging. I have been using it as my night cream. When I wake up and go to wash my face, my face is still hydrated. I also have sensitive skin and it hasn't bothered it at all. Amazing. Highly recommended. Thank you e.l.f.!!!"
This moisturizer is the best one e.l.f. has released so far! It is very lightly scented and did not bother my acne prone and sensitive skin. It isn't the most hydrating moisturizer I've used but it's perfect as a day cream. It also takes a small amount of product to cover the entire face making this very cost effective.
"Can we please give this product the big gold trophy it deserves?? Because this is honestly the best moisturizer I've ever used. My skin is so soft and supple everyday, I feel that I absolutely glow after using this face cream. HELLO Hydration, and welcome to the family!"
"When I first tried this product, it was in the jet set hydration kit that I bought. I loved it so much that I had to buy the bigger product! This cream is smooth, a little heavy weighted, but it feels refreshing on my skin (combination of oily and dry)."
I 100% recommend this product.
"This is 100% a dupe for First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream and is in my opinion SO much better. This product is so lightweight and gives so much hydration, and a little goes such a long way. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry skin or even easonal dry skin (like me)."
"I love this cream! When I bought it, I was afraid it would be heavy and oily, but it is super light and makes my skin feel great. I used it after cleansing with elf Gel Melt Cleanser and, and my face was noticeably softer even the next morning. Love it!"
"I received this about a month ago, and I am SOLD! This goes on smooth, low-scent, and absorbs into my thirsty skin so quickly. I have an issue with dry, flakey skin around my mouth area in the winter and so far, that hasn't happened this time. No redness and low-scent makes my day!"
"I'm dealing with both acne and fine lines right now, and this moisturizer is amazing. It didn't clog my pores, felt light and non-greasy, and diminished the appearance of the lines around my eyes. My skin tone evened out and brightened, too. This is my new fave!"
I've been using this product for about two weeks and it has absolutely impressed me in every way. It was instantaneous. My skin gets extremely dry in the winter and this product has changed that. I am in love. I use it in the morning occasionally and every night before bed. It has definitely hydrated my skin and the scent is incredible. I am a forever user of this product!
"I bought this 3 weeks ago and I am sooo shocked! For 12 $ this moisturizer kicked my 38$ higher end moisturizer out of the game. Not only does it apply beautifully but it makes my skin feel plump and glowing! I use it day and night. Also, lets take a moment to appreciate the fact that a little goes A LONG WAY! Such an amazing find and so thankful I found this."
"I really like this stuff, I don't think it breaks me out or anything and it goes on very smoothly. I got it as like a dupe for Drunk Elephant polypeptide protini and I think it has similar effects. My skin definitely feels more hydrated and it kind of plumps skin in a good way around my eyes. I did have some issues with applying Rosehip oil on top because it pilled up some but I think as a daily moisturizer this is going to be bomb under sunscreen or makeup. Tbh anything that doesn't break me out and is animal cruelty free is 5 stars from me!"
I have sensitive skin that's get very dry in the winter time. Different moisturizers I've tried either sit on top of my dry skin or don't leave my skin hydrated for very long. This one absorbed very well and my face no longer feels dry at all! A little bit seemed to go a long way as well
This is my first time purchasing this product and it does everything as promised. My face feels incredibly smooth and hydrated; the skin around my eyes feels bouncy and rejuvenated. Deeply moisturizing without an oily feel. Easily dissolves into the skin. Packaged beautifully. LOVE this moisturizer.
"I just received this in the mail. Winter in upstate NY plays havoc on my skin. I used this for the first time tonight and I am in love! My face feels so soft, and hydrated. I have tried a bunch of moisturizers and almost every one makes my face burn. This just feels good. I will definitely reorder this, please never change this!"
"I am HOOKED! This is the best skin care cream I have ever tried! Not greasy and absorbs right into my skin leaving it feeling soft, moisturized, refreshed even looks much better as since I've been using this every morning and night! This is the best!!! I've had no dry spots like ih normally get this time of year."
"elf so graciously sent this to me and as soon as I saw all the skincare packed inside I was pumped. After almost 2 weeks of twice daily usage I'll say this: hands down the best face cream I've tried. The ONLY way this could be improved upon is to add a sunscreen. For daytime use I've been waiting till its absorbed, that happens rapidly as well, and then applying my sunscreen if it's a no makeup day. At night I save this for the last step and OMG does it seal all the other products in! I'm sold and will FOREVER keep this in stock."
"Always on the hunt for a new moisturizer. I was very excited to try this one. It has a very heavy scent, but I tried it anyways. A few days into use I noticed I was getting very small pimples near my eye area. It was very annoying and they took months to fully disappear (I had to pop them). I gave the product away."
"I just bought this and I love, love, love it."
It is a whipped moisterizer and you only need to use a finger tip amount and the moment you put it on you can feel it working insitly.
"I have very sensitive skin, and this product feels amazing. I will definitely be buying this again."
"I have sensitive combination skin and I used a sample product and knew I had to buy it. Unfortunately it's sold out, but after trying it I noticed a big difference with my skin. It hydrates so well. It doesn't leave a gross residue after applying it at all. Please restock this soon!"
"So far, I have not had a reaction to this cream. That is insanely rare. Fingers crossed, will check back in a few weeks! I adore the way it makes my skin feel after using it. I have rosacea and can get eczema on the drop of a dime. If this works out, this is a miracle cream. It has surpassed many already."
I have oily skin so I wanted to try this product but I broke out after a week of using this. I want to like this product and the price is great it hydrates and absorbs well onto my skin. A little goes a long way but I hope ELF will come out with a hydrating gel version of this it would be great for oily skin folks like me. I passed mines along to my sister. I went back to my Laneige water bank hydrating gel.
"I didnt my buy this , it was a free sample . I have sensitive skin. I put this on 3 times now and each time my skin stung . The stinging does go away and it does leave my face soft. But I will not be purchasing this. I love a lot to elf products , this isn't one."
It's a nice moisturizer for the price but I wish brands wouldn't ruined skin care products by adding fragrance to everything. It always irritates my skin and it's actually not good for our skin.
Super moisturizing and has lightweight formula that doesn't leave behind a greasy residue! Has a light fresh scent that I enjoy. I have oily skin and this product doesn't make me more oily like other products do.
"I bought this about a month ago and I've been using it everyday. I find that this doesn't hydrate my skin the way I need it too. Sure there is some hydration, but my skin is very dry and this has done nothing to minimize my dry patches."
I wanted to like this so bad! Its awful! Skips across my face when applying and pills up upon drying. I will not repurchase. Better products on the market for $12.00!
I received this product a few weeks ago and instantly fell in love. My skin has been super dry since I got pregnant and this has really helped to keep my skin moisturized all day! I will definitely make this a permanent part of my skin care routine.
"I have combo skin and I love this! Fast absorbing, non greasy, and very hydrating. Nice packaging. Would definitely repurchase and I highly recommend! If you're sensitive to fragrance, it's VERY light and goes away quickly"
I bought this while trying to find something to take care of my flaky skin but not break me out at the same time. I have the complete set and this is literally the only thing that has ever worked for me!
"This is, without a doubt, a great moisturizer. It keeps the skin hydrated all day. If you have skin that is not prone to acne, get it. However, if you do get acne, beware. It broke my chin area out in cystic acne really bad."
one of the workers at elf recommended this to me after mentioning I needed a moisturizer that wasn't going to agitate my skin. This product was sooooo good better than the performance of cetaphil and ceraVe face moisturizers did on my sensitive skin. I used it everyday twice a day and my skin looked hydrated and smooth when using. There's a lot of product in it surprisingly and pretty inexpensive for having all those good ingredients got your skin. 1000000/10
"I bought this lotion about two months ago and I'm never going back to another lotion. I was having serious problems with my skin. I had dry patches under my eyes, on my eyelids, and on my cheeks. I ditched my old moisturizer and tried out this one. A week later my dry patches were gone! I have been using this ever since. It is a little pricey for me but it's totally worth it. I have sensitive skin too and its very moisturizing."
"I am very picky with face moisturizers because my skin is dry and sensitive, but tends to get oily as the day goes on. This sinks into the skin SO NICELY after I wash my face and leaves my feeling fresh, hydrated, and not greasy. Highly recommend especially given the price!"
"I've been using this creme consistently for approximately 3 weeks. It's light, refreshing, and easily absorbed. I have combination skin and it works very well for it. I'm highly impressed, honestly. My skin tone has been more even and my skin super soft. For the price and the quality, I definitely recommend it."
"I bought this based strictly off my curiousity and the good reviews i read. I honestly forgot i ourchased it until my package arrived, and i think ive used it every day since. I have above average sensitive skin as well as mild perioral dermatitis. This really keeps the dryness down without over moisturizing other areas of my face. It sinks into my skin and just leaves it soft, period. No extra slickness, or greasiness or stickiness. I will definitely be ordering more. Oh and a little goes a long ways!"
"I was cautious, but grateful I bought this. I usually only buy face lotion with SPF."
"After a couple days of this my complexion noticeable improved. After wearing it a while, I put on my Olay with SPF, and it did not feel as comfortable as ELF. I couldn't believe how much better this was."
"I started using this, and then just adding spf as needed. The best my 36 year old skin has looked."
It absorbs into my skin without being oily or wet. Doesn't make me break out (I have sensitive skin) which is always a plus!
Not a strong fragrance either which I love.
"Got a sample of this and I am in LOVE! I have super sensitive skin so it's hard to get products that work for my skin, and next to impossible to get affordable products that don't react, and once again ELF nailed it!"
"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. It hydrates and smooths and doesn't break me out, and my skin is really sensitive and"
break-outy. <3 <3
The cream is so hydrating! I have very dry and sensitive skin so any creams that are oily I instantly break out . But with this cream my face feels hydrated and bouncy all day. This does not feel sticky at all. this is my everyday face cream.
I've been using this for the past week after cleansing and before makeup. It keeps my skin from drying out over the course of the day and helps my makeup stay smooth. It has a delicate pleasing scent and and a very light texture. It feels nice on my skin.
I reordered this after my first try. It would've lasted longer but my daughter loved it too. I'm 51 and my daughter is 26 years old - works beautifully for us.
I have extremely dry skin and this product hydrates. Helps my skin look fresh and bright. I also have sensitive skin and this did not make me breakout.
"Received a sample size with an order. I loved the texture and it was fabulously hydrating, but the strong perfume smell turned me off. Ugh. Too bad. I would have loved to purchase a jar of this. Why do companies still add fragrance to facial products? Yuck"
"I've recently bought this moisturizer at Target wondering what it would be like since I've never tried one from this brand. It's an excellent moisturizer, but it has an extremely thick consistency. It's hard to apply and spread throughout my face, but besides that, it is definitely worth the price point."
I have very sensitive skin & I also have eczema plus I used have a lot of acne
However I have such a dry face and when I began using this immediately my face didn't feel dry ! It felt so hydrated and clean and it doesn't break me out the formula itself is so light but you don't feel it heavy at all ! I love it! I just repurchased a new one !
"purchased over a month ago, use it daily. overall i'm obsessed with everything about it. it is SO moisturizing, i can use it all over my face as a cream or just as an eye cream. its the BEST hands down. and at this price point HOW CAN you go wrong??? keep doin you ELF. you're doin somerhin right! =]"
"I got a sample with my last order and loved it so much I bought the full jar. I have combo to oily skin and it works beautifully for me, I don't find that it feels greasy at all. Very lightweight. I'm not a fan overall of fragranced creams and scrubs but I really like the light scent of this."
"I bought this about 6 weeks ago. I started using it right away. I'm not exaggerating, it fixed my skin within 24 hours. My skin was actually scaly dry. It was awful. This fixed that. I love the light, non- greasy texture. I'm buying like 10 of them, for back up!"
"I always get little skeptic about trying new skin care products. I decided to pick this up based on the reviews, but I also got a sample with my purchase. Let me tell you, I will not get another moisturizer. Little goes a long way, rice size amount covered my whole face. By morning time, my face was so soft and supple. I asked my 19 year old daughter to try it also, and she loves it. I would strongly recommend."
I bought this last week and I received it only 4 days ago and honestly my skin has never looked better. My acne has gone down and my skin is hits glowing and I'm in love. It's really hydrating. it is a little heavy for my liking but the end result is totally worth it. Especially for the price I really reccomend this to anybody that's looking for an affordable face moisturizer.
I bought this maybe a week or 2 and I bought it because my skin was so dry and flaky it hurt just to laugh because my skin was so dry! So I started using this after I cleans (I use neutrogena hydro boost cleanser) and these two go so well together!! It cleared up my dry flaky skin I have some dead skin show up sometimes ! And it cleared up my redness really recommend!!
The past few years ive been trying to find a good face cream and ive tried EVERYTHING and always something was off that i didnt like. I gave this a shot bc its new and marketing looks great and it is PERFECT. It isnt weird and sticky like many creams are. Its so light and airy so when you put it on it doesnt feel like you have 5lbs of lotion on your face which is also a problem that i had with orher brands. It absorbs soooo quick and my face feels so soft and clean afterwards.
Really work at my age I need hydration and this product is on point
I got this and I'm in love! It reminds me of a high end product I used all the time. I have found a new favorite.
This product is awesome for dry skin. Not greasy at all. Very moisturizing. After using this for a few days I can see my skin plumping up.
Elf has done it again! Another amazing product! I have extremely dry skin and my skin soaked this cream up like a glass of water. I also have eczema and this cream is non-irritating which makes me wanna run out and get another tub.
"Smells great, goes on smooth.... But! It sits on top of the skin rather than absorbing and will pill off. It also unfortunately contains dimethicone and that is not an ingredient i enjoy in skin care."
I've been using this for a few weeks now and I love the way my face feels! It's so soft! I also love how it feels going on - no stickiness and it sinks in pretty quickly. I highly recommend it!
"I bought this product at my local Walmart and I kid you not, this moisturizer is so amazing and I honestly can't believe it at such a low price my skin feels so amazing!! I've had this product for about 2 months now and it's still filled to the top. A little bit goes a long way."
I got a sample of this with my ELF order so of course I was happy to try it because I love skincare products. I was not very impressed with the results though. The gel- cream left my face feeling a little tacky and slightly unconfortable. I ended up rinsing it off after. about a half hour.
"Purchased a jar after trying and loving the free sample. Its lightweight, non greasy and give my face the moisture it needs."
Hydrates my face really really well. Absolutely love the smell and the overall feeling it leaves on my skin. Will be purchasing over and over again.
I got a sample of this in one of my previous e.l.f. orders. It sat around for a while but I just decided to use it up. I got three uses out of that little sample and LOVED IT! Going in for the full-size!
"Nice scent. Leaves my face feeling plump and refreshed. Helps keeps my breakouts under control on my sensitive (prone to breakouts) combo skin; dry overall, t-zone oily). Wish there was a bit more product for the price."
"I got a free sample and i absolutely love it! It smells wonderful, my skin feels moisturized but not greasy, and it doesn't cause my skin to become oily. I would definitely recommend!"
"This stuff really works well on my sometimes dry face. I wash my face at night, then I rub this on my face afterwards and it works wonders. If you have dry skin this will work for you! Trust me. I love it."
"This moisturizer is the best one I've used. I have been looking for the perfect moisturizer to use for my combination skin, and this is it! I feel so refreshed when I use it. 10000% recommend."
This product is so great. Moisturizing without feeling heavy/greasy. Smells just like the Soothing Marshmallow mask & the Hydrating Water Essence. So great! Leaves me feeling moisturized all day.
I've been looking for a new moisturizer and think I've found it! This absorbs quickly and doesn't feel oily or like a lotion like some moisturizers. I have combination skin that can be kind of sensitive but i haven't had any issues with this moisturizer. I tried it for a week before writing this just to make sure it wouldn't irritate my skin.
"I received this for free from e.l.f., and even though it was free, my honest review is that I love it! It seemed a little heavy when I put my finger in it, but it went on smoothly and sank into my skin quickly. I have oilier/combo skin, but this didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I can see this becoming a staple in the winter months, but it might be too heavy for summer humidity. We'll have to see how it goes in warm weather, but for now, it's great! Thank you, e.l.f.!"
"It doesn't absorb into the skin very well and when I wake up after putting it on at night my face feels very greasy but tight and dehydrated at the same time. Like most elf skincare products, this is probably best suited for someone who has good skin already."
I had been wanting to try this so I ordered while ordering other items I needed. Based on other reviews I thought it would be heavy & would havd used as a night cream. It's not heavy or greasy at all ! I can use it Day or Night. It soaks right into skin and leaves it feeling soft. I will definately order again. They evwn sent a free sample of it so I gave it to my 20 yr old Daughter to try since I have the jar.
This stuff is really light and non greasy. I really like the light scent of it. soaks in quickly and I have even put my makeup on over it with no issues. Now it does not compare to my all natural thicker lotion but it's a good change up and second best from whats in my cabinet. For the price you cant beat it!
I received this as a sample product when I ordered a couple of items from online. It works wonders! I was able to actually see a difference. My face definitely felt moisturized and hydrated. I would absolutely recommend this product and will be buying in the future!
"I have been using this for about a week now and just love it, it feels so good on my face ."
I have been using this product all summer and it has been very nice even on my oily skin. It is lightweight but very hydrating.
Probably the best affordable moisturizer for dry skin
"This moisturizer is so lightweight but hydrates so well! My skin has never been so soft. I have dry skin with hormonal acne, and with one night my dry patches were gone. It also didnt irritate my mild sunburn."
Leaves my sensitive combo skin feeling plump and refeshed. Keeps my big breakouts away.
I really enjoy this product! Makes me skin soft and hydrated all day. Not too heavy or greasy. My skin just soaks it up! Well done!
Thought I'd give this a try as I was in need of a moisturizer. I'm not disappointed. It feels very nice and a little goes a long way.
It's a good face cream and it absorbs into your skin quick. It's very lightweight. It will leave your skin feeling happy
Love this cream. Keeps my face moist everyday. It's light weight and the packaging is cute and durable
"I really like this cream, it really does make your skin softer and smoother, I will be buying another jar when this one is gone."
This new face cream is amazing it is like a high end moisturizer its thick and creamy . It soaks in and doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin. I'm beyond satisfied with the product and for the price you can not go wrong
I really like this moisturizer. My skin feels very hydrated but not greasy. It really soaks into the skin. Took off 1 star because it doesn't contain a sunscreen
This is very light but extremely hydrating. I have very sensitive combination skin and this helps my dryness without making my skin oily or irritated. I use it as the last step of my night time skin care routine
I received a free sample of this and fell in love! It's a little thick when applying it but then as your skin soaks it up it's not sticky or thick at all. Went out and bought a bottle the next day!
"I got the sample size with purchase and decided to buy the actual size my skin feels fresh and doesn't feel make my face feel clogged to sticky, but fresh."
"I found that less is more with this one. I apply a thin layer am and pm. I don't find it to be sticky, which is a pet peeve of mine. :) I have dry, sometimes sensitive skin."
"You sent this product to me about 3 weeks ago. I have used this cream as my last step in my AM skincare routine. I am finding that you must use only a little amount or it will pill. Also, I am not finding it as hydrating as your daily hydration moisturizer. I would not purchase this product. I am very disappointed."
"I bought this today to try it out tonight. What I usually use is vitamin E oil as a moisturizer. I decided to cleanse my face and then apply this cream, then after apply the oil. Once I applied the oil and rubbed it in slightly, my skin started peeling. Like dead skin peeling. Ugh so upset!! Now I don't know what to think of this product. What u will say is that it is very good at moisturizing. Not good with oils."

I feel like this is a quality face cream for the price & it's not sticky.
easy and effective for my use. will absolutely recommend for all in need of extra moisture
I bought this about month ago. I have tried everything on the market. Best 12$ I ever spent.
My sensitive skin loves this cream. Great hydration.
I have pretty even skin. Not too oily and not too dry and no sensitivity that I know of. I bought this to bring some moisture back after washing my face. After one use I started to break out and started getting red bumpy patches all over my face. Please stay away if you have sensitive skin.
"Feels great but when applied with makeup, it peels."
I really like this moisturizer.
Is perfect por my normal super sensitive skin.
I am so completely disappointed with this face cream. I normally have pretty clear skin. As soon as I started using this I broke out like crazy and it slightly burned as well. I would never recommend this to anyone.
"I just like more of a hydrating face cream, so I'll keep it, but I don't use it daily"
"I was given a free sample with my order-I tried it on freshly washed face and it felt like my face was coated in Vaseline. Thanks for the freebie, but I will stick with my"
"Oil of OLAY Regenerist, hyaloronic (sp) acid without the heavy feel."
I got a sample and used it immediately. I used it for two days in the morning and the night and I got horrible blackheads and pimples. Did moisturize well besides that though so I gave it a second star.
Feels like i dunked my face in water. Love love love.
Perfect for dry skin and it's soo lightweight I highly recommend it
I got this as a sample...and now i have to order some!
Feels very refreshing on the skin! Good for my dry skin.
I have combo oily skin that's been a little drier than normal. The ingredients look promising however it is not hydrating at all lol. After 4 layers it did absolutely nothing.
I love the look of this webpage! Really makes the products shine just like your skin will if you use them!!! Highly recommended. Whoever made this design should get a raise.
Just amazing. Great product. Would recommend 110% to anyone.
I received this as a gift and i LOVE it!! Another successful product! Made my skin soft and supple! Way to go e.l.f!!!
"I like to use the cream at night. After appliying it, my skin feels smooth and hydrated. Best of all, it does not leave my face greasy."
