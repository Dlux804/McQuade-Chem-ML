This moistutizer works great on my skin. I got this free to test out from Influenster to test and try. Its been 3 days so far and I am seeing the differnce in the way my face is. This is great. Its fragrance free and a little big if this cream goes a long way.
This stuff left my skin feeling silky and smooth. No real fragrance which is nice if your skin breaks out easily. Eager to see how well it helps my skin retain moisture.
Very soft and light texture. A little goes a long way with this moisturizer. I wake up with very refreshed skin. Ive only been using this at night because it contains retinol but it seems to be gentle enough to use multiple times a week. So excited I received this free for testing purposes from Olay. I would definitely buy this on my own once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Packaging is pretty, sleek and looks expensive. It has a faint smell, lightly perfumed. I have combo to oily skin. Once moisturizer and eye cream were applied my face and under eye immediately felt greasy. I wiped both products off best I could. Face and under eyes were still greasy. I had several blemishes after using. I do not recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed trying the Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizer. This cream was very effective in that it virtually erased my fine lines and wrinkles within a week after using. It is by far the best retinol cream Ive ever used. It also was very gentle on my sensitive skin. I had great results overall and I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer goes on thick and creamy, but feels very light on your skin. Overall I liked the product for my cheeks but it seemed to dry on my forehead leaving a residue. Packaging was very nice but hard to remove seal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product, it was a little oily at first but when you wake up your skin is so soft. My skin seemed to glow with in the first 3 days and looked more hydrated. I definitely recommend using this product! Thank you Influenster for the free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free for my honest review. I liked how light this moisturizer is. It felt really nice putting on my face after washing before bedtime. However, I did some spots feeling a little dry and needing extra moisture so I would not recommend if you have normal to dry skin like me. This moisturizer is more for combination to oily skin. I probably would not buy again but I will def use up my sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how light weight this cream is.. does not leave my skin heavy and dewy like most night creams. Leaves my skin smooth and bright.. best part is its no -greasy and fragrance free...Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a perfect moisturizer to use at night. Its a little on the thick side but immediately sinks into my skin and does not feel heavy or greasy at all. Ive already begun to notice that my skin looks more refreshed and bright in the morning. Plus, I have no experienced any breakouts with this moisturizer, something my skin tends to do with others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just started using this product so far I have noticed that it makes my face feel amazing after applying! It like instant silk! And the best part not greasy residue on the pillow! I am excited to see the results! Already impressed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am really loving this moisturizer so far! It feels good going on and doesnt make my face feel greasy! It says unscented but it has a slight smell, that I dont get much prefer, so would be nice if it was actually a little scented, but overall like the product! I received this product for free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical about trying out a new moisturizer since my face tends to be oily and breaks out easy but I have this a shot since Influenster sent it to me and Im glad I did. It leaves my face feeling so silky smooth! I dont wake up with an oily face and my face looks so much smoother. I truly love this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try this but when I put it on, it felt like powder on my face due to all of the “cones” in it. The second ingredient is Dimethicone. I thought I'd try without the serum, which has dimethicone over kill too, to give it a second chance, still didn't like it. My skin did not feel hydrated at all. Please remove the the “cones” in your products."
"Not impressed with this Olay Night Facial Moisturizer, feels strange in a skin, kind of silicony even by the morning. I also had some dry and irritated patches on a cheeks under eyes. Not going to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this Night moisturizer. I have only been using it for a few weeks.l now but my face looks and feels amazing. The texture of the moisturizer is very light as well. Definitely worth trying!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was kinda unsure at first because I haven't had no luck on a good night moisturizer but then I received this complimentary from Influenster and it changed my mind. The packaging is perfect not to big not to small and a pretty purple color with an easy open top. The smell is light not to strong. Leaves your face soft with no oily after feeling. Overall all so far so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I feel like this moisturizer is really well moisturizing. I have used olay in the past but it was the regular regenerist line. My skin feels and looks good when I use this. I have been using at night before bed or after I shower. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive been using this product for two weeks. Ive noticed the wrinkles on my forehead appear less pronounced. Formula is thick and creamy in the jar but does not feel heavy or greasy when its on my face. My only complaint is the little white disk that covers the cream on the inside of the jar. Its difficult to lift up if you dont have nails. *i received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how light and smooth this product is. It makes my skin feel great after I apply and I havent had any issues with discomfort after using it. Sturdy container with an amount that will last me quite a while too which is nice. Not sure Ive noticed major differences in my skin but I plan to continue using it to see what long term results I get. *i received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night time moisturizer felt light on my skin when applying. Went on smoothly and did not leave my face feeling greasy. There was no scent to it if you dont like fragrances. The jar was very pretty with a shiny chrome lid and a vibrant purple color. Would definitely buy and continue to use. I received this product complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I didnt want to rush into a review. I have been using this for a few weeks. Im a huge R+F lover, but love trying new products. A little goes a very long way. This isnt harsh at all, and my skin is breakout prone. I love how soft your soft feels the moment you put it on. You can feel your skin absorbing it. Definitely recommend! Thank you Influenster for allowing me to try this product complimentary! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the product. It's thick but easy to spread and it does moisturize my skin. However, it didn't help my skin, I have trouble with pigmentation and uneven skin and have been using it every night and it really doesn't make much of a difference for me. I also can't use it during the day because when it dries out and you touch your face it creates flakes and you don't want to go out with it on. I think it's a great product if your main concern is dryness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this to review it and I have tried this moisturizer for a little over a week now and I love it its super soft when applying to face and doesnt feel heavy or sticky at all. In the morning I wake up my face looks flawless not oily nor dry and I have dry skin this has helped I would definitely recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Genuinely surprised on how much I liked this product. It works well with my other Skin care and s didnt make my skin freak out. The feeling on the Skin is nice, almost like a powder silky finish once its rubbed in. I did find it to make my Akon smooth and appear clearer once I woke up I the morning. So happy I was apply to get this as a free trial cause I probably would of kept passing it up in the store. Definitely worth a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok guys so this is an awsome night cream. And super affordable. It has really enhanced the look of my face. I apply it after my serum but before my face oil. And it has really played very well with all my other skincare products. It has replaced my old moisturizer for sure. I recieved this from influenster to try and review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this product to be a very hydrating and non irritating moisturizer despite the inclusion of retinol. I would not consider this to be a retinol on its own, but does suffice on nights when Im not already using a prescription retinal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how light this cream is. It doesn't make my skin feel heavy or greasy. I do have naturally oily skin though so using it every day was a bit too much for me especially in my T zone. Overall though it is a great product and made my skin feel much better and less flaky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"TRULY so amazing!!! My face is so soft every morning. It feels tighter and looks brighter. I don't feel greasy or look shiny after using it, immediately or throughout the day. It leaves a great matte finish. The difference I'm seeing in my skin after trying this product is vast, and it's probably only been three weeks. I'm obsessed with this cream and amazed every day using it. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I LOVE this product. It is very light weight and absorbs very quickly while leaving my skin to feel super moisturized. There is virtually no scent which I appreciate because I dont want a strong scent while going to bed. I have also noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin. 10/10 would recommend to a friend and purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I initially wasn't sure if I would like this since retinols tend to be very drying for my skin but I loved it. My skin felt great! My complexion looked better than normal after just a week's use.y skin cleared up just a bit and my skin looked better than it has in a while I would definitely recommend this at least to give it a try. I will definitely purchase this product! I received this complimentary to review and I can't be happier this product was provided for me to try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this night cream. Ive been using it for a week or 2 now and my skin looks and feels tighter (not that I had that much of a problem at 34). My smile lines are fading away and my skin is more moisturized now than before. Its light weight so it doesnt feel like you have a mask on, like other night creams. Its not strong scented which is perfect for my sensitivity to scents. And its affordable [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I dont think this did much for my skin. I dont have intense wrinkles but I do have some. Ive been using this consistently for a week. It feels heavy and feels like it just sits on the skin. It also pills up when you try to rub it in. I unfortunately would not recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Okay so although Ive found I can only use this once a weekthats because its so effective. Who would have thought an over the counter moisturizer with retinol would actually be this strong? Im excited to have found an affordable retinol! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried Olay Retinol 24 Moisturizer as part of a complimentary sample. I like that there is no odor and the packaging is nice. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I have not noticed a difference in my skin. I have actually still had very dry and peeling skin. I would not purchase this product because I had not noticable results. #Complimentary, #Contest, #influenster, #OlayVoxBox, #OlayRetinol24Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this night moisturizer ! When waking up I notice my skin looked plump hydrated , and since Im oily skin type I like that it does feel heavy and notice it wasnt greasy. My face feels super soft in the mornings, and I havent broken out so far while using it which is awesome . I think this is a great night time moisturizer. I received this product complimentary for review purposes through Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the packaging...very pretty! It comes with a generous amount of product...a little seems to go a long way. My skin seemed a little softer after using it. However, my skin seemed to break out a tiny bit around my cheekbones for some reason. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Enjoyed using this Olay night cream. Im a fan of overnight creams and this one works pretty well. I love how light the moisturizer feels and its not greasy. Leaves a nice silky feel to my skin! I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feeling of this cream! It goes on smooth and silky with no greasy feeling at all! It makes my face feel really smooth and soft. Honestly, I don't think there is anything i would change about this product. I believe i am already seeing a little change in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for a few days now and let me tell you...my skin is definitely feels moisturized. I tend to wake up with dry skin and this makes it look and feel different. It's very gentle. A little does go a long way with this product. I have combination skin that also tends to be sensitive and this does not irritate my face. Definitely a must try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The feel of the moisturizer it self is very nice. It absorbs in quickly, goes on smooth like many high end lux products. Retinol helps with fine lines and wrinkles and smooths skin out. Ive used for about a week now so I cant say too much long term but it does make my skin feel smooth and plump in the morning. I will continue to use! Love the fact that its fragrance free! Id recommend it for anyone looking for a drug store retinol face moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this for a week before reviewing it, and I actually love it! My skin feels so soft and moisturized when i wake up! It is definitely like an oily feeling cream though so i wouldnt recommend it for oily skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Like the eye cream it contains silicones too which I prefer to avoid. The cream is very thick so you dont need to use much . It has no smell . A good point if you have allergies. Its surprisingly very moisturizing. It penetrates the skin pretty good. And most importantly it doesnt make me breakout . I have oily skin and Im prone to acne . So thats very important to me !! Only advice: get rid of the silicones. Other than that you should try it out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free and complimentary from Influenster to review and give my honest opinion on. I love that this product is fragrance free!! Its such a nice, soft consistency without being too thick. It sinks in quite quickly into my skin and feels very comfortable, not too heavy to sleep with it on. I havent seen too much of a difference to my skin with it yet, but Im excited to see how it will change with continued use!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combination skin, which makes finding a good moisturizer hard. I love the feeling of the moisturizer, you can tell its locked onto your skin and wont rub off. I did wake up a little oily, but even after washing my face in the morning it still felt moisturized. Usually my skin would be dry and flakey but not after using this product! Would of given it a 5 star if I didnt wake up with oily skin, but a very well made product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is overall pretty good. However I do not recommend this product as everyday use if your skin is not tolerante to retinol. I am not sure how much retinol it actually has so it may be just enough to wear every night. Also please use sunscreen when using retinol and I was pretty upset it didn't say to wear sunscreen. The packaging on this was really nice. Super sleek I love the color. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this product! It has no scent which is great for those who have sensitive skin and allergies to fragrance. The product is thick but it absorbs in the skin without leaving it greasy. I love that this doesn't burn like other products that contains retinol. It left my face feeling smooth and I could tell a difference in just one day. My skin look moisturized and healthy. This is definitely a affordable and easy product to add to your night time skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved this complimentary from Influenster to review. I absolutely love it. This moisturizer made my skin incredibly soft immediately. It has a light weight texture and a little goes a long way. I will definitely keep using this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer was very creamy but also felt light when you put it on. I hate creams that make you feel greasy and this was nothing like that. It made my face feel nice and smooth and I would definitely recommend this to others. It has a nice clean smell too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff feels amazing on my skin! It doesn't leave a sticky or oily feeling on my skin. It leaves my face feeling hydrated and healthy! The only difference i would make would be to have it scented. I would most definitely buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I honestly love this moisturizer is the one I was looking for its just perfect if you hate oil moisturizer you will understand but this isnt the case 0 fragrance I cant wait to see the results what I mean by that is that my skin type is super dry FYI and I love using makeup Ill love to see if this change my makeup game even though this product doesnt clame that. Super excited. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
#influenster #Olay for my complimentary products I received the Olay regenerist retinol 24 night eye cream and the regenerist retinol 24 night facial moisturizer I actually tried it last night and omg Its very creamy and it immediately absorbs into my skin it is non scented but what I like the most it leaves my skin very smooth and soft and I will definitely keep using it. I definitely recommend it Thanks so much #influenster #Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am loving this moisturizer. I have oily skin, and this doesnt make my skin feel oilier when I put it on. I like that it leaves my skin smooth and doesnt feel heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So lightweight but works great! I definitely recommend this to anyone with a dry face. Looking forward to using it this winter [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does everything I want a moisturizer to do. It doesnt make my face feel sticky after applying. It leaves my face super soft and has started taking blemishes away. I have even started using it during the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this retinol cream. I've always wanted to try a retinol cream formula, but I didn't yet have the chance. While I was skeptical at first, I really love the formula, and it has improved the look and feel of my skin. I recommend this product, and I would definitely buy it in the future. I received the product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about two weeks now and I love it. It goes on my skin so smooth almost like an oil, but does not make my skin oily which I really love. I have noticed my skin feeling much softer as well. It does not have much of a scent, if any at all, and I love that because there is nothing I hate more than a very heavy scented moisturizer that gives me a headache at night. I definitely recommend this product to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this product I often dont get enough sleep so I tend to have bags u see my eyes. I use this every night and it definitely works amazing. I would recommend this to anyone. Its light feeling and doesnt feel greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I will admit that I was a little hesitant on change my night moisturizer because of the fact that I had several acne for a long time and I finally got it under control. But I gave it a go and I am in love. I would definitely purchase this again. I can definitely see a difference in my skin especially now that I'm in my 30s. I think this is what I needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was never really into night creams but as I got older I realized I had to start taking care of m eyes. This cream is very gentle, the scent isnt too overpowering. I started noticing a change in my eyes after using it for a week. They didnt look as puffy as they do and the wrinkles I get were less noticeable. I am definitely going to keep using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this complimentary from Influencer, I've used this from the pass month and its amazing. It's very thick but soaks into the skin in minutes, alittle goes a long way. It has no scent and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I can already tell that I have less texture on my checks. My skin feels amazing. I love this moisturizer and would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this in my third Voxbox and it's as if Influenster was listening to me because I have been looking for a new skin care nighttime routine. For a nighttime face cream this ones works pretty good. It's moisturizing, but not overly so. I have combo skin that is more on the dry side and super thick moisturizers tend to not work for my skin. This particular cream moisturizes, but doesn't leave me feeling like an oil slick. I would recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So first I want to start off by saying I have no idea how much this retails for. The packaging is really lovely, very sleek and attractive. Big deal. The cream itself is silky without feeling greasy or too thick. It doesnt have any smell, which is awesome since it goes on your face. Did it make my face look younger or any different? Not really. Its a nice moisturizer to use at night, but I dont think so. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The bottle is a nice size and has an appealing look. There is a nice plastic separator inside to keep lotion in the tub. Price seems a little high, but does leave the skin very smooth. I would recommend the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so surprised by the results of this cream. I have tried higher end brands that do not even come close to this. I notice less red spots, my dark spots have faded and the acne is gone. I recommend this 100%. It may seem a little pricey but it is so worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has definitely made my face smoother and my complexion brighter. However I have not been able to decide if I like the product, I deal with oily/dry skin and there are no instructions on the amount to put on. Too much seemed very heavy and it's hard to get the perfect amount. I stopped using for about a week and my face went crazy with a breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After several days of trying.. here are my thoughts! Cost - a little spendy, but if it works Im open to paying good money. Formula - a little bit goes a long way! It went on so silky smooth. I found that a bit of it peeled if I ran my hands on my face when it dried which wasnt a big deal since this is night cream. Results - my face was definitely smoother! Didnt seem to change redness much, but can say I feel like my forehead wrinkles improved! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Like the eye cream this is a great product t so far for me. It makes my skin brighter and softer. It really helps with the texture as well! This formula is very light weight and has an oily feel to it ... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do really like this product, however Ive been using it religiously for about a month and havent really seen too much of a change in my skin, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Im only 27 so I use retinols mainly as a preventative measure and not necessarily for improvement. However, the texture is really nice and its very moisturizing and makes my skin super soft. I received this product free to try in exchange for my honest review. #influenster #contest [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the texture of this moisturizer a lot, but as far as results go, I didnt see much of a difference. Ive used other retinol products before and have had much better luck with them. Its a drugstore product, so I guess its good if youre on a budget and you dont need retinol urgently, but Im in my mid-30s and trying to stop time, so this didnt work out for me. Maybe for someone younger whos just starting out with the retinol journey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how this moisturizer changed my nightly regimen! This moisturizer brought so much life back to my face! It gave my face the ability to feel that it wasnt screaming for Lotion! I felt renewed and able to start the day every morning feeling like a new person! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is very rich! It left my skin very moisturized even after going to bed in the evening and waking up in the morning. I was very surprised because usually evening products are absorbed and my skin is dry again in the morning. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisture first time using it and I love how it feels on my face not too heavy or have bad sense which is a great nice packaging and definitely worth repurchasing. And I received it for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a beautiful moisturizer. And a retinol for the price point is amazing. It is a little on the heavier side, which doesnt bother me but I know could bother some. All around its a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought that this was an overall okay moisturizer. I wouldnt say it was my favorite or the best one Ive ever used. It did a good job but I probably wouldnt use again if I had to actually purchase it myself since I reviewed this sample in a voxbox. Leaves your face feeling soft but a little flaky over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this moisturizer for nearly 3 weeks I am so happy with the results. My skin feels so much healthier and so well moisturized! Compared to other moisturizers Ive used, this requires much less product to get complete coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is extremely lightweight. I am sensitive to fragrances, especially when they are over the top, and this has no scent. I love that thishydrates my face for such a long period and I dont need to worry about reapplying [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Made my skin so soft, evened out my skin tone, brightened my skin, and an unexpected but very welcome result was that it cleared existing breakouts super fast! My skin is pretty sensitive, but also on the dry side. This is a nice, creamy moisturizer that didnt irritate my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using olay as a daily moisturizer for many years and always loved it. I received the Regenerist Facial Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes and absolutely love it! It goes on a little heavier than my daily cream, but does not make me greasy or cause break out. It helps my skin feel moisturized throughout the whole night, and doesnt have an aggressive smell. Would definitely recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical about trying this because I've tried so many moisturizers and serums that have shown little to no results. However, after just the first night, I noticed a difference. My skin looked smoother, felt softer, some of the discolorations I can get from dryness were reduced. I am TERRIBLE at keeping a consistent routine, but I make sure to put this on every night that I remember to do so, and the results are amazing! I will definitely be buying this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Oh my Goodness! I was a little concerned when I opened this VoxBox because I'm not a huge fan of moisturizing creams, especially ones that you use at night. I was Wrong! My skin feels smooth and I was up bright eyed, bushy tailed. You really dont need to use a lot of product. A little goes a long way! I would definitely purchase again! Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought this product was good. I liked how it made my skin felt after using it. It came in a very nice sized jar and packaging. I'm sure it could be improved but I myself wouldn't do a thing to it. It is definitely a good value and definitely room for improvement! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ive been trying out this moisturizer for a little over a week now, and Im absolutely in love! The lightweight, non-greasy formula absorbs into my skin so quickly, and I love that there practically isnt a fragrance. Its been a perfect addition to my nightly skincare routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was given this complimentary. Ive been using this for 5 days now and my skin is a little irritated and stings a little. These are all normal side effects of retinol so I am not worried about it. I will keep trying it to see how it goes and update later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ive never really been too keen on night time routines. I get home exhausted from work and daily activities, so I hate to say it but sometimes went Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizerto bed with a full face of make up. Once I got this cream everything changed. I used for about a week before I noticed a difference in my skin that I love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always heard such good things about Olay. But I was blown away. My skin is such a mess with bad ingrown hairs and dry, flaky skin. This lotion takes care of both of those some how OVERNIGHT. I have been trying several lotions and facial cleansers trying to fix this issue for years. This cream has my face feeling seriously so soft in just one use. No more flaky chin. And I havent really had any issues with ingrown hairs either! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster. I am not a big fan of face/eye lotions because they're usually oily, heavy and leave my skin breaking out. This product did not disappoint!!! It is lightweight and feel good on (not sticky, or greasy)! I have been using for two weeks now and already notice a difference with how my face feels and looks - vibrant and young! #OlayRegenerist #complimentary @ @Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ive never used a night facial moisturizer before. This stuff is amazing!! It makes me WANT to moisturize my face every night! Its gentle on my skin. My face is so smooth and soft after using it. Its something that Ill definitely keep in my night time routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I often avoid night creams because they feel too thick and greasy. This, in contrast, felt rich and silky which was a pleasant surprise. I liked that there's no fragrance. Packaging was appealing and I loved that the jar was plastic since I am always afraid of dropping glass on the tile floor in my bathroom! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this In my VoxBox and I love it so far. It doesnt have a strong scent to it which is nice. It is a very light feeling product - the best way I can explain the feeling is it feels soft and clean. No greasy feel to at all! Leaves your face feeling so soft and smooth after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product, I saw results pretty quickly and improvement the longer I used it. I also like the texture of this product, it goes on smooth and light, it doesn't leave a heavy residue on your skin. Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt like this moisturizer is just okay and it didnt do much for my combination type skin. I do prefer water base moisturizers as it doesnt make my skin feel oilier and greasy as this moisturizer did. Of course I did keep in mind because its a night cream, its usually thicker so I expected that, but still wasnt please with the results.

"I received this free for testing purposes. Usually, I break out from facial lotions so I was afraid to use this. To my surprise, I havent had any issues at all! My skin is soft, oil free, and free from break outs. I cant ask for more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ive been using this for a few weeks now and i have definitely seen improvement with how my skin feel in the mornings- firm, hydrated and lightened dark spot. Not totally sure yet if this is something I would keep buying but I have a lot more product left and have high hopes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this product is so smooth and feels great going on. Maybe it's just me or possible I wasn't using the right amount but I felt like my face was very oily and greasy in the morning and kind of concerns me for breakouts, not that I had any or incredibly prone but I was uncomfortably shiny and absolutely had to wash my face. So overall I liked it but wouldn't recommend if you prefer something weightless and non oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm not a big fan of moisturizer because the ones I have tried left me very oily. But I apply this once I get out of the shower at night and when I wake up in the morning my face feels really moisturized and it does not leave me oily. The container is a big size. You get quit a bit of product and you dont need a lot. A little bit goes a long way. The packaging is very nice & very appealing. #Olay #Retinol24 #Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using this product. It was easy to use and left my face feeling cool, clean, and refreshed. I thought the product had a slight smell to it, though not smelling like anything in particular. I would use this product again and would recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ive been using this cream daily (missed a day or two) and have received compliments on my face at work. I do not normally wear makeup to work and my coworkers along with myself agreed that my face looks a little tighter. If using the correct amount everyday, this package will last you a good while so I think is worth the investment [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer! I look forward to using it every evening. I was worried it would leave a residue on my pillow as I went to bed, but Ive experienced no issues. It leaves my face feeling hydrated and nurtured. Id recommend this to everyone I know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the moisturizer the texture is nice the scent is good. I did have to try it twice the first time I used it my skin broke out but I tried again and i havent had the same effects. I would say watch what you pair this with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is amazing! It is very smooth lotion almost a silly feeling! My face feels so soft after applying it! The smell is not strong. It applies very evenly and rejuvenates my skin over night! I highly recommend it and would most definitely buy it again! I'm so glad I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It doesn't take much of it to use on your entire face. I will definitely purchase when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Cool, creamy and left my face feeling so moisturized! I have dry patches on my cheeks and forehead so this really does the trick. I use it every other night because I find that every single night leaves an oily residue. Less filters for my pictures, haven't really noticed less wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I definitely see a difference. My face looks so smooth and soft. I would definitely be buying this and recommending it to friends and family. I am happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster and tried it out for a few weeks. I really like the thickness of it and how well it moisturizes my skin. I usually use an all natural product and this one stung a little the first night but was fine after that.

It also doesn't feel too heavy or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Ive been using this night time moisturizer for a couple of weeks now. I cant say much about the effects of retinol part yet as I think the skin needs a little longer to rejuvenate with retinol. However its a wonderful moisturizer. I wake up in the morning with a nice refreshed and hydrated skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this moisturizer complimentary from Influenster to try and I love it! It isnt greasy and leaves my skin so soft!

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product! I like how light the cream was after applying it and how my face didnt seem sticky afterwards. In the morning it was also apparent that there wasnt any residue left over. It didnt make my face break out & I have sensitive skin! So that's great! I have actually recommended this to my mom and my grandmother's. I think it's so nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ive only been using the night facial moisturizer for a couple weeks which is why Im not apt to give it 5 stars yet - but I love the way it applies smoothly and the way my face feels when I wake up in the morning! If you are looking for a nightly facial moisturizer to use, you should definitely give this one a shot. Maybe try the travel size first since it is a lot of product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really love this moisturizer. I put it on after I wash my face at night and my skin feels so amazing. Even in the mornings my face just is still so soft and makes my acne look less frightening. 10/10 would but this. I received this product complimentary for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how this product is fragrance-free! I have sensitive skin and it is easily irritated by fragrances. My skin feels so smooth after using this product for about a week now. The only issue I have, while its personal, is I wax my eyebrows. You arent supposed to wax your brows if you use retinol. I received this product complimentary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This moisturizer is amazing I have been searching for a moisturizer and I have finally found the perfect one! The facial moisturizer goes on silky smooth and does not leave an oily feeling! Legit. The perfect moisturizer to add to your collection! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is a great product. I was hesitant at first to whether or not I would like it. Ive been really specific with my choices in the past. I tried this product and I was happy that it gave me a fresh moisturized feel and there was no scent. I did not have any issues with breakouts or reactions to ingredients. I really liked the texture in the way it left my skin feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes, and I really love it. It is truly fragrance free and helped my skin to feel amazing. The only reason that I did not give this product 5 stars is because the Olay site advertises that it improves dark spots and pores, which I have not seen improvement in. It has helped with firming, fine lines, and moisturizing my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well to start off, this product was sent to me by Influenster for free to review. Olay isnt a brand Id normally reach for but Ive been fairly satisfied with this moisturizer. Its non scented which is a plus and its not tacky or sticky even though its a night cream. Face feels nice and smooth after I use it. I am pretty bad at sticking through nightly face creams but when I do remember, I find myself reaching for this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

So luxurious! I absolutely love this formula. It really sinks into the skin so nicely leaving you feeling so soft and moisturized. Fragrance free so thats a plus! I would recommend to anyone looking for a good night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the consistency of this product, it wasn't to heavy like other night time cream products. It definitely moisturized my skin as I slept and absorbed well. I will point out that this is one of my first Retinol products and my skin did peel a bit for about 2 weeks until it calmed down. I've read that this could happen. But maybe some warning or instruction that this is a normal part of the processes when using Retinol would be helpful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ive never really used a moisturizer until this one. I was skeptical at first but I like it. Its not oily on my face and I feel like my face has a sort of glow. Id definitely buy it and recommend this moisturizer to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As someone who suffers from dry skin, this moisturizer is great for overnight. Not too heavy but not too light. The price is great and its super easy to find which is a plus. Only reason Im giving 4 stars is I didnt see that much difference in wrinkles over the few weeks Ive used it. Doesnt mean it wont work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It left my face feeling nice and soft. Not greasey, i put it on right before bed and woke up feeling smoother than the day before... i used it nightly after getting out of the bath.

"#Influenster Vox Box #Olay (I received this product free in exchange for my review) This was my first time using this product. Didn't have a strong smell, doesn't really have much of a smell at all. It amazed me when I first tried it, it wasn't oily or greasy but it was the right amount of moisture. Made my face feel smooth and soft. Definitely see a difference already and it's been a little over a week now. I will end up buying this before I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does what its supposed to do. I typically prefer a thicker night moisturizer that I can really feel soaking into my pores, but after using this consistently for a few weeks, my skin does feel moisturized in the morning. This product comes in pretty purple packaging as well . *note- Influenster sent me this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this product. A lot of night creams are thick and greasy. This night cream wasn't like that and absorbed into my skin well. I feel I could actually use it as a daytime moisturizer as well and I might try that to see how it is under my makeup. I definitely recommend this night cream!! This product was complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was using a way more expensive brand and was nervous this wouldn't compare but girl was I wrong...I saw a difference the first night I used it(could have just been in my head but still). I noticed my face got an little sensitive to touch around day 4 but it only lasted a day or so. I have already recommended this to my friends and will definitely be buying more after I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is my new go to night moisturizer. It does not have a greasy feeling. My face feels so soft in the morning. I wish it came in a pump version I hate dipping my fingers in the jar. The packaging though feels so nice and sturdy. I did receive this free for my review but that doesn't mean it's not a awesome product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After 4 days of use I could really tell a difference. I would feel like my skin was moisturized even without putting it on in the morning, so I could tell it was working! I felt like my skin has started looking brighter and tighter with just a few short week of use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have sensitive skin so I was a little nervous to try however I didnt notice any ill effects from the moisturizer. Im not a huge fan of silicone based products. It leaves a velvety/primer like finish. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this moisturizer for about 3 weeks and I am in love with it! The first time I used it, I was blown away by the texture. It is unlike anything I have ever felt it was like liquid velvet! Over the last several weeks my skin has felt smoother and looked brighter. I would purchase with my own money. I received this for free for review purposes from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this moisturizer. It keeps my skin soft and looking great. I have really noticed a difference in the past two weeks of use. Only complaint is that sometimes it seems to ball up a little. I would recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I will purchase this in the future!! Thank you influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Cute and really good size for an Olay Moisturizer, I have to say that it was effectual in my skin, i would like to improve the product just with a sweet essence, but I really like how the product feels in my skin, my face looks healthy, clean and extremely soft after each use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"That is an amazing Night Facial Moisturizer. It totally meet my expectations, I could feel my skin hydrate right after put it on, I dont need even tell after couple night applying on my face. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually put moisturizer on in the mornings. So this was my first experience with a nighttime moisturizer. It is very light and doesnt make my skin feel oily. It is gentle on my skin and I could hardly feel it was on my face. I had a noticeable glow and soft skin that lasts all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive been trying this out for weeks now and it has surpassed my expectations. It goes on smoothly and leaves my face feeling like a butter satin texture. Better than any other moisturizer Ive tried before. Would purchase once Im done with mine. I got this for free for review purpose. But I truly know and think this is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer is light and airy! It definitely didnt feel like I had any product on my face. I put this product on in the evening and it kept my face hydrated all night and even in the morning! If you are looking for a hydrating moisturizer, then you should try the Olay Regenerist Retinol! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I waited to use over a couple of weeks to see how it really works. My skin is definitely more moisturized! Its very glowy in the morning and not too oily (tend to have that). I feel like a little goes a long way which is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was actually surprised that I ended up liking this Olay retinol cream. It doesnt irritate the skin at all like it claims, and I notice that when I use it my face peels all the dead skin away. The end results leaves my skin extremely soft and radiant. I highly recommend. *I received this product for testing purposes* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been trying this product out for a few weeks now and I've been loving it! It is a thick moisturizer, but it's not so thick that it broke me out. There is really no smell to it which can be nice if your sensitive to smells. Overall it's a very nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This face cream is great for night time moisture pick me up. It doesn't leave my face sticking to the pillow and dries very nicely. I think the fragrance free formula is a real home run for me since my skin is so sensitive. I would definitely purchase this again!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is definitely my new night cream. It has a really light but refreshing and cool feel on the skin. I love that it's fragrance free so that it doesn't affect being able to sleep. I can visibly see the difference already and so can others based upon the compliments! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I give this a 5/5 because it does work well for the price point. The formula is high quality, gentle on sensitive skin, and you can see rejuvenation within a couple nights of use. I would say it is almost as effective as Lancme night creams I have used in the past, but 1/2 to 1/3 the cost. I will be sticking with this product for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is a combination of dry and oily complexion. I would use this cream all over my face and for the first few days my face felt nice but later my skin started to get oily. I realized this is great for the dry areas only. I now only use it in those areas. Id give this 4 stars if it were for both skin types, and if the packaging was plastic free. This was a complimentary product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought my skin looked really nice after using this. It wasnt overly greasy but felt very moisturizing. I use it twice a week and its my first time using a retinol. I would buy again. A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The density is perfect, not runny or thick. I use creams like this for prevention, so as far as effectiveness I cannot say how this product performs. The cream does not irritate my skin nor does it have a noticeable scent. Only time will tell if this is makes much of a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Let me start off with saying, I've always had oily skin, and moisturizers are difficult for me to find and love. But THIS moisturizer I really really like. It's not too thick of a moisturizer, it's very light. After I warm it up between my fingers and rub it in to my face, it sinks right in. It doesn't stay on the surface of my skin, or leave it overly greasy. I would definitely buy this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is everything! I used it every night the past couple of weeks and have noticed a visible difference! It also smells so fresh and amazing! I can't wait to use this every night before bed!

"I was worried at first because this moisturizer is really thick but it went on like a regular daytime one. It has a light almost water like fragrance and did not feel heavy on my skin. It didnt feel heavy, like I needed to wash it off, in the morning either. I've had a few other night moisturizers do that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this night cream!! I have never used olay products prior to this. It's thick and creamy, not super greasy which i love. I used this the last few nights and my face feels nice today. I think for the price you definitely get a good cream. I dont know if i can recommend yet until i get it added into an actual routine, but so far i do like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Olay Regenerist 24 Night Moisturizer is amazing! The scent is incredible and my face doesn't feel oily or heavy from the product.

"First, this moisturizer feels like it should cost a million bucks. It is so silky smooth and rich when you apply but doesnt leave your face or hands feeling super sticky - it feel like it is already working and doing its job as soon as you put it on. This is definitely something I can see myself incorporating into my nightly routine for the foreseeable future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product did absolutely everything it was supposed to. It has added more bounce and hydration to my skin than I thought possible in a short time (one week). It is fragrance free, and incredibly smooth and creamy. The only ""con"" I have experienced is that it will ""pil"" up on my face the next day if it is not washed off with the morning skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Oh I really liked this night moisturizer! Right when I put it on I feel the difference in my face. It instantly goes soft and supple.

Very happy with the product and would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Its so soft and looks so radiant. I feel like Ive shaved a few years off of my face already. Im definitely going to be purchasing this when this jar is done. Ive used skincare thats way more expensive and havent gotten results near as good. Good job, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The packaging is really nice and the texture of the cream is really soft and blends well into the skin. After using it for about three weeks I havent notice a change in my skin either good or bad. While its a nice product I dont think I would buy it again because it hasnt made any improvements to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Typically I have sensitive skin and can tend to be oily. This does great at moisturizing at night before bed and works all though the night.

This moisturizer feels so soft on the skin. A little goes a LONG way. I use it at night only (as instructed) and have noticed the spots on my cheeks clearing up by using this every night for 3 weeks now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels so light weight on your face and leaves it feeling so smooth! I had the whips day cream and this is the perfectly nightly complement to my facial care routine. I wake up in the morning and my skin still feels moisturized vs prior to using this product, it felt very dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love that this moisturizer is unscented, therefore it caused no irritation. However, for a retinol night cream, I wish it could have been a lot more hydrating, especially because retinol is usually drying. I would recommend this for people who have oily skin. This product was received complimentary of Influentser but these opinions are all my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This. Cream. Is. BOMB! The scent is so nice but still subtle, and its so lightweight and creamy going on your skin. You only need a small amount to feel great.

"I dont normally have a nighttime moisturizer routine so I wasnt sure really what to expect, but I was actually surprised. It was light and I didnt feel like I couldnt sleep like I have in the past when I tried products for nighttime routines. I would definitely recommend this to someone for a nighttime product who is not wanting to feel heavy or feel like they have too much product on before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Provides good moisture and leaves my dry skin feeling like silk. Doesnt feel greasy. Has improved the unevenness of my skin tone a little. Easy to get out of the container. A little bit goes a long way! Not sure on the price but I would totally buy it because its worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed this moisturizer. A little definitely goes a long way as it is nice and thick. Even though it is thick, it didn't feel heavy at all. It is extremely moisturizing. After just one use my skin felt 10x softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was sent to me compliments of influencer for my opinions so here's my honest review. This is a new part of my nightly routine!

"A no fuss hydrating moisturizer. A little too silicone heavy for me, hence the loss of 1 star. Havent used it long enough to really see the results of the retinol, will need to give it a few more months. Doesnt have any irritating fragrance. It has simple, easy packaging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always nervous to try night creams because usually they are too hydrating and I end up breaking out. This product was different, I woke up with hydrated skin, ready to take on the day. I didn't notice any difference in fine line and wrinkles though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is really smooth going on your face I have really sensitive skin but it didnt bother it at all I wouldnt really change this formula. The package is so pretty it makes you want to get more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It is lightweight and doesnt make my face greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Product has been added to my nightly routine! The moisturizer goes on smooth, not thick, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I love that the moisturizer doesnt leave my skin feeling like it cant breathe. The product is fragrance free but it does have a little bit of a chemical scent to it, but this hasnt stopped me from LOVING the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Surprisingly light, almost gel-cream like moisturizer. Im used to products with more retinol than this one, but its a nice texture and consistency. It makes my skin feel smooth and doesnt leave me waking up feeling like a total greaseball, which is a huge bonus considering Im incredibly oily and acne prone. I havent had an increase in breakouts since using this product either, which is a huge plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved it! Its very light & non-greasy. It definitely exceeded my expectations. It got rid of all my dry patches of skin. Its very gentle& not harsh at all. Its a great value for the price. You need to give this product a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am not a huge fan of Olay, because their moisturizer usually leaves my skin oily, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one!! It goes on really nicely and does not feel greasy at all after applied. It makes my skin soft right away and my skin has been much less dry in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am a skincare junkie and have tried many high-end moisturizers and night creams. I am impressed with this okay retinol night cream. Its light and doesnt make my skin feel irritated like actual retin-a cream! Ive been using for 2 weeks and so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel the same way about this product as I do the eye cream. This is a thick night cream. However, once applied to the skin it just melts into your skin. Leaving my face and neck feeling and looking wonderful. I have very sensitive skin and this product does NOT irritate my skin at all. I get no residue left behind or greasy skin feeling with this cream. I highly recommend this night cream. I have used a lot of retinol night creams, but none have been as light weight as this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this complimentary for testing purposes. Ive never tried any Olay skincare products before, I was super excited to try this especially because of the retinol.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the way this product felt both when I put it on at night and when I woke up in the morning. I usually have oily skin even when I wake up and after a few days I noticed a big difference. I liked that it had no fragrance and how light it sets on the skin. I would definitely recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think this moisturizer is amazing. I put it on right after the shower and then go to bed. My fave feels so smooth in the morning. The only thing i dont like about it is that it feels so greasy going on. It dries down fine but for that first hour, my face feels suffocated (if that makes sense) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer Did not help the dry and burning feeling left from the eye cream, but it did leave the rest of my face moisturized nicely. It seemed to work well, and I would recommend the moisturizer to people with normal to oily skin. If you have dry skin it may dry your skin out more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this moisturizer complimentary for review and so far I love it! It has no broken me out yet and I love how my skin feels immediately after. It's even better the next morning.

"I haven't been using this for long enough to see the full effects yet. So, I'm giving 3 stars for now until it has been a little longer. I received this in a voxbox for free from influenster. My favorite thing so far is the texture of the cream. It's almost like a primer texture. I feel like my face looks ""primed"" after applying this. It fills in pores. My face looks smooth. My face is also soft when I wake up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have been using it for a few weeks now and it is a full part of my night routine. I cannot go to bed without putting it on. My face feels so much better, it is looking better every day that I use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using Olay products when I was 16. Over 10 years later and this cream is everything!! It was my first time using it but I'm in love. It's gentle on my skin and works amazing. I can't come up with any suggestions for improvement. Compared to similar products on the market, it is great priced with phenomenal quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far so good! I love how this makes my skin feel after washing my face before bed. The packaging makes it look high end.

"Ok after trying this product for a week I have decided I do like it but it's not my favorite. I like using a retinol that is strictly that. Not a retinoid moisturizer in one. There is nothing wrong with it, it's just personal preference. I like layering my skincare. I did like the way this felt though. The smell was a typical moisturizer smell. My skin didnt feel overly greasy after. I will continue to use it and update this review with any changes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like it, it seems to moisture very well. I was getting dry flakey patches and since using the moisturizer it has been amazing. I don't it needs to improve, except maybe a bigger size, so I could have more product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The silky feel of the cream, matched with the simple directions to ensure smooth skin makes this product a WIN! From the first moment used on my face and neck, I felt hydrated.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tend to use oils to hydrate my skin and stay away from moisturizers like this, but gave it a try anyway and was pleasantly surprised!

I loved the Olay Refenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Moisturizer! I have very dry skin and this made my skin feel so soft and smooth!

"Immediately I thought how this product was really lightweight. It was very gentle to touch and felt amazing when applying it. However, I do have naturally oily skin so it did feel as if i was just adding to that. I love for my skin to feel hydrated which it did, but not so much oily, which it did as well. I will continue to use to see the benefits i am expecting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far...its good! I love the consistency and the fact that it's not scented. Seems like a small container but it's actually a lot of cream. It's not greasy and doesn't leave stains on my pillow! Skin feels refreshed after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like that this night moisturizer dries quickly, leaving skin soft and smooth, with no residue on your pillow. Its definitely hydrating and is just so soft in its application. I received this product free in a VoxBox but would be interested to try it again - its especially promising that its Olay because it feels like it would be more of a luxury brand.

I liked the appearance of the bottle. I have been using it every night for about 2 weeks now and I like that it doesnt make my face feel greasy after applying or in the morning (if I use a small amount) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this in an Influenster VoxBox but I am definitely adding it to my nightly beauty routine!

My mom and I both really liked trying out this product. I never buy Olay because I never wanted to spend the extra bit of money and not like the product. I really liked the way this product felt on my skin and how I looked in the morning. Would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"My skin feels much better after trying this product for a couple of days. I can't imagine after a whole month! It doesn't matter what skin type you have because it won't make you feel ""greasy"" the next day. It is an excellent moisturizer. Totally recommended!

Ok. So far. It is nice. The cream is nice and not thick.. it is light so it smooths in quick on my face. The scent is pleasant. I never put anything on my face. But this leave my face moisturized in the morning. Will consider buying it in the future!! !!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first, I was skeptical about this product. I tried it the first night and was surprised at how lightweight it felt. Because of that, I thought there was no way I would like this because I thought it wasnt moisturizing enough. I was wrong! The next morning my skin felt great! Ive only used for about a week so I havent seen a huge difference in the age of my skin but so far I like it. Im not oily in the morning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I dont use a daily moisturizer so I didnt know what to expect at first. After using this for about a week I am now a believer! My skin looks and feels amazing. It goes on easy and very smooth and you can use a little and it goes a long way. I have now found my nightly moisturizer and I'm not going back!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For starters, Ive tried quite a few nighttime retinol moisturizers. They all sort of do the same thing as far as results, but this one has the best texture without a doubt. If you dont like to wake up feeling covered in grease, this one is for you! It goes on thick, but soaks up through the night. This shows you that the product is working. I will be buying this one again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this at night with the nightime eye cream. I love the texture and the feel on my face. I wake up with smooth soft skin in the morning. I am a busy mom in the morning so it's nice to sit down for my nightime routine and wake up refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive and acne prone skin. The first night I applied this there was ZERO redness, burning, nor tingling and a week later my skin hadnt broken out, is so smooth and feels less puffy. I cant recommend enough! This is truly the perfect night moisturizer to gently nourish your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Okay, so I have been really picky about what I have been putting on my face do to breakouts and I can say 100% that I am obsessed and I have had no breakouts. Great job Olay! Smooth and thin consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this free to review and it is one of the best things I received. I have a pretty sensitive face and get eczema, this cream was amazing. It didnt hurt my face and it helped my ezcema. Another great thing about this cream is it didnt make my face SUPER oily like others have. Will definitely buy in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this for free to review and am honestly impressed. I dont typically like night creams as they are usually very thick and heavy but a little bit of this goes a long way. Definitely made my skin feel softer and more hydrated. It will take me a while to get through this, but I would definitely buy it on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that this moisturizer has retinol. Im not sure its as effective as a sole retinol treatment but I do feel like its very hydrating. It hasnt broken me out and I have sensitive skin so thats always a plus [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The best night cream / night time facial moisturizer. I think it is effective, it hydrated my skin overnight. It feels fresh in the morning. It is gentle, no rash chemical that I saw on the ingredients list. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This eye cream feels like nothing is even around your eyes. A tiny bit goes a far way. I use it at night time after my shower. It makes my eye area feel smooth. I like that it doesnt burn my eyes at all or have a strong scent. This product was sent to me by Influenster for testing purposes so I can provide my honest feedback. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First time trying an Olay product and I must say its going great so far! Ive tried a few night facial moisturizers before but this one is my fav. I put it on after cleansing my face and it leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized! I also really like the consistency of the cream, not too thin and not too thick - spreads easily on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is awesome! A little bit def goes a long way! Its creamy but not greasy, goes on smooth and absorbs evenly. Its fragrance free so its great for sensitive skin. I live in. Humid area and iys nice that it doesnt melt off my face it keeps it smooth and hydrated through the day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One great thing to note about this is that its fragrance free, as someone who has been sensitive to that stuff in the past this definitely made me feel like the product was safe for me to try. The formula was light weight, and made my skin feel smooth. I gave the product 4 stars because it is a nice product but, it may not be something I would purchase in the future. One last nice thing to note about it is, I love the packaging! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this night moisturizer that I was given for review. It makes my skin feel smooth, you only need a dime size for your whole face, and it feels like it will work through all the seasons when I usually buy different moisturizer for summer to winter. The smell is subtle/barely there and its a large container that will last me well over a month! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free for testing purposes. Olay is never a brand that I would buy for myself, but I definitely wasnt disappointed! The moisturizer has absolutely no smell, which is great. I tend to have fairly normal skin, but always have very dry skin on my nose. Immediately after applying the moisturizer, my skin felt really soft. When I woke up, I could see a noticeable difference in the dry areas on my nose. This is overall a great moisturizer and the price point is decent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Not as moisturizing as other face lotions/creams that I have used. I dont wake up feeling like my skin is super hydrated. I do think this would be a nice addition to a night time routine if used 2-3 x weekly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far I really like this nightcream. It is unscented and the packaging is beautiful. I do notice it leaves my skin very soft. As far as the retinol healing, maybe it takes more time? I haven't really noticed any results. I took one star off because I have noticed it sometimes pills off? Super weird. I think it's more likely to happen if you apply a lot of it.

Im a huge skincare person and always searching for the best moisturizers. I didnt have high expectations for this one considering Olay is more of a drugstore brand. But Ive got to say I was pleasantly surprised! Its super moisturizing with no scent. It is a bit of a thicker cream so I would use this in the winter time when my skin is drier. Definitely an affordable moisturizer!!! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this in my VoxBox through Influenster for free in return of my honest opinion of the product, so here it goes.. I've always been a fan of Olay products, and this wasn't disappointing.. This cream made my skin feel fresh and rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from Influenster for testing purposes. After washing my face, I applied the product before going to bed. The product applied on smoothly and I didnt even need to use too much product to cover my entire face. I did notice that after using this for a few times, my face felt moisturized and soft. My skin was no longer dry and dull. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving this moisturizer. Im very cautious when trying new skin products because I have dry sensitive skin. It doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy like some products do. Its very light and leaves my skin feeling quenched which is a huge selling point for me. I also like to leave it in the fridge because it feels so refreshing putting it on at the end of the day. *I received this product for free for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Its a nice lightweight nighttime moisturizer. It doesnt feel greasy or heavy. It actually feels velvety. Im not sure if its actually doing anything but I am enjoying. Im really happy that its not broken me out as I have sensitive skin. Im very happy to have received this item and Ill continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Sneak peak into my new nightly routine It's been about a week since I started using Olay's regenerist cream, and I've got to say I'm quite surprised by the difference in so little time! My skin feels tighter, and is visibly clearer. I love the fact this line of skin cream is fragrance free, as we know fragrance can be hard on the skin and immune system. So far, this product seems to be a wise investment. Stay tuned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the first retinol cream Ive tried from the drugstore, and I like it! Sometimes my skin is sensitive to retinol, but I dont experience any burning or irritation from this. It doesnt feel heavy on the skin but is a little thicker than what I prefer to use in the summer. For my personal preference, I think it will be a great night cream to use in fall/winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for an honest review and I love it! Yes, it is very greasy which is great as it is a night cream and prepares my skin for the morning. Generally speaking I have combination skin and the dry parts of my face is looking a lot better than it once did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never used a retinal before so this was a new experience. It's a light almost whipped consistency that is a bit oily, but my skin loved it. After the first week of use I noticed the skin on my cheeks felt tighter. My skin does look better compared to a regular hydrating cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this stuff! Wasnt sure at first due to how thick and greasy these creams can sometimes be. But not this one! This goes on so smooth and has no after grease feeling at all. If anything it has a satin like feel and soaks right in. Ive only been using it a week since I received it, so I cant necessarily tell if its working as described, but I love this product so far. Highly recommend if youre looking for a retinol night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pretty good. Loved the way it made my face feel. The only thing I recommend is making another version because even though it says it is not oily, it was for me. I do not think I would buy again because my skin is already oily just increased it, especially in my t-zone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pretty happy to get this product to try out. It feels a little greasy on the hands, but the face is super nice. Only thing I would change is that its unscented. It's probably better for some people, but one of my favorite parts about skin care is smelling fresh and clean. Itll take a while before I know just how young this stuff will make me feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to test this out for a solid week before reviewing.. and Im glad i stuck with it. So I was skeptical because olay is drug store... it it definitely surprised me. No heavy smell, which is a huge factor for me. It wasnt extremely heavy feeling, but it really moisturized my face. It was like a bomb of hydration that my face really needed. Very pleasantly surprised and I would definitely purchase this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this night time moisturizer for a week now and I love how cooling it is and refreshing! It is a super gentle cream, not as thick as I thought it was going to be which is a good thing! I have acne prone skins so a thicker consistency tends to break me out but so far so good! I'd definitely recommend picking it up!!(: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far, this product makes my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. After I use it, my skin looks hydrated and firmness. // Hasta ahora, este producto hace que mi piel se sienta suave y fresca. Despus de usarlo, mi piel se ve hidratada y firme. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So Ive used this for about two weeks. I LOVE how beneficial it is already! Its not heavy, but its thick enough to cover and you dont have to use much! It isnt oily or sticky. It dries almost immediately. Im a big fan! Ill definitely buy this when i run out! This product was received for free per Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes. Thanks so much!

"I absolutely love the consistency of this moisturizer! Its not greasy feeling, which is usually the case with my combo skin! As far as how well this works, I will have to use it a bit longer to give a full review! But first impressions are so far great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't normally use retinol products because the one time I did, I got dry skin and I broke out. I did get a few pimples with this, but it us moisturizing. It definitely is best to use right before bed because I found if you rub your face at all it does pill. I like the texture as it reminds me of a water balm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I. Am. Loving. This. Cream. My face and neck are incredibly sensitive and Ive been having insane breakouts the last few months. This cream has gone on so easily, doesnt feel greasy and isnt making me breakout! Im shocked. I havent been using it long enough to notice major changes in firmness or lines, but Id recommend this to anyone looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of this night moisturizer, it's thick but silky. And it's very hydrating. I will continue to use this, and the nice big jar is filled and it doesn't take much, so this will last a long time even using it every night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far, so good. Goes 9n smoothly and has no smell...which I prefer. The only thing I noticed that I don't like about it is that it leaves my face feeling extra oily. Still testing it out, but overall good so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the way this moisturizer makes my face feel! I was having problems with my skin being dry and after a just a few days of using this my face was very soft and even the color looked better. 10/10 recommend ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I generally have very sensitive skin and this seems to be very gentle on my skin and I have not broken out at all. I am always impressed with Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer! I have very oily skin, and I usually stick to gel formulas. This is pretty fluffy... its definitely thick, but its not heavy. It also doesnt have a smell, which is nice. What surprised me was that it doesnt feel oily and it absorbed quite nicely into my skin. I also used it on my neck and my chest. My skin felt nice after using it. Ill update more after a few weeks of use. I received this complementary in my voxbox for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im on day five with this product and so far I love it! It is light and makes my skin soft and smooth. Had some acne recently which doesnt seem affected one way or another with this product. So far no change in redness or scarring but its still early! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just started using this. I was SHOCKED how soft it made my skin! It doesn't have a scent which is actually really nice. I apply it before bed, it's very light and my skin just sucks it up. I would definitely recommend. I haven't noticed much change in the appearance of my skin but it is definitely softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always see Olay in stores and always thought so people use this? Now that Ive tried it, I am kicking myself for not trying it sooner. It left my skin supple and not greasy, which I love. I have oily skin and I was worried about that. All in all, its an awesome moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this night moisturizer. It is so gentle and it makes your face feel so soft. I love everything about it. It is definitely worth applying every night to achieve beautiful skin in the morning. I recommended this to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What a nice a refreshing way to sleep! After a long day and a nice shower this is the ultimate feel of relaxation. Smells great, feels great and all around just a great product. Does not leave an oily residue so you dont have to worry so much about changing your pillow case. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was honestly expecting this not to agree with my skin; I think that about most things in all honestly. I have sensitive but oily skin. However, this stuff is so light weight and does so well with my skin. I do feel like my skin has been more moisturized since using it and Ill keep using it till Im out! (Thanks to Influenster for the product to review). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love how moisturizing this is!! Feels great on the skin! Received it complimentary but will be purchasing once it runs out. Seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles. I received it complimentary but will definitely buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night cream is amazing. My skin is super sensitive and this didn't bother my skin at all. Some night creams have made my skin break out and after 2 weeks there has been no issues. The cream was perfect for applying nightly. It did not leave my skin greasy or feel heavy. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, I love that this is fragrance free! It goes on easy and is absorbed fast by my skin. It is light and non oily and I noticed a softer skin texture after a weeks time of using every night. Would buy this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly, I was so super pumped to be getting this voxbox complementary of @Influenster. Its a part of nightly routine now with acne wash before bed. My skin has felt and look so much more moisturized since using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I want to start by saying I have not had good luck in the past with moisturizers. I have combination skin and most moisturizers make me oily in my T zone. This moisturizer is absolutely amazing. Its not too heavy, it moisturizes in al the right places and it doesnt make greasy at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is powerful. After using it for a few nights I can tell the difference in my skin. I wake up and my face looks plump and youthful. I feel pretty confident without makeup during the day which is saying a lot. I have a feeling that with continued use, I will see huge improvements in my skin, as Ive already seen changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I've only been usinf this a few days and may re-review after 1 month but so far I like this product. Be prepared to have some breakouts the first day or two as your skin adjusts bit after day 4 my skin started balancing out. Leave my sking SUPER soft, interested to see if the retinol will even my skin tones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent this product for review by Influenster. I was surprised to get this along with the eye cream. It's a cream yet doesn't feel heavy and leaves my skin feeling soft. I believe it's a good value and I would recommend this for anyone looking for a night moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer literally feels like youre putting silk onto your skin, it feels amazing! I havent been using it long enough to know how well it works in regards to the retinol, so I unfortunately can not speak to that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow! This product is amazing! It feels so hydrating and smooth on my skin. I have oily prone skin but it didnt make it feel even more oily. It just felt hydrated. I would love to try something similar for a day cream. This was the best free product for me to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very thick and creamy a little goes a long way. Makes my face very soft!!! I have only used for a week so haven't noticed to much as far as fine lines going away but feel like over all appearance and dullness of my skin is much better!! Excited to see what my skin will look like after longer use!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this night moisturizer. It goes on very thick and creamy but it dries light and my skin feels silky smooth. I feel like it is working to smooth out my fine lines. Ive been using this every other day because I believe the retinol in it is causing some flakey dry patches on my face. I will continue to use every other night until my skin gets more used to the retinol. I received this product for free through Influenster in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this cream as it gets the job done! The only (very small) set back is my skin is just a little to oily for this formula so when I wake up in the morning my face is so oily haha but it smells so good and the formula is truly great for anyone who doesnt already have oily skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product left my face feeling rejuvenated. I have been using it every night and it seems to be working for my super dry skin. Im hoping it helps with tightening my skin around my eyes. Would buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've been using this for a few days now and it does make my skin feels softer and more moisturized. I don't buy a lot of face creams, because I usually use sheet masks, but this was an interesting change from the norm for me. May buy this after the sample runs out.

"I received this product complimentary as part of a voxbox campaign. This moisturizer goes on creamy and quickly absorbs into my skin. I use this nightly as directed, at the very end of my skincare routine and it leaves my skin baby smooth through the night, locking in moisture. While I havent noticed any significant changes, its a great alternative moisturizer to my other ones, since I notice my skin tends to get used to products with extended periods of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ive only been using this for a few days, but I can definitely tell a difference!! Not only is the product very nice, but the fragrance isnt overwhelming which is such a plus!!

"I am more of a water based moisturizer person due to my oily skin. Therefore, I gave it 4 stars. I do however, like how my skin feels in the morning after sleeping with it on. I feel like my skin is more protected at night. It appears smoother and much cleaner. I would definitely buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love play face creams and this one is no exception. Retinol is the best skin care ingredient you can use without a prescription. This one is not overly drying. I enjoy the thickness and lack of strong fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Im all I can say is this is AMAZING!!! I take showers at night and after I get out is when I apply it. You only need a dime sized amount and my skin is already dry. After I apply this is makes my skin so soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend it. Love how my skin feels after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been contemplating getting a night moisturizer since I just one during the day, and I have used this a week and loved it. I'm not super big on smells but this doesn't leave a scent at all. My face feels super hydrated once i put it on, and in the morning I can still feel it on. It's super lightweight and that's one thing I always look for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Consistency was as expected with a cream. Smell was like a swimming pool though, threw me off for a second. Makes my skin feel super soft. Feels like a dry oil on my skin even though its cream but it eventually soaks in. Lightweight, doesnt feel heavy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this its very moisturizing and works all night long leave the face soft. I have sensitive skin so alot of products break me out and this doesnt do that.

This face moisturizer is nothing special. Every night I use a moisturizer and expect to wake up with my face feeling smooth- this moisturizer didnt do that for me. My skin was still dry when waking up the next day after using this product. I had to apply a different moisturizer to help my skin. I wont be repurchasing this in the future.

I love the olay regenerist line and i love this new one. I was looking for a night time face cream and this one came just in time.

Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Facial Mositurizer is really good I used it after I put on the Olay Reset Facial Mask. This is packaged really well and pretty. It is very gentle on my skin.

I really like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for the first time last night and I'm writing this review the next morning. My skin is still moisturized and soft. I love the feel of this formula during and after application. It's very smooth, light and absorbs into the skin quickly. Non-greasy and fragrance-free is a huge plus in this product.

I couldn't believe it I've tried so many high brand moisturizers and they feel good going on but once I wake up my skins back to being dry! I would highly recommend this! It's a great drugstore moisturizer and even better it comes with retinol! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I say this a lot, but this is better than any other facial moisturizer I have ever tried! A little definitely goes a long way. It feels very light and airy. It doesnt feel like your putting a whole handful of grease on your face. It makes my skin super smooth and fresh. It also gets rid of this pesky dry spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from Influenster, and I was really excited that I started using it that same night. To be honest I never really used a moisturizer before bed but I have to say that after using the #OlayRetinol24 night moisturizer I wont stop. I have a greasy face and this product did not add to it. It felt light on my skin and smelled super good and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary Olay moisturizer from influenster and I couldnt be happier with my first Vox Box! Im only 26, so of course my 62 year old mom was eyeing my retinol night cream, but no way! Ive used this for the past couple nights and plan on making it a staple in my routine. I hope to see good results from this. Ive never used a retinol cream, but they always say you can never start out too early to prevent aging [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First of all I really love Olay and all their products. Ive used a lot of them and I remember my grandma loved them and used them for forever. So I knew this would be good. I like that it has no smell. The texture of it is nice and feels good on the face. I like it so far and will continue to use to see how the results are. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free from Influenster to review. This is my first night using the product. First impressions I did enjoy the purple and silver packaging. I gave it 4 stars because I feel its a nice quality lightweight night cream. I feel like this product would be great for someone who has more oily skin. I do have super dry skin and since this has retinol in it I would highly recommend a good moisturizing oil afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this in my first voxbox!! Olay is an awesome brand for skincare and I was excited to get to try out this moisturizer. It was very moisturizing and I felt that it had enough hydration without being too heavy. The only thing that would be helpful is if Olay was crulety free and was certified as such. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ive been using this moisturizer with my nightly skin care routine. It is scent free, which is wonderful for sensitive skin. Its not too heavy of a moisturizer, but it isnt too shear either. It is the perfect weight of moisturizer and leaves my skin feeling fresh and very smooth. I love that it has anti-aging components as well! Just what my skin needs! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Influencer must have sensed that my face needed some help because this complimentary product came just in time. Tried it for the first time tonight and i love how light the moisturizer is. Rubbed in into my skin and i love how smooth, moisturized and rich my face feels. My favorite part? No scents. Im very sensitive to scents and they typically irritate my skin . Looking forward to using this product every night [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the fact that it has no smell. My skin is super sensitive to things with scents. Its really smooth and seems like it hydrates very well. I might make this a part of my daily skin care regimen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product! Love the smell and makes my face feel very soft and new the next morning. However, not sure if I would recommend. The downside for me is Im not crazy about all of the ingredients in the product - but Im taking a more natural ingredient approach to face care. So it may be a good product for others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very excited to get this product! Ive been looking into different retinols, so this was the perfect product for me to receive. The moisturizer leaves me feeling hydrated without feeling greasy. Im looking forward to keep using this and see how it helps my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I struggle with seasonal allergies and adult acne, equaling not so soft and dry rough facial skin. Used this and within one night I woke up to super soft and smooth hydrated skin all over! Bonus I also use this for my neck and chest area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I Have recieved this product a day ago. It states its a retinol night facial moisturizer. You apply it all over the face. It is not oily the texture of the moisturizer is creamy kindo of feels like jelly. It glads on smoothly on the face and it doesnt have a scent to it which I like. I did notice my face looking smoother amd brighter!!. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First night trying this product after recieving it complimentary in a voxbox, first impression are GREAT! Light and not greasy, no harsh smells. Dried quickly and I would believe I had no products on at all aside from the smoothness that came immediately from use. #complimentary #contest [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a night moisturizer and I was SO happy to receive this. This product is SUPER hydrating and non-greasy. A little goes a long way with this product, too. When I wake up in the morning I can still feel the product on my face but in a refreshing way. I am so happy with this! 10/10. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always loved products from Olay, particularly their facial creams. But the Regenerist Retinol facial moisturizer is phenomenal. I received it for free from Influenster. It is not greasy, had an easy application, and left my skin with plenty of moisture the next morning. Usually I have to put moisturizer on before my foundation for my morning routine, but I easily skipped that step this morning. I would recommend this product to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the moisterizer. At first I was really skeptical since i havent had much experience with olay products, but this lotion when on beautifully and smelled great. I was not paid to write this review and would recommend purchasing this item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First night using it and so far so good. Its very think, so a little goes a long way! I love that though, because it will last me a while. It feels think but does not feel oily on the skin at all. Its fragrance free, which is perfect for those with sensitive skin. The eye cream is also thick, but doesnt feel oily. Im excited to see the results throughout my time using it. I received this product complementary for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I havent used it long enough yet to give it 5 stars. I really like it though for the time I have used it. It is light and gentle on my skin. I also love how it doesnt make my skin oily. The best part is that it has retinol in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Goes on velvety smooth. Theres a nice little cap on the inside that keeps it from going up in the lid. Non greasy. No harsh fragrance. Doesnt break out my sensitive face. A little goes a long way! I woke up and my skin was even softer than when I first applied it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
To be totally honest I was skeptical about using an Olay moisturizer because I havent tried the brand before. I got it for free for reviewing purposes and I quite enjoyed it. It is very thick which is what my skin type (dry) needs as an overnight moisturizer. It is also fragrance free so there is less of a chance of irritation. It does not have a tacky residue like other moisturizers can. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin feels amazing...adding this product to a great face wash has really helped leaving my face feeling very well moisturized and great...I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is soft and not sticky. A little bit goes a long way. I woke up with very little oil around my problem areas (mostly T-Zone area) and my face not feeling so dried out from the dry nighttime air. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Awesome moisturizer!! It has such a silky texture to it. Immediately after the first use I saw results. I would put this moisturizer up to a high end moisturizer any day!! I will definitely be re-Purchasing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product! Ive been trying it out for a few days since received my voxbox. I have very sensitive skin that is combination of dry and oily. Its a perfect way to hydrate my skin without irritation. I wake up with soft and hydrated skin. I cant wait to keep trying it to see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer left my skin feeling great! I put it on last night before bed and it was thick but creamy. A little went a long way! My skin the next morning felt firm and refreshed. I am loving this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Only giving 4 stars because Ive only used it once. Recieved ot yesturday in the mail, took a shower washed my face & used it. I can say it definitely made me feel hydrated & it was such a smooth feeling. Told my hubby I might of found a new moisturizer. Thank you influenster! Lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this product is fragrance free! That is super important to me these days. Especially in an anti-aging product! I got this product in my voxbox, but I definitely can see myself repurchasing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ill start by saying I have combo skin that is mostly oily in the summer. Right now, this moisturizer is too much for my combo skin. Its thick, and creamy. I used it a few nights, but its just too much with how oily my skin is right now. I look forward to using it this winter when my skin is more dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried a large variety of night time moisturizers. This was had been he favorite so far. Others I have tried tend to be very goopy and heavy. This one makes my skin feel like velvet but also is light. I dont feel greasy going to bed with it on and when I wake up its perfectly settled into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from influenster free to test and review. I always give my honest opinion when reviewing products. This moisturizer cream is great! A little goes a long way. At first when applying it, I thought it was too greasy but it absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. The other thing I like is that it is fragrance free, which is a plus for me. The cream comes in a decent size container and looks pleasant to the eye. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Got this in a VoxBox right after coming back from travelling and this was able to revitalize my skin after several plane rides. The cream is very thick and rich as it is a night cream and after using it over night my skin feels still supple and moisturized in the morning. It's non scented and surprisingly not oily feeling despite how thick it feels. I'm excited to use it through the Chicago winters to keep my skin hydrated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im a pretty simple person when it comes to my skin care routines, and this wasnt a crazy add on. The cream moisturizer was light and despite having retinol in it, my skin seems happy! I received this product for free in exchange for my input. Ill definitely continue using it though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
No complaints. I just started using this product and I have to say I woke up to my skin feeling hydrated. My skin was still hydrated after a shower and cleanse. This is perfect for me since I sometimes run into and forget to apply moisturizer when Im not wearing foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this night moisturizer when i received it complimentary to test and I have to say, I love it! Its super light and doesnt leave your face feeling greasy after you put it on. I work long days so I dont use it every night but Ive still noticed softer, smoother skin! It goes a long way so Id definitely purchase it when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer. Im doing small patch tests on my face right now to see how my skin reacts because I have very sensitive skin, but it leaves my skin feeling soft. It absorbs into my skin so it doesnt feel like theres a greasy film sitting on my face. I highly recommend for a daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the consistency of this! Its thick and creamy and and feels like putting a moisture mask on. Waking up in the morning my skin doesn't feel dry or weighed down by the cream at all. It feels like waking up with a new face every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I wanted to give it about 2 full weeks of use before I reviewed this product. I am very happy! First it works great with my overly sensitive skin. It only took about 3 days to correct my severely dry areas that I always struggle with. In addition my skin looks much healthier and plump! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So happily surprised! Honestly didnt think this eye cream would be as great! I have been waking up with refreshed eyes and no dark circles at all! Also a little bit goes a long way. I definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Review from an oily skinned girl- I LOVE this moisturizer!! It hydrated my skin without me waking up with a face full of grease! Its lightweight, makes my skin SO soft, and doesnt leave any residue behind. HIGHLY recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for approximately two weeks and so far I have nothing but good things to say about it. My face and neck feel sooo soft! I've also noticed a decrease in the redness I normally have in my cheeks. I plan to update more once I have used it for a longer period. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and reviewing, all opinions however, are my own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin and normally use gobs of lotion, just for it to sink in and feel dry again. I was excited when I received this Olay cream for free. I am a huge fan of olay and this moisturizer seals the deal. My face feels like silk after using this lotion, and I only use a little bit, less than I normally do. After a week of using it, my face looks refreshed and has never felt better. This line is definitely my new go to. I highly recommend, definitely a must have!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling incredible when I wake up. It doesnt feel thick and heavy, but it locks in amazing moisture on my dry patches! I will definitely be buying another when this one is empty! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this moisturizer much better than the eye cream. It goes on a bit oily but does not get on pillows/blankets during the night. Soaks in well by morning you have soft, smooth skin. I love the results Ive seen in just a few short weeks. I can only imagine the long term benefits. Would buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing! I actually got to try because of the Olay voxbox i got from influenster. It's great because it's a very light cream. It has no scent & it works. You see results quickly. I love it. Thank you influenster #olayvoxbox #influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free for my input, but Im so glad Ive had the opportunity to try it! Ive only been using this product for a week or so, but it feels super lightweight when you put it on and it dries quickly. Other retinol creams can be too harsh and drying, but definitely not this one. I use it each night and havent had any peeling/dryness. I love it so far and cant wait to see if I start noticing results soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a dream - Ive been using it daily for about a week now. The texture is silky and the scent is subtle and pleasant. I work outside quite a bit between my job and my garden at home, so my skin really gets put through the ringer. I apply this after removing my makeup, right before bed, and I wake up with skin thats smooth, hydrated, and firm. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love how this doesnt feel greasy ! My skin felt super soft and looked like it was glowing from inside. I would definitely recommend this for people with dry skin or if you just want that extra glow boost through the night [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how my face feels after applying this product. I was sent this product for free to try it out and so far have been very pleased with it. I like that it is fragrance free. I have used this brand before but not this noght cream. Its not supper heavy or thick but makes my face feel great after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've had such a hard time finding a good moisturizer that worked for my combo skin and was also not super heavy and greasy. I think I've found it in this product. The moisture lasts through the night and I don't feel like i have a ton of products on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoy all aspects of this moisturizer. Its gentle on my sensitive skin, moisturizing it without leaving it greasy or oily. I noticed my skin was softer, and a little brighter after a weeks use. While I received this complimentary to try and review, I would absolutely buy this on my own after seeing results better than prestige brand moisturizer I usually use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer! Its very silky and sinks into the skin easily. I've been using it once a day at night for about a week and a half and my skin looks moisturized and healthy. It doesn't leave a greasy feel and when I wake up in the morning, my skin still feels soft. The texture your skin feels is almost velvety! Its so addicting. I would definitely restock this. *I received this product for free for reviewing purposes* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have super sensitive skin and often have crazy allergic reactions to face creams...so I was scared to try this product! But it has not caused my face to break out at all. It's fragrance free, which makes it a great option for people like me with sensitive skin. It feels good on your skin and doesn't burn or sting like some anti-aging products. I can't attest to the anti-aging benefits yet, but so far I've enjoyed this product (I received this product for free in a voxbox for my honest review). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off, not the greatest smelling moisturizer.. Very unpleasant, NOT fragrance free. Cooling feeling when applying and dries very quick. The fragrance of the moisturizer just really didnt do it for me, though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have really acne prone skin and am always skeptical to try new products for my face. This has not broke me out! The texture of this cream is different than other moisturizers Ive used. On my face it feels so smooth and light. Not greasy at all. Smells nice too. Def recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for about a week and a half now... I can definitely say my skin is clear Tighter and I have less breakouts. my dark spots have lightened out tremendously especially under my eyes. I love that you don't need a huge amount to cover your whole face and neck it's definitely a great product I will definitely be buying it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive been using this for a week now at night only. I can actually see and feel a difference. Skin is definitely more supple. Feels quenched. I like it just as much as my PTR I pay way more for. Only reason not 5 stars is because the smell could be better. Its kinda plastic smelling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A great night time moisturizer. It does have retinol and My face did not have any type of reaction to it thankfully. I didnt feel it being too strong nor did my skin irritate once. I put it at night after washing my face and pair it along with the retinol 24 eye cream as well. I have really enjoyed it up to now and have not had anything negative to say about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product smells amazing and has a nice light texture. It was easy to apply and did t irritate my sensitive skin. I enjoyed the results I swear I saw firmer skin the next morning. Ive been using it a few days now and dont think Ill stop. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i have only tried one other moisturizer before this one and for me I like that this was fragrance free because I have sensitive skin. It made me face smooth and soft which is a plus! Id def try this product again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Not my favorite moisturizer. It doesnt sink well into the skin and it balls up if you try to layer with any other skin care. I do like that there is no scent to this product but I would pass on this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this so much! This leaves my face so soft. Ive only used this for about a week so Im still testing it out but so far so good. This product is gentle on the skin and I would definitely recommend this to other people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had actually been on the hunt for a new moisturizer when I received this in the mail. I really really like this moisturizer. It makes your skin so soft and really lasts all day long. I would definitely recommend trying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love love love this cream. Its thick and great for overnight. I always wake up feeling moisturized. As an added bonus it does not make me feel greasy. The tub is huge and a little goes a long way. I will definitely be buying this in stores!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this eye cream. Seems to be working but I think I need to give it a few more weeks. I like how light it goes on. You dont need much product at all! So smooth and non scented which is nice! This small size will last a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I normally don't use a night cream and moisturize only in the morning. So I'm not super sure what results to expect but the consistency is nice and it feels nice on my skin...a nice fresh feeling right before bedtime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Olay Regenerist Retinol Night Moisturizer is a Godsend. My favorite time to moisturize is at night and this one truly sinks into my skin without any greasy residue. I notice my skin feeling hydrated into the morning and throughout the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product I have super dry skin especially on my face this product instantly moisturized my skin I have been using it for a week now and my skin is noticeably softer I was worried at first about applying it to my face because I was worried about the possibility of it causing acne but I have not had that issue with this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have not had too much time to try this out, but I have used it pretty consistently over the past week and I can say that I do like it. It is definitely moisturizing and doesnt feel heavy on my skin. It isnt the best moisturizer Ive used, but isnt the worst either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this night moisturizer! Its not heavy or sticky, it has a very delicate scent and it hydrated your skin instantly! Ive also noticed reduction in morning puffiness and redness which is a huge plus for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this item free in a recent VoxBox. It is a very heavy cream. I guess that's why it's a night cream. I haven't really noticed any difference in my skin but skin care takes time. The packaging is a very nice heavy plastic or glass. It looks nice on my vanity. I'm not sure I would purchase this item myself due to cost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion feels fantastic on my skin. The unscented smell is a plus. It goes on smoothly without a thick sticky feeling afterward. I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing it again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream felt really good on my face. It is really moisturizing. After a few days my skin seemed brighter and smoother. My face seems all around newer and revived after using this product. Would definitely recommend it to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great moisturizer! A little bit goes a long way. This does have a silky feeling finish to it and leaves your skin feeling dewy. Probably not something you would love if you have very oily skin. I have used it for about a week now and dont see major results, but does help your skin get some hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I honestly loved this. It makes my eyes look so much brighter in the morning. And my skin is so soft! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has issues with bags under their eyes or dry skin. It's extremely simple to use as well which is a perk for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is amazing. Again you only need a little bit at a time. The more you use the harder and flakey it got. (I used to much the first night) I've been using this for a good week and I definitely have seen some improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great night moisturizer! It doesnt leave my skin feeling greasy. When I wake up it doesnt have a weird film left on my skin. The packaging is really nice. I received this complimentary but Id definitely consider repurchasing this is in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Omg this moisturizer is AMAZING! The gist night I got a little to excited and put to much on so I put the rest on my husband who said his face felt amazing and pretty! Its not to greasy and smells good as well! My skin is singing praises since have used it this whole wk. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the creaminess of the product and the lack of fragrance. My skin typically doesnt like product that as an overly heavy scent. Its super thick so a little goes a long way, which to me means more bang for your buck. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add retinol to their skincare regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the Olay regenerist retinol 24 night facial moisturizer for review and I have to stay it didnt disappoint. The moisturizer is no tto thick, not too thin and after using it for 2 weeks it never clogged my pores- which a lot of other products do. I do wish it was a tiny bit thicker, but thats just personal preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I mean in 24 skin care is super important for me right now because this is when it counts. I dont necessarily see any difference just yet, I love the way it feels on my skin tho almost velvety I have oily combo skin and have not had a break out since using it although I still use my acne cream. I dont think I would have gone out of my way to purchase this though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely LOVE this night time moisturizer! The soft silky feeling it leaves is my favorite. I would much rather this then any oily feeling moisturizer while still getting the same hydrating benefit! There is no scent what so ever, that is a big plus as well. The morning after my skin feels incredibly soft and hydrated. I will for 100% sure be repurchasing when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Okay so I have pretty dry skin and I got this product free to review! I honestly enjoy it, its definitely helped some with my dryness and has helped make my skin much softer! I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First off I love the packaging for this item! I really like that it is fragrance free. My first reaction was wow this feels great when applying. Its thick! I have been using for 3 days now and it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. Its one of the best moisturizers I have used in a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have enjoyed using this facial moisturizer. It leaves the skin feeling silky but not oily. I've never used this before now, so I'm not sure if the retinol is really doing much for my skin. I can't say I've noticed any differences yet. I have extremely oily, acne prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this in a VoxBox and it made my skin smoother. I havent noticed a difference in the fine lines or wrinkles. I think the only thing I have noticed is that my skin is smooth. I like that about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am stunned about this facial Moisturizer! I didnt know what to expect at first because my skin is pretty sensitive to new products, but after the first night of use I fell in love with it! Not just because the way it makes my skin feel and look, but also because Mu skin didnt break up!. The texture of the cream is heavy and a little bit oily but it leaves your skin looking fresh, smooth and not oily at all! I am definitely buying another one after this one is gone. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It feels very thick and rich going on, instantly feels hydrating and nutrient on my skin. After even the first few uses Ive noticed a difference in the softness and texture of my skin as well as a smoother application of my makeup. Would definitely recommend and would re purchase again. This product was sent to me for free to review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love the consistency of this cream. It feels like it just melts into the skin and makes it feel so refreshed. Havent noticed any changes to color on my face yet but have only been using for a few days. Great product will definitely be recommending it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow, I was very pleasantly surprised by this product! First of all, they sent a full size product in a VoxBox, which was awesome. The packing is adorable and I love that shade of purple. The product itself is really thick, but you only need a little bit to get the job done. This stuff makes my skin super soft and I havent noticed any breakouts or anything. I am really enjoying using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely adore this night cream. It was ultra smooth when applied. It didn't leave my face feeling oily or greasy in the morning. I didn't have any breakouts which sometimes happens since I do have combination skin. I've been trying it for 5 days and I'm very pleased. The price is a little steep however there is a lot of product in the container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really look forward to using this each night. It is very gentle on the skin and goes on super smooth. I want a bigger container so I dont ever have to run out! I like the way it makes my face feel afterwards. I would recommend this to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this cream !! Works super good on dry sensitive skin !! Dont smell strong and its super nice size !! ( I receive this product for complementary testing purposes) also I recommend use on night time because on the day feels greasy !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had not tried Olay products prior to receiving my Vox Box. Let me just say I am so excited that I got to try it out. I absolutely love it. Within a few minutes of applying the moisturizer my face was the smoothest I've ever felt it, like suede! And my face stayed soft into the next day. It didnt get oily with which I LOVED. I will definitely be purchasing this once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really really like this moisturizer I felt my face in the past about a week and a half two two weeks it really feels softer I wake up with more moisturize skin I could say that my makeup goes on a lot more smoother I really want to continue using this in to see where it goes I definitely would buy this again and I definitely recommend and enjoy it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As Im currently under the care of a dermatologist any product that I use has a slight burn. This however, does not. I havent seen a difference in my skin long term, but I can tell just from using it for a week that this product leaves my skin baby smooth after apply and theres no sign of any dryness in the morning. The amount of product you receive for the price is great! You dont need to apply a lot so the amount should last a good while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can't believe I spent so much time to find a great night moisturizer that would work for my skin during warm weather. I have a combination skin and during warm and hot weather I suffer so much with the oil parts. This night moisturizer keeps my face hydrated and soft without making it oily. With only a few days I have already noticed the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Really enjoyed how it left my face feeling refreshed. It is lightweight leaving my face feeling smooth and airy. Unlike some I have tried it does not leave my skin feeling oily or clogged after applying. Super gentle on my sensitive skin, I will be buying more.

Also, a little goes a long way. I hope to continue to incorporate this product into my nightly routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The night time moisturizer is greatly creamy. I normally have dry skin and have to use a moisturizer daily. I stopped using my moisturizer in the morning and noticed that my skin is still smooth.

I like this moisturizer a lot! Feels very light weight on the skin and isnt too heavy that makes you feel uncomfortable! It smells nice and is a good cream!

This makes my skin feel super smooth and hydrated. It doesn't feel greasy and you can feel that it actually sinks into your skin instead of sitting on top.

"I really enjoyed this product. It has left my skin feeling so soft and it really does feel moisturized for 24 hours. The only reason why i do not give it 5 stars is because although they say it is not oily, i did find it to be just a bit greasy on my fingers and face, but its not so much that i would stop using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this free from Influenster for review purposes. One of my biggest issues with this is the heavy silicone base of it. It feels more like a primer than a night moisturizer and it was just sitting too heavy on y skin. It didnt cause any breakouts the first few times I used it but I feel like if I use it too frequently it may. It isnt too strong on my skin in terms of the retinol content. I think the biggest issue is texture and how heavy it feels [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far I'm really liking this product this is my first time using Olay. I love that it doesn't have a scent to it. After putting it on, it made my skin feel soft, smooth, clean and refreshing. Though, I feel like its making me break out, but not badly just a few small pimples. Other than that this product is now my fave.

The texture of this product is great. My skin feels amazing and smooth after using it. It doesnt have that icky oily feeling to it. The skin absorbs it in no time. My skin feels fresh and after a week of using it my skin looks a bit brighter. My only thing is it's only for night time and I usually like using products that I can use both I the day time and night time. But I would recommend this to my friends and family.

I will definitely continue to use and purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is very smooth and goes on and absorbs quickly. The packaging is beautiful and looks nice sitting on my makeup shelf. The price is great compared to other bra lands as well. It leaves my skin feeling so soft after it absorbs into my skin. I have noticed it doesnt do much for my super dry areas but does help those some. I would reccomend for anyone but if you have really dry flaky skin use another moisturizer in your super dry zones as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

As for the retinol properties, Im not sure if it made my pores smaller or decreased sun spots or wrinkles I think that will take a little more time to tell!

"*I received this product for free through Vox Box* This is a great moisturizer. My face was really dry and dull before using this, but in just two days my skin feels super soft. This product isn't heavy or greasy at all and didn't make my normally oily skin shiny. It leaves your face feeling silky for hours after application too. It's too soon to tell how the Retinol is working for me, but as a moisturizer, this product is definitely worth the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that the product is not greasy, doesn't have a smell (which is a plus) and it doesn't take alot to cover your face. However, I have sensitive skin and when I put it on, it burned a little and turned me red. This is my first night using it and so far I have no other complaints. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
*this product was received from influenster* Can I say WOW? I absolutely love this product. This is my 3rd night using it and I have noticed a difference in the softness and brightness in my skin. I would recommend this product to add to anyone's night time skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never tried a retinol before today and I love it. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and not sticky. I highly recommend everybody try this out!

"There is no smell at all. Its VERY creamy, and a little goes a long way! It goes on very smooth and tingles a bit on the skin. Its not at all greasy and feels like a very high end product. I really like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Its a thicker cream but that is great for a night cream. It instantly plumped and moisturized my skin. I love that its unscented as well. The value is also there! I would buy again. Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am AMAZED at how well my skin has reacted to this facial moisturizer. I tend to have very sensitive skin with it comes to creams and lotions on my face and Most usually make me break out. This stuff is so lightweight and Ive had no problems. I usually have dry flaky skin in the mornings but this cream has greatly minimized all that. Love!

"Love this product! It really does make my skin feel significantly smoother, brighter, and softer! I would definitely consider buying this product! (This review provided after I received the product courtesy of Influenster). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how lightweight and truly odorless this cream is! I live in a very humid climate and a lot of moisturizers tend to ""melt off"" as soon as you put them on. This moisturizer is very light and airy and it doesn't even feel like you have anything on. It is slightly on the pricier side however, it takes very little product. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a midrange priced moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I have extremely sensitive skin with patches of eczema on my face, so products easily irritate my skin. However this night moisturizer is wonderful! It doesnt burn or irritate my skin and I definitely feel as if my skin looks better. I havent been using it long enough to tell if my fine lines are going away but over all my skin seems to be improving in just one week ! Totally recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is rapidly becoming a favorite! I love that it is fragrance-free and how soft and smooth it is to apply. It is already showing noticable noticeable differences in the fine lines. This was my first time trying a nighttime moisturizer and my face absorbed it gladly. I highly recommend this! Thanks to influenster for the free item! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This makes my face feel really refreshed, but just like the eye cream it is greasy for the first few minutes of it being applied. Once I have used it more I will do an updated review of how it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The retinal night facial cream is amazing ! My skin was lacking in elasticity and moisture . But once Im used the play night cream Ive seen a good change! My skin looks glows and the retinol is a plus ingredient! My marks on my face lightened up and faded from pimple scaring which was a big surprise to me! I would recommend this cream to all skin types! Not oily at all [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Creamy, rich texture. You only need to use a small amount each night so the jar goes a long way. This was my first time trying a night cream and I noticed that when i woke up each morning my skin felt cleaner and softer. There isn't much of a scent to the product. Would purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very sensitive skin so I was a little worried when trying this out but its been working great! It is so mosturizing and its also unsented which is great if you have sensitive skin. Im excited to see how my skin is feeling in a month because so far after a week it is doing great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is Ah-May-Zing! It made my skin feel so soft and after a week I saw a noticable diminishing of the smile lines around my mouth and the furrow lines in my brow! The only thing I didnt like was how heavy it felt on my face but it's incredibly effective and didn't irritate my acne at all! No breaks outs caused by switching or trying new products is always a plus!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"kind of heavy for a moisturizer but, since its for overnight use, its not the worst quality. it doesnt have a scent which is nice. ive only used it three times now, so long term wise i havent seen any differences in my skins moisture status. i dont think i would buy this product but only because i havent noticed a change in my skin condition since using it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Its hard to explain the refreshening feel after applying the eye cream! Its light but feels surprisingly refreshening afterwards. Its definitely rejuvenating and not oily at all! I like the new formula. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received these products free from influenster for testing. I really liked it obsorbed right away made my face feel nice and moisturized. The only thing I can say is I believe it helping wrinkles alright and resurfacing your skin because I had skin coming off and peeling I would definitely say this stuff is intense. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is silky smooth and leaves a nice soft touch while applying and after waking up. I definitely feel like my.usually very dry skin is softer and more radiant. Will have to do a check in after a month or so! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This moisturizer is so rich and hydrating. I am on a prescription strength retinol, and this product hasnt irritated me at all. Its my first time using this product, though Ive used other Olay moisturizers in the past. Its rich but not too thick, and makes my skin soft and supple when I wake up in the morning. Definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love how soft my skin feels after applying this moisturizer, its a softness Ive never felt with any other moisturizer. I cannot truly say at this point if I have noticed a difference in my skin as I have only been using it for less than a week and believe it takes time. However, Im hoping my skin likes it as much as it feels like it does after application! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product is amazing. I wake up in the morning with my face feeling fresh and renewed. I used to have an issue with flaky skin around my cheeks, but NO MORE. I also love that it's unscented and light, it makes it easy to not notice that you have it on, which is pretty important for a night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream feels great on my face. Light, but also like its actually doing something. Its hard to know how to review without weeks and weeks of consistent use, but after one week of consistent use my skin definitely feels softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer hydrated my skin overnight so much! My skin has been adjusting to the weather change recently and started breaking out. Once I used this, I woke up with my skin feeling as if I just put on moisturizer. It is a retinol so make sure you apply sunscreen in the morning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have typical skin, no really big problems except very occasionally dryness. I am always cautious to try a new moisturizer for fear it will be too oily on my skin.

It's not heavy or greasy. Definitely will remain in my skin care routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have used this product for 3 days and already seen improvement in my skin. The product was very comfortable and I did not feel any stinging that usually comes with retinoid products. I have major oil control issues and I feel like the product is tightening my pores and thus decreasing my oil production. Its also helping to clear some hyperpigmentation I have from pimple picking scars. I am excited to see how my skin will look in the next couple of weeks.

It's super lightweight, not oily AT ALL, and just the right amount of moisture. Not gonna lie, I've used it for a moisturizer after showering in the morning too. It was amazing.

It softened up my skin more than it was before. I feel like I dont look as tired as I really am. I feel like it is really thick so you only need to use a little.

"This was my first time trying Olay Regenerist Moisturizer! I thought the packaging was lovely, and it provided long lasting moisture overnight without feeling greasy or leaving residue on my pillow. I would recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, I was really surprised to recieve this VoxBox. I immediately used it the first night and it made my skin feel super soft and smooth. I've been looking for a new face and eye cream and getting this was perfect timing. I can't wait to continue using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an amazing moisturizer. My face has a bad habit of breaking out when it's introduced to new skin care that it really is not used to. I have never purchased Olay skincare before, which I now realize is a mistake u have been making for years. I recommend to anyone that needs an excellent face moisturizer. And I low-key feel like this is an excellent Tachta (if thats how you spell it) knock off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received this complementary from Influenster, Ive used this for 3 days and can already tell a noticeable different, my skin looks smoother and feels so much more hydrated. I can especially tell on my neck, I cant believe how smooth and hydrated it is. Ive struggled for a few weeks after traveling my skin around my nose and lips has been so incredibly dry, this moisturized it the first night I used it. It doesnt leave your skin feeling oily, it absorbs right in :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this stuff, makes my skins super smooth and soft, not oily or greasy feeling or looking. I was so excited to see my voxbox in the mail, awesome packaging. Very gentle, don't have to use much so it will last forever!!! I will definitely buy this when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a really nice night cream. The only thing I didnt like about it is that when you put it in it feels almost like powdery if that makes sense? Like it almost doesnt absorb into the skin almost. Thats why I took one star off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this moisturizer through Influenster for free! I love how smooth it is. Pretty thick so I definitely feel like it works all through the night. My skin felt so soft and smooth the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free for testing purposes for a contest. I have been using it for the past few days and so far I absolutely love it! The packaging is pretty and the formula is so smooth and creamy... it feels amazing on the skin! My skin after just one use was super soft! It is not greasy at all and absorbs super quickly.. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Used this for the first time last night and I can say that it is great. It has a very subtle scent to it, nothing to overwhelming. It was absorbed into my skin rather quickly and instantly made my skin super soft. I woke up this morning to bright soft skin on my face. I think after prolonged use any wrinkles I may have will be gone. (I received this product for free) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Left my skin really soft and smooth, I have more of a glow to it. The packaging is simple but nice, the smell is pleasant nothing over the top. It's not greasy or sticky feeling and not too heavy. My skin is sensitive and I haven't had any reactions. So far I really like this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff feels AMAZING on my skin. I will definitely continue using because the results were immediate and unlike any facial moisturizer Ive ever tried. Lightweight and smooth as silk!! An absolute must have for every nightly routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I really like this cream. It absorbs fast, has a really light smell and is really light. The packaging looks nice, I like a little detail on the top. I just started using mine and so far, the skin looks more fresh in the morning. Make sure to use it at night only since it has Retinol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I will certainly be buying this once I run out of this! It made my skin feel smooth and felt supple. I got comments on how pretty my skin looked and how I was glowing. This was after a weeks worth of uses every night before bedtime. So I can see what the hype is about!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is light and silky. It feels amazing going on my face. It's not thun and runny like other moisturizers. Its thicker but not too thick. I feel it covering my skin. Just after a couple days, my facial skin improved with the elasticity and brightness. My skin also feels much more moisturized and less dry. I love this product and will definitely keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free to test. Im liking it so far. It isnt greasy and doesnt clog my pores despite it being a thick cream. I wake up with moisturized skin and am excited to see the anti aging effects the more I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After 2 days of using this moisturizer, I can honestly say that my skin feels sooooo soft and smooth. It doesnt feel oily or greasy AT ALL! This will definitely remain in my nighttime skin care routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wake up feeling refreshed and ready for the day! Retinol to keep the skin looking young. The container is HUGE! Will last a good 6 months to a year. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good nighttime moisturizer #VoxBox I received this product for free for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay regenerist moisturizing night cream didn't work as well as the eye cream did for me. Also it is way to pricey in stores. I received this product for free, in my first Influenster VoxBox. The packaging is very eye catching and beautiful. I am going to continue to use this product to see if I notice better results after a couple more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of my favorite moisturizers I have used. It feels nice and cool when I put it on, doesnt feel too oily, and makes my face/neck nice and soft all night into the next day. It smells nice but not too strong. I would recommend to someone who isnt looking for a super oily moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really have only ever used acne helping products so this was new for me. I loved it! I put it on just before bed and it absorbed super quickly and didnt leave a heavy oily residue feeling on my face which is a big deal for me. It also didnt have any scent which was nice. I woke up the next day feeling like my face looked fuller? More plump? Healthier! I will definitely keep using this product! I love the feel and the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizer not only is it super hydrating but it has no strong scent which I truly appreciate its my new staple Ive been looking for a good night time moisturizer that hydrated my skin and I dont wake up with a dry feeling on my face thanks Influenster so sending this to me I loved it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never used a night moisturizer before and I have to say this olay night moisturizer has me wondering why!! It's easy to apply, feels amazing going on, during moisturizing and after moisturizing, affordable and most of all convenient!! I'm hoping this will be the secret to solve my dry intxhy, flaky winter skin!! Thanks influenster for the opportunity to try something amazing and new to me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is amazing! I have been looking for a facial moisturizer for a while that would meet my needs and this is it! I have naturally oily skin and many moisturizers leave my skin even more oily, but this doesn't! I don't wake up in the morning with an oily face which is huge for me. In the week I've been using this, I've already noticed some changes on some of the dark spots on my face. This is a product I'd highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LOVE THIS! Seriously. I have combination skin and nothing ever works for both the oily and dry parts of my skin but this does. It goes on and doesnt feel oily. And as time goes on it doesnt dry out or get oily. It keeps my skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. This is the only face moisturizer I'll be using from now on [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I realized that I placed the wrong review under the eye cream. The moisturizer is heaven sent! My skin feels so supple and soft. It just gives you a new outlook on life. You feel more vibrant. It goes on light and doesn't feel sticky to the touch. Very simple application. I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this free for review. The moisturizer doesnt really have a smell other than the normal lotion smell. It is very silky and smooth and make my face feel this way as well. Even though I received this one for review when I run out I will definitely be buying another one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My new favorite moisturizer. Used it at night before going to bed. Caused absolutely no irritation to my sensitive skin. After only a couple days of using the product I saw improvement in the evenness of my skin tone. Dark spots and wrinkles and fine lines were improved. Skin was left looking smooth and the fragrance free formula is perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free for a trial from Influenster, but this review is all from my experience with the product. Ive been using it for several nights now and it does seem to work great as a moisturizer! I do also use clinical strength retinol normally, so this isnt as strong, but I like it for an overnight moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best night facial mouistuzer! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to fight off wrinkles! It comes in a nice packaging and easy to apply. It met my expectations and I would recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The moisturiser is not too runny. It is like a very thin layer on the skin. I always love good moisturisers to apply at night so I can wake up with a healthy looking face. And okay never disappoints. Must try for healthy looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer has a great smell and definitely leaves you face feeling smooth and hydrated. I only used it for three days and already can notice a huge difference in my face. Not a big fan of the lid its kind of hard to open. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have dry skin so I'm picky about my moisturizers because I need long lasting. This is a night time moisturizer that I've been using for a few days and I love that I wake up with my skin feeling soft and smooth. This moisturizer is so easily applied. The presentation of the product is gorgeous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great moisturizer , I love the consistency of it . It is a night cream that everyone needs . Some night creams arent thick and dont last overnight but this is good . Only gave 4 stars since I havent used it for a long period of time to see results . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this in a voxbox it is not greasy, you dont need much for it to do the job. My skin has felt hydrated and smooth, it is also clearing up my face and evening out my skin tone. I will definitely buy this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely dry skin and though I've only used it a handful of times so far I can say that I really like it. I typically use shea or cocoa butter on my skin but this lotion is thick and creamy enough that it actually provides adequate moisture with not much product. My face felt soft and comfortable throughout the night. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product makes your skin soft after the first try. The reason that im giving it such a low score is it feels so greasy on the skin and takes forever to dry down. I applied a dime size to my entire face and neck area and ended up having to blot some of it off of my face because it felt so heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"OMGOSH! This stuff is THE BOMB! I have very sensitive skin and very dry skin mainly around my nose and hairline. This product has done wonders. I love it so much I actually have been using it twice a day. Its moon thank feels great, not greasy at all. I definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product in a Voxbox from Influenster. I love all Olay products. Im so glad I was able to test this facial moisturizer out. The packaging is really nice. Product comes in an acrylic container. This cream is scent free. When I applied it on my face the cream glides on smoothly. Made my skin feel so soft and moisturized the next day. I recommend this facial moisturizer by Olay. Thank you Influenster for allowing me to test this product out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am in awe of this product. The texture is creamy and not too thin or thick. Very soft to the skin. You do not need to use a lot. This was my first time using and I will use it again. My face feels smooth and soft hours later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this in my Olay Voxbox, and I'm telling you guys that it's amazing!! I put it on before bed and my skin feels like silk in the morning! I'm super impressed!! My skin has been softer, more supple, and younger looking. There's no smell, it's light weight, and super moisturizing. I absolutely love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff feels great going on. Its pretty lightweight for a nighttime moisturizer but it is still heavy hitting. I have only used it twice but the retinol has helped clear up my acne a bit. I havent changed anything else in my routine but will probably purchase this when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the way it makes my skin feel when I wake up but putting it on at night its kind of has like a greasy/oily finish when I apply it which I dont like especially since I have oily skin but you only need to apply very little since it goes all over with not much product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Omg I just received this voxbox and I can't tell you how excited I was to receive this and try it. It feels so soft and smooth in my skin and I know it's too early to tell but I can already feel a huge difference in my skin. I live it and am now going to purchase from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this complimentary for testing a couple day's ago so I've been only using this for 2 nights, but so far I am loving it. My skin is so hydrated, but not greasy looking or feeling. I used little to much the first night, but you wouldn't of known as it just melted into my skin so fast and it makes my skin so soft. I haven't been using it long enough to see any other results so I will update after trying it out longer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to try this out for a few days before I gave my review. But I really liked this cream. Its moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy. I love how my skin feels the day after. I wake up with pretty great skin. It has no scent which is a plus. I was given this sample complimentary for reviewing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I hate face products that have a scent and this is DEFINITELY not one of them. This product is very light and has absolutely no fragrance which is important to me. My skin feels good. Could maybe be a little more moisturizing but if it helps to fix signs of aging/uneven skin tone then I don't mind. Just started using. Will update in 2 weeks with more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was the first thing I tried when I recieved my box. I would definitely buy this night creme again. It felt waxy at first when I applied to my skin, then it dried feeling matte. I like this product because it sets well, and it is not oily at all! I would've given this product a better rating if it had a nice scent to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So let me start by saying that I am not a night cream type of person, but this has changed my skin in just a couple of days. My skin looks more refreshed and hydrated. Retinol is known for improving dull and hyperpigmentation, so I am hoping to have more of a glowy appearance soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Full disclaimer: Im 28 so its not like I have a ton of wrinkles but I have noticed some finer lines that werent there a few years ago and my skin didnt feel as firm as it did before I had a baby. Using this cream nightly that I received complimentary for testing purposes for the last week has not only tightened things up, but my skin is noticeably smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had gotten this night time facial moisturizer complimentary from Influenster to test out. It has only been a couple of nights but I noticed a couple dry spots on my face are slowly getting better. It isnt the lightest moisturizer but at the same time thats what I feel I need for my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Retinal24 caught me by surprise On how big the product was wasn't expecting so much in a small container. Smelled like your regular lotion. Smoothed and moist to put on face. Will definitely be trying till I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im super picky about my moisturizer. I have sensitive skin, so Im not always forthcoming when it comes to change lmao. I have used this 3 days/nights in a row. I apply before my primer for the day, and then after my shower for night. My skin is so soft! I have not had issues with breakouts or redness. So far, Im impressed. I have never used Olay before. The cream is not overly thick and its not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for 3 nights now and I can honestly say my skin has been looking better every morning. It has no scent which is great for sensitive skin. It goes on very smooth and it's very light weight for a night cream. Absorbs in to the skin quick. I have been using this with other Olay products which has been working out great so far. I received this product for free in the Olay Voxbox courtesy of Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product!! Only been using for a few days but Ive already ruled out my old moisturizer! Its so light and leaves skin feeling soft and silky. I love the container, so cute!

very nice for a drugstore brands the packaging is pretty good and the quality of the product is great for drugstore in my opinion the moisturizer feels a bit thicker and goes on really smooth my husband likes it as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I.Love.This.Moisturizer. Its ideal for people with combo skin. Its very lightweight and doesnt clog your pores. It feels like your natural skin and doesnt leave you looking or feeling like a grease ball. It also dries down quickly to a matte finish. Doesnt smell like anything I could point out. Totally recommend this if you have combo or oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Most products that say no fragrance in fact have a fragrance, this one doesnt. It left my face feeling smooth and got rid of some of the dry flakes around my nose. I would definitely recommend it if youre looking for a new moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This might be my new favorite moisturizer! This cream is so supple, it glides on perfectly and lesves my skin hydrated and refreshed in the morning. This product certainly met my expectations and I would absolutely purchase this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is AMAZING!! Its only been a few days of trying it but so far its been keeping my face from feeling dry ALL day! A little goes a long way so dont go overboard with it but thats a good thing! I like that it has a little stopper to make sure it doesnt leak on anything. I also love that it isnt scented, fragrances tend to irritate my skin. 100% recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this Olay regenerist retinol 24 night facial cream from, Influenster, for free for testing purpkses, and I must say I am loving it!! It's not heavy or greasy at all, but the consistency is a thick, white cream. It absorbs as soon as you put it on, my skin soaked it up very quickly. It has a light good smell and it left my skin soft looking, and filled in my fine lines making my skin look younger and brighter. I would definitely recommend this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the texture of this moisturizer, and the fact that it has absolutely no smell. It was very silky and creamy and my fingers and so soft to the touch I put it on my skin let it sit for a few minutes and my skin literally feels like clouds it is so soft. And the next day my skin actually looks rejuvenated like theres actually moisture in my skin and its not so dried out. I absolutely love this stuff and I will buy it from here on out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 night moisturizer was hard to open but it says that it truly has a treasure inside. Applying its cool cream was fun-my husband helped & had fun too. It was very light yet still rich & creamy. After, I felt like it really helped shed the dirt off my face & truly deeply cleanse it. Its the days after & my skin feels lit [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for testing and lets just say I LOVE it! Most night creams leave my face super oily the next morning however this one does not! I can wash my face the next morning when i get to it AND if I forget to apply morning moisturizer my face doesnt feel like the Sahara desert! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Recieved this item in my voxbox from Influenster as complimentary, love how light it felt on my face and No greasy feeling at all...I used it for the past 2 days I will definitely use this item every night from now on. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smells very good and is moisturizing. The packaging is sleek and expensive looking. A little goes a long way because the formula is pretty thick and a lot of application could make my normal skin too greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First impressions: The moisturizer is thick but super lightweight and sinks into the skin almost immediately leaving the face feeling hydrated and silky smooth! I have acne scar and breakouts and they do not feel scabby at all ( I know gross!!!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really am loving the olay regenerist retinol moisturizer! Its really lightweight but still luxurious on the skin. Some of these fortified moisturizers can feel so oppressive on the skin before bed- this is the opposite. Ive been using alongside the eye cream from the same line and theyre a great pair! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far this moisturizer has been gentle on my sensitive skin. I havent seen any break outs while using it. It doesnt leave my skin feeling oily or dry however it is a bit thick for my liking so it is definitely better to use before bed. It is a night cream after all. Cant wait to see more results in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The best moisturizer I have used. Keeps my skin hydrated for the entire day. Only need to use a drop at a time, a little goes a long way. The top easily twists on and off and its easy to take as much as I need. Would recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell is Very subtle since it is fragrance free, but it still has a very light smell to it. I love how moisturizing the cream is and how smoothly it applies on skin. It comes with a very decent amount! I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product feels light on my skin, and hasn't made my super sensitive skin irritated! This was my first time trying this product, and I was a bit nervous just because my skin can be so sensitive. So far it's been great though! Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good night time mosturizer to balance their skin out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the night facial moisturizer last night and I love it!!!

Just got this moisturizer and it feels very nice on the skin. I am a huge fan of retinols so hopefully this helps with anti-aging and lightening my dark spots. It takes a while to notice a difference so its still TBD [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thank you Influenster for sending me these Olay goodies! This formula is super light weight, fragrance free and extremely moisturizing!

I will definitely be purchasing this once I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive been wanting to try a retinol cream for a while but was worried about irritation or breakouts. This night moisturizer was very gentle and soothing and I woke up with clear skin and no issues!

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just got this olay regenerist retinol night facial moisturizer and so far I think its great. Ive always suffered with combination skin, which leaves me dry in some places and really oily in others. Its hard to find products that help one area without hurting the other.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After one time use, I can already feel the difference in my skin. I received this in a voxbox and I am so happy. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't make me break out and made my skin super soft.

I received this product for free to test and review. First off this has no odor which again if you read my eye cream review that is a major plus for me. Second this leaves my face feeling smooth as soon as I put this one and I love that. Finally I will continue to buy this product and recommend to my friends and family. I love it.

This is now my new favorite night cream. I have been using Mary Kay for a year and this made my eye bags look so much better the first night I used it. A lot goes a long way too. Rubbing my eyes in the middle of the night did not irritate them either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off i LOVE the purple packaging and it feels so luxurious! I loved the texture of both products. Both creams absorbed quickly and non greasy. My skin feels so hydrated and soft!

My dry spots vanished asap! #voxbox [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If you are looking for a night Cream that Isn't heavy Isn't oily Isn't sticky Moisterized without the heavy wet feeling Then this right here is the night Cream for YOU.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just received this for free as part of a vox box, but all opinions are my own true thoughts! First off, I love that this is fragrance free. Im a redhead and my skin goes a little bonkers when I throw heavily scented products on it, but with this there was no burning and no redness! I enjoyed how easily it absorbed into my skin and that there was no greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got the product free for testing purposes. So far with trying out this product, its been surprising! I dont think it makes me face oily, which is a big deal for me since my skin is oil prone to begin with. It feels clean, and doesnt have any bad or strong smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can not say enough good things about this product! Its light yet when you put it on you know its there. My face feels soft and refreshed right before bed.

It absorbs quickly into skin. And skin is left feeling like a babys bottom. Love this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this moisturizer!! Its light on your skin and not in the least bit greasy. Other overnight formulas have felt very heavy on my face, but not this!! The package is wonderful as well- there is a piece inside that you can twist off so you dont get overloaded with product. A little goes a long way and this is worth every penny!

This product is really good for moisturizing when I use this my skin was so soft I like it and I dont wanna improve this product its really good product and effective too I will buy this again for sure [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is amazing. Its not greasy and doesnt have a smell. Your face feel so smooth and hydrated after applying. I use this every night before bed and will probably buy more when it runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First and foremost, Its NON GREASY which is the first positive thing about it. The packaging is super cute. The product is very light and absorbs very quickly, not to mention gives your face the cute glow in the night and does what it mentions i.e. Keeps your skin moisturized... Hope to see the final results after a few days of continuous use... Totally recommending it based on it first 2 uses... P.s. I received this in a VoxBox i.e. free/complimentary for testing purposes.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love it! Day 1: this product is amazing so far. It is not oily or heavy. A simple dip of your index finger and your all set to apply the product. Your fingers will feel oily afterwards but I wouldnt say its a big deal. It is clearly an overnight moisturizer, so do not use it in the morning. There is no scent which is perfect. I cant wait to keep using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
