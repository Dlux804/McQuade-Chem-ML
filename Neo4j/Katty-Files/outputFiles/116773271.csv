"I searched all over and this item is $99 elsewhere and Walmart was much cheaper. It arrived 3 days earlier than expected. Love this product, goes on smoothly. I will order again."
I have only been using it for a little less than a week but it seems to be working well.
My beauty therapist daughter recommended this for me and all I can say is wow this item is amazing and I wont use any other product now!!!!!!
"I have been using this cream for a few years and have tried other kinds, but I always come back!"
I purchased this product (despite the price) because I am beginning to develop fine lines along my forehead. I also have recently developed sensitive skin. This moisturizer is the best thing I have used. My fine lines are still there but not as visible and my skin in no longer irritated. I recommend this for everyone to try.
I really love this product. It has help my skin and I feel that my face is a lot smoother as well.
"Makes my skin feel taught, lines and wrinkles less pronounced."
The package came with broken I am not happy at all
