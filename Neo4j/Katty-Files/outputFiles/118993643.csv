"I am in love with serum, my skin absorbed it as if it was a sponge. That how dry my skin was, my face and neck were know longer tight,flaky. I am well hydrated now and this was just my first use."
"I absolutely love these products! I have super sensitive and dry skin. I feel like this is what my skin has been waiting for. It feels soft, hydrated and my skin looks great with or without makeup. I haven't broken out, knock on wood that I don't. So far, I'm super pleased!"
"I have always trusted Neutrogena. It has been recommended to me by dermatologists since I was a teenager dealing with acne. I am now 66 years old and by all accounts I have great skin and get many complements. I am a fan of hyalurinic acid and the Hydrating Serum is my favorite form of it. It is light, smells nice, and can be used alone or with the hydrating gel or tinted moisturizer over it. I use it twice a day."
I have been using this serum for about two weeks and already see results. Not only are wrinkles less visible but dark spots are getting lighter. This is exactly what I needed for my aging skin. I highly recommend this product based on my personal experience so far.
I bought this product to complete my hydro boost skincare regimen. My skin was very dry and bumpy through the cold winter season and this product along with the hydroboost gel have saved my skin!!! I've been dedicated to the brand for my skincare for a few years now and I don't think I'll ever change it!!!!
"Tried this after reading the reviews, and I absolutely love this serum! I have sensitive skin and this didn't irritate me at all!! Plus, it was actually hydrating and I could feel the difference in how soft it made my skin in just a few days. I use it every night after cleansing!"
"I bought this a while ago but have just started using it on a regular basis. I have been using a Department Store serum that costs far more but doesn't do a very good job at making some pesky sunspots to lighten. I wanted a serum with Hyaluronic Acid in it, since I am allergic to Retin-A, and saw that this serum contained it so I decided to give a try. It's too soon for me to say it works for me but it feels nice and leaves my skin soft and smooth and that's important. Further use will determine if it will fade those spots for me!"
I've used this product for two weeks now and it definitely leaves my skin softer and and has helped with minimoze the pores as well as assist with dryness. My only complaint is it can feel a little sticky and at times if I exfoliate and then use the serum I get a slight sting. Otherwise it's a great serum that is effective if you wish to add more moisture to your face.
"I bought the set of Hydro boost Hydrating serum and Water Gel moisturizer and was using for a week, but it doesn't work for my skin cause it feels so dry when you wake up in the morning, then started to break out, so I stopped using it. Switch over to Laneige water bank hydrating and sleeping mask, working great to hydrate my skin and feel so smooth."
"I purchased several products in the Hydro Boost line about a month ago. I am 54 and have an issue with very dry dull skin. The entire Hydro Boost line has improved my overall skin health. I don't feel flaky or like any oil my skin does produce, is sitting ""on top of my face"". I use the serum in the morning after the wash and before I apply any makeup. It keeps my skin feeling soft all day. I recommend the entire line"
I have been using it for 6 months now. It suits my sensitive skin during all seasons.
I was having a hard time finding this product in retail stores and the online price was very good. It took a little while before I received the order.
I am so beyond amazed at finding a product that works so well. I have very dry peeling skin. I am from Colorado. If you have dry skin this by far is the best product ive used.
"Really impressed with the serum.... It's pretty much hydrating.... Lightweight, non greasy with mild fragnence..... It's working pretty well on my oily to combo skin....."
I bought this about a week ago and it's so moisturizing that it helped get rid of my dry flakey skin! I'm so happy I found this product and will definitely repurchase.
I've only been using these products for about a week now. But So far I'm in love and already plan to purchase more for friends. I have such a dry face and my face actually feels so soft AND the product smells fantastic!
"I've been using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Serum for 6 months. It was recommended by a beauty blogger @HeyAprill. The change in my skin has been noticeable. Soft, smooth, and beautiful."
"It has only been a short time since I've used the product, but my skin feels soft and hyrdated. I use this serum in addition to the water gel and so far, it has been a great combo."
I ordered several products in November and I also called customer service but I have not received them yet??
I have been using Neutrogena products for over forty years. I love the new Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum. It leaves my skin feeling so silky smooth.
I have been using it for about a couple of weeks and love it! The smell is amazing and it also helped with my skin concerns.
I bought this to help with my dry skin and it does wonders I've noticed the results within days !! Highly recommend this product!!
It's only been a few days. I will continue using it for a while but so far my skin is drier and I may have to try other products.
I am so please with the Hydro boost products I bought the cleaning system and all the makeup. Love it
"Love the wipes, lip balm and the moisturizer with heliopkex. Hydroboost cleanser, serum & gel did the opposite for me what it claims. My skin actually felt drier."
Absolutely love this serum. I have never really been an avid user of serums until I bought this one. I use it morning and night and really love the results I've gotten. My skin is so much softer and stays moisturized far longer than it would with just my moisturizer. Hasn't caused me any breakouts and makes my skin feel amazing. I use one pump for my face and neck so I know the bottle will last me a while. Definitely worth the money!
I recently moved to a drier climate and my skin has been paying the price. I wanted to give this product a try and I am so happy I did. It feels lighter than lotion but works more effectively at keeping my skin moist. I also noticed a more glowy look of my skin and my dark circles have seemed to be reduced. Very happy with this serum!
I purchased this originally 3 months ago and have replenished it love the results
I have been using this serum for about a week and I really see a difference. My skin is so soft.
"I believe I will buy again, My skin and face has even tone and folks say I look younger"
"This does everything it claims to do, and does not empty your wallet."
"My dermatologist recommended these items, and I love them!"
Love this product! My face feels hydrated and so soft! I loce it!
"I bought 2 weeks ago and I just falling in love my skin just lights up, very soft"
Been using this product for about a week. Already noticing improvements in my dry patches. Feels nice and nice scent.I
"I just started using this a couple of days ago, so I can't really speak to how well it works, so far I like it, I use with the hydro boost extra dry skin gel cream."
I was skeptical about these products at first because I have such dry and sensitive skin. But it really works. It leaves my face and neck soft and moisturized. Will be buying more from this product line. A little pricey but worth it.
Been searching for a product that wouldn't break me out and that's not oily. I've been using this since it came out. And it helps with my breakouts and it's not greasy or thick. I use it twice a day. Morning and at night. Two pumps or three depending on how dry my skin is. Definitely sticking to this!
My skin looks and feels so much better! I would recommend this to anyone.
I bought this product a few weeks ago and use it after washing my face morning and night. It works because it feels hydrating and smooth afterward. This works especially for me because of my dry skin that always makes my face very tight and flaky.
"I bought the serum, cream moisturizer, and cleaner from the Hydro Boost line and it's made my skin dryer... how is that possible? I spent a lot of money on these 3 products combined and was expecting great results. I have dry, peeling skin on my nose and chin, this is what I was trying to treat and now it's worse then when I started. I'm very disappointed."
Skin feels smooth and hydrated but not greasy. Only negative is that the cap won't stay on which is irritating because I keep this in my gym bag.
"I can't believe how my face feels after just one use. I am 62, bought this yesterday just to try it out. All I can say is wow!!! As long as they make it I will buy it (and I'll be letting my friends know)."
"My doctor recommended this serum to use with my derma roller. I read you should not use any products with fragrance added. I thought this was suppose to be fragrance free, but it is not."
"I have been using this product for over a year now and love it. My skin is so sensitive that I can't use anything else. I've tried Lancome, Clinique, Estee-Lauder, and Clinique and they all irate my skin. Neutrogena products don't bother my skin at all. I won't use any other products."
"I only purchased this product a week ago, and have only used it a few times so far..but, i can already tell a difference. My skin feels so hydrated and soft. I like that it feels like nothings on my skin, its very light and my dry skin needs a product like this!! *only downside is it smells alittle weird when first applied, kinda like diapers.? Idk what the smell is, but its very strange. If it weren't for that I would've given 5 stars!*"
So I have acne prone skin and am on medication that dries my skin out sooooo badly I couldn't put foundation on without it looking cakey. My Dermo even gave me a prescription lotion to help out the dryness. I thought it worked ok until I bought this! And so far it is amazing! I use it before bed and in the morning before my makeup and my foundation goes on so smooth and no more Cakey foundation! This is so much cheaper than my prescription lotion and works 100x better! Deffinetly recommend!
"DOES NOT BREAK ME OUT or leave my skin oily. I have oily skin and it actually balances the oils in my skin! i have not have an oily face since!! my skin is soft, and gives me a glow! i use this with the hydro boost spf 15 in morning and the hydro boost gel cream at night. i also use the hyro boost eye cream day and night!!! this whole product line is HEAVEN SENT!!"
I have tried several pricey hydrating products and they all failed. After searching high end products in all the big retailers I came across this product and was thrilled. My skin feels so soft and the lines in my skin are far less visible. I have found my new best friend. Thank you Neutrogena
I love the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum! I wasn't too sure about using it and how it would work. But i was pleasantly surprised when i started to feel my skin moisturized and it just felt like it was perfect. The formula is very lightweight and it doesn't feel oily. I will definitely be adding this to my every day routine.
I received this product for free from PINCHME for my honest review.
"I've been using this product for a few weeks and, although I cannot say for certain that is provides additional improvement over my existing Hydroboost routine, it certainly seems to support the hydration level and suppleness of my face and neck skin."
I have been using this as soon when I get out the shower in the morning. My skin feels great and is softer. The consistency is nice and so is the scent. Overall I would recommend.
I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme in exchange for my honest opinion.
"I thought I was doing something good for my skin when I purchased this serum. I'd already purchased Neutrogena's gel-cream for extra dry skin and the eye gel-cream and was fairly pleased with the ingredient list and love how my skin looks and feels. Sadly, this serum contains aluminum and propylene glycol -- two things I don't won't on my face or absorbed ithrough my skin"
"After Kiehl's discontinued one of my go-to products, I decided to find a more affordable skin care line. I fell in love with the Hydro Boost Gel-Cream for Extra-Dry Skin about a month ago, and just added this serum. This product is NOT fragrance free like the gel-cream. It smells like a cross between a powdery perfume and a bathroom cleaning product The serum itself works well, but the fragrance is too strong and irritating. I could still smell it a half hour later."
"I am 54 and for years I've used Avon face cleansers and creams. I have the under eye fine lines and I now under my chin the skin looks like crepe paper. My skin is also oily in the T zone area and I still have breakouts. Even at my age. I decided to try the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating products less than a week ago. I only purchased the cleansing gel, exfoliator and Hydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I haven't had anymore breakouts and I don't have the crepe neck now! I highly recommend these products!"
"Excellent product!!! Is better that Lancome hidra sen, absolutely!!!!"
I am obsessed. The water-gel moisturizer is great for oily skin. It makes my makeup go on smoother. The gel-eye cream is my favorite product so far because myundereyes hold
This product is amazing. It actuly does what it says it is to do. I have tried many products and this is the one for me. My skin feels so clean and I do not have to keep trying to scrub my eye makeup off forever.
Recently tried this product and loved how it delivers instant hydration! This serum works true wonders for our dry skin and balanced out the oily areas. It's not greasy at all. We highly recommend this cost-effective product.
"Bad for my skin where ever I applied this on face, I got redness in skin specially in cheeks. I have large open pores because of those my skin looks very stretched.I thought of this would help me for reducing my pores, but made it worse."
Love this product! Softet skin & more moisturized. The only change is I wish it came unscented. I am a Neutrogena girl & have been using their products for years.
"I got this serum after loving the cleanser but I don't find this as hydrating. I have a dry, flaky nose and after applying this it was flaky again within a few minutes. It is light and I like it but it does not feel like it is doing much on my face."
I received a sample of this and fell in love!! I purchased the product as soon as I ran out. The serum is non-greasy and absorbed right into my skin. It left my skin feeling so smooth and hydrated. I will definitely purchase again!
"I have dry skin and found that most moisturizing products were to heavy for my skin. Then I tried this product, it's amazing so light but packs moisture to my skin and makes my face so soft. I love this product!"
I have very dry skin and was using Clinique. This product is a much better moisturizer and keeps my skin hydrated all day. I love it and it's cheaper than Clinique.
I received this moisturizer from Pinch Me for free and I loved it. It covers you skin evenly and it light. It made my skin feel smooth and didn't clog my pores. Will definitely purchase it in the future.
"I received a sample from pinch me. It makes my skin feel silky smooth. It wasn't,t greasy and it absorbed quickly. A little goes a long way. It smelled good too."
I received this free from pinchme.com to test and submit a review. I really like the smooth texture and it goes on easy and absorbs completely into my skin. I like that it keeps my skin moisturized and fresh looking.
"Serum feels like watery jelly on skin and is very refreshing. Not sure if I'm supposed to use WITH another moisturizer, but this feels great on its own. I apply foundation over the top of this and it does not do anything funky on the skin."
Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this line, but unfortunately cannot contine use. I have been using the cleanser and serum for 3 weeks now. I have sensitive skin, so these do not work well for me. Lesions develope on my skin after each use. May try something from Neutrogena's sensitive skin line."
Does puff up areas that need puffing but temporarily. Going to purchase again to give myself time on this item.
"I received my first order on Tuesday, June 25th, so it is a bit early to tell."
"So far, it does feel good."
I just tried you product a week ago and I am very impressed with the quality of the product.
I gave this to my mother-in-law since she's been complaining on how dry her skin was. She was amazed after the first use how different her skin felt. She noticed the hydration was back and that it was not as tight feeling due to being dry.
I received this product from PinchMe for a honest review. I have been using this serum and it's amazing! My skin is dry to normal and this serum makes it feel great! It's so soft and hydrating. It doesn't leave any residue or make your skin feel sticky. I definitely recommend.
"My skin gets SO incredibly dry and flaky in the winter. I have tried so many products and while some DO moisturize my skin, many leave my skin feeling heavy, coated, sticky, or oily. The Neutrogena Hydro Boost had a great consistency. I LOVE serums because they don't leave my skin as oily as lotions or creams. It was easy to apply, had a nice fresh fragrance, and kept my skin hydrated all day long. I will definitely be buying this again!"
"I was recently sent the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum from PINCHME and was pleasantly surprised to receive a full size of this product. After using it for the past few weeks I can honestly say I enjoy this product. Its thin consistency allows for quick absorption. It has a very light, clean smelling fragrance. My skin feels great after using it and it has not caused me to break out. I would definitely recommend this product."
"I love this. It is the perfect amount of moisture for my face during this harsh winter weather we're having. I use it daily, twice and I haven't felt like my face gets dried out during the day while I'm outside playing with the kids. It is amazing. I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme."
"I am a big fan of the neutrogena skin care line. I honesty can say that I have never tried their moisturizer. Recieving this from PinchMe as a sample, I was extremely pleased! I live in MI and the winters get really dry here. This sample came on time, this moisturizer is non-greasy, light and one little pump goes a long way. I am curious to see how it does in the summer months and if it will make me feel greasy as most moisturizers normally make my skin feel."
"I really like Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum, It's not oily and dries quick. I apply this serum when I wake up and before I go to bed. My skin has become noticeably smooth and vibrant, dark bags under my eyes has lighten and the lines on my face has tighten up. I will be referring this product to my friends! I received this product free from PinchMe for my review."
"I've used 2 jars of Neutrogena Hydro boost. I love how dewy it makes my skin feel. It doesn't take much to smooth all over my face and neck. I really don't need another moisturizer but, have used another Neutrogena moisturizer under it. Its not greasy either. And, it goes a long way. I think my jars each lasted about 2.5 months using it 2x daily. Highly recommend this product for anyone but, especially for mature, dry skin."
"This stuff definitely adds to your moisture levels. I don't know if I would say it radically changed my life, because I am a combination skin girl. But if you are dry or have mature skin this stuff really works."
I recieved this product as a sample in exchange for my honest review.
"I absolutely love this product. I really needed to hydrate my skin, and sometimes its very hard to pick and choose different brands based on your personal needs. Well I tried the Neutrogena Hydrating Serum and it works fantastic with my skin. The serum easily dissolved very easily into my skin leaving no greasy residue. Also the smell was pleasant. I highly recommend this if you need hydration."
I received it as a free sample from PINCHme!
this product is the best my skin is soft love this product
"This stuff keeps my skin hydrated, clear and the smell is awesome!"
What more can I say !
it works but I broke out as it made my face hold in all the oils
This producy is good but thats not for me this will make me painfull breakouts
I love the way this smells and it makes my face very soft
This is not my first time buying the serum this one the pump does not work.
Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating serum making my soft and refreshing for a long time. I usually apply this product after cleansing my face. A great product with nice smell. I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme.
This is a great hydrating serum - very lightweight. It feels good on the skin and rivals more expensive serums. I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme!
I really like this moisturizer
"It feels a little greasy at first, but it absorbs quickly and provides long lasting moisture. I received a free sample from Pinchme. But, all opinions are my own."
"I received the Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum for free from PinchMe, and so far it is my absolute favorite sample. During winter my skin becomes extremely dry, to the point it begins to peel. I noticed the difference in my skin from day one. It's been two weeks since I began using the serum. My skin is hydrated, not peeling, and smoother."
"Since receiving this product I have seen such an improvement in the appearance of my skin. I use this serum 2x a day for the past month. My skin looks fresh, hydrated and never feels dry throughout the day. I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme!"
"I received a #free sample from #pinchme.com for my honest opinion. I must say that this product exceeded my original thoughts of this product! It went over and beyond how I thought it was going to work. It helped my dry areas on my body to stay supple, great smelling and very hydrated!"
I received a free sample of this Hydrating Serum from Pinchme. I really liked how it made my skin feel so soft and look great too!! It moisturized my skin just right and it doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky at all. I would definitely recommend it to all my family and friends!!
"I have never tried this product prior to having the opportunity to try it for free and I'm glad I have. I use this morning and night after I wash my face and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, with no residue feeling left. I would recommend this product to any woman who needs a little extra boost for dry skin."
"I received a sample of Hydro Boost from PinchMe, and I love it! It goes on so smooth, and it really works well to hydrate. It does have a bit of a scent, particularly after showering. It's not overpowering, and if I put lotion over it, the scent goes away. It works very well for my dry skin, and I adore it!"
I received this as a sample through PINCHme and have never heard of it before so this is my first experience with it. This serum feels so lightweight and provides just a hint of fresh smelling scent. It makes my skin feel soft and pure but the thing I like the most is that it blends right in instantly and I don't even feel it. I can apply other moisturizer or just skip straight to my makeup.
"I'm pretty skeptical about trying new skin creams, since I found one that works for me about a year ago, after a LOT of trial and error, but when I got this as a free sample I thought it was worth a shot. I like other Neutrogena products, so why not give it a try? I LOVE IT! My skin is soft and smooth, and it smells great, but very light and subtle, not overpowering! I use it once a day, in the morning, plus again if I take an evening shower, and that seems to be just perfect."
I received this free sample from Pinch me for my honest opinion...
"I love using this product together with the cleaner. It's a great combination for my skin. I noticed results after a day, my face was softer, smoother and looked brighter. Definitely have recommended this product and would continue using for my final results."
"Okay, I received a full size of the Hydroboost Serum through PinchMe not too long ago, and let me just say.... this stuff is life changing. My skin has never felt better. I actually replaced some of my high end skin care for this and I use it daily now! Highly considering getting the full lime of products now!"
"I love this serum! I've got horribly dry skin this winter season. After using this for nearly a week, the dry flaky patches are decreasing and the redness from the dry patches are beginning to fade. I'm using this and the Mario bedescu moisture magnet. My face is becoming more normal."
"I'm a HUGE fan of the Hydro Boost line and this serum is a great addition to the product line. It's hydrating and smells amazing. I'm always a little hesitant to try hydrating products because my skin can get oily easily, but this line of products give enough hydration without making me super oily. I highly recommend it!"
"I received a sample of this serum from PINCHme and I love it! This serum absorbs instantly leaving my skin very hydrated, radiant and smooth. I love the texture of it, it feels very good. I purchased a moisturizer from the same line and together they work great, just like high end products I used to use before. I love that the serum contains hyaluronic acid that is very good for the dry skin especially in winter."
"This sample from Pinchme could not have come at a better time. With it now being winter my face dries out so bad and since I have been using the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum, it is crazy how soft it has made my skin feel. So this product is great to combat dry winter face for sure!! I totally am going to go out and buy another one once I run out of this sample. Which again thanks PINCHme for letting me try this from your website."
This is the best facial lotion I've tried in years! It's really great for the winter days where my skin get super dried out I apply this in the morning before I put on my makeup and it keeps mice in soft supple and no signs of lines !I got it free from pinchme to try.
"I love the feel of this on my skin and I like that it doesn't leave any residue after I apply it! I still need to use moisturizer on top but that may be because it's still the winter and my skin is much dryer than normal. Overall, I really enjoy using this but I don't notice a huge difference between this and my current moisturizing product. I was able to try this product for free but the thoughts and opinions are my own."
"I received a free sample of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum from PINCHme to try, and I love it! This serum goes on smoothly and makes my face feel so soft and rejuvenated. When applied, it does not leave that greasy feeling like some other serums I have tried. This Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum has helped my face during the winter months, and is now a new favorite of mine!"
"I received the Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum as a free sample from PINCHme and I was thinking ""hydrating serum, who needs it?"" It turns out that I do! It's got a great light scent and absorbs instantly in my skin. And my skin really does feel softer and hydrated after I use it. I apply it immediately after using cleaner, toner, and other products that dry out my skin. This serum works really well. I highly recommend it."
"Are you see this product through pinch me for my honest opinion, second the serum has a very silky feel to it , third it glades on the face smoothly and feel so cool to the touch. I usually put it on in the morning and at night I would buy this product again most certainly!"
"I received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum as a sample from Pinchme.com, and fell in love with the product after the first use. My skin instantly glowed, and felt smooth. Over the course of the use this product helped my skin look less tired, and more fresh. As a mom of two toddler boys it is hard to find a product that helps me look refreshed even on the days I am not."
Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum is a great product that works well! I received a free sample from Pinchme to try and am SO glad I was chosen! I have very dry and sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of the current products on the market but this is one that I can use and it has made such a huge difference in my skin! It is not dry and flaky anymore and it looks and feels softer than it has in years! I would reccommend Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum to anyone!
"I received a free sample of this to try. It's a good moisturizer but it didn't exceed my expectations. It's not thick and it spreads well, but I can't say the price justifies the product at all. I really wasn't expecting it to cost this much when it didn't do anything special to my skin. It moisturized my face for a while but I have other cheaper products that last longer."
I love the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum. I use it every after shower as my face gets really dry right away especially winter time. I love that it makes my face feel so soft and moisturized without the greasy feeling. I don't have any allergic reaction which is a must on my sensitive skin. I'm very happy with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum.
I am very glad I was able to try this product. I really love using serums but a lot of the ones have used in past have always made my feeling sticky. This serum did not do that.. I have very dry sensitive skin and finding a product that helps with dryness of my skin is very hard to find. The product left my skin feeling very hydrated and moisturized without having my skin feeling or looking greasy.
Discloser: I received this item for free from pinchme.com My opinions of this product are of my own.
"I have been using this serum for a few weeks now and I like the soft, non-greasy feel this leaves on my skin. It doesn't feel sticky and it has a very light, fresh scent. I use it everyday after I wash my face and it does not irritate my sensitive skin, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend using it with the Hydro Boost gel for a great hydration combination. I will be purchasing this product after my free trial from Pinchme.com runs out. Love it!"
"I really like Neutrogena Hydro Boost hydrating serum. It has a light texture but delivers a powerful dose of hydration. I use it under my regular day or night cream on days when my skin is especially dry. I also occasionally use it on dry spots on my face throughout the day, rather than all over my face. It is very lightweight and doesn't mess up my makeup. I received this serum as a free sample from PinchMe, and I'm glad I did. I may not have otherwise discovered such a great product!"
"The neutrogena hydro boost hydrating serum goes on smoothly with no heavy or sticky residue, and makes my face feel like liquid silk! I have seen an improvement in not only more hydrated skin, but also increased elasticity, softness, suppleness, and decreased fine lines and uneven patches! I will continue to use this serum in my daily facial regimen."
i like that this serum was lightweight and easy to apply. I did feel that my skin was dry a few hours later so did have to keep applying it. I like the idea of a hydro boosting product but don't feel this one delivered to the max. Mostly an average product.
This will be my new go to facial moisturizer. I love that it instantly works to hydrate my skin without making it feel greasy. I also love that I can wear makeup over top without issues. I also love that it's affordable. I received this product for free from Pinchme in exchange for my honest review.
"I often find that with most moisturizers my skin is left feeling greasy. However, with the Hydro Boost that wasn't the case. It felt more like a gel, but went on smooth and made my skin feel soft and helped out with my winter dry skin issues. It has a slight scent, but nothing too overwhelming like others I have tried. I have always been a Neutrogena fan, and I am loving how your products keep getting better and better. Customer for life! I received this product for free from PINCHme to review."
"Absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any icky feeling residue. It is very light, however, and doesn't come with spf so I prefer it for night time and I like to use another moisturizer during the day. I received this product for free from PINCHme in exchange for my honest review."
"This product goes on in a Silky texture and smells great! My skin feels smooth and hydrated all day and is improving in overall radiance with use! While I did recieved this product as a free trial, I actually had already tried the hydro boost moisturizer as well, and was very excited to try. Have to say I prefer the serum, but it's a great product line overall."
I received the neutrogena hydro boost hydrating serum free to try and review from PINCHme. I must say this is a great product that is left my face soft and smooth . I love how light the serum is and it smells great also . I really like that you can use it under your make up and it won't clog your pores so you don't have to worry about breakouts . it is a bit pricey but it's a good quality serum and I highly recommend it .
"I have awfully dehydrated skin in the winter because of the cold and this product has been one of the lifesavers in my arsenal. Light scent, absorbs quickly and layers well with other products, even acne medications. I received this product for testing. All opinions are my own."
I received this serum as a free sample from PINCHme. This is my honest opinion of this product. As this is winter my skin has become slightly drier in patches around my face so when I use this serum underneath my moisturizer. It is lightweight that packs a powerful hydrating punch. Moisturizes my face but doesn't leave my skin greasy and didn;t give me any breakouts. Give this a try.
"This product is really awesome! It's very lightweight and smells really good. My skin is so soft, and moisturized since I have started using it. The best part about this serum is that it's perfect to wear under makeup. And it doesn't clog pores, so it won't cause breakouts. It's a win win! I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum as a free sample from PINCHme!"
"This is a nice lightweight serum that easily absorbs into my skin. After applying it, my skin feels soft and has a nice youthful glow to it This serum has really helped to balance my skin and smooth out the dry patches. It also has a light fragrance which I like. I received a free sample of this serum from PINCHme."
I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme in exchange for my honest opinion.
I have been using this as soon as i get out the shower everyday and at night. My skin has been much softer and feels great.. I have sensitive skin and this doesnt bother me at all. Great product.
"I received this product for free from PINCHme for reviewing purposes. Normally, I don't use serums because I have acne-prone skin, and serums tend to clog my pores and chaos follows right away. This one is oil free and non-comedogenic; therefore, I went ahead and gave it a shot. I have been using the serum for two weeks now. My skin feels nice and smooth. It feels fresh and well hydrated. The serum does not feel thick, and I love that it allows my skin to breathe! The serum has a very pleasant scent, too."
"The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating serum is truly and honestly great. I have used it for just one week and I see improvements on my skin texture, my skin also feels"
smooth and hydrated. But I still recommend to use a good moisturizer after you put on the serum.
I received this as a free sample from Pinchme. I am very impressed. I've been using this for two weeks and it is amazing! Not greasy at all and the scent is very refreshing. Usually my forehead gets oily halfway through the day but that's not the case with this one. This is replacing the old lotion.
"I tried this through Pinch Me and was very surprised on how well it worked. After I washed my face and applied the hydrating serum, I found I didn't need to add my regular lotion. Only 1 pump gave me a dab for my entire face. It isn't thick like lotion and has a very nice smell. I have sensitive skin so after using it 7 days in a row I was breaking out a little. I backed off and am only using it a couple days a week until my skin gets used to it."
This is my new favorite Hydrating Serum! I received this product for free to test from PinchMe and boy am I lucky. This product is amazing. The formula just melts away when applied to your face. It's not greasy or tacky. The smell is beyond amazing and the texture is amazing. A little goes such a long way and I personally think the price is great for the product you're getting.
"I received a free sample from PINCHme on behalf of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum! My thoughts and opinions are my own. I was ecstatic to receive this wonderful moisturizer in the mail. It was delivered straight to my door. I have combination skin and it helped both areas, wasn't too greasy or drying. I use it day and night and it helps my skin stay hydrated and clear. The serum smells wonderful and has an easy application. I definitely recommend to everyone and skin type!"
I am on my second jar of this lovely gel I would never want to be without it. I have a terrible oily T-zone and this gel magically controls my oil. It moisturizes and absorbs so nice and the scent is pleasant. It's the best moisturizing gel I have tried whilst others tend to be way waaay too greasy on my face. Give it a try!
"I received this product free from #PINCHme. I can't believe what a difference it has made with my skin. I was having problems with dry skin due to the cold temps. I could feel a difference after just one application. My skin is so soft and smooth now - no dry patches! I use this day and night. It isn't greasy so it works wonderful under make-up. I was so impressed with this product that I have already repurchased it, as well as, other products in the same line. Love it!"
"I am a person with very sensitive skin, and very dry skin. This product is fantastic and I am a HUGE fan. I am looking into the other products in the same line. It is SO worth the price for the results I have seen. My face is not only free of any reactions, but my complexion is not as dry as it usually is. I love this, I love the bottle design, and I will be continuing to purchase it!"
"I really like using this product, it definitely has helped my skin. It makes it much softer and smoother and the feeling lasts all day. You do not have to use much to cover your entire face and it feels and smells nice!"
I received this product for free to test from PINCHMe!
"I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost as a free sample from PINCHme and I love it! I was a little worried to try it at first because I do have oily skin, but the product is oil free and did not leave my skin feeling greasy or looking shiny. The serum absorbs extremely quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft and refreshed! The serum is scented with an amazingly clean and fresh scent what stays with me for a while. My skin remains hydrated all day! I would definitely recommend this serum to others!"
"I live in the upper Midwest, so with the extremely cold winters I need lots of moisturizing products in my daily routine. This serum was a great addition to my skincare regimine. It absorbs quickly, keeps my skin moisturized, and has a great scent. I will continue using this serum throughout the winter months."
I received this product to try for free from PINCHme.com in exchange for an honest review.
"I have super dry skin, redness, fine lines and uneven skin tone. This serum has definitely added much needed hydration to my skin which helps with a lot of my skin issues. I've also noticed the redness has toned down a bit too. I use this after i use toner then I moisturize after I use this. I'm really loving my skin and how it's starting to look much healthier. I received this product free from pinch me but once I run out I will for sure purchase this product again and again."
"I received this product as a sample in PINCHME and I loved it. It goes on smoothly and it moisturize my skin all day. It doesn't take a lot of product either to get the moisture that's needed. The only downside is when I priced it at the store to purchase on my own, it is a bit pricey and I don't like that."
"I was given this Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum by Neutrogena through PINCHme to sample for free. I had never seriously tried using a serum as part of my skin routine, but that has now changed. This product is amazing. It feels lightweight and has a light but refreshing scent. It glides easily over my skin and one to two pumps is more than enough for coverage on my face and neck. I have noticed a more supple change in my skin. I will continue to use this product as a part of my skin care routine."
After using this Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum for a few weeks I noticed that the dry patches of skin on my were much less noticeable and smaller. It made my make up application easier and I didn't have to use as much product. The serum skins into the skin very fast and doesn't leave a greasy feeling behind. Even with my combination skin it felt wonderful and smooth.
"I receieved a free full-sized sample from PINCHme, and love it! My face is actually very oily in my t-zone, yet dry on my cheeks and nose area. I use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum after I wash my face and anytime I put on makeup. I've noticed that it has made my face smoother and my foundation lasts a bit longer. I also like that the serum is a lighter consistency than other products I've tried for hydration. Also, the smell is light and not overpowering. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family."
I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. I really love this product and use it every day! It doesn't leave my skin oily and helps keep it hydrated at the same time. I have recommend this product to others and will keep buying it. Neutrogeana has always been a name I could trust. Great product over all.
"This hydrating serum works good for every day use. My face was extremely dry when I tried it and I did have to use a lotion with it but now that is not as bad, I only use the serum and it works great! The formula is not oily or anything. It goes on smooth and you cannot tell you put anything on your face. I love it!"
I get dry patches on my face all winter long as a result of old school radiators and the dry heat at work. I put this on in the morning under my make up and it keeps my skin moisturized but I don't break out like I do with some other brands. It absorbs quickly and isn't sticky or gross feeling. I did receive this as a sample to try and this is my honest review after trying it. I will be purchasing when this runs out as it has become part of my daily morning routine.
I got mine free as a sample (full Size) from PinchMe and I fell in love with it. It was perfect timing since the cold weather has kicked in. My skin was feeling rough and dull with dryness. I'm so happy I got to be part of this testing. I will be repurchasing and recommending it to friends and family. My skin is looking better than ever so excited.
I received this from Pinchme in exchange for my review. I really like the packaging. It looks nice and sleek. This product goes on nicely and does a good job of moisturizing. My skin is on the dry side with some flaky spots even after exfoliating and I felt like I needed a larger amount of this to moisturize my skin. Overall I like it and will purchase in the future.
"This is a great product - I love this whole line of products! They work so well and leave my skin so soft and moisturized, but still healthy! I love this serum - it really does give skin a hydrating boost - I use it along with my regular moisturizer for extra hydration. It is gentle and feels so good on skin. My skin is soft, comfortable, and healthy. I love this for the winter especially. I received a free trial of this product from Pinch Me in exchange for my honest review."
"I received a sample of Neutogena Hydroboost Hydrating Serum in exchange for reviewing the product. I loved how light weight and quick drying the serum was. It easily replaced a serum and separate moisturizer. After a couple weeks use in the harsh winter cold, I notice decreased redness. My skin feels soft, supple, and smooth. I liked the results so much, I also use it on other problem dry spots with fantastic results. It truly quenches and soothes dry skin without stickiness or coating. It just feels like my own skin at its best!"
"I received a sample of this Serum from PinchMe. And I love it. In winter my skin is getting very dry and itchy. This Serum helps a lot. I use it twice a day morning and before bed. Sometimes I need a little more moisture so a I put some lotion in a middle of a day, but most of the time it's enough by itself. Definitely will buy it when I run out of this bottle."
"I received a bottle of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum from PinchMe for free and they asked me to give an honest review of the product. After using this for eight days, I have to say I am very happy. I have sensitive skin that lets me know as soon as it doesn't like something, but it seems to love this! My skin looks healthy and happy, what more could you want?"
"After trying Neutrogena's Boost Hydrating Serum, I've found so many things that I like about this product. It's lightweight, but moisturizes like a heavier serum. It has a pleasant texture and scent. It's easy to apply, and can be used on it's own or underneath moisturizer. It has made my skin feel more moisturized, even though winter usually dries out my skin. Other than moisturizing, I haven't seen any additional benefits, but I would definitely continue to use this product."
"This is the lightest moisturizer I've ever used. My first time, I stopped and smelled it because I almost believed"
it was just water! It disappears into the skin in seconds. Great for summertime. I've received it as a free sample from PINCHme and my review is honest and unbiased.
I love this stuff! The scent is refreshing. When I apply it on my face it feels like a wonderful burst of freshness. You know how amazing your face feels after a nice warming facial mask? Well this is way better and you can feel that way everyday. I can't get enough of this stuff
"Thanks to PinchMe for allowing me to try before I buy. And, I'll definitely be buying after I run out. Way to go Neutrogena! Fantastic product."
"I received the Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum as a free sample from Pinch Me and I am not disappointed! I absolutely LOVE this serum. It left my skin very soft, moisturized, and did not leave a greasy residue. It has a soft scent, that I like, and does not stay after applying to my face. I would highly recommend the Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum."
"I have combination skin, and Neutrogena hydro boost hydrating serum seemed perfect for it. After applying it once a day before bed, my skin slowly started to feel more hydrated. My skin didn't feel oily or greasy."
I received this product complimentary from pinchme in exchange for my honest opinion.
This product seemed to make my moisturizer work better! I applied the serum first and then layered the moisturizer on after the serum had dried. My skin looks smoother and almost glowing! I love the fact that you don't have to spend a ton of money to get a quality product.
I have been searching for a moisturizer that would help my skin. It has been looking very dry and rough. Since I have been using this product it has really helped my skin. I have gotten many compliments on my skin. I will definitely be using the product on a regular basis.
"I have very dry skin, and was excited when my free, full size sample arrived. I've been using it every day, and haven't seen that big of a change. It smells nice, and I love how it isn't greasy, but it hasn't helped my skin as much as I had hoped. But just because this product doesn't work well for me doesn't mean it won't work well for someone else. It very well may work for you!"
I received this product to test free of charge and was so glad that I have discovered it. I have now found my new moisturizer. The serum is so refreshing and hydrating. I like that it made my skin so soft and without over oiling it. I will purchase this when I run out!
I received this serum through pinchme as a sample. I started using it right away since my skin was starting to feel a little dry. I live up north where the winter can really do some damage to your skin. I am definitely buying this product and use it daily. My skin as soft as silk!
"I loved the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum especially because it did not irritatie my dry sensitive skin. I have had difficulty in the past with finding the right products for my skin and am so happy to have received this product. The serum soaked right into my face and left my skin feeling cool, soft & hydrated. I will continue using this product. received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own."
"I have already tried the water gel but the serum is the absolute best. I had been looking for more of a serum and my prayers were answered. The price is also amazing, I mean have you seen the price of some serums on the market? I am so glad I found this and I will continue to use and buy."
I got Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum free thanks to pinch me and I was pleasantly surprised on how much I love it. Winters really dry my skin and I hate the oily sensation of certain products but Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum is very light weight no breakouts hydrated and leave a great smell also I have started to use to prime my face before make up which is great...I truly recommend
I wanted some cream which keeps my skin hydrated through out the day. I used this hydrating serum 3 times a day morning afternoon and night.. it leaves your skin smooth for sometime.. definetly not greasy..Don't expect it to be like heavy cream which keeps your skin moist through out the day. Also mine is a dry skin.. not sure how it would be on oily skin.. over all I love the serum and I use it daily. would definetly recommend for dry skin.. I got this serum for free to test!
"I have a pretty extensive skincare regime, and I was skeptical to add this in. But is the one step that I have been missing! My skin feels so hydrated, and it doesn't leave me feeling greasy or oily! I can use it under my makeup, I use it in the morning after I wash my face, and I use it as one of the final steps in my night time routine. It has a slight plastic-y scent, but that goes away almost immediately."
I received this product in return for my open and honest review.
"I love this hydro boost hydrating serum.I have been using it daily.After I cleanse my face I apply a small amount of the serum all over my face.With the winter weather my skin has been extra dry and peeling,but this has ended all of that.It has my face so smooth, soft,and moisturized.This product really does what it says,I love that it's so light and goes on so smoothly a little of this goes a long way."
"I recently had the opportunity to try out this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum as a free sample, and my skin loved it. I tend to have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, but this was not heavy or pore clogging at all. My skin felt soft and smooth. I don't think it is something i could use daily, but I use it multiple times a week and it seems to work well."
I have very VERY oily skin. This is the first moisturizer that I have found that doesnt sweat off my skin. I dont feel greasy or sweaty. It absorbs instantly and leaves my skin feeling soft. I have noticed less fine lines and wrinkles and I LOVE the way my skin feels!
"I've been using this serum for about 4 weeks now. At first i honestly though this was just a fancy name for moisturizer but after using it, i realized it does so much more! It does moisturize my skin and sort of gave it a nice glow. As the day progressed i noticed that parts of my skin that usually gets oily didn't, wich is a nice I have no problems using this serum and applying makeup afterwards."
"I received a sample from PinchMe.com of the Hydrating Serum. I have been using it daily and it has left my skin soft and hydrated without any oily residue. I have pretty oily skin so most skin care products just feel heavy on my skin or add a layer of oil and shine - not this one! I've added the Serum to my daily facial routine and have been happy with how my skin looks. I haven't had a break out, my skin feels hydrated but not oily. I would definitely recommend this product!"
I received a free sample of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum from PINCHme. I have combination skin so I always worry that what works well for one part of my face will not work for another part. This product worked well everywhere! It made my normal moisturizer absorb quicker and last longer and kept the oily parts of my skin less greasy throughout the day. Even in these colder winter months my patches that are usually dry look dewy and healthy. Very pleased with this product!
"I'm a big fan of serums, and I love this particular brand. I was excited to try this product, and they definitely did not let me down. The serum is lightweight, and hydrating. It was not irritating to my combination skin, and did not feel greasy or sticky after application. I also liked that the scent was subtle and not overpowering, over overly perfume scented. Highly recommend! I received this as a free sample from PINCHme, opinions are my own."
"The new Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum leaves my skin super refreshed, hydrated, and light and bouncy skin! I can notice the difference in my face.

I do really like the product. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I use it as a base before my moisturizer. I haven't seen a big difference but it's not mid-winter and I haven't experienced any dryness so that's a positive.
I'm not sure what they're trying to do here. It's like an acne fighting moisturizer? I've been using for about a month. It smells like clean cat litter which still smells horrible. It doesn't help with any acne issues and it feels like a weird film on your face. Doesn't moisturize any better than simply tomatoes. Worse than grapefruit moisturizer.
"I received the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum for free from PINCHme in exchange for an honest review, and this is a product that I would purchase. One thing that I have to applaud Neutrogena for making a Serum that doesn't remain sticky on the skin. I have combination skin so I need a moisturizer on my dry patches but I don't need any breakouts. The Hydro Boost Hydrating Serum gives me a plump hydrated look and my skin stays soft and not oily. I really love this Serum."
