I had Super oily skin and this mattified my skin using pro foam wash along with lotion i have not had a single break out since i began to use this product. Product is amazing.
"I don't get excited about products very often, but this one ACTUALLY WORKS for me!!!! I have PCOS skin (very oily and acne prone) and it really smooths things over!"
It's the only sunscreen that I've ever tried (and I've tried TONS) that doesn't make me break out. And such a bonus that it's super affordable. I love it and have been using it for years! It's so non-oily and matte finish that most days (especially dry winter days) I feel the need to apply a thin layer of another oil free moisturizer as well. But I'm ok with that! I'm used to layering products depending on what my skin wants that day. But I always start the day with this lotion!
"I love this product. I have super fair, sensitive, acne prone, oily skin and this product protects me from the sun while feeling super light weight. I love that is acts as a moisturizer too. The only negative is that it has a shiny finish, not matte. However it works great under powder makeup so it doesn't bother me much."
"really don't like how this feels on my face. i was aware of it all day, like another layer sitting heavily on my skin. it just made my face feel weird; it has a distinct sunscreen smell and feel to it. it probably wouldn't bother people that regularly wear makeup/foundation, though. didn't notice much difference when it came to oil control, but it definitely gave my skin a matte appearance all day, even though my face felt oily."
I bought this because I read so many good reviews of how good it was on combination/oily skin but when I tried it it just felt like putting on sunscreen and felt very heavy on my skin. I've been using Neutrogena oil free moisturizer and I really didn't see any difference between the two except for one being really light and the other one heavy.
I am really disappointed as mine didnât come with proper packaging. It seemed like someone tried it or something
"I'm highly allergic to something in this moisturizer. It made my eyes burn very badly, and it also made them water."
Really like that it has spf 30 in it.I have REALLY oily skin and this product does seem to help.
I brought this product because of my acne and after a few days of use I was able to see a great difference in my face - kudos
"I used to work in a dermatologist's office x many years, so had a free sample of this. Finally tried it and was very pleased. I do not like products that will leave my face shiny, and this also did not dry out my skin as some other products do that are for acne control. I just put some powder over it, and I'm good to go all day. I had a hard time finding it locally in drugstores, but Walmart came to my rescue, so I ordered extra."
I cannot use creams/lotions on my face. This is the ONLY lotion type moisturizer w/sunscreen that I can use on my face without it aggravating my cystic acne or breaking me out. It's perfect for my skin and I hope that it's never discontinued! It was recommended to me by my esthetician.
I started using this product in 2016 and have never regretted it!
Does not leave me feeling greasy or shiny but rather moisturized. I have sensitive skin and this works great.
My daughter has extremely oily skin and acne. She started using this product about 3 weeks ago. She likes it so far.
"I've been using this product for almost 2 months now. What I don't like about this is that it burns my eyes a lot since I always rub them. I realized that I'm not using the right product for my skin since I have a very very dry complexion, but overall it's a great product. I also use the cetaphil moisturizing lotion at night and my skin feels so soft with minimal pores."
"I have extremely oily, acne prone skin. I gave up using moisturizers years ago because they made my face feel greasy and break out. Finally, at 38yrs old, I've found something that actually works. Not only does this not make my face feel gross but it's helped cut down on the oiliness and is spf 30. I only wish it came in a larger size so I could use it all over. As of now, I only use it on my face cause 4oz doesn't go far. Please make a bigger size!!!!!!"
I have extremely oily skin and this is the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I still get oily but not until much later in the day now. I learned not to use an entire pump of this lotion in one application. A little goes a long way and that makes my skin and pocket happy!
"I usually race home to wipe my face clean of all of the oil I have at the end of the day or blot my face throughout the day to keep from looking too shiny but today I can happily share, I didn't have to do either! This stuff really works and I don't have to compromise moisturizer and sunsceeen - two big requirements. It's a must-buy!"
"My dermatologist just subscribed this product for me about two days ago. I always saw it at my local convenient store but I never bothered to try it out. Once I applied the product, it was amazing! I loved the way it glides on and I didn't notice any eye burning at all. I can't wait to see how good this product will be to me :)"
I'm 33 and have struggled with acne for most of my life. I am on roaccutane now so have dry skin and burn easily. I need oil free moisture because any oil will clog my pores and cause an acne breakout. The cetaphil oil free moisturise keeps my skin hyrdrated and gives me SPF protection. I have been using it for nearly a year and my only regret is I didn't try it sooner !
I have struggled with adult acne. I have oily skin and frequent breakouts. I use this product in the morning and my skin stays oil free for 10 to 12 hours. It has not caused any breakouts and my skin looks better. I would totally recommend this product.
"I use the wash and moisturizer, it helps keep my face oil free all day even with make up applied over it."
"I'm so pleased with this sunscreen, it doesn't leave that white look on your face. It has a matte finish just like it states. The best part is, it's made for oily/acene prone skin. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it you won't be sorry."
I sincerely hope Cetaphil never discontinues or changes the formulation to this product. It's seriously the only sunscreen/moisturizer that does not break me out or cause an allergic reaction.
"I love this product!!! It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it helps control the oil. But it would would fulfill all my needs if it came in SPF 50."
"In just a week of using this is can't get enough compliments on how great my skin looks, this product saved my skin, money and endless acne prone stress. Thanks for making a wonder cream :)"
Whenever I am out of my super expensive face cream i get this and its really quite good. I need something that won't make me break out so this is a perfect alternative.
As a South African arab and a guy this is by far the best product one can use if you have problematic acne prone skin. I recommend it to all looking for a good spf moisturizer.
"In my quest to find a sunscreen that I can use under makeup, I think I've finally found it in this light moisturizer. This is a sunscreen that I'll actually use, for a change. No sting and no fragrance. Just what I was looking for!"
Excellent product for preventing acne. Wish it could tighten skin and reduce wrinkles.
this product is good for oily skin like mine.
"My go to moisturizer, I use it everyday and underneath my makeup. It's inexpensive and works great !"
I finally found a moisturizer that I love! It controls my oily t-zone and is moisturizing at the same time. It's perfect!
"I really really love this moisturizer, best I have used. Even better with the SPF. Makes my skin look so smooth and great."
I bought other moisturizer from other drugs store company .and this moisturizer works well on my skin
I really wanted to like this but it burns my eyes like crazy every time and makes my eyes water until I cry my makeup off. Works for some people though.
Made my foundation slide right off. Not good for wearing under makeup.
Not light weight at all and did not help with my oily skin.
Does not absorb any oil and also made me break out. Waste of money dont buy.
works really well I have noticed less oily face and for my teen son also love this
I have combination skin. This product did absolutely NOTHING to combat my oil. I had better results using Aveeno which makes no claims to control oily skin.
"Loved it, not greasy"
"I've been using this for over a year. I really like how it has SPF 30 and moisturizes my face. I use 1 pump and that's enough to cover my entire face. I think my dark spots have faded a little from having the higher SPF to protect my face from the sun. I cannot comment on the oil control claim, since I have more normal to dry skin."
love it.love the way it works.and feels on my face and body.
i love it it's not expensive i think it's the best
Love this! Very great! Works well! Most def should try!
Does what it says and does not sting my eyes like others.
"Moisturizer doesn't break me out. Love that it has SPF. Unfortunately, no oil control."
i really like this moisturizer because it is very lightweight. It is perfect for oily skin.
Finally. Protection without feeling like you've been dipped in sticky goo.
Broke me out the first time I used it. Not sure if I will try again.
Makes my eyes burn and cry almost every time. I even try avoiding the eye area. I dont like using it.
"Don't buy this... I bought it because my dermatologist recommend it to me since I needed a moisturizer but it only made my face WORST! It made me break out even more. Also, the bottle it's small for the price and your face feels cakey, not fresh at all."
"I bought this product with my own money. It feels lightweight on my face and absorbs quickly. I feel like it does moisturize my oily skin good enough. However, this makes my eyes water and itch for quite a few minutes, so please, do not buy it."
"I love this moisturizer because instead of making my skin feel greasy, it sinks into my skin and makes it nice and soft. However I am having a bit of a bad reaction to it. 2 out of three times I put it on, and it makes my skin burn horribly. It might be the medication I'm taking because before it worked perfectly, but now just be cautious about using it on any medications and such."
"Great for the skin, feels great"
"I bought this for my neighbors special needs daughter, it is the only lotion she can use with her skin. She loves it."
Love this lotion. Never feels oily and covers nicely. I use everyday and also as my facial sunscreen when going out in the sun.
Irritated my eyes even though I avoid the eye area. Doesn't quench my skins thirst . Strong sunscreen smell
Made my eyes water and nose run. I am allergic to it. Walmart representatives were nice enough to issue me a credit. My eyes also turned red. Horrible experience.
"It's perfect for oily skin, especially during summer."
Feels good on the skin and I think it actually does help with oil
"I love this moisturizer! It is affordable, has spf 30, great for oily skin, has a matte finish, and layers well under my make up."
I got this product because my face was getting oily due to stress. This and the oil control foam wash did the trick.
Worked good on my oily skin.
More of a sunscreen than a moisturizer. I returned it because it was not worth the money.
"Still feeling oily around lunchtime & worsens. Otherwise, sufficient moisturizing capabilities"
