I will be 70 yr old in a month-and I LOVE this product! It makes my face look young! It seems to be working really really well! I'd give it a try!
I'm a previous user of this product and I'm totally unsatisfied with this purchase. It is not the same product I've used fir years. The packaging is the same but the product is not.
