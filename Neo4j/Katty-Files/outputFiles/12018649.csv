This is a difficult product to find in store. The size is smaller than my past purchases. Like the product very much and it is worth the time to order on-line. I do wish it were available in the store as I shop frequently at Wal-Mart.
This cream makes my skin and make up look flawless. It guides on super smooth and silky. And it lasts all day! I Love this cream 100 % and will continue to use it!
I bought this for my grandmother and she and he aunt have been using it for years and love it!
I have used this p[roduct for years and it is the best.
This product is really good. It moisturizes my skin very well. I woke up with refreshing eyes when I put it on at night.
"This moisturizer has been around forever for a reason. My mother used it every day and now, so do I. It's light, absorbs well and leaves my face feeling soft but not oily. The best, I think, at this price point."
My wife has used this product for many years. Her skin is still lovely even now as she approaches xz y/o.
"my neighbor uses this and when it couldn't be purchased in the store, I was able to find it and get it for her"
Love love this moisture cream.....have use it for years.
"I've been using this for years, and I love it."
