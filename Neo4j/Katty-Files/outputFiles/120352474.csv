"While I'm used to higher-end products, I use SPF religiously and am always interested to try something new. i LOVE this product. It is light tinted but dissipates pretty quickly when rubbed in. It does have a dewy finish, nothing a little setting powder can't fix. Greasy is a bad word but it is moisturizing. 50 coverage for this price? Unbeatable."
"I just got back from Tobago and it protected my fair skin quite well. I had never used a tinted moisturizer, so was a little hesitant. It blended quite well and was fine on its own, as well as under foundation. Once you get over the fact that it isn't a cream (not that it is advertised as such) and get used to the liquid texture, it really is a nice product."
"I like thw fact that this is an SPF of 50. However, this is NOT a ""universal tint"" unless casket ready grey is universal. Please make a clear ( Urban Decay, Murad and Supergoop! make them) for darker skins! The price is great but until you make a product better suited for darker skin I'll just use this one inhouse since I can't return it."
"I bought my yesterday and i open it this morning and the bottom of the bottle was really oilly and the paper around was coming off, oil sepreate and it lives a white looking , i really want my money back."
"I bought this product yesterday. It's going immediately back to the store. It gave my skin an awful purple-grey tint. If you're any type of melanated person, RUN. Also, the runny thin consistency is very off putting, and ends up balling up on itself if you idk, rub it in too long?? I ended up having to take it all off. Extremely disappointing."
"Perfect for busy mornings , like my self im a mom of 3 so school runs can get busy , I hate leaving the door with no makeup on and i find myself in a rush most mornings this is perfect im a freckley women this makes my skin look so naturally glowing , giving me a natural healthier look"
"I have used many tinted moisturizers looking for the perfect fit, but this has the best of everything. The SPF is wonderfully high at 50. The scent starts out a little strong and I was initially worried, but it quickly fades away as it sets."
"I've been using this for about a week, I wasn't expecting it to be tinted so that surprised me. I followed the directions to shake before use but even so it feels so heavy throughout the day like I used thick body type sunscreen and doesn't absorb. I also have light skin and I look lighter when I wear this even though it's tinted almost tan. Wouldn't recommend for daily use, only sun-heavy days."
"I've been using e.l.f. products for the last 2 years and it was my first time trying this product. I love how easily it went on my face and it wasn't greasy. I'd recommend this product! Also, I was glad to find an SPF 50 especially in Colorado because the sun is so strong here."
I bought this with quite a few other things and I planned to use this in the morning underneath my base. Honestly it smells like sunblock and comes out kinda making me look like I have a whiter base on my face. Left streaky didn't blend well into my skin just overall not a good buy for me
"I bought this thinking I was getting a creamy moisturizer but instead it turned out to be just some kind of liquidy tint. At first I thought maybe I just didn't shake the product for long enough, but after a minute of shaking it still just comes out like water in my hand. To its credit, I have continued to use it while on vacation and my face hasn't burned at all so the SPF part must still be effective. Overall though, I would not buy it again."
Like some other users I also missed that this was tinted and not a plain moisturizer. The product was effective but the tint only works for fairer skin tones and the sunscreen leaves a white/gray cast on the face.
I'm pretty fair and the tint on this is just awful. I have pink undertones and I have to use a ton of blush to make myself look alive. But what is worse is the texture and how it feels on your face. Perhaps without the tint this could be a much better product.
"I am not a big fan of SPF of any kind. I actually burn when wearing it. My daughter has the same issues and she uses. Due to the not-so-chemical make up of this product, I gave it a go. I love it! No burns, no breakouts and is flawless under the rest of my makeup! I am in the sun about 12 hours a day and never have to use anything else!"
"It is better than the Rodan + Fields radiant defense($50), bare minerals prime time and any other over priced sun screen I have purchased for my face. It is a light tone...but for me it is fabulous. Not over the top, doesnt fall into pores to accentuate their size like R+F, liquid consistency distributes well...on and on. Definitely well worth the 12$"
"I'm buying my fourth bottle of Beauty Shield. It does exactly what it says it does: sunscreen(SPF50!), moisturizes and evens skin tone. I use it with ELF Illuminating Primer and I'm good to go. It lasts all day and comes off easily when I'm ready for it to. I do buff it sometimes halfway through the day to keep it fresh and that's it. It seems to be hypoallergenic. I'm allergic to everything and this doesn't bother me at all. It does have a light citrusy scent and I've had no reaction to the odor either. Love this stuff!"
"I am really unhappy with this formula. It's extremely greasy, leaves my face shiny, and never settles into my skin. I think if I sweat, it would run into my eyes. It smells and feels like sunscreen. Total waste of money, just buy a sports sunscreen."
"I bought this product yesterday, and it's completely unusable. I had to shake it like crazy, to just end up with a watery, separated mess. When I pumped some out, it splattered all over my bathroom and shirt, too."
"I wouldn't really call this a moisturizer. For me it's just physical sunscreen. It enhances dry patches, scabs and pores. This product is also a hit or miss with how it sits on the skin. Somedays it'll look really nice and some days it's a dry mess."
"Although I've only been using this a couple days, so far I'm very impressed. The texture is lightweight, it soaks in the skin quickly and doesn't dry too shiny, the coverage is very sheer but gives a nice little boost of brightness, and it has a very pleasant citrus scent."
I have combination skin and it hasn't left me an oily mess or overly dry. I've also had no issue applying makeup on top of this.
I've been using this product for about a month now. Loved the smell and actually didn't mind the tint. Love the packaging too but unfortunately my skin has broken out so bad. Continued to use hoping it was something else but I've noticed every time I use this I break out. I do have naturally oily skin so maybe it's not good for oily/ combo skin.
I. LOVE. THIS! I am obsessed with this moisturizer. I love that is has an SPF of 50 so you know you're getting great protection. I use this every single day and have not had 1 break out from it. It's lightweight and hydrating. An added bonus is the tint so it can bump up the coverage on your foundation or be the only coverage you need.
"I usually love Elf skin products, but this is by far the worst product from this company that I have ever tried. The “universal” tint is not universal at all and leaves a white cast on my skin and does not moisturize at all. It's just like rubbing a bunch of thick sunblock on your face. Elf needs to go back to the drawing board on this one."
I have really sensitive skin and I love this product and how it smells but IM SO MAD THEY HAVENT HAD IT IN AWHILE! It make sure me so mad to like something and then they just don't have it in stock for awhile. It makes me not want to be an elf customer because I should be able to consistently purchase moisturizer whenever I want.
"I wanted to love this so badly. I needed a light moisturizer with SPF, and the tint was just a bonus. Unfortunately, it gives me the worst breakouts I've ever had in my adult life. Weeks later, my face is still healing from pimple spots. I know it was from this product because I broke out only when I used it. I grew up with cystic acne (treated with Accutane) so I know my skin very well. I'm disappointed to say the least."
"This SPF50 moisturizer is very light and spreads easily. It has a light orange scent which is very nice because it smells natural. I like the fact that it has SPF 50 because it protects me, most moisturizers only have SPF15. It serves great as a makeup primer because it provides a shield. Hygenic because it comes out of a pump which is a plus. Great value."
"Have used this a few times. Has a beige tint to it, but comes out white on face and very greasy feeling. The white goes away after a bit, but that greasy/rough feeling is nasty. I won't purchase it again. My face has also started to break out after using it."
"I was worried about the tint being too dark for my hella pale skin, but it does blend in pretty nicely. It is a good base for foundation too, which is nice, so it's like an SPF primer with a little extra coverage. The one thing I'm disappointed about it how much it causes me to break out. I will continue to use it in hopes that my skin adjusts, but it seriously clogs my pores."
Received this about 5 days ago. Have loved everything about it! Love the fact that it adjust to your face tone. Have used it in the mornings over the vitamin C serum. Great for an every day no make up look but color! I have combination skin & it still works wonders!
"It's lightweight & goes on so smoothly. I love the slight tint to it, it works beautifully on my fair skin. The scent is lovely. I use it daily in the mornings to protect & moisture my skin before work. I prefer a natural look, so I often just apply only this product & head out the door. I really love this product."
"I dont wear too much face makeup as it is so maybe this isnt a fair review. I wish it didnt have the tint in it at all. I was really unhappy how it felt on my face, it wasn't smooth, it was sticky and just felt super cakey even though my bottle was super liquidy. The color itself wasn't that bad but just didn't give me the finish I like!"
"I bought this because I needed a moisturizer with SPF. I recently went on vacation to Ft. Lauderdale and this moisturizer protected my face as well as enhanced my tan. I would get compliments on my glowing skin every time after I applied this. It's light-weight and with the sheer color, I don't even need to apply my foundation. I'm not entirely too fond of the texture, but I can overlook it with all the benefits I get out of it."
"I would definitely recommend this. It smells fruity and nice. Blends and sinks into the skin keeping it moisturized all day. The SPF 50 is a huge plus in the summer and all year around really. It really does protect. Definitely a staple, will repurchase!!"
"I bought this last month and love everything EXCEPT the tint -- it goes on white, stays white. I use a primer and foundation, so that takes the edge off the funky color, except I also want to use it on my neck and upper chest area which turns chalky white!"
"I have to be extremely careful with sun exposure on my face due to scars from a chemical burn that will discolor become extremely noticeable if they get sunburned, as well as creating an increased risk for skin cancer. Most moisturizers would tap out at SPF 20, sunscreens stink and clog my pores, and it seems ELF discontinued their SPF 45 powder. This stuff is a Godsend. The tint blends perfect and it has completely replaced my tinted moisturizer. It also leaves my skin feeling so soft. I love it so much."
"I like this because its a high SPF, the tint threw me off but it does blend out nicely. The only thing is it makes my face sooo shiny! I was hoping to use this on days when I am not wearing makeup but I have to put a setting powder over this because it stays extremely shiny and tacky on my skin. Other than that its good."
"I bought this product a few months ago and have been really enjoying it! It makes my skin look smooth, covers redness in my cheeks, and of course offers sun protection. The primer was too dark for me, but this stuff is my jam as of right now. The only issue is that I cannot tell if it provides both UVA & UVB protection."
I love the feel of this daily moisturizer. The SPF 50 is great when I am running outside.
i have used three bottles of this and i love it. Now i cannot find it in any store. I really wish i could find it.
Usually I love this product! Came in the mail and was defective or something! It leaked all over the packaging and is not usable :(
I just got this yesterday. Tried it on today and had to wash my face and neck because it left my skin looking whitish-grey. Waste of my money on this one and I absolutely love all elf products but this one needs to turn clear on the skin. It sucks.
"I love this product. It's super silky, great SPF and blends easily. The tint is fine for me and I'm very fair. However, i do wish there was an untinted version. The price is perfect. Will repurchase!"
"I first purchase off the Elf website and was instantly in love with the formula and the price! However, the second bottle I purchased from Target, and the formula was so watery and completely unlike the previous bottle. I really had a hard time using it up. I'm so sad because I have to find a new face sunscreen."
"I use this nearly every day on myself and my husband. It works really well as a sun screen. It feels like you don't have anything on either, unlike regular spf 50 sunscreens, which feel heavy and greasy. The tint is very subtle but enough to give your face a noticeable subtle glow. Remember to always shake well before you use this, because it separates."
"I am sad to report that this looks greasy and heavy on my skin. The tint doesn't offer any coverage, and yet, it looks heavy on the skin. For every time I wore it, multiple people would tell me that my foundation looks heavy that day, even though I wasn't wearing foundation, I was only wearing this. It also feels oily, and you need to set it with powder. It's a shame, since the packaging is of amazing quality, with a good weight to it and an even better pump."
I bought this product because I needed a moisturizer because all the anti-acne items I use are extremely drying. The tint is an added bonus. It blends into my skin like a dream and leaves my skin feeling so soft. Plus I have hyper-sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer I have found besides Aveno's that does not irritate my skin.
I've used this product three times and the pump stopped working. I can't get it open and can't get anymore of the product out
I've tried this a few times with different primers and foundations and it just breaks up my makeup so bad. It's nice to wear by itself but that's it
It's moisturizing with light coverage and SPF. Perfect for dry skin in the desert. Please get some in stock.
"Bottle came broken inside of package, liquid was everywhere. It smells disgusting. I was expecting a cream, not a tinted liquid."
It's lightweight and smell good. It keeps my face not dry all day. So far so good. It makes my skin look healthy.
"I use this expressly, I don't need a lot of coverage as far as color goes, but I wear this as a one-and-done in the morning, color slight foundation, Sunblock, Moisturizer perfect! Doesn't get built up in my face wrinkles that's the best part."
I love how it's a sunscreen but it doesn't have that yucky sunscreen feel. It makes me skin so soft and glowy. It's a wonderful base for my makeup. It's also a great price for what it is! Definitely worth a try!
"I've been using this for over a year as my nearly daily go-to priming layer and sunscreen. I have dry skin, but it does not stick to dry patches. It soaks in quickly and doesn't leave me feeling greasy either. The first time I bought this I didn't realize it was tinted. The tint is alright for my skin tone, but won't work for everybody, especially if you have a deeper skin tone. I wish they had an untinted version."
I wanted to love this product but it is just too drying for my skin. I had my teenage daughter and twenty year old daughter try it on and it was drying on their younger skin too. I can wear it if I use the Prep and Hydrate balm and then mix in Booster Drops for more moisture. The Stay Out and Play SPF Moisturizer is more comfortable and I recommend it.
"This is an amazing product, but it does take a little effort to make it work (hence 4 not 5 stars). After my skincare has absorbed into my skin in the morning, I lightly work this into the skin. You can also use a sponge if you're short on time. It leaves a dewy glow that I love."
This is for my no makeup makeup days. Love!
"I am so excited about this product and have absolutely loved it. I am always looking for a not too greasy SPF lotion for the summer months and this is my new favorite! The tint is so light but blends for a really soft natural look, and I was concerned about this, given I am very pale. I thought it seemed a little bit greasy at first but after the first few uses it doesn't feel that way anymore. Plus I just add a bit of pressed powder overtop and I'm ready to go!"
"I bought this a way to dip my toes into the world of tinted moisturizer and I love it! It's a super lightweight way to brighten up and even skintone, and when combined with concealer it makes your skin look amazing. I have fair skin, so the ""universal"" tint works well for me, although people are right that there sometimes appears to be a sort of gray-white-ish undertone to it. It's not greasy at all on my combination-dry acne-prone skin, and it smells deliciously of citrus! I will definitely repurchase this!!"
"I am so disapointed, great with the big FPS but so sticky (and my skin is dry)"
"I thought this was straight moisturizer, not tinted, but my fault for not double checking."
"This makes my skin feel sooooo smooth! It smells good! The mineral, physical sunblock is outstanding! I am absolutely in love with this!"
"I bought it, and I love it! It smells soooo good, my sunscreen that is way less spf has a much higher sunscreen smell! I run in the summer and this is perfect to not worry about me burning. I love it!"
"I actually really like this product and have been using it (when I can) for a couple weeks, my issue is that the pump does not work and you can't take off the top. It takes 5 minutes just to get enough product out and you have to keep pressing the top and it spray fine drops everywhere."
"I bought this a few weeks ago and just got around to using it. It's horrible! Unless you have white/very light skin, it's not for you! It literally made my brown skin grey, no matter how much I tried to rub it into my skin, it just got worse. It's not a “universal tint” if you have brown skin...don't waste your money like I did."
"The tint color is great and despite the runny-ness of the product it doesn't feel greasy. That being said I was surprised how runny the moisturizer was. It almost seemed like it was a really thin liquid foundation. While the product didn't feel greasy I noticed that it dried out my skin if I used it every day. So now I only use it every couple days. I love the product if it didn't dry out my skin, but maybe that's just me since I have combination type skin."
Similar review as the related primer in this series. Rather than being too thick though I found the moisturizer much too watery / runny. As with the primer once it was on it felt greasy and oily on my face for the whole day. Wouldn't buy again or recommend.
Bueno y e un dos en uno pero deja una Capa blanca como los protectores solares
Areyou kidding me elf?! Bought this because i thought it was cream. So disappointed.
I love it's lightweight and doesn't have strong scent. I have very light oily skin. This is my go to sunscreen for my face and neck
I have used up my first bottle of this great (and affordable) moisturizer. It goes on smoothly and the tint is just enough to even out skin tone a little. With just a little brush on bronzer and mascara I am ready to meet the day. Now if it could be back in stock I would give it 5 stars. Hard to love a product I can't get.
"Bought at a store as my local Target didn't have it and was excited to use, but no matter how much I shook it up as directed it pumped out like runny liquid. This made it super hard to apply and it just dragged on my skin not like a moisturizer at all! What I could get on had a nice tint to it. Customer service were excellent and have sent the hydrating moisturizer as a replacement i"
I could not even use this because if it's light baige the tint (think mortisha Adams color). COMPLECTIONS OF TAN AND DEERPER WOULD NOT BE ABLE YO USE THIS AT ALL also if you have oily skin this is not for you because it is very grecey consistency
I brought this when it first came out. I can't tell you how well the product works because the smell made me so nauseous I could barely use it for a couple of days.
"It goes on white, which is okay, however it does not moisturize and makes my foundation go on uneven and weird."
I bought this because I thought it would be a great moisturizer but it always leaves my skin super dry.
I purchased one. Now I'm up to 8. This product is simply amazing. Universal tint and spf are added benefits.
I like the product but the pump broke after 4-5 pumps.
