My new favorite face creame! I have used the same face cream for years until a friend introduced me to the Naked Bee. The smell is amazing and you only need a pea sized dot to cover your whole face. It's great for normal to dry skin which is what i have. The mega plus is spf 30 to protect against the sun! Love this cream!
"My skin is baby soft w/o clogging pores or causing adult acne! Smells great too. I ordered the body lotion, shower gel and lip balm - all are equally awesome. Found face cream first at a little mom-n-mom beach store. So happy to see it for sale here, in my real life :)"
