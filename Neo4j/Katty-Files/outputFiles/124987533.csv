"I live this moisturizer, I live in CO and my face is always dry, I use it daily. Works really well with the IMAGE face wash."
"Price was great, fast shipping and I love the product. Doesn't clog my pores, blocks the sun and hydrates my face."
My new favorite...feels like regular sunscreen going on but quickly soaks in leaving a matte finish. Neutral scent. Thank you Studio McGee for recommending this product on Instagram!
Very hydrating
This moisturizer is truly great! I love everything about this face moisturizer!
It goes on smoothly and doesn't cause breakouts. Have a nice gentle smell and it works.
"the product is great. not too heavy on my skin so its great for daily use. only negative is that this bottle is expiring 11/19, today is 2/19. i expect to use this whole bottle by 11/19 but it would have been nice to get a product that was not so close to expiration."
It was awesome at first! But it began to feel thick and the color didnt not blend
"I love image products but I have to say this is THE MOST OILY product I've used of theirs and it actual says ""oil free"". It's unusable by itself, would have to put powder over to dry up oil a bit. Probably won't use at all. Should have known as most moisturizers in this line are more than $20"
By far the best face cream I have found. SPF level is great and doesn't feel heavy.
The best face sunscreen out there for oily/problematic skin. No oily feel or look.
This is an amazing product. One review said the moisturizer was too oily but not if you use as intended. A little goes a long way. This actually has a mattifying effect and is great for oily skin!
