"I've used this sunscreen for several years and love it. It is very light, smells nice, and does the trick protecting my skin. Other products that I have used have been heavier or caused me to break out, but not this one. It is a little expensive, but I'm willing to pay for it because it works for my skin."
"I have been looking for a moisturizing sunscreen that didn't feel thick or greasy on. I also can't stanf the smell of most sunscreen moisturizers. This one almost feels like a satin when you put it on, it's light and I like the scent. I wish I had found this sooner."
"I love this sunscreen! It is gentle and moisturizing on my sensitive, aging (over 65) skin. Many days it is the only thing I wear on my face."
"This goes on light, almost sheer, without any sticky residue, bad smell, or cakey heaviness. It feels like a clean, pure, fresh product. I feel great about this purchase because of the message and mission of the company."
"Living in LA, I use this everyday as my face moisturizer. It doesn't leave a sunscreen grease, doesn't make me break out, but it DOES protect my skin and smells great. Like any sunscreen you have to reapply for the protection so I might have to get another to carry in my purse."
"Wow, I sampled six or seven other facial sunscreens, and none of them compared to how light and smooth Coola feels. This was the only sunscreen I could put on my face and then *forget about a few minutes later.* Every other brand leaves me wanting to wash my face immediately after because they are heavy, chalky, thick, or greasy. Plus the cucumber scent is so nice. I hope this product never changes!"
"When I first started using it, it made my skin feel a little tingly so I was a little alarmed but it turned out to have been nothing! I use it everyday and I love how thin it feels and the smell is so distinctive too! I do find that I need to double up with another facial moisturizer in the winter though."
"This is the only face spf that feels like actually lotion going on, smells great and doesn't make my face breakout. I use it on myself and my daughter who is three. I also love how well this brand rates on Think Dirty...makes me feel good about what I am putting on my body. Also need to mention that Coola has excellent customer service. Highly recommend."
"I love this product! It's really hard for me to find an everyday lotion with spf that's my face can tolerate. I've tried numerous products and none have worked out. I've been other B.B. creams, cc cream, tinted and non tinted spf lotions that were suppose to be light but my face couldn't handle using any of them everyday. I've had this one for 3 weeks and so far everything's been great! Might have just found my go to daily moisturizer! Love that it offers the sun protection that I've been looking for while being light."
"I love the formula which uses natural plant oils and extracts. I sometimes use rosehip seed oil as a moisturizer before using this product, other times I can use it alone and it's enough moisture. It makes me feel confident that as my skin is being protected from the sun, while being soft as well."
"My absolute favorite and go-to sunscreen / face lotion! I've been using this moisturizer for years and know that my face is protected before I leave my house, every day. The formula is light weight, applies easily, has a lovely sent and best of all it is NOT greasy. Thanks Coola for being a part of my day - every day."
"I use this everyday as my morning moisturizer, and I LOVE it. I love how quickly and smoothly my skin takes to it. AND that is has a 30 SPF, so I don't have to worry about the sun in the morning. I also use it later in the day if I'm out in the sun just as an SPF. It's organic, it works, and it doesn't leave a residue. AND it doesn't make me break out."
I have tried so many sunscreens and this is by far my favorite. I love that it is all natural without harmful chemicals but I really love how it blends into my skin so easily. It seems like there are so many steps in the morning face process- and this saves time because you can go ahead and keep on going with her routine.
"My favorite sunscreen! Most feel thick and pasty. Coola is light feeling, and has a nice refreshing scent. It is very effective skin protection and I am a fair, redhead.. My skin looks so much nicer since using this product. Does not clog pores like other spf protection."
"I've loved this product so far. I haven't been in direct sunlight for extended periods of time, but I love it as a daily protectant. I was looking for something light and clean that I could wear during the day."
I love Coola Moisturizing Organic Sunscreen Lotion. It is light and great to add to your make-up daily routine. I love the smell and know I am always protected from the harsh Arizona sun.
The smell is nice and light. It doesn't break out my face. And it goes on very smoothly. I'm happy with this product. I will definitely order more when I run out.
I was looking for a moisturizer that was non comedogenic and had some SPF value.
"This is a great solution. No scent, goes on smoothly and is broad spectrum SPF30. Perfect!"
I love this organic broad spectrum sunscreen. My husband and I both used it. It provides great protection in the sun for at least 6 hrs and it blends in your face nicely without much white showing.
This is the only facial sunscreen that doesn't make my eyes water. And it also don't clog my pores. I even like wearing it alone. Amazing! Love it!
"I have very dry skin and even though the lotion is silky light, it makes my skin feel amazing and I love the smell. Also, it does not feel like sunscreen, which I love!"
It's rare you find a moisturizer that doubles as sunscreen that both works and doesn't get in your eyes. I wouldn't consider using anything else at this stage.
"I love everything about this sunscreen and have been using it for years. It is perfect for my oily skin because it is light, and it smells great too!"
"I find that ""unscented"" face SPFs are rarely telling the whole truth, but this one is great. No scent and no breakouts, plus it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin a little dewy before makeup."
"This is my favorite facial sunscreen - great scent that doesn't overpower, wears well under makeup, isn't greasy or shiny, and gives great protection without being too heavy."
My husband and I have enjoyed Coola for a couple of years now. This year we couldn't bring our Coola to Florida because we it was too many ounces to have in our carry on. We bought another natural sunscreen when we got there and what a mistake! We both looked like glowing ghosts! The sunscreen would not rub in and we both burned which we never do with Coola! We're back to Coola and appreciate it even more now!
Very light feeling and not at all greasy. I think it actually improves the way my make up looks too.
I love how it's not greasy like other sun screen products. I will continue to buy this product for sure.
I loved it! It didn't feel greasy at all on my face. No breakouts afterward either!
Love this product. I had a sample and feel in love with the formula and easy application process
I like this because it is light and non greasy.
And the cucumber smells fresh and clean.
I love COOLA all around but this is my GO TO face sunscreen! Lightweight and smells lovely!!
I love them all but my personal fav is the cucumber moisturizer-light and smells so fresh!
sun screen and still have it keep the velvety clean feel. Kudos to you!
"I love this sunscreen! It's light and feels fresh once you apply it. My kids love it, too!"
I use this every morning under my primer and love it! It smells great too!
"I love that it's organic, has SPF 30 and my skin just drinks it up"
Goes on easily and smoothly. Works very well and does not burn the eyes if sweating
"A good friend raved about this product so much that I ordered it and am so glad I did. It's light and feels so fresh and easy to apply. I have very dry skin so I haven't tried using it alone. I use it over my moisturizer, and figure that I'm getting even more benefit to my skin. The real benefit is that I like the feel of it and the scent so much that I'm always using it and getting the sunscreen coverage!"
"This is my favorite sunscreen because it's light, smells good and is effective. What's not to like?? So much better than any others I've tried and I've tried LOTS of them over the years."
