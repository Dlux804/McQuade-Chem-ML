This product leaves my skin feeling soft and not greasy. No breakout. My skin is sensitive and this product works very well for me.
Works well for day and night
very happy to find this product at such a good price.
Love.
Lightweight and fragrance free foundation that made me feel refreshed and not weighed down or like i was about to break out. Would highly recommend! I use this twice a day.
Great product! Hope Walmart sells it for a long time. I will buy again.
"I love the texture of this moisturizer. It is substantial, yet non oily. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth."
Obagi Hydrate Moisturizer is perfect fo all types of skin and is quickly becoming an important part of my skincare regimen. I highly recommend!
"While it is not actually a legit bottle from Obaji, the moisturizer is a very good one and worth the money."
Not sure if I wanna use it. The production date was 2012. Buyer needs be cautious about and take their own risk.
This product is really good and moisted my dry skin well
It leaves your face very soft with a velvety feel. It has no greasy residue. Plus it really works.
Love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Fantastic! I have combination skin and this is perfect for the whole face. Absorbs very quickly, non greasy and plays well with toners/essences that I also use."
Great Moisturizer
"IT'S A FAKE! Don't waste your money...... totally a ""too good to be true"" price tag."
