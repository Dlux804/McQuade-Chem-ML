"I did my research on wrinkle creams bs wrinkle fillers. I wanted to correct the wrinkles on my forehead and beginning to see around eyes and top of lip. It works, it's powerful, be careful not to get on eyelids it puffed them up but I was fine after a few days. I love this product. Best $20 I have spent on myself."
"I have been using the ROC beauty products for years, very essential for a more youthful skin. I had gone to a big name pharmacy and bought them with a special 25% off coupon and still couldn't believe how expensive it was. My husband who shops on-line through Walmart told me to price it out at Walmart. I couldn't believe it, I saved $15 on my purchase. I actually returned it to the pharmacy. I am now a Walmart believer and will be buying it here in the future."
"Thought the reviews were too good to be true..but after 2 applications I do notice a difference in my fine lines! I love the feel of the serum, a little goes a long way. I'm applying to my acne as well because apparently it helps."
"I have been using Roc products for a long time. Their products are wonderful. I have severe allergies, so it's always good to have a 'tried and true' product I know I can use with no problems.....that REALLY works!"
"I had doubts when I got this serum because I've tried several others with no improvement. But after a month of use, even the deep wrinkles on my upper lip improved to where I could really see the difference. I shall not be without this from now on!"
"This is a product that does what it says it will do . In 3 days I could see the results and my husband made comments about my skin, I highly recommend this product"
What I didn't realize is that you can't use this under other Retinol products. I have used twice in the evening under Olay Regenerist night recovery and seems fine. No adverse reactions. I wanted to use it during the day also but am using Neotrogena creme with Retinol so I can't. This is a serum therefore it is not moisturizing and you will need something over it. It goes on smooth and dries fairly quickly allowing me then to apply moisturizer.
This product made my skin feel great but the fragrance was overwhelming. I used it for about a week and a half but had to give it to a relative because I really did not want any fragrance and this was quite strong.
"You can see the difference after using, I'm on my s cons bottle and I use in combination with eye cream. My skin looks and feels great. My tone is more even and I just have much more confidence using this product. I love Roc:. Plus it's completely affordable."
"Wow, works so well with my combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm only 1 week in and the area around my eyes is red and puffy. I got it because of the great reviews to help me with fine lines under my eyes. It burns a LOT when I apply and for a good 5 minutes after. Will this pass? Is this supposed to happen? It seems to have peeled off the outer layer of skin. I thought that may be a good thing, like exfoliation but not sure. Help!"
"I love the Roc brand. I use this product daily and love how it makes my skin feel and the wrinkles on my chest and neck are not so noticeable, I also love the smell and that it is not so strong. I have been using this product for many years and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I began using Roc products years ago. I am in my early 60's but look much younger. Smells nice, not greasy and I don't break out - exactly what I need [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product. I have tried everything but nothing has given my face the look and feel this product has. I use it with the eye correcting cream and they work really well together. Highly recommend both ROC products.
"This serum is a very nice moisturizer, it works well under make-up. I don't know if it will improve the appearance of my wrinkles because I have just begun using it."
"I've been using this skin product for over a year now. I am 55 and started recognizing the need for skin hydration about six years ago. Roc has made a difference in the look and feel of my skin, especially around the eyes."
I've used RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Serum for many years. This serum is the very best for keeping skin soft and making wrinkles much less noticeable and also preventing new wrinkles from appearing. I highly recommend this serum for men and women to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great Serum!
Definitely can tell a difference in skin cell turnover. I am using it once a night as I believe two times would irritate my skin. Happy with this purchase.
"I have very sensitive skin and can't use a lot of products. This Anti-aging serum is amazing. Not only did it not irritate my skin, but I noticed a difference after the first time I used it. The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are much less noticeable. It makes your skin feel soft and makeup goes on smoothly after you apply it. Plus, it's a great price!"
"I started using this product about 2 years ago. I believe it has definitely made a difference in my facial skin. My only complaint is the dispenser. I pump, pump, pump and pump. My finger can't pump anymore. To start...you pump. About half through. You pump and pump. Finally at the end you pump until you're convinced there is no more serum in it. You can't tell because of the design of the bottle. It is too expensive to miss even one drop. Please change this. Put it in a small jar. Pleaseeeeee!!!!!,!,,"
"I have a frown line that I feel makes me look old. I used the Deep Wrinkle Serum for a couple of weeks & liked my results. After a couple of years, I decided to try a very pricey, department store beauty product that was more than 4x the price of ROC. No results after 16 weeks of that product & I noticed my skin looking dull. I switched back to ROC & saw great results very quickly. I don't know why we think we have to spend a fortune to get good products & results. I'm staying with ROC forever. Thank you very much ROC!"
I cant believe how well this works. Have only been using this for less than two weeks and the deep lines or crows feet have all but disappeared. I am truly amazed. Great Price for the results! I actually might pay more considering the results I have gotten. I use it twice a day and after the first two days there was absolutely noticeable reduction in wrinkles under my eyes.
"...reach for Roc. I am 44.5 years old. I had a very stressful couple of years that showed up on my skin in the form of wrinkles. I tried another serum and it didn't work very well, at all. I decided to go with the original hard working proven winner. I am not disappointed. I have only been using this, and a couple of the other skin care products for a couple of weeks, but I have some noticeable results. The science is what sold me, and the reputation. Im glad I made the choice to fight back and help myself with these products."
"I first used roc back in 2000 and I loved it!I started seeing a difference in my skin after the first few days.Really.Nothing dramatic,but enough that I could tell.I used it the rest of the month as well as the following month.My skin was tighter,the lines around my mouth were softer and my skin tone and texture were fresher and softer.I love this product.If I could afford it,I'd be THAT loyal customer.Good job ROC!!"
I use the Deep Wrinkle Serum as part of my day regimen. After finishing the product (a few weeks ) then I rotate it with The Deep Wrinkle Filler so my skin doesn't get too used to the same product. This line delivers on its promise to reduce lines and wrinkles. I won't use any other brand.
"This product has great featuresThis light-weight RoC®RETINOL formula helps to improve the appearance of fine lines and deep wrinkles. After four weeks, skin appears more radiant, fine lines are smoothed and skin firmness is improved. After eight weeks, crow's feet are visibly reduced and discoloration is diminished. After 12 weeks, deep wrinkles are visibly reduced. This formula glides on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin feeling smooth and velvety and is ideal for use under makeup."
Have used this for years. I am tempted from time to time to try the new latest fad but always return to this cream. It makes my skin feel good and is one of the few that absorbs properly and doesn't pill into little white blobs like pva glue when you apply make up.
"This product has been a life saver for me. I have adult acne and used to use Retin-A which is much more expensive, I never have any acne as long as I use this product and it makes my pores unnoticable . I am 82 and I think my skin looks younger than my age."
Love this product as well as the eye cream and neck and chest cream. They work extremely well and do not irritate my skin. Have gotten multiple compliments on my skin since using these products. I highly recommend these products for anyone wanting to improve the look of their skin. They are reasonably priced and DO work.
"i have been using roc deep wrinkle daily moisturizer and retinol correxion deep wrinkle night cream for 9 months and am wondering if i may not be using it right. At first it seemed to really make my skin look healthier, but lately it just seems as tho it is not as healthy and glowing. Any suggestions for me? i am 73 years old ."
"I am 65 years old and this serum works! I have been using this formula for about 6 weeks, and the results are positive, I only wish I had started using this product in my 50's. I don't plan on ever stopping the use of this serum , It works plain and simple. My Name is George Newsome."
"I got this product several weeks ago and used twice a day. Although It made my skin feel softer, I did not see any visual results. I am very disappointed with this product. I had high hopes. I have 2 stars but it was only because it made my face feel softer."
"Sincerely, Unsatisfied customer"
"I started using this product a few weeks before my son's wedding. When the day came, I felt I looked FABULOUS! A new employee saw a picture of us and she thought he was my brother - She said I look 35 (I am 52 and my son is 22)! I've also recently had someone think I was 28! After using this product for about 3 months, it looks like ""I've had work done""! I'm a believer - and have purchased other ROC products as a result!"
"I have used several different products through out the years, even worked as a representative for a popular line. I am 47 years old and in the past two year of using ROC deep wrinkle repair serum my skin looks better than it did in my 30's. Thank you for my confidence with my very young looking skin!"
"I love this product! At first I was skeptical but I kept using it and after 4 weeks I love it! As I age my skin is getting drier, I live is So. Cal. so sun and some wind have aged me a little the past few years. I can clearly see a difference after only 4 weeks!"
"I am 34 with wrinkles magically appearing on my forehead! I have slightly sensitive skin and using it all over my face does burn a little. Since my forehead has the majority of wrinkles, I used it daily on my forehead. I took a photo before I started and another photo after 3 months and could visibly see the reduction in wrinkles on my forehead. I wish I could use it on the rest of my face, but will find another RoC product that I won't burn the rest of my face. I would recommend this product!"
"I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks but I am already seeing results. In fact I saw results right away. The deep wrinkles on my neck have diminished and also some on my face. I am so pleased that I have ordered the eye cream as well. If it works after only a couple of weeks, I can imagine how good it will look after several weeks."
"I love the product but because the bottle makes it impossible to get the rest of the serum out, it makes me want to break the bottle. I have tried flipping it upside down and banging it into my hands, q-tips to get the serum out but to no avail."
Now I know what everyone else is talking about.
I used this product and there was a burning sensation. I immediately washed my face but the burning continued. I now have red skin irritation similar to a burn to my upper cheek and around my eye area. I have applied ice and burn cream. It has been 2 days and still burns. Be careful with this product!
"I like it. I couldn't say if it really does ALL the things it promises to do, but it does seem to smooth over my skin for a day and with consistant use I do think there is some improvement. I use it mostly every day and I like the results well enough to have been buying it for more than a year. I'm 47 and not super wrinkly, but like any 47-year old, I could use some help :)"
"I have tried many products in my 62 years, some very expensive. This product is the best for the price. It actually works. In the few weeks I have been using this product it has improved the wrinkles I have unlike any other product I have used (and it has been a lot)."
Thank you!
"I was really disappointed in this. It smells bad; it is sticky, yellowish and doesn't soak into my skin. I cannot get past these things to try using it for any length of time to see if it does anything."
It is I have seen results in a few as three weeks.
"I recommend this product to anyone at any time. I have used the other roc products in combination and it feels so light, no mmess, non stick, non oily and I have oily skin ( love it)."
Within a few days I could see a noticeable difference. My facial skin felt so soft and my wrinkles around my eyes began to fade. Would recommend to anyone my age (47). Wonderful beauty in a bottle!
"I use the correxion eye and night creams, which are pretty good. The day cream with UV protection was too oily for me. Would this be a good substitute for the day cream?"
"I've only been using this for a week, and notice how much softer my skin is already and how easily my makeup goes on. If this helps some of my sun damage and small lines as well after longer use, I will be a customer forever!"
Daily use at bedtime did reduce around 65-70% 0f fine lines around eyes and middle of my forehead . I would purchase again and would love to receive a free full size sample after I had purchased my first bottle at full price . Thank You/
"I love rock skin care. It is the only brand I'll use on my skin. At 47, I constantly have people tell me I don't look my age, and I have roc skin care to thank for it!"
"I just started using this product. The fragrance is so, so strong and it could be a deal breaker. I wish they offered a fragrance free product, thin it would be at the top of my list."
"Am so surprised to see the results of using the Deep Wrinkle Cream. After smoking for years, I have deep lines around my mouth. This product is lessening these deep ugly lines. I am so happy to finally find a good, reasonably priced product."
I have found this product to be an absolute lifesaver. I have had people at work tell me my skin looks fabulous and lines have diminished. Love this product and will always use it. Youth serum.
"Sorry, does not work. Tried more than once"
It is advertised as retinol but that ingredient is near bottom list. Water is first ingredient. Means it has mostly water.
My skin looked noticeably better within a couple of weeks of using this morning and night. I like it very much and am encouraged to try other ROC products.
Apparently this line has been discontinued. It is no longer available where I live. A big mistake for Roc in my opinion as it gets great reviews from many people including me.
"Got into US and my wife complained about my skin and She gave me this product, i was surprised that under a week my face became clearer and my completion came out brighter. This product needs to get to Africa"
"I never write reviews, but this product worked so well that I am taking the time to do one. I had previously tried Botox, but did not like the paralyzed feeling. This product works very well and has significantly reduced my frown line."
"I bought this product only five days ago, and am loving it. My lines are already visibly reduced and tone improved. I have tried all the expensive brands, and for me, this works better. I will continue to use it religiously."
I used this product for over a week and a half and my face broke out with sores and under my eyes it looked worse than before I used it. I'm now just getting my face back to looking normal from the sores
I just removed the product from the box and I have no idea how to get the serum dispensed from the bottle...does the tip come off? Someone please help.
This really does work. I've tried several different products and never noticed a change in my skin until I started using this product and definitely saw a difference after a couple of weeks.
I have bad skin on eyelids and under eyes very early in life I thought about surgery This is helping a lot I am surprised as u all know the claims by most products well ROC is really working Do not expect surgery results but it is noticeable Thank u
"With sensitive skin, I usually break out for a week or so. Started using just in the morning. Saw good results in just a week. Even deep wrinkles are lessened. Skin texture improved."
I love this serum. It is so much nicer than using a bedtime moisturizing cream because I have oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for many many years and it has worked great on my skin. My fine lines have not changed over the years. It also moisturize my face and gives my skin I have beautiful glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Because RoC Retinol Correxion tinkled with a burny sensation and smelled fairly nice I thought it was working and I would look somewhat better. Really looked at my face today in the sunlight and was horrified! After 5 weeks my facial LINES ARE DEEPER THAN BEFORE I started the regiment. Good it works for others but not for my mature skin. Sure didn't need help deflating my morale anymore than it is deflated. My mistake for expecting results not RoC's.
"I received a sample of this product and was excited to try the RoC line. It felt great going on my skin, but I had to get out of bed to wash it off my face because the fragrance was so strong. I don't need to have perfume on my face or in my skin care products. I'd love to try your products again if it were reformulated to be fragrance free."
It reduced or got rid of most of my deep wrinkles. The wrinkles from my nose to my upper lip is gone. The furrows between my eyes are mere lines. The wrinkles around my lips are not as deep. They aren't gone but they are a lot better. I am still on my first container n have just ordered my second one.
Great for wrinkles.
This has really made a difference in my skin. I've been using it for a few years now. Use it as part of my nightly regimen.
This product is amazing! You can see the difference in about 2 weeks! You will never use another cream!
This is a amazing product for many skin types with great results. Buy it quickly to have these great results.
First wrinkle reducer I have ever used that really works. My lines have almost vanished in 3 months. Thank you roc!
After using product for 3 months I definitely see a cchange. I will continue use and helps to look younger to feel younger. GO ROC! THANKS.
"Love this product and all of Roc products. I have used them for years and have seen great results. Tried other brands, but always come back to Roc."
After just a few days I have a rash all over my face. It burned when I put it on last night. Any suggestions?
The worry wrinkle by my right eyebrow? Gone after several weeks of using this product. I am on the way to buy more! I was very satisfied.
My skin feels great and my upper lip wrinkles are already smoothing out. So far so good. I like the smell too.
"I haven't had it long enough for it to do what it says it will do,but the deeper age lines are smoothing out! It's worth a try for anyone."
"I like the product is best high quality very effective action and also long lasting and wrinkles disapear, i recommend this product"
"Sorry, but this was a no go for me! The smell was horrendous!! And it did have a burning sensation to my skin."
loved this serum . very light and made skin feel and look soft .. No sticky residue. Could see a huge difference after a few days.
"Feels great! Wonderful product, couldn't be happier!"
Great Stuff!
Retinol reduces fine lines and wrinkles. It has made my skin soft and more vibrant.
Used this product for a short time and noticed an improvement already! Love this product!
"Does everything it says, see noticeable results in less than 2 weeks"
Started to use this serum a month ago. Can see a difference. Love it!
This product does not work! Wasted money. I followed directions and no difference at all.
I saw a significant reduction in wrinkles under my eye after one week. Amazing!
Love it if it tingles it's work best prouduct for I'm 55 and love it
The product is too strongly scented. Otherwise I cannot yet comment on its effectiveness.
The fragrance is too strong that I get headaches. Not worth it
"Just bought this product & cant wait to see the results , LUV the fragrance :)"
Great product. I've changed several times to others but always come back to this one.
Roc is one of the best wrinkle serum facial products!
Very good moisturizer and even though I'm older I do like it
Fast shipping. Package was just like it's advertised. Will order again
I have been using this for 42 years. Everyone thinks my daughter and I are sisters. It works great.
"Ordered on 9/23/14, still waiting for delivery it is now 10/5/14"
"I had been using this serum and liked it, but found out recently that it has wheat in it, and I have celiac disease. It has not bothered my skin, but I won't purchase it any more just to be safe."
"Used this product for several months. No results. I am 51 with a deep wrinkle on the side of each jowl and deep ones on my chest as well. Ive tried several products, peels, microderm abrasition. NOthing works. Even the silicone pads didn't work. ANd how uncomfortable to sleep in"
I have been using this religiously for over four weeks now. I can see a visible difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. I use it in the morning before my makeup and in the evening before I go to bed. I will continue to use this product along with the other RoC products I received! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I will be using this great product daily. Even though I received this product through House Party for free, I always give my honest opinion. This stuff is great. Like liquid gold. Easy to apply and use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the ROC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum for about a month. I can say that I see visible results in the lines on my face. Every morning I wake up and look in the mirror and swear I see less wrinkles. What a great product. I will be a continual user. I received this item for free. I would recommend this product to all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this product every evening. I can already see the results. The women that were at the gathering love it as well, some more than others. A few of the women didn't necessarily like the burning sensation but I didn't mind because I knew that it was working to get rid of the find lines. I will continue to use the products for best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this RoC deep wrinkle serum free with my houseparty pack!! All I can say is OMG!! I have a HUGE deep wrinkle on my forehead right between my eyes and after using RoC deep wrinkle serum I noticed a big difference after 2 weeks!! It definitely is not as noticeable and I'm not so self conscious about it anymore!! Thank you RoC [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a first time user of the RoC products, I got it for Free an amazing kit , I was able to try for a while and I like the way make my skin looks after days of trying Retinol Correction Deep Wrinkle Serum."
I can notice after couple days using the product a little improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My mother had just finished telling me that only products containing retinol are worth using and then I tried this Roc product. It absorbs quickly into my skin and is a great base step for my skincare regimen. It was easy to apply my makeup over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I started using the RoC Retinol Correcion, about four weeks ago, but I already feel like my skin, especially under my eyes, feels better. The tiny wrinkles are slowly becoming less noticeable. I received a sample to try, and these are my thought! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to wait a few weeks to give an honest review. I have been using this day and night. My skin looks younger and more refreshed, and actually the best it's ever been. I am almost 52 and I think I look 42 I have been told I look 38, LOL. I am a new fan favorite of The Roc skin care line I truly believe it has done wonders on my fine lines and wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only had a couple of deeper wrinkles, laugh or smile lines around my mouth. After using Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum for a while, they are visibly diminished. I have been getting so many compliments, people telling me I look well rested, healthy or just plan great! I'm very happy with the serum and plan to keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've named my wrinkles after my children, going back years! Although I do see some improvement, I'll need more time as my kids are adults now and these wrinkles are quite settled.... **I received this product for free but my opinion is my own ** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Finally a product that works! After using for week, I've received compliments from co-workers and my family. I get a second look and then a question. Have you done something different?"
I certainly have! I switched to using ROC products exclusively. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I only tried it during the party so still have to use it regularly. It felt good on the skin, not too strong, like the ones that dry the skin out. After finishing my current regime, I'll start on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had tried this product in the past however didnt commit to using it on a regular basis. WOW I wish I had back then because now after using it for several weeks in a row consistently I have really been able to see a difference in my skin and I am so happy! I received this product for free through House Party however I will definitely be buying it when it runs out and I highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! It goes on smooth under makeup or just on it's own. My skin feel so soft and silky. This product also has a very pleasant scent. I received this product for free and I hosted a party after being selected as a host from House Party. #RoC #Sponsored [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far so good! I like the ease of application with this serum! It has a smooth feel and no overpowering scent. I've been using this on my neck for about two weeks and it feels smoother.
I was lucky enough to receive this free with Party Pack! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the RoC retinol Deep Wrinkle correction cream! So lightweight and smooth to put on, it's great for all seasons. I was very impressed with how quickly I started to notice my deeper wrinkles smoothing out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product while lots has been going on in my life, including international travel, illness, and work stress. In spite of those things that can tend to show on my face, my skin has felt softer and perhaps just a bit less wrinkled! I was honored to have the chance to try this product for free but I would definitely pay to use it in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say that I see a difference. Today I decided to really look at my skin and it looks fresher and the wrinkles are less noticeable. I don't really believe all that I hear especially about skin products, but I'm sold with RoC! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed a softening of the lines on my face. It felt good on my skin. The scent was a good scent, a little more than I like in a serum, but it wouldn't prevent me from buying it. I tried this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product in a free Party Pack. I have been using this only at night because my skin is a little sensitive. It feels lovely and I am really excited about how it improves the texture of my skin. I have noticed a fading of my Florida sunspots so I am hopeful for a softening of wrinkles at the end of the 12 weeks! I would recommend this product because it is working as well as the products I had purchased from the dermatologist and at a much better price point! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this for a couple of weeks and the first change I noticed was that my skin started to feel softer. Still waiting to see improvements in the wrinkle department. The downside for me is that the smell is a bit strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this RoC deep wrinkle serum I got for free to review for at least a month, and I've noticed my skin looking smoother, feels much softer too. I use this RoC serum right after washing my face, I use a large pea size and dab it on each finger so I get even application. It has no scent which is great, it soaks in quickly. I will continue to use this because I've noticed a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am loving this product. The longer I am using it, the better the results are. I am finding that my skin texture is improved and the fine lines are definitely diminished. I use it twice daily and noticed an improvement almost immediately [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product. It goes on easy, smells nice and dries quickly. I also like that it does not cause my skin to sting like past serums I have used. I have notices that after using RoC serum my other skin care products go on smoother and easier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw the signs of Father Time marching across my face. I started using RoC Retinol Corrextion as soon as it arrived. I can say I have seen a noticeable change in the dryness on my face that I was experiencing. The fine lines around my eyes seem to have diminished also. I will definitely be buying RoC products again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using this since the party. Always was curious about how this product was,and was glad to get the opportunity to try it for free.

"I really liked this product. I have not been using it very long, but feel it is evening out my skin tone and helping the fine wrinkles under my eyes. I have great hope that this will help the overall look of all my wrinkles given some time. It is lightweight and not heavy or greasy. And I love a product that does not have a strong scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved that the Roc deep wrinkle serum was not greasy on my face, felt light and did what it says it was going to do.

"After I turn fifty my face began to change drastically. I am not sure if it was hormonal or not, but I began to lose elasticity and acquire crows feet. I have tried other products but did not succeed in eliminating them. With Roc they seem to diminish emensely and my face feels lifted. This is special product that works miricles on your skin. I am fifty two years old , but my face looks 40 thanks to ROC. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using the ROC retinol correction every day since I received my free party pack from House Party. During the past few weeks I have experienced noticeable improvements in my skin.

I'm definitely hooked on this product and will continue to use!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is amazing. I only use it every few days because its very good for wrinkles and I was trying to make the ones better between my eyebrows. (Frown lines) I'm 51 and I see a huge difference every time I use it. I will definitely buy this product. Love it!
"I love Roc and now it is a part of my regular beauty routine. My skin is soft, radiant and more youthful. RoC has changed the way i feel about Anti Aging products with retinal and the bodies key nutrient vitamin A. My family and friends can see a difference as well, i tell them its RoC, they started using it themselves."
I have tried this product which I purchased on my own through a beauty box from a retailer. I like it very much. The consistency and the feel of the product was good not too thick or greasy. The RoC Deep Wrinkle Serum I did not find it to have a strong fragrance that I felt would irritate me and I am very sensitive to many fragrances and scents. I have not used it long enough or consistently to see any visible results in my wrinkles.
"I do seem to be able to notice a bit of fading in some wrinkles. It can get to stinging pretty good the closer you get it to the skin around your eyes but I have seen no negative response from my skin, so far, in the way of reaction or discoloration. I do not see too much shine or oil in my skin during the day, after application, and I have skin that tends to have issue with that. Have not been using it long enough for a more accurate and detailed review but after about a week, it seems promising."
This product is VERY greasy and shiny did not like it at all! It broke out my skin. Stung my eyes when the perspiration hit it... It might be ok up north but NOT in the deep south in the summer when you need it most The auction was fun... Customer service was great!
"Its a strong serum. So a newbie to retinol should start with thrice a week application at night. In a week iv noticed my sun spot n acne spots have reduced to 80%. I have yet to see its other claims like fine lines. I have a few on forehead. Its been two weeks n im happy with my purchase. For its price, it works great. Any Sun block with broadspectrum with spf 30 or higher is a must when using retinol. I ordered online with free pickup in store. Its cheaper that way"
I receive this product for free from Home Tester Club. I've been using this product for about 2 months now. I have to say the bags under my eyes and the wrinkle on the sides of them have decreased to almost nothing. The wrinkles on my forehead have also decreased still there but we'll see after awhile of me still using it. It doesn't leave my face oily or dry my face actually feel a lot more smoother. Overall I love this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum I received as a sample was much better than expected. I used it religiously day and night for 4 weeks.

I received the bottle of RoC RETINOL CORRECTION Deep Wrinkle Serum from Home Tester Club and used it for approximately 29 days. The texture of the cream was as I expected - thicker than the usual serums - and this is what I look for in a moisturizer and specialized treatment product. I noticed a marked improvement in my skin's hydration after 7 days of using the product and believe that with further use I will see a major improvement in minimizing my wrinkles.

"I received RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum for free from the Home Tester Club. I enjoyed the way the product applied and how it felt on my face; my skin felt moisturized and the product was not the least bit irritating.

After 3 days of using it, the skin around my eyes is dark, MORE wrinkled and burns! I look 10 years older than I did prior to using....this better resolve itself now that I've stopped using it! The directions say that if you experience a burning sensation, that's just the product ""working."" Actually, it's the product burning your skin!"
"i started using this product last week. It seemed to be working well, but yesterday i noticed that the skin where i had been applying the serum had started peeling, as if i had damage from sunburn in those areas. (i am not out in the sun, as i spend my day indoors in this cool weather) i have decided to discontinue using this product, but i am sure it works well for many people. It probably is just my sensitive skin."
M 68 years old so I exfoliate daily. Yours is the best! I've tried every sin cream up to 400.00thee was one tat worked like a miracle cream for lifting and I wold by against they took it off the market. This is the best for if ting and wrinkles.
