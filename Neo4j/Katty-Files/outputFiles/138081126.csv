"This is heaven in a bottle. I struggle with ingrown hairs and hyperpigmentation from shaving. Iâve been using this for my underarms and I can literally see the dead skin peeling and revealing new skin. Iâm so shocked! I exfoliate under my arms 3x a week to make the process faster. If you struggle with any hypedpigmentation, I highly recommend this, you will not regret it!"
Wow!!!! I can't really believe how this stuff works... I received my order Saturday and I've been only using it for 3 days and my bumps from plucking my chin are gone!!! Lol..... I'm about to order another bottle for my bikini area... its worth it!!!!
Great product works really well best product ive used for discoloration. Beaware skin peeling for a few weeks after using it
I love how it works
Works but it takes time. A little goes long way cause Ive had for at 5 months. It does burn when freshly shaved.
