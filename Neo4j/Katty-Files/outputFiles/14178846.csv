At least three generations of women in my family use Pond's products and I started using this instead of the Dry Skin Cream and it has helped dramatically reduce acne scars. It gives me a wonderful healthy glow and keeps my skin hydrated even while I was on deployment in the Arctic Circle.
"I enjoyed reviewing the Dark Spot correcyor by Ponds.It was very creamy, and thick.not at all greasy.A little went a ling way.I see a difference in my skin.I received complimentary, this is my unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you do not have this little gem of skin cream...Go buy it! I have bought hundreds of skin care creams in my life. I am 45 years old. My mother when I was young would use Ponds creams and over the years I stopped. But recently I decided to buy some and just like it did while my mother used it, I was once again glowing with radiance after applying. Ponds is old school however the best. Buy as much as you can. It works!"
I have alot of trouble areas because of the scars my acne left behind. I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and can already tell that my scars have lightened up. The best part would have to be that it does not clog my pores at all. Love this face cream and I will for sure keep using this product.
"We have only had the product a week, takes 2-4 weeks to see results so we will know more then. Reviews are great everywhere online, and this was the cheapest price with site to store it was free and ready for pickup... no complaints. Smells great, doesnt leave a greasy feeling... even if it doesnt work its a good lotion lol."
love this product! most do not believe im 39 yrs old but i am. Been using Ponds for as long as i can remember:)
I love this product you will see the results within a few days only! Its not oily or heavy cream. make sure you pick the right one for your type of skin. I use this only at night.
I been using this product for a few weeks and have seen a change in my face its even and the black spots are disappearing you can't go wrong with this product.
This face cream is nice and light with hardly any fragrance which is great for someone with allergies. I don't know that it removes dark spots. I haven't noticed a difference but I still like it because it makes your face very smooth.
"I need more moisture and lots of it. This product delivers! I love the brand and its products. All affordable! I tested your POND'S products for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product, loved it, would recommend it to my friends and family. That's all i have to say about this awesome cream .. AAA+++"
I have been using this product for almost 2 years. It is very light and has definitely evened my skin tone.
It really helps with dark spots!! Old school remedy minus dept store prices!!
"Is very hard to find this one in store, but I'm happy I'd find it online."
Just started using the product and already seen my dark spots getting lighter
Works! Fades dark spots. Smells delicious.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Remove bruises in days, Very effective skin smoother."
"Using Pond's has a great effect. Words are not necessary to prove, just look at those who regularly use it."
"I love this product. It's smell is so soothing, especially at night right before bed."
"I actually really liked this. It is very hydrating and rich. It smells amazing, but the scent is very strong so if your are sensitive to smells just be aware of that. It says that its supposed to diminish dark spots. The jar I got was a travel size so I dont think Ive used it enough to know about this part. But it wouldnt hurt to try it. The price is definitely affordable and it does last a while."
"Ive been using this for almost a year now and ive seen very dramatic improvement in my skin. Not only did it help brighten dark spots on my face, but it manages to be very moisturizing yet not make me look like a total grease ball which is amazing!"
"I originally tried this product on travel size...I have dark spots on my face due to acne, and scarring. I love this product, it's really helping from a month of just using it. It's made not only my dark marks and scars fade, but has significantly hydrated my oily skin and has help with the acne itself due to my skin not producing as much oil anymore. Definitely recommend, and will continue to use this"
"I am 25 years old, and bought this to help with a few dark spots and to even out my skin tone. The first night I put it on, I woke up and noticed something was different but, thought to myself no it can't be that quick so I've continued to use it, 5 days later i can truly say that it works and I see a major difference already! Also leaves your skin so soft, I wish I would've taken a before picture but I didn't, I would definitely recommend!"
"I am 63 years old, I started using Ponds moisturizer in my 40's, but by the time I reached my late 50's I noticed age spots occuring. So I tried Ponds Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream. This product is Amazing, I use it once in the morning an let it soak into my skin then I can apply my make up, I apply again at night after I wash my face. This product really works an at a very good price. Ladies try it."
My friend begged for this from me when she saw what I got to sample from Influenster. I don't really have any dark spots but she middle eastern from Pakistan and so I let her try it. After a couple weeks she was very excited and happy because she finally found something that actually worked for the dark circles under her eyes and around her mouth area. Got for free but this is my friends opinion. #ponds #influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I brought a travel size product just to try it. I have dark spots on my face from acne. I never really tried to fade them, and thought it was time that i start using products to try. I got the product and starting using it immediately as a part of my morning and nightly routines. It has been about 2-3 and i do see a significant change in the color of my dark spots. My skin is more even, and soft, and my spots ARE fading! I wish i had taken a before and after picture to share, but this stuff works!"
"I use the one for oily to normal skin and I like it. It does a good job of moisturizing my face but I mainly buy it to fade my dark spots. I think they changed the formula though. The old version was a little thicker and had a slightly stronger smell. I'm not complaining about the new formula, they only made a slight change. You don't have to use a lot of it. This is the second jar I have bought. My first jar lasted me a almost a year."
I found this product after being disappointed with a $70 product that my husband had purchased. I have used it morning and evening and within a week noticed improvement in both softness of my skin and evenness of skin tone. My only complaint is that the 7 oz size is not available in my local Walmart store and so I have found the travel 1.5oz size there and bought multiple jars.
"I have not been able to find this product in the full size jar, so I picked up one travel size jar to try it out.....well, I am glad I did! I have been using this for 2 weeks and my awful acne marks/spots are fading away! Major improvement - I am happy. It does have a nice smell to it, so if that stuff bothers you, this might not be for you. It is creamy and absorbs well. Went back and bought a few more travel size jars :) Love it and recommend it."
I've used several more expensive spot correctors and nothing works as well as this does. I have dark areas on my face from a bad sunburn when I was a kid and I've never been able to get rid of it until now. My skin is starting to be the creamy beige all over that I remember and dreamed it could be. I can finally just throw on some powder and go instead of using all that cover-up. Love you Pond's.
This stuff is amaze balls for heavens sake where has this been my whole life I needed this in my skincare regime for the past 10 years now I just need to buy more and stock up for the rest of my life!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using more expensive products over my 57 years I gave this a try since I was going on a trip. I stuck with it after realizing my skin was improved, fading spots and evening skin tone. Much to my dismay I can't find it in stores so will order online. Give it a try, you will love it!"
"I love this product, since chemotherapy, and radiation my face and neck had very bad dark spots that would not go away, my skin was too! Sensitive for other products, so I came across ponds it was a revaliatuon I use it twice a day, and in 2 weeks I notice the difference!!! I was blown away! I love it"
"I've been dealing with dark spots for almost four years now and I've tried almost every leading brand of dark spot removal and none of them compare to this lotion here. In a matter of a month, my dark spots are barely visible and with other products I would start to notice a little difference in two to three months. i absolutely love this product and recommend it to everyone who needs it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product in the travel size and was skeptical. I am a darker shade and it's very hard to get rid of dark spots that are new and old. However, it faded most of my marks from prior years and also my fave is now one even tone. Best of all it keeps my face moisturized but not oily enough to block my pores. After using this product faithfully it really has done wonders for my skin and is now my holy grail."
"I received these products complimentary for testing purposes I received the POND's Clarant B3 Moisturizers and they have absolutely blown me away! I will be using this moisturizer going forward. It made my skin feel smooth and refreshed without becoming flaky or having clogged pores. In conjunction to how it made my skin feel, the reduction of color in my age spots has absolutely blown me away! I love this product and will recommend it to anyone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I saw a review on this and decided to try it since my dark spots around my cheeks have been getting bad. Omg i love it so much! it says it takes around 4 weeks to see a difference in the apperance of the dark marks, but I notice a difference right when i wake up in the morning from applying it the night before i go to bed. I also enjoy the smell of it and a little product goes a long way!"
"I bought the big bottle about two weeks ago and I was hessitant to use it. I didnt trust it, but I gave it a try a week ago and my skin feels smooth. Doesnât clog my pores or cause acne. I also use it under my make up and it seems to last longer during the day. My dark and red acne spots are also fading away already. I cant wait to see my results in 4 weeks. I absolutely love it."
"I love this moisturizer! I have used it very often to help diminish my discoloration due to acne scars. Its a little on the pricey end but I dont use it daily and purchase the small one. Great product, great moisturizing, and great smell! I definitley have noticed a change on the appearance of my acne scars."
I love this product!! I am 35 years old with adult hormonal acne. I also had dark spots due to my acne. After using this product my dark spots have diminished and I also noticed I don't get acne neither. I have tried everything and this is the only thing that has helped my face.
"This cream is amazing. Just after 10 days of use I can visibly see and feel a difference in my skin. Will definitely purchase again and I highly recommend this product. Has a very soft, pleasant scent. Skin feels moisturized after each use. Will continue to monitor my results."
nice [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very happy with purchase and shipping.thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I only used theis cream for 2 days and it made the dark spots worse and darker. I was so disappointed in this product. Face was slightly irritated as well in those places. I immediately stopped using it.
"I was surprised at how heavily scented this is. BUT itâs amazing stuff! Transformed my skin in just three days. Itâs softer, smoother AND is helping to heal adult acne. Canât speak to the evening out the skin tone part yet, but im optimistic!"
The great reviews were off the chart on this! I trust Pond's but was disappointed that I'm not seeing the reduction to the dark spots as it stated.
"This product is great if you want way lighter skin , and what i like is that it also brings out your eyebrows alot , i would definitely recommend this product i always use it i just LOVE it ."
It actually does what it says it does ... clears dark spots. This is my go-to item when i need these little dark spots on my face to go away ... I love it.
THIS CREAM WORKS SO WELL WITHIN JUST A FEW DAYS I NOTICED A BIG DIFERENCE IN MY SKIN. SO MUCH SOFTER AND SMOOTHER. MY MEDS WERE DRYING MY FACE OUT BUT NOW ITS GREAT! WON'T BE WITHOU IT EVER.
I m an aestitionIVE used other age spot removers at 100.00 a 1/4 oz this works better. rub whole area with cream after few days all freckels blend and age spots dissapear good for whole body and face
"I picked up a travel size by random and had been using it for 2 months. I can see visible improvement on skin tone. Her skin is a little dry so this cream is a good fit, especially during autumn and winter. Highly recommended!!!"
I have been using this for 5 days and I already see a difference in my acne scars. They are almost gone and I have had these dark marks for over 2 years now. I can't wait until I keep using this product more and see even better results. Must buy!
This product I been using it over a year and is amazing I notice the I got lighter and the dark spot are gone I love it I can't live with out it I went and got me a big size now I recommend it to every one with dark spot
Gets rid of dark spots and discolorations of skin. I have used many products and this one actually does the job of keeping my skin even. Great price from a great company with a great reputation.
I've had these acne scars on my face for a very long time and after using this creme for less than a week they are almost all gone. This product is awesome. It even got rid of the acne on my cheeks.
My girlfriend introduced me to this product because my face was breaking out and leaving dark spots. She suggested I use this and after a few weeks I can definitely see a difference. I love it!!!
the product was fine but the deilvery was not. i ordered both ponds creams both were shiped separtli two days apart. why waste so much time packing two creams in two big boxes and two deliveres
I am in my first week of using this for the dark spots on the back of my hands. It smells nice and is easy to use. The price is great. I am hoping for good results.
I have been using it for several years and it has been very good for me. I like it because apart from moisturizing and helping with the spots it has a protector.
Honestly giving 2 stars just causw it smells really good. Ive been using this product daily for 4 months and have not seen any improvements on my dark spots. Ive been raking photos over time and see no difference. I had high hopes for this.
"Used 1 jar of this cream and have noticed my skin tone is more even, with less pronounced dark spots. The cream has a nice scent and it glides well over your face, just a little bit goes a long way. Love this product!"
Really really love all ponds items but especially this cream. Great for both dry and oily skin. I have oily skin and I put so much on because its so amazingly hydrated
This is a very thick and nice moisturizer it helps get rid of scars and dry skin. Its pretty cheap for such a big container. Its a soft and gentle lotion. I use it as a night time cream and I definitely recommend it to others.
Ponds Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream is a great value! I have sun spots and I have been using this product for them. I do recommend this cream.
"Love this! If you just wanna try it, they have smaller ones in the travel section at your local drugstore. Has a really nice scent and doubles as a primer for your makeup."
"I dont really like this product. At first , it made me feel like it was doing wonders for my skin but then my skin started feeling very dry and I stopped using it. I dont really have any spots for this to correct but it worked on helping remove a natural tan out of my face with was great."
"I use it in the night because it can be harsh for my skin if exposed to the sun afterwards, however I found it very helpful to make me return to my natural skin color (it doesn't make your skin lighter than its natural color) but help really well with dark spot and sun spots, also is very important to choose the formula for your skin type I have dry skin and the one for oily to normal skin, is really harsh for my skin, but I love the one for dry skin it also gives moisture to my skin."
Started to use this cream 3 weeks ago and already seeing results on my dark spots. Great price not pricey at all. What i like the most is that you can use it night and day and it works as a moisturizer too. POND's Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream
"The cream smells very pleasant and feels super nice going on the skin. It is nice and cold to the touch and is gentle. I love the Ponds packaging and the component. However, my skin looked the same after using it for a few weeks. A nice moisturizer but nothing special."
"It took a while to see some results, but after about 4 weeks of using this cream (applying before makeup in the morning and after exfoliating at night) I started to see some of my dark spots diminish. This moisturizer is on the thicker side so it doesn't take much to get the job done, which means this 7 oz jar will last quite a while. I think it's a worthwhile addition to my skincare arsenal, and you can't beat the price."
"I'm usually skeptical when it comes to products like this, I've never used any products for my face. But when I started noticing age spots I knew I had to do something, so I tried this..I was shocked. Almost instantly my face feels nurished and literally within 2 days I noticed my spots clearing up. This product is amazing! Thank you!"
It's alright. I didn't see much improvement when I was using it but I'm opening to trying it again. This product was inexpensive and has worked for others around me so I might give it another try. It has a pleasant smell as well. There is much room for improvement
One of my friends referred this cream to me because I was having breakouts due to hormone imbalance. Within the first week of using it I noticed my dark spots clearing up. I also love how smooth this product leaves my skin. Also it has a pleasant scent unlike some facial creams.
"I got this moisturizer in hopes to alleviate some current acne and some of the scarring I have from old skin problems. The cream is nice. Lightweight with a refreshing scent, it goes in a little bit greasy but does not stay that way. Will definitely buy again if some of my acne scars begin to lighten."
"I live by this cream! I suffered from acne and had so many dark spots left from picking at my face over the years. This cream has cleared my face up and the marks are nearly gone! Also, the price is unbeatable. You can find this product at any drugstore."
"I swear by this , this stuff is magic . Use it daily , for the past year or so . No more dark spots, no more patchy skin. Really moisturized my skin. Leaves it feeling smooth & soft. Very affordable can find it practically anywhere . Recommend to those that have dark spots , scars. Give it a try. I have oily/dry skin. Doesn't leave me oily."
I rate it 3 stars because for me it didn't work at a spot corrector but it has work great as my daily moisturizer every morning. Did not meet the expectations but great for the moisture. Gentle on the skin and does not make my face greasy or over moisture.
"It is a good moisturizer but not lightening, if it comes to fade the spots but not to remove them completely, in addition to my skin is greasy and obviously not a product for me, so I do not recommend it for girls with oily skin, dry or normal skin maybe it would be worth it to taste it"
"I used this for my scarring on my cheeks at night time. It did help with fading my scars but I also had a whole skin care regimen for my scars with other face masks, spot treatments, and such. I would encourage anyone with any dark spots to add this to their regimen and you'll probably see faster results as well. The smell is tolerable for me personally, but I've read many people don't like it. It smells like a baby scent in my opinion. POND's Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream"
"This is what God uses on his face every morning I swear !!! It immediately brightens your face, removes uneven skin tone, and doesn't feel too thick on the face. I normally use it every morning and night and it works great. I saw results within about 4 days . I got my family hooked on it and my boyfriend. Totally inexpensive and worth every penny."
"I am on my 2nd tub of this product, I haven't seen immediate results my skin has a lot of darks spots but I also have seen them get a bit lighter... as anything I don't expect miracles. I will definitely be buying this product keeps my fave moisturized and not oily"
"It's too early to tell, only been using for 4 days"
"I tried Pond's Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream because of the Pond's brand and affordability. I'm disappointed to say, other than moisturizing and smelling good, I've had no positive results for improving skin tone or diminishing dark spots. I've used this product twice daily for 2 months with no results."
I have very few faint brown spots on my face. Sometimes they tend to show through my foundation if I don't use heavy makeup. So I was excited to try this product. I did notice the spots starting to fade some. My face seemed to be smoother with a flawless look. I love how this also hydrates my skin. Ponds always has amazing products. This is a great moisturizer! I received a sample for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got to try this product for free through @influenster. I have tried it everyday for two weeks and I love the results. I have fair skin, so I tend to get dark acne spots while healing and dark patches or freckles if I'm in the sun too long. In two weeks, I have noticed a difference and these spots have slightly lightened. I will continue to use the product and it's really inexpensive. This is 100% my own opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved 2 free jats for testing purposes from Influenster. First is the scent as I opened them it was very nice light scent. The first day after washing my face i applied it to my face and neck and it adsorbs very well and did not leave my face looking oily . My face feels so soft after using for over a week and the lines and dark spots are fading. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to keep using it . I have told my family and friends how wonderful this product works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Soft and smells so good
Since I've been using this product I have not been using anything else.
"After using this product for only 10 days I started to notice my acne scars fading! 3 weeks later, I can barely see them."
I bought a trial size and used it for a week..all I can say is that i'm surprised at the results! Very good product..
"Arrived very quickly but I have not used it long enough to give an honest review. It is nice and creamy though and, so far, seems fine."
It has a pleasant scent and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I will continue to use and reccomend to others.
"Using it since i was a teen, I really lit the smooth and the results of this cream, also the price is very affordable."
"This is a great cream, but it not meet my expectations by claring the dark spot. But i used it every night."
TERRIFIC. Thats the word Ill use to describe this product. It works great for the dark circles under my eyes.
In my opinion does not remove dark marks from my skin but its a really good moisturizer for my skin and does not leave it with an oily residue
I purchased this because it was inexpensive. Lesson learned because it breaks my skin out like crazy. then I read the ingredients and it has a bunch of stuff I can't pronounce.
"I Like it a lot I've only been using for a few days and I can already see my spots lighten. It has a bit of a tingle if I really lather it on. Smells very clean and fresh. Very happy, I glow."
"Love It, I bought this because it had good reviews and it was the right price. I have only used it for 1 week, but I think my skin tone is improving. I also love the smell! Great product leave it to Pond's"
"I absolutely believe in this cream! I have definitely noticed a difference in my face with some acne scars I used to have. And any discoloration, using this product religiously has balanced my face."
"It smells good, it's soft on the skin, make my skin comfortable, bright and healthy as well. I use it on the mornings after I wake up, wash my face and then apply it."
I have been currently using this because of my under eye dark circles I don't know yet if I truly live this or not I need to go e it a little longer to see if it works but it is a good dose of mostiure to the face
"I have been using this for about 2 years. Never really noticed a difference. Also, my skin have recently became drier than usual and this cream is not very moisturizing."
"I start use it on my acne scars and help it in a few weeks, it was that well that I use it in the rest on my body where I have dark spots. Use it wherever you need! It actually works!"
"My skin tone is golden and I tend to get a lot of darks spots on my skin because of acne and my period. This cream solve that problem, my face looks smooth and healthy after using this cream."
Ponds Clarant B3 Dark Spot Normal to Dry Skin I don't know. The jury is still out. Worked better than Aveeno. Not as good as Neutrogena. BETTER price than either of those. But it is working. Seems to work better if...
I love it! It is so gentle and my skin Just looks really really good after using! Not sure if actuslly corrects dark spots but I will check back after using it longer! I do like this so far though!!
"I am currently using this cream for the day, what I can say is that as far as clarifying is needed, the results are very smooth. It moisturizes my skin as for that I have no problem."
"My dark spots have gotten worse over the years and I've used a lot of facial cleansers, masks and peels over the past year. This one was very refreshing! I would definitely recommend this product to my friends!"
Smells AMAZING! and helps my lighten my dark spots. This product is super affordable and keeps my skin so moisturized. I use it twice a day and my skin looks and feels amazing.
"I love the smell, I love the fresh feeling I have after using it. I have seen quite a difference. I use it for the dark bags under my eyes and it works miracles."
This company is one of the best companies that have been dealing with it for a long time because its products are wonderful and the raw materials are excellent and more wonderful
LOVE LOVE LOVE! My everyday moisturizer/ skin prep before doing makeup! Cannot be replaced. It goes on the skin smoothly and is very light on the skin. Not sticky or heavy like most moisturizers.
Have used this product for years now. I have dark spots and yes this totally does work . Keeps them faded and away is non irritating. I give it a thumbs up
This is a very good-cheap cream. I like it very much. I used to use it when I was younger and start to worry about my skin care routine. I highly recommend it
"I bought this product thinking it would work, but it did not work. This was very disappointing but it is a good concept for a product, I just hope they can make another like it that works in the future."
Do not care for this product. Left my face feeling a bit oily and felt like I just rubbed my face down with body lotion. It's not a bad price but I wouldn't waste my money on this one. Pretty disappointed with this one and won't be buying again.
"very good, it leaves the skin impeccable, and removes stains, removes all the dirt from the skin, lme charm, I highly recommend it, they have to use it"
I swear by this lotion it is the best smelling best feeling and over all best dark spit corrector I have found! POND's Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream
In my opinion these don't work and I don't see any difference. I like the small package but I feel their kinda harsh and way too thin. I always have to double up. Not worth the price and I wouldnt recommend these to anyone
Been using this for 3 months on my dark spots and it has made such a difference I love my skin now I am not ashamed anymore helped me gain my confidence this product is great
This is an old school product line but ponds is a solid choice for makeup removal. I like how my makeup just slides off leaving my skin ready for cleansing.
"This cream actually works, does clear your sling, the value is great and the price awesome, very affordable! This product meet all my expectations, it's gentle to the skin. I would definitely keep purchasing this product"
"I use this when my face is dry, and also sometimes to take off my makeup. I like to pull it down my neck to help early with wrinkles (I'm only 22). Doesn't seem to do much for dark spots though, mainly for dryness"
Probably my favorite product from Ponds thus far. I recently got this and love it. It helps with my dark circles and makes my skin soft. The smell is great but not overpowering. It's affordable and easy to apply. I recommend this forsure.
"the cream has a slightly strong texture, its smell alike. But moisturizes the face well, and there to have a constant use to see the results of the lightening"
"I use this everyday on some blemishes I have for being terrible to my breakouts, and with contiuous use I notice it dminshes the blemish not a miracle worker over night but def worth a try to see if it works for others."
This will forever be one of my go to products not just for my face but for my whole body. I use it to help battle hyperpigmentation and it works great and makes your skin feel so soft and it's super inexpensive on top of that.
Great product. After just a week the dark spots on my face and back of my hands are lighter. This is very inexpensive and I couldn't be happier! Can't wait to see what it does ater a month!
"I can see my dark spots just starting to lighten. It's a slower process, as I can see, but it does brighten my skin up, again a slow process, but I am satisified. Ponds products are very good. And the price is extremely reasonable. A trusting name."
First day using and have already noticed the difference I have used everything and by far this product was most noticeable after first use!!! Lightened years of dark spots will continue to use and will be buying another
Good
"I originally bought a sample size of this. I have discoloration around my mouth area, and used it in that area that night. The next morning, I noticed it was a bit lighter. I've used it regularly, and the area has definitely lighten up. This is the first time I haven't had a problem using a product to lighten a dark area. It seems to be gentler than other bleaching products and has a nice scent to it."
"I've had really bad skin my whole life. I suffer from eczema, adult acne, and scarring from teen acne. This face cream literally changed my life. My skin is SO much better then it was before using this. It has really made a huge difference to me. I highly recommend!"
After recieving the free sample of ponds clarant-b3-dark-spot-correcting-cream from Influenster I began to notice immediate results in as little as three days. I cancelled my dermatologist appointment I had made when I noticed the dark spot showing up from years of sun exposure. I'm still using it and it just keeps getting better and better. Not only are the dark spots fading but my whole face is getting a more even tone and feels so nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use to use tanning beds before and due to me doing that I got a brown spot on my upper left side. I started using the Ponds Clarant B3 about 3 weeks ago and I have noticed that my spot went from a dark brown to a very light brown. No it is not gone completely, but it is almost gone. I received my cream for free from Fluenster, but this is my true opinion. I wear this every single day, in the morning and at night. I'm crossing my fingers all of my spots will disappear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LOVE THE WAY THIS PRODUCTS MAKES MY SKIN FEEL. SO SOFT AND LIGHT NOT HEAVY AND GREASY. AFTER USING FOR A COUPLE WEEKS I NOTICE A DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN SKIN DARK SPOTS AND UNEVEN TONE. MY SKIN LOOKS FABULOUS [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received Ponds Clarant B3 for testing purposes from Influenster. This product has made my skin so even toned after two weeks. Also, can we talk about the smell? It smells amazing! Even my husband noticed. The only drawback is I wish it had a sunscreen in it. It doesn't make a lot of sense to get rid of dark spots without also protecting your skin from them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have only been using the product for a few days but I am finding my skin to be so soft and smooth with a slight reduction in pigmentation spots. I only wish it had sunscreen so that I could prevent more sun damage. I received this product for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recommend this product it is excellent. Within 2 weeks I can see the change in my skin tone.
This product is so gentle on the skin and leaves it so Soft.
Very good product very moisturizing
Great products expesically the brown spot remover. I'm proof that it works.
"I use it regularly, it's a lot like it smells and its effect is prolonged and long lasting"
This product leaves my skin feeling soft & moisturized. It absorbs quickly & isnt greasy at all
not great. Good moisturizer but no effect to skin toning
It made my face red. I probably would use the rest on my elbows or feet so not to waste it. Kinda harsh in my opinion
Face cleanses is a must and I love this soo much it's so smooth and amazing will definitely buy again his corrected is great
"Worked well as a moisturizer, however, it didn't visibly reduce dark or red spots on my face. Would like to try it again"
Really amazing product and great value. Not pricey at all. Nice smell and texture. It definitely met my expectations.
I use POND's Bio Hydratante Cream along with the dark spot correcting cream after every face wash to give my face but the moisture it might've lost
I ware this every morning and it has really helped my dark spots under my eyes. This cream helps rejuvenate your skin and makes it look more vibrant.
My faithful companion since I was 16 years old. Basic but efficient. Perfect to start in this world of skincare :)
"Pond's Clarant its so good, i always use it, every morning and every night, I love it, are the best product!"
Cheap and I have repurchased this many many times. It works so good as a regular moisturizer. It has a tacky feel that you will love!
So I have a problem with picking at my face and these pods helped a little bit. But not something I would use everyday
Cheap cheap cheap. Does not do a thing for dark spots. Maybe like a little lotion. Would not recommend this product
I used this before I would actually put on makeup. This helped moisturize my face to the point where I would put it a part of my morning routine.
Used this for a month and sawno chisme in my dark spots. If you want something to help diminish dark spots this doesn't work.
"Works great! Smells great! Makes your dark spots go away little by little! I definitely would recommend it,,"
I have dark spots on my face and this cream really helped me. I put it every morning after my shower and every evening before I go to bed.
"Great, affordable moisturizer. A bit on the oily side but smells good ! I have gone through a couple of these."
"Wonderful, I really love it. I always use it and it leaves my skin super cute. It is a 100% recommended product, since it works very well for me."
Use this every night! Works great for acne scars without clogging pores. Smells very clean but not overpowering.
"Best inexpensive, never gets old product for the skin, if you are in a budget however are interested in taking care tjis is the best brand to use."
I have used this product and it's very good. It hydrates your skin and helps you to clear it. I've used at night.
Cream is very useful I always recommend it because I trust the products of this distinguished company
I use this for my hyperpigmentation and it works great! You will see results over time not immediately
It has taken many uses but I am seeing subtle corrections to my coloring of skin. Not greasy at all semi lightweight
I love the texture that leaves on my skin I use to remove my makeup before sleep and I love the bolveria to buy
I started to use this cream more now then when I first purchased it. I think its a great face product. I like how it feels smells and goes on my skin. I have noticed one spot lighter . very happy. Looking to try the wrinkle creme too.
"Normally these types of creams are very expensive, but Pond's is reasonably priced. Too soon to tell if it will work, but this is a generous size, so plenty of time to give it a full trial."
I purchased a bottle about 3 weeks ago. I have dark spots on my forehead and cheek area. I am amazed how well the dark spots are starting to fade. THANK YOU for an affordable product!
"Too strong fragrance smell, when I say ""too strong"" it really means like that It causes ACNE, BIG-RED AND HURT. When I first use it, my skin break out but I don't believe that because of this product. I was stop using it for 2 months (until my skin gets better) and give it another try. Guess what? After use it for 3 days and now my skin has lots of big acne, nose, forehead, cheek. I'm expect this product to help my dark spot but now it creates MORE DARK SPOTS. THANK YOU!"
"Ponds is a Mexican staple in facial regimens! I've used ponds cream for years! My mom used only ponds , so hence why I followed along ! This new formula of ponds for dark spots does work great. It doesn't feel too heavy or thick and it really does work . You do have to use it for a month before you start seeing results. I love this stuff!"
"Pond, you are awesome! Please dont stop making this product! I'm so inlove with this and it's the only product that fits my skin perfectly! I want to thank you so much for making this great product with difficult skin like mines, thank you thank you!"
I am into day 9 of using. I am an outdoor lady and I got my share of sun spots on my forehead and a few on cheeks. Being 58 and getting older I realized using aloe vera alone wasn't helping. The scent is very nice and the cream is a smooth clean feeling when appied. Looking for results to to also help with hands and forarms.
"I tried this product to lessen the appearance of scars, after trying expensive products like Mederma etc., nothing worked. After one week, there already is a 75% less appearence to the scars that actually look like dark spots. This is a great product at a greatt price."
I purchased this product two weeks ago just out of curiosity. I have mild acne marks and almost all of them are already gone its been a week and a half. I'm fair so my skin can get red sometimes this product evens it nice. It also is a fantastic moisturizer! LOVE
"I wanted to try a new product for my dark spots. I ran across this item in the grocery store. I decided to give it a try. However, It didn't really do much for me. I used this product twice a day; once in the morning, then at night before going to sleep. I used this cream over a month. The good quality about this product is that, it has a really good smell, not greasy, and a good moisturizer. Hope this was helpful..."
"Two weeks after I started using this, my husband said ""Your skin tone looks much more even!"" I hadn't told him I was using it. So that was pretty amazing. :-) My skin had some dark spots and redness, but this cream has done wonders for it- and it's inexpensive to boot. I could swear my fine lines have also diminished somewhat. My grandma used Pond's her whole life, as did my mom. Now I know why!"
I love Ponds. My grandmother and aunt used it when I was a little girl. I have used it All of the Ponds products and they are wonderful. I am 56 years old and people think my 23 year old daughter and I are sisters. Wouldn't change for anything. Thank you grandma for introducing Ponds to me.
"My skin has been seriously dry and dull-looking these past few months. A few pimples are popping up here and there, all leaving scars. I decided to give this moisturizer a try as I've always been fond of Pond's products during my early teenage years. It has made my skin real smooth in a few days and brighter looking in about a week! It has also significantly diminished the appearance of my dark spots which is just amazing!"
"I've been using this since I was a teenager and suffering from acne and acne marks - and this cream has been incredible! Not only did it lighten all the marks, but it is also a wonderful moisturiser and did not irritate or cause my skin to break out. I've gone through three tubs of this cream, and don't plan on ever giving it up."
"I purchased this product to help with serious scars I have on my hands. My hands have been scratched and scratched, and some times the wounds were reopened before the area could heal. I have used Ponds Clarant B3 normal to dry for only a week and Holy Cow! There has been a huge improvement! I tried popular scar treatments and those more expensive products did very little to improve my hands. I am going to use this on face this week - I will be sure to take a photo before I start!"
"I have mild to moderate discoloration spots that I was targeting with vitamin C serum and a niacinamide cream. While they seemed to work, the combination seemed drying so I added a moisturizing hydrator. I really dislike layering that many products so I decided to try this instead. Wow. This works better than the other combined products in one step. My skin is rather sensitive and I've experienced no adverse reactions. Love it!"
"I have use this product for about 2 weeks and it's amazing. I suffer from acne and of course I have acne scars and this product has helped a lot. I haven't got any breakouts yet (I hope it stays like that too) and my skin is so soft and my scars are fading away !! I use it twice a day, morning & night.. I truly recommend this product! I can't wait to see my results in one more month of using this !! Love it !!"
"I'm a teenager who plays sports, so my skin will obviously not be the best (very dry and irritated). I've used this product for about a month and I've never received better results. My skin tone is cleared up from redness and acne scars while my skin is no longer dry. Definitely planning on using this for a long time into the future."
THIS ITEM LEFT MY FACE FEELING FRESH...SMOOTH AND RADIANT. THE SCENT IS AMAZING AND I WANTED TO USE IT MORE THAN JUST ON MY FACE AND NECK! I HAVE TO GET IN THE HABIT OF USING IT 2 TIMES A DAY FOR BETTER RESULTS. IM HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have minor discoloration due to photosensitivity in one of my medications. This DID work as promised but I appear to be extra sensitive to an ingredient because my skin got a bit of a break out around my hair line on on my t-zone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent was a light floral scent, easy to open & a good size jar for petite hand. I used the product 2 times a day for 2 weeks. It did make my skin very soft & it wasn't very heavy. It was great for under my eye makeup too. I tested POND'S products for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Clarant B3 moisturizer is amazing! I've been using the product for a little over 3 weeks and I can see the change in my skin tone. My dark spots from sun damage are slowly fading. Completely satisfied with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the feeling of this product, it is lightweight and non-greasy. Perfect to apply before moisturizer and foundation. It has a nice scent and makes your skin feel smooth. I received this product compliments of the brand for testing and review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used POND'S for the first time about 25 years ago and I wasn't very impressed. Well, I have started using Clarant B3 and Rejuveness creams a few weeks ago and I am now very impressed! My lines are less noticeable and my dark spots do not stand out as much! I received samples of each product for review purposes, all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to Ponds, and Influenster, I received a sample to try for 2 weeks. I am loving the results after the 2 weeks. My skin is smoother looking and feeling. Its actually enough of a difference that others noticed. I'm 54 years old, and was starting to notice darker areas, Ponds Clarant B3 has really helped make them less noticeable! I'm loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have pretty fussy skin but I trust Pond's skincare prodicts. They rarely make me break out and never cause the hives that lots of other products do. I tried POND'S® - Clarant B3 - Normal to Dry and it, unfortunately, did make me break out. Right now I have cradle cap, or seborrheic dermatitis, across some of my face, and I am sure the breakout was in part due to that. I still like POND'S® cold cream. It's a classic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and my skin looks brighter, healthier, hydrated and younger. I use it night and day after using a facial cleanser. I dry off my face and apply. Its non irritating, gentle and the fragrance is light and pleasant. It evened out my skin tone and made it look so much better than before. Im very please with this product and will continue to use it. I tested this POND'S product for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a moisturizer this product is. It goes on incredibly smooth and silky, making it lightweight. That is my number one requirement in a moisturizer, so I've really loved this. I haven't been using long enough to notice a definitive lightening of dark spots, but I'm hopeful. I tested this product free via Influenster.com."
"Sometimes drugstore brand products make me breakout with little dry patches. I used this and the Pond's Anti-Wrinkle Cream and have had amazing results! I am very pleased with the way the cream goes on, it doesn't feel greasy and it absorbs into my skin. I do think my face looks better. I received my products free but my opinion is my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin has never felt or looked firmer, smoother or more youthful. You really can SEE and FEEL the difference with the first application! I have a ruddy completion and have previously failed to find a product to help me get rid of the redness. Just after a few days use I started to see my skin tone evening out. After two weeks use my skin has never looked clearer and felt more smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the product complimentary to test and review. I must admit I was skeptical at first, I didn't believe you could lighten dark spots without a harsh chemical bleach and I have to admit, the spots on my cheeks are diminishing and I'm sure with more use, they will continue to get lighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like to use it everyday, sometimes twice/day, after I shower and before I go to bed. I started using it a couple days ago and I have already seen results. I have a few dark spots caused by acne and those seem like they're fading. My T-zone is a bit oily, but not as much as with other facial moisturizers. I will buy this moisturizer again! ‪#SeeForYourself‬ I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Excellent, hydrate your face, clarify and all at an affordable price......!"
Really makes my face smooth and balanced hydrated all over ( have mixed oily/dry skin type )
Love this stuff!!! I like to put it on every night and it seems so make my face brighter.
I love this correcting cream so much and it helps and making me feel confident in my face.
"Really hydrating, lasts all night. Smells fresh and definitely enough product to last a few months!"
Love this
Good moisturizer but did nothing for my dark spots or at least lightening them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Feels really good ob my skin, nice and supple, smells fantastic..dont know yet if it corrects dark spots. Just started using..we'll see."
I have used a trial jar for many months. Love the product but now I can't find it in stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am three weeks in and I see no difference in my spots.. none are gone not have lightened my face is soft but still covered in spots. I have even started using this 2x a day and nothing I am disappointed
"For years, my skin had thick, purple acne scars and uneven skin tone. I tried everything! This has changed my life. I am getting married in a few months and this product makes me more confident for my day. I will continue to use this product."
I have been using pond's products from years. It is really soft cream and leaves my skin very soft and glowing through out the day. It corrects the darken spots. Love it.
I initially used Rejuveness and it plumped my skin and fine lines were lessened. About 2 weeks ago I started using the Clarant and my age spots have almost disappeared. Love these products.
"I've only been using it for a few days since receiving it, so no ""remarkable"" difference just yet, but feels awesome to my face. I do hope it helps the few brown spots I have."
I have been using ponds b3 for less than a week and my skin looks amazing. I feel more confident and good now that I don't need to wear makeup. Thank you so much ponds.!
"This is a pretty good face lotion. For the longest time, I was only relying on the travel sized ones of this. I use this every morning after my shower. It works great."
I've been using Garnier dark spot corrector for 5 months and I haven't seen any improvement yet. I've only been using this for 2 1/2 weeks and I already see improvements and dark spots that has diminished. Kudo's ponds for making this product. 
Great moisturizer especially for under make up all day wear! I tried this morning and night and it just feels so soft! Light weight is the #1 thing i look for in a moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
At first I was skeptical if this would really work. But I was plesently surprised that it works! I had darkspots on my skin from sun damage but applying this daily has made them less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought a travel size version of this and after using it daily noticed I was breaking out. It might've actually worsened by dark spots but I can't be sure if the moisturizer is the reason as I haven't been drinking enough water lately and notice being dehydrated makes my skin worse. I won't be buying this again but doesn't mean you shouldn't try it. Everyone's skin is different.
Received this product in an Influenster Voxbox. First time user. I have normal skin and am looking forward to seeing the long-term effects. So far it has been a great addition to my day/night skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Picked this up in the 'travel size' section of the store just to try it mostly for the sunspots I've gotten over the years. I used it a couple of times before I took it on our trip to the beach a couple of weeks ago. We were out in the sun all day one day. I reapplied the Pond's a couple of times to my face. I used name brand sunscreen on the rest of my body. I ended up with sunburn on my shoulders and back, but my face was perfectly fine. The Pond's cream did a better job than the sunscreen!"
Everything! I have been using Pond's for more than 10 years now and I always get the best results.
I usually don't write reviews but after two days of use I was broke out! Don't buy if you have sensitive skin.
"Maybe it's just for my skin (I have very dry skin), but this cream made me break out. And it took a while until my skin got clear"
i LOVE this stuff. i use this 2 times a day and its amazing. it reduces redness and over time it clears away the discolored spots from past acne.
"I love it, I've been using it for the past 2 months and I will definitely buy it again. Really good price-quality ratio."
It's good for windy days and hot day.Me and my friends try it and it helps are dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
only been using for a few days and my skin looks more radiant already. spots seem to be getting lighter as well. will definitely be purchasing again. nice smell too.
I used this for a couple of days and it made me break out. Not at all happy about that as I am trying to take care of the dark spots caused by acne not to add more to my face.
"for 10 weeks I faithfully used this for facial dark spots and got absolutely no results, nada, zilch, nothing, zero...what a waste of money it made Ponds $9 richer and me poorer...what a let down."
"Few months before I purchase the same Item and it looks more thickness, and it worked well, couple of weeks before again I purchase the same item, but the quality has been change, thickness is low. I feel it is not working well now."
DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS!! DARK SPOTS IN MY FACE CLEARED IN 2 WEEKS!
Its not greasy and smooth out nicely
So many people pay insane amounts of $ on inferior products. This is truly a miracle product.
Makes my skin feel soft and smooth! It's been wonderful!
Awesome product for the ultra sensitive skin and it does what it says
"I love, love, love, this cream. It keeps my skin spotless..."
I bought ponds and it was opened and had yellow spots in it
