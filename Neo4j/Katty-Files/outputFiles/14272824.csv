I received a sample of this several years ago at the dermatology office. I was looking for an unscented high SPF moisturizer for the tops of my hands. It gives me the protection I am looking for without a scent. It is a bit expensive for the size though.
"Love this stuff. People of color need sunblock too and others I tried left this terrible white-ish gloss on my face. I'll never forget when a boyfriend asked why my face was turning white with another product. No problems with this, I have dry skin, it takes care of that with sunblock that does not leave a trace. It's the only facial lotion I use."
I got a sample of it from my dermatologist used it few times and noticed a big difference in my skin. It felt smoother and looks radiant. I was hooked that I ordered two other ones!!!!
I am allergenic to the chemicals is most sunscreens. My eyes swell and my neck begins to itch and turn red. My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Healthy Defense years ago and it is the only sunscreen I have used on my face ever since.
I've been using this product and it's predecessor for about 10 years. I have that typical Irish light skin and living in the tropics is probably something I should have reconsidered long ago but with the help of this product my skin still looks great at 63. This product keeps it moisturized all day while also blocking much of the sun's harmful effects and thats saying a lot considering I'm often on my boat or Harley all day in the sunshine. Using Healthy Defense will give you the confidence to live in the sun again.
"My dermatologist gave me a sample of this about 6 years ago and I fell in love with it. It is unscented, light weight, and it actually works. I slather it on my face and neck and then apply makeup over it. Works beautifully. Please don't discontinue it."
"After several basal cell cancers, my doc has me using this daily. Non oily and does not cause ingrown hairs for shaving my face."
"I've been using Neutrogena since I came to the US 13 years ago they have what I need for my face skin n I love it, thank you Neutrogena!"
I have been using this product for many years. I love it! Please don't discontinue it! It contains SPF 30 and that is very important to me! My skin feels very clean after I apply it. Soft and moisturized and not greasy. I even put it on my hands with the SPF 30 to moisturize and protect them from the sun with the SPF 30.
"This product was rated by Consumer Reports as being one of the best products to use as a facial skin product that protects the skin from sun rays,"
"I wear this every day under makeup per my doctor's orders. It is mild and does not sting or feel sticky,"
"I bought this a week a go, I really like the sunscreen protection that can avoids skin damage if I am outside for too long. But the only problem that I don't want is too shiny and greased after I applied. If they can make it with less grease then it will be great!"
"My favorite product was Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with a light tint. It had everything--just the right amount of sunscreen (30spf), a great feel, and as much make-up as I wanted. Alas, it has disappeared from my local drugstore and now, apparently, from this website. So begins the search for a new product and probably a new brand. We've been together a long time, Neutrogena, but you let me down."
I use this product every morning. I love it. And I don't have to worry about sun exposure.
I love this product. My skin feels so soft. So creamy. Not greasy.
I use this everyday and I love it. My dermatologist recommended it and it doesn't clog pores.
Since changing to this sunscreen in the moisturizer I know I'll be protected from skin cancer and dark spots. I even use it on my hands. I'm very happy with the way it performs under a makeup base.
"The first time I wore this I did yard work for a few hours and didn't get burnt or tan, so it definitely works! It wasn't really greasy like you would expect a sunscreen moisturizer to be, but it was also not like a regular moisturizer. It has a faint scent similar to that of sunscreen (which I do not like), but it is a lot lighter and slightly different - I didn't really mind it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with Sunscreen feels so great on my skin. If I try and use a bit more than just a little of it then my face would get greasy so I only make sure to use a little bit of it. It makes my skin very smooth. I like the fact that it also has sunscreen in it because I am highly sensitive to sunburn. I will continue to use this product as my main moisturizer. This product is very creamy and has a tad scent of sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try the Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with SPF 50 because I wear a minimum of SPF 30 on my face every day. I found the Neutrogena to give too much of a white cast and it didn't absorb into my skin enough. If I was on vacation at the beach, I may use this product for intense sun protection. But for everyday protection and wear under makeup, this product missed the mark for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always used Neutrogena products because of their high quality. The Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer absolutely worked well on my skin. Not only is it lightweight, I especially like that it is not greasy at all. It absorbed quickly when applied and most important is the spf 50 sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This sunscreen is a very nice, non-greasy product. It goes on easy and has a pleasant smell. I applied my Neutogena sunscreen before going outside because I live in an area that is extremely hot in the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product keeps my face moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy on my skin. It also provides a level of sunscreen to keep my face safe from sun damage. I wear it alone and under my make-up. I definitely recommend for all skin types as my face tends to be dry in some places and oily in others...this definitely seems to give me a more even skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how my face felt after using this moisturizer! That's saying something, for me, when a moisturizer has spf in it. It usually feels more greasy or heavy on my skin, but not this one! It felt great, even under my makeup or by itself. I'll be picking up more soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer was easy to apply. It spread easily and I did not have to apply a lot of product. It did not leave my face too wet and I was able to apply power foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am honestly shocked at how great this moisturizer is. I use Super Goop sunscreen as part of my daily regimen. In comparison to that I would say that this moisturizer is the same if not better. I have very sensitive acne/clogging prone skin. The moisturizer is not greasy at all and did not cause any breakouts either. I would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's a decent chemical sunscreen with necessary features.
When first applied it caused some white cast which with a little rub & time will slowly be absorbed.
"I didn't experience any issue, other than after few hours it made my skin looked greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have acne prone skin and always looking for sunscreen that is not greasy. After using Neutrogena healthy defence cream I have found permanent skin cream for my skin. It was very gentle, fast absorbing and light fragrant. I did not see any problem with this product. Absolutely loved this product. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Very good quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is awesome. It feels smooth and non-greasy upon application.
"I was looking for a mineral based, fragrance free sunscreen, and this exceeded my expectations. No burning when applied, no white cast (though I have very pale skin), no pilling under makeup, no weird smell, no breakouts. It's reasonably priced."
"This moisturizer was a pleasant surprise! I have temperamental skin and most moisturizers just cause more issues but not this one. It's very lightweight and doesn't make my skin overwhelmingly oily 20 minutes later. Overall I'd definitely recommend this moisturizer (and I have a strong preference for ""luxury"" beauy products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great sunscreen that i add directly into my foundation each morning. It's light and you don't really notice it's there since the scent is so mild and the cream is so light and not too greasy. I would use it on a daily basis whether there's sunshine or not. Gotta protect my face from those harmful uv [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer is my new favorite daytime product! It kept my skin moisturized all day without feeling heavy or sticky. I love that it keeps my skin soft and glowing while protecting me from the sun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Neutrogena healthy defense daily moisturizer is the best daily facial moisturizer I have tried in years. This moisturizer is just the right texture and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but the moisturizer is not heavy. It's light scent and easy to use packaging make this my new favorite moisturizer overall. I will have to try all of the neutrogena healthy defense products now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It provides great moisture without feeling heavy or greasy at all. I expected it to smell like sunscreen, but actually there's almost no scent at all. My skin even looks healthy and glowing for the rest of the day, even under my makeup. I've been wearing it every day for at least a week and I haven't had any breakouts or any issues with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product was very lightweight and didn't smell too much like sunscreen. I liked how it was not greasy. It seemed to work as if was supposed to. Would definitely buy. I received this product in exchange for a review, all opinions are my very own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer is a great product that provides protection from the sun while moisturizing your skin. It's not greasy and it goes on smoothly. I would recommend to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of this moisturizer, it feels light and not greasy. I love that it contains a 50 SPF sunscreen, it's the strongest I've seen in a moisturizer. Even though it contains sunscreen, it only lightly smells like a sunscreen. After I apply it to my face my skin absorbs it quickly, not leaving me looking shiny or greasy. It leaves my skin feeling very soft, too. I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It provided great protection and was gentle on my face. It did leave a slight greasy feel on my face but it went away after a few hours. Didn't work well with makeup unless I waited a few hours to apply [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Neutrogena broad spectrum sunscreen has a high level of sun protection in which I absolutely love. I know my face is being not only protected, but also moisturized while doing so! This sunscreen and moisturizer doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy, like other sunscreens and moisturizers. I absolutely love this product and it will now be my go to! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is moisturizing. It makes my face feels nice and smooth. It smells like sunscreen, not really like moisturizer. So if that bothers you, you may want to skip this. It seems to do fine with the sun. I have burned at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this daily moisturizer. It is creamy but not super heavy. It has a very subtle sunscreen smell but it's pleasant. It applies smoothly and doesn't feel greasy. I love the SPF 50. That's very important in any daily moisturizer but especially when you live in Florida. This product is a great for daily use and works well under makeup. I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the product after washing my face for the morning. The product went on smooth and white but did not leave a chalky feel. It was very light and had a pleasant scent. I loved how I didn't notice the product on my face throughout the day like other SPF products. My skin stayed protected throughout the day while I was outside. I would recommend the product. I just wish it came in a bigger tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This daily moisturizer with sunscreen blends on well on the face it doesn't leave a white residue on the skin. Doesn't clog pores and isn't oily. It just smells like sunscreen which is the only thing I don't like about this product. I wish it had a pleasant scent or no scent at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm always searching for a good moisturizer with a high SPH. Finally I found one that is light, non-greasy, no sunscreen smell, and applies easily. It goes great under my makeup and does not leave an oily residue feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised at how thin this was. Usually facial moisturizers that also have SPF (especially that greater than 30) tend to be very thick and feel thick when applied on the face. This wasn't thick and I liked it, plus it didn't have too much of a scent. It went on smoothly and I felt like my face was moisturized. I didn't have to reapply another layer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was an amazing product - sunscreen was lightweight and easy to spread without feeling dry. It even held up to exercising! It's also great because it is fragrance-free (which is good for the skin).
"Unfortunately I cannot reccommend (and will not buy) due to the ingredients, which are bad for marine systems and the others have been shown to bioaccumulate. Otherwise I would purchase this product exclusively! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am an avid Neutrogena user and found that this moisturizer absorbed into the skin easily and provided protection from the sun without making skin oily, or coming off during sweat. I liked that I did not have to reapply this product throughout the day and was ready to go from sunup to sundown. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love the convenience of combining my moisturizer and sunscreen steps! I also love that this has a high SPF of 50. Many of the other moisturizer + sunscreen combos i've tried tend to be on the lower end of SPF. I wear sunscreen everyday as it's the most important factor in anti-aging and this makes it easy and quick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a freckles living in Florida, I an an afficianado of moisturizing sunscreens. I've tried them all. Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 50 ranks pretty high to the top. Non greasy, lives up to the moisturizing label and at keeping sun damage at bay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neutrogena has been my go to drug store brand because they make quality products. With very sensitive skin, and prone to breakouts, I am quite hesitant with most sunscreens. I cannot stand a white cast that most sunscreen products leave behind and this did not do that. I actually enjoyed using this because it's not greasy, moisturizing and has not clogged my pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always used aveeno face moisturizer with SPF 50. But given the chance to use Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer I would definetly purchase it in the future. At first I was skeptical about the product because it seemed thicker and greasier, but once I applied it to my face it didnt feel thick or greasy. My pores didnt clogged causing a breakout which I always worry about with a new face product. I will definetly keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer was great! It quickly absorbed into my skin without leaving a white cast and it did not affect my makeup at all. This makes it such a good product to use on a daily basis, especially since the SPF 50 protection is great to have. It spread very easily and did not leave my skin feeling greasy either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was lightweight and non greasy. I felt like my skin stayed moisturized and free from sunburn or irritation due to heavy perfume or added ingredients. It's a noticeable difference from its competitors of the superior quality of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It gets absorbed by my skin fast and won't leave marks or stain. I notice also it keeps my skin moisturized longer and I experience less redness. I can say that the UV protection works as I stayed in the sun for a long time and did not see any sign of sun exposure. It also doesn't burn my eyes if applied near them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the texture of the lotion, it wasn't too thick. It was a little greasy on my face after application, but not so bad that I wouldn't purchase it. Thanks for the opportunity to try this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was impressed with the moisturizing quality of this product. Left my face feeling well hydrated, but not greasy. No fragrance, which is nice. You only need a small amount to cover your entire face! I would definitely recommend this product to someone looking for a good moisturizer with sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Feels light not heavy and greasy. Most others O have tried I did not like due to this issue as well as being to sunscreeny smelling and this was not that way which is also a very huge plus for me I am picky when it comes to these things. I am glad I got picked for this because now I have found a new product for me and my girls yay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cream is a lightweight texture that goes on smoothly. It was not greasy or thick like other brands with SPF. I used this on my face and neck and within a few days I noticed my skin was softer and smoother than before I used. There was no smell and a small amount went a long way. I did have a few small face break outs after a week of use but it was minor and cleared up. Overall I really enjoyed the moisturizer and felt protected from the hot high desert sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with sunscreen is a definite win for faces everywhere! It is light enough to be a facial moisturizer, but yet has the strength to block the damaging sun. There is no “sunscreen burn” when applied, like many other facial sunscreens have. This is great on sensitive skin, too! Thanks Neutrogena! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt like this sunscreen was way too heavy to use as a daily moisturizer. I put this on under my makeup before we went to the beach and it was so thick it didn't feel like it absorbed into my skin well. Maybe if you use it as a stand alone AT the beach... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this moisturizer is amazing. I love that it has SPF 50 which is great since I live in Florida and it's usually always sunny. Is lightweight it doesn't dry out my skin at all. I will definitely be getting this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I got to sample of Neutrogena Healthy Defense with SPF 50, and I enjoyed using it. I used it when I went to the beach or the pool. I do not recommend putting make up over it, that didn't work out for me to well but it did protect me from the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this a lot because it doesn't break me out, and feels moisturizing. However, from its ingredient list I can see it's still a chemical sunscreen. Once I reapplied to my face, it seems to sting just a little bit -- not bad sting but just like other chemical sunscreens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer both as a sunscreen protector and a moisturizing cream with my makeup. I was very pleased that it did not leave an oily feeling. It was smooth and light weight. I have a very pale colored skin. So I felt it did as advertised as far as protecting me from UV sun exposure. I was very pleased with this product as I usually am with Neutrogena products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Read the ingredients. Was told that oxybenzone was an ingredient one should avoid in sunscreens. Still used the product in order to do a review. It was hard to spread it out on the face. Had to keep rubbing to sink in. Smell was decent. Would love if the oxybenzone was taken out and still provided the same benefits. Love the high spf of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i love the texture of this sunscreen...it goes on easily without leaving any film on my skin or any whitish cast. it also leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized while im protected with a 50 spf sunscreen. im very happy with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It clogged my pores up to the point were my face broke out. I loved that it had SPF in it but maybe that is what made my skin break out. I used it also under my makeup and my makeup went on nicely and smooth. I've used it alone and it made my skin super irritated. I have sensitive skin as it is but my face doesn't breakout easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that this moisturizer is so high in SPF! I am super fair skinned with red hair and I burn very easily. I like knowing that I am protected from burns and also aging. I would give it 5 stars if it was more moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Neutrogena® Healthy Defense® Daily Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Sunscreen is a high quality product. I am usually nervous about applying sunscreen to my face but this product was extremely lightweight, absorbed almost upon contact and did NOT clog my pores. I was able to easily apply my makeup directly over it which was a huge plus! I felt confident that my skin was protected without compromising my normal routine.

"This tinted moisturizer is an EXCELLENT product. I have used it for years and continue to get complements on my complexion. I've tried other products (like Neutrogena BB cream), but nothing is as sheer, moisturizing, protective, and with the perfect light tint for my skin color. NEUTROGENA, ARE YOU LISTENING? WE WANT IT RETURNED TO PRODUCTION. WE WILL BUY IT."
"What Committee of Mostly Men discontinued this extremely excellent product? Sorry, but I dare the people in Marketing or R&D to read ALL the polite requests/pleadings/demands, which are being studiously ignored by you, to bring back this excellent product. I just bought 8 boxes/tubes online, staving off the time when I'll never get to use it again. UNLESS, of course, you do the unexpected and listen to your customers and BRING BACK THE LIGHT TINT SPF 30 HEALTHY DEFENSE."
"Love Healthy Defense, but with the light tint. Which I can no longer find. There is no other product out there that is so light and with just the right tint. Been using it for many years, and I know it was discontinued once before, and then brought back. Now it is discontinued again!"
I agree with the other reviews. Please bring the daily moisturizer with light tint back. I have been searching locally and online which is what brought me to this site only to see that others are having the same issue. Please consider bringing it back.
I have used this product for years as my daytime makeup and now I can't find the light tint version. Your description on the website says available in untinted and light tint but no options at checkout. Please bring back the LIGHT TINT if you are not offering it anymore. Like product but won't buy untinted as that does not fit my needs. Can't recommend product minus light tint but love the tint version.
"I have just started looking everywhere for the tinted moisturize and found out it has been discontinued. Why?It was perfect for my face, with or without make-up. I have used this for years. I even recommended it to my sister and she loves it. I'm not taking any chances on the BB cream, since there are so many bad reviews on this product. Please bring it back!"
"I have used this product for so many years I have lost count! I have recommended it to countless females over the years that have approached me asking me what skin care I use. I have not been able to find it anywhere! I have your BB cream and there is simply NO comparison! It is too thick and make-up looking. In fact, I am now searching for a replacement brand."
Please please bring back Healthy Defense with light tint. I've tried your BB cream but its too thick and fake looking. The light tint moisturizer has always worked perfectly for my skin type. It's very natural looking with just that bit of coverage and the SPF is a bonus. I look way better with this stuff on!
"The Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 changed formulas and I am not happy with the new helioplex formula at all. It has a strange smell, feels very greasy and my face stings when I apply it. I loved the old formula and I am very disappointed with the new formula."
"I've tried unsuccessfully to replace your light tint moisturizer and there is literally nothing else out there that gives the natural shine, color and sun protection. I have no idea why you discontinued this product. I'm with everyone else--PLEASE BRING IT BACK."
I have been using Healthy Defense Lightly Tinted Moisturizer for MANY years. Now I can't find it anywhere. I am down to the end of my last tube and i wear it every day. I really hope you have not discontinued this product. or I will have to switch brands which I don't want to do. I have used Neutrogena products for many years. .I really love this product and am extremely disappointed that it is no longer available. I've tried the BB cream and it's too thick.
"Long time customer of this product. Have tried others, both from Neutrogena and other companies, and NOTHING ELSE COMPARES. Light tint is perfect for those of us who want sun protection and don't wear makeup. Please listen to your customers and bring back one of the most popular products in your line. Thank you."
Every time I use a product of yours with a tint you discontinue it. Are you creating a new tint product? I love Neutrogena products but I am afraid to try new because they end up going away. Do I go to another manufacturer? Please let us know what is going on. #onmylasttube
"Why, why would you discontinue Light Tint? I have used it for years as my only make-up. I am over 70 and people always compliment me on my beautiful skin. Tried BB and CC and it looks like paste. So angry that I will no longer use any Nutragena products."
"I have used this product in the tinted version for about ten or more years. I use it in place of foundation . I was very disappointed when I needed to get another tube and it was not available. Your site ad says it is available, but I couldn't find a way to select it to order on line."
"I love this product, (Healthy Defense daily moisturizer SPF 30, Light Tint), which I have been using for at least 10 years. I spend much time in Greece, & I always stocked up on it when in the States. Now, however, I asked my son to bring me some, & he can't find it anywhere. I wouldn't bother to write this when reviews are so overwhelmingly positive, but if you are discontinuing it I hope that the sheer number of disgruntled customers will cause you to reconsider!"
"I've used this product for over 10 years and it is wonderful. I have tried other products including your B&B cream. Not comparable! Please bring it back. I love the creamy, natural feel and the glow it gives my skin. I hope you consider bringing back this great moisturizer. Thank-you"
I am a 68 year old man with fair skin. I used Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer Light Tint for the last year. This product was the best. I looked 10 years younger using the product. Nothing on the market can replace it. Jane from Phoenix is right. Ed S. New Jersey
"I have had melanoma skin cancer and also am very concerned about wrinkles. I first bought this product for sun protection, but realized it has made my face and neck smoother, more hydrated and less wrinkled. I have used just about everything, and this tops my chart. Works great under makeup also!"
"I have been using the HD light tint for many years as I have rosacea and this shade evens out my skin tone without clogging my pores or looking made up. I am now down to my last tube. I have been shown the new ""light to fair"" moisturizer cream and the tone is too light and the texture too thick and make up looking. Please bring it back, STAT."
"I have been using this product for years , have recommended it to countless friends -- and have searched for it from East to west coast... I have tried two different shades of BB visibly even - no comparison with Healthy Defense light tint. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!"
"WHY, WHY, WHY?!? There is no other product like this, and so many of us have told you that we want it back! I use it once or twice a day, feel naked without it, and wish I had known before it disappeared off the shelves, so I could've stocked up! PLEASE listen to your devoted customers and bring it, or similiar tinted moisturizer with SPF protection, back!! THANK YOU!"
"I have used this product for at least 5 years. I love it. Please make this available again. It is an excellent product. I have tried other moisturizers in your line as well as competiitive brands. Nothing is as good. It is light and creamy with a little tint. I love the UVA/UVB protection, also. I can't find it anywhere. Why did you discontinue this?"
Please bring back Healthy Defense moisturizer SPF 30 light tint. This is a product that I talked about to all my friends and now cannot find it anywhere. This product gave good coverage provided just enough color and it went on so smoothly. Did you discontinue it?
"This daily moisturizer with tint is the best for smooth, lightly tinted facial skin. Why on earth would it be discontinued?? Have used it and recommended it to many of my friends who started using it, also. ALL makeup dwells in the crevices, dries out the complexion even with moisturizer so this product was a jewel. Bring it back!!"
"Loved this product, have been using it for at least 10 years. Use to use the dark tint and you stopped making it and then started using the light tint. Last time I bought 2 and still have some left. I like it because it is fragrance free and gives my face a nice glow. Please bring it back!"
"I have been using this for years!! I can't find it anywhere! I have tried the BB as well as a couple of others and I don't like them. This moisturizer is light, not greasy, yet moisturizers my very dry skin. The color is perfect, most others are too yellow. The other products also make me break out. I am 51 years old and don't want to deal with acne at this age!! BRING IT BACK ....."
"This product gives my skin a healthy, younger look - when I use the tinted. I particularly like the smooth way it goes on and the fact that it lasts all day while also giving me sun protection. So many prefer the tinted, why is it not more available - if at all?"
"It is the best moisturizer and I love that it gives me a subtle hint of color. I tried the BB cream, but it's too heavy and I don't want to wear something that feels like makeup. I won't be buying the regular moisturizer because I don't want to have to buy 2 products (moisturizer and something else tinted), so I'm going to have to switch to another brand if you don't bring back the light tint. So sad."
This moisturizer with a light tint was perfect for me. I don't like anything else that I've tried as well as the Healthy Defense spf30 w/light tint. Please bring it back or consider a light tint option to another one of your moisturizer/sunscreen products.
"I have used this product, both tinted and untinted, for many years. In the summertime untinted is fine but I like a little color in the winter."
Now I have to look elsewhere to find a winter-use tinted moisturizer.
Why did you cease making the tinted Healthy Defense moisturizer?
"I have used the tinted version of Healthy Moisturizer for years - although often having a hard time locating it - and am so disappointed in is no longer manufactured. Neutrogena's BB cream is better than other BB creams I have tried - but still not as good as this product. BBs are all too chalky. Please bring this product back. Great for light coverage and not too heavy in a hot, outdoor climate."
I have been using your Healthy Defense daily moisturizer in light tint and it has been absolutely perfect !!! Nothing else works as well or looks as good. I am 72 and desperately want to be able to keep using this but can't find it anywhere. There is nothing else anywhere that does as good a job at both moisturizing and generally making my skin look fresh and dewy. Please bring it back for faithful users.
Please reevaluate discontinuing this product. Since I have been unable to find it in stores I have wasted so much money on other brands and have been continuously broken out on my face. I have also tried your bb cream and was not happy with it either.
"After searching empty store shelves for months, I finally looked online to discover to my horror that this product is discontinued! Why?? I have used this product for years and have found nothing as a suitable substitute. I resorted to trying BB cream, which is too thick and has an unpleasant odor. Looks like no more Neutrogena for me... :-("
I love Healthy Defense and have been using it for many years. It was recommended by my dermatologist because it was a great moisturizer with sun protection and an extra bonus of nice tint. Hassel free. A win! Please bring it back. I use several of your products because I do see great results and because of my dermatologist recommendation. Thank You.
"When it was available with ""light tint"" this was my go to product. Now you have me looking for another daily moisturizer with suncreen and a light tint. Please bring back a tinted version of this product and notify your loyal customers when it is available again."
I have been using Neutrogena products for several decades. The Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 - LIGHT TINT was my all time favorite. Please consider manufacturing the item again. I have not found a comparable Neutrogena product or competitor product to replace the HD Daily Moisturizer with LIGHT TINT. I am confident many Neutrogena users would agree it was a terrific product.
"What happened to the Healthy Defense Light Tint? I've been looking all over for it in drugstores, and no one has it. There's nothing else like it on the market, and it's all I ever used. Please, don't tell me you've discontinued it! And if so, why on earth would you discontinue such a popular product?"
"I also have used the Light Tint moisturizer for many, many years. It seems unfair that you pulled this off the market & now left so many people unhappy. I do not like your BB tinted moisturizer. I returned it. I sure hope you do a ""turn around"" & bring this product back to those who were loyal customers & loved it."
I have been searching all over to find the Healthy Defense Light Tint everywhere. Isn't this the second time you took it off the shelves? You can see from the responses that we want and will buy this product. I don't like the new visibly even BB cream. It doesn't blend well and the shade is off. Please bring it back!
"I have been using this product under my makeup everyday for over a year . I originally tried your helioplex moisturizers and kept developing a rash but the sensitive skin has caused none of these issues. I am having trouble finding it in stores recently, please tell me you haven't discontinued it."
I purchased this product hoping to help my skin be protected from sun and dryness. Unfortunately I broke out in a rash and it left my skin very dry. Although I do have sensitive skin Oxybenzone is known to cause an allergic reaction and I have read further that it may be linked to skin cancer. Just be aware of ingredients before you begin to put something on your skin!!
"I've been using this Healthy Defense moisturizer for at least a year now and it has been great at protecting my skin from normal daily sun exposure. It works well under mineral foundation as well as liquid foundation. By itself, it does not leave a white cast residue on my face. It leaves my skin dewy-looking. I wish I knew what the PA rating of it is though. Is it PA+++??"
"I have been using this Healthy Defense Moisturizer for many years. I love that it covers some of my imperfections but is not so heavy that it doesn't clog my skin, reducing breakouts on my 40+ year old sensitive skin. And it has sunscreen to protect my skin from the sun. Please Bring It Back!"
"For spunky old gals like me, this is THE BEST stuff! Do I wish I still had the dewey skin I had in my 20's, you bet!! But I don't. And this is the next best thing for me.I am 60, and I'm far to old to change my ways and start wearing make-up. This product covers the major flaws of my skin, feels like it's not even there, yet adds just that extra touch I need. I cannot, will not wear a full blown foundation. I'm buying this is bulk."
"Loved this moisturizer! After searching unsuccessfully every store for the Healthy Defense with light tint, I finally tried the NEUTROGENA BB cream recommended as a replacement. I have to admit I am not a big fan of that one. After several uses I started breaking out. Now I am back on my search for the right moisturizer with tint. Please bring back the Healthy Defense with light tint!!!!!"
I have very fair skin and the light tint is a wonderful product to even out my skin when I don't want to wear much makeup. It is also wonderful when I use along with foundation by adding depth to my fair skin and keeping the foundation from looking fake.
"I agree with all of the other reviewers. I hate when you find a really good product, and it gets discontinued. I also have not been able to find a comparable product to replace it. If you truly value the opinions of your customers you will bring this back to your product line."
"I've used Neutrogena moisturizers for decades, it works so well with combination skin. I appreciate the sunscreen and especially like the light tint formula, which I can't find anywhere. Please bring it back! I've tried your tinted BB moisturizers but they're too heavy. Healthy Defense with sunscreen and light tint is PERFECT for warm weather wear."
"Oh no!!! Going into summer time and can't find my light tint moisturizer! Is it true you have discontinued it? Please bring it back!!!! Been using it for 10+ years and cannot imagine not having it. It is light, just the right shade, and non greasy. Need this!!!"
"I have sworn by this tinted moisturizer since it came in Medium to Dark many years ago. It's perfect because its super hydrating (I have very dry skin) and very light. I have frantically checked drug stores in whatever city I'm in and no luck :( I've tried other prducts but nothing compares. I will spend good money for my skin products and that was the best part about this moisturizer, it was SO affordable! Neutrogena PLEASE bring this product back!"
Can't seem to find it anywhere. Please bring it back. It belongs with all of your other fine products.i I've been forced to purchase a competitor's moisturizer. Tried your BB moisturizer but it doesn't have the same consistency and the color is not as compatible with my skin tone.
"I've been searching all over for the Healthy Defense light tint only to find out it has been discontinued. The beauty of this product was that I didn't have to wear foundation. I tried the BB cream but it's too thick. Why did you discontinue it? Please bring it back!,"
I spent the day driving around the Twin Cities metro area looking for Healthy Defense with a tint. Why would you get rid of such a great product? It gives my skin a bit of color while helping maintain the daily moisture I need. Please reconsider bringing it back to those of us who didn't think we needed to stock up!
"I am allergic to the strong chemicals used in sunscreens. After a melanoma surgery, my dermatologist gave me a sample of Healthy Defense with zinc oxide. I have used it ever since and appreciate the knowledge that my eyes won't swell up from using this product and that it protects my face and neck from the sun."
"I was skeptical that this product would moisturize my 71-year-old skin. I knew it would protect me from the sun but moisturize all day? Having used it for about 3 weeks I can now say, ""Yes it does."" It is a very good moisturizer lasts all day. It is very gentle on my extra sensitive skin as well. It is better than products costing 2 to 3 times as much. It is a real value."
"Just had a dermatological skin peel to remove skin cancer precursors, caused by sun damage. Because of sensitive skin I already use a shaving balm, and I wanted something to use on my whole face and ears, not just my shaving area. The Health Defense seems to be ideal. Goes on well, not greasy, and makes my skin feel good. My skin looks good, at 69 for someone who has eczema and dry skin , this is outstanding. No perfume, easy application, no greasiness, and a SPF of 50, it's terrific!"
I bought up as many bottles as I could when I heard this was being discontinued. I am down to my last bottle and I am beyond disappointed that I can no longer get this. Please bring it back - it seriously was the only thing I used. Never had a need for makeup and my skin was so healthy!! please bring it back!!!!
I'm so sad - please please reconsider your decision not to offer the healthy defense tinted moisturizer. I used light tint and it was the ONLY product that matched my skin tone and protected my skin as only Neutrogena products can. What can we do/say to get you to start offering that product again - and who has a secret stash that I can contact?!
I love the Healthy Defense daily moisturizer SPF30 WITH the tint. That little bit of tint covers uneven blotches and makes the skin look so much smoother and a gives a healthy glow. I didn't know it was discontinued until I came looking on line to buy it because I couldn't find it in any stores. Great..... Now what..........?
This is the only moisturizer I want to use on my face. Have been using consistently for several years. I'm allergic to chemical sunscreen and this is one of the few that has a physical sunscreen and it doesn't cause a reaction of any kind. My dermatologist recommended it. Please continue to make this.
"Like the previous reviewer I am really crossing my fingers that this product isn't being discontinued or changed. (Please don't change it!!) It is perfect for my sensitive skin and has really helped keep my skin even and bright. Please, Neutrogena, keep making this product forever!"
"I have been using this product religiously for several years now. I am super allergic to any of the helioplex products, but this version is perfect. Goes on smoothly and easily, I have no issues with my skin absorbing the lotion fully. It is an excellent daily sunscreen protection without being oily or heavy. I have not been able to find this in stores in my area. I was hoping to order direct from your site, but see that it is out of stock. Please please please don't stop offering this product."
"I have used Neutrogena products for 30 years. Finding products that do not irritate my highly sensitive, extremely fair skin is difficult. The Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with light tint is perfect as I need color and something that will not irritate my skin. I have used the untinted but as I am so fair, I need the color. PLEASE bring it back!"
"Please, please bring back Healthy Defense Moisturizer with Light Tint. It is the best!!! I finally gave in after months of searching for it and tried the BB Cream and I was so disappointed. I can't tolerate the smell and it is nothing like the Healthy Defense with Tint. I can't find a similar product anywhere. Can you please consider putting it back on the market?"
"I have been using this product with light tint for years. I like the light tint in lieu of foundation. But now it has disappeared from shelves. I have never had any irritation from it, but it appears others have. I hope it makes a comeback with the recent bugs worked out."
"I love neutrogena healthy defense. This was recommended by my dermatologist and I have been using it ever since. I put it on every morning before leaving the house. It's a great moisturizer and does NOT feel greasy at all. I spend a lot of time outside so I love that it has an SPF of 30, but doesn't have that sunscreen at the beach smell. I have been using this product for the past 6 years!"
"I have tried everysingle sunscreen out in the market and they ALWAYS break me out. I suffer from severley oily skin and cystic acne. I'am on Clyndamicin, Retin-A, and 10% Benzoyl Peroxide! So I need something that will not irritate with chemicals and will not break me out, this sunscreen has been my life saver! PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. My mother and I both use this and she sufferes from really dry skin, she loves it as well!"
Love this light weight moisturizer. Great for my sensitive skin. No breakouts! Not heavy. I use it everyday before my make up goes on and it's been wonderful. Couldn't find it anywhere but on line for the past month. Hope it's just a demand shortage and not discontinuing it!
"This moisturizer is great: it has the right kind of sunscreen, it moisturizes, it's not greasy or heavy. This product doesn't have octinoxate and it's a chemically stable sunscreen. That's what Helioplex means. It's non-greasy and my skin is perfectly moisturized. My foundation goes on top of it well."
"I have been using this product for any years and have been delighted with the results. I am a redhead with very fair skin and have had no problems. My only concern is the articles I have been reading about the SPF ingredients such as avobenzone, octinoxate and most of all oxybenzone which are all contained in Healthy Defense Moisturizer. What are you doing about these ingredients?"
"I have used this for 5+ years and have been unable to find it in any stores. After reading another review, I learned that it has been discontinued. Please bring it back! I loved the tint and 30 SPF sunscreen, plus the level of moisture is perfect for daily use."
I have been using the Light Tint - Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer for several years and can no longer find it in stores or on-line. Please bring it back! There are no other products that even come close to it for pleasing coverage and sun safety. So disappointed it's been discontinued. Please bring it back!
i used the Healthy Defense Moisturizer with light tint and was vert happy with the results. In the winter it was nice to use it and made me look like I had a some tan. I can no longer fine this item in our drug stores in Canada. I would use this moisturizer every day in the winter aand used the one with no tint all summer. All my skin products are neutrogena.
"Great moisturizer to use any time of the year! Living in Wisconsin, we get weather of all kinds. So, several years ago a dermatologist recommended this moisturizer and I have used it ever since! The light tint version was my choice, but now that I can't find it anywhere, I have to switch! When will it be back???"
I have tried tons of facial moisturizers with sunscreen. It works just as good as all the expensive equivalents. I have acne prone skin and recommend this product if you are looking for a good sunscreen/sunblock for the face. It has recently become more difficult to find this product in the stores :(
DISCONTINUED??? I switched to this formula of yours after you discontinued the Oil Free Moisturizet that was tinted. The other that you sell is wayyyy to heavy for my skin and the color is awful! Had I known this would have been discontinued I would have stock piled!! Please bring it back!!!!!!
"Tinted version is the best product I have ever used (for years and years) and now I can't find it anywhere. The BB cream is too thick, too heavy, and too light in color. I've tried mixing the 2 products, but it's not quite the same and eventually I'll run out of the Healthy Defense and will have to go looking for a replacement. The light tinted Healthy Defense is/was perfect! Bring it back!!!"
"I LOVE this product. The tinted version gives my aging skin a subtle, healthy glow that I CANNOT get with anything else. Other tinted products (including Neutrogena BB Cream) make my skin look like a death mask. HELP! Keep it in stock. PLEASE, PLEASE!"
"This is my favorite moisturizer for my face! I have oily, acne prone skin, and this didn't break me out or make shiny. You only need a little bit and the tube will last for around 6 months. I use this twice daily and whenever I need SPF, as this is one of the few SPF containing products that won't break me out."
"I'm an African American woman whose skin get's super oily in the summer. As my skin matures (I turn 30 this year) it is definitely changing. I have been searching for a daily moisturizer with SPF in it that will not break me out and that is NOT greasy. I've tried Aveeno, Oil of Olay, but I think I have found my preferred favorite in this Neutrogena product. Funny thing is Neutrogena face washes break me out, but their moisturizers are EXCELLENT. Wish I got more product for my $, but I still love the product."
"I got this product for the first time in 30 SPF a few months ago, but ran out, so I decided to try other moisturizers from different brands, and I can say that no other moisturizer compares to this, I just bought and new bottle a couple of days ago. Sticking with you Neutrogena!"
I have used this tinted moisturizer/sunscreen as my make-up for a couple of years now and find I like it so much better than regular make-up. I am in my fifties and prefer the sheer coverage. Please don't stop making this product. I can't find it any more where I shop in Minnesota and would very much appreciate you making this available again. Thank you. Candy
"I was guilty of not putting sunscreen lotion on my exposed body parts because they were all greasy or smelled bad and I would not go to work like that but would only wear sunscreen if doing outdoor Leisure activity. Since I found this I put it on all of my exposed body parts everyday and love the fact that I don't have to separately use a moisturizer. It absorbs fast, has little to no smell, and makes my skin feel great while protecting it. My only complaint is that it does not come in a larger size container!"
"I have acne prone skin and was looking for some light moisturizer with SPF that works under make up. Sadly this broke me out and it was a bit oily on my skin. I think this works better in someone with dry skin that doesn't have acne, because it works well under makeup."
"Used this product for the longest time and it is the best. Unfortunately, I see you have discontinued this product. Please bring it back on the shelves. No other product compares to it. It gives the right amount of tint coverage, moisturizes and provides SPF30 sunscreen coverage for me. Hope Neutrogena can reconsider and bring it back!"
I agree with the reviews to bring back the product with the light tint. I bought every tube i could find. I am now out of the product. I love the light tint and use instead of foundation because it matches my complexion so well. Please consider bringing back. Thank you
"I used the light tint version of this for years and years it was my go to for every day wear and I hardly needed anything else, the perfect amount of coverage to blur red spots and protect my skin from the Southern California sun with SPF. I'm so disappointed that it has been discontinued when so many people liked it. Please bring it back!!"
"I love this moisturizer a lot. For starters, it has a higher SPF (50) and it is great for sun protection. The lotion is creamy, smooth and absorbs easily and quickly into my face. The best part is it leaves no white residue and it is great to use under makeup. The only flaw with this is it has no or minimal antioxidant, which is so beneficial to the skin. Since it is a physical block, it is safe to use around the eyes and never burns."
I've used this product for over 5 years and it works great. I never have to worry about having my sunscreen on my face after moisturizing in the morning. I no longer can buy it in my area and was hoping to buy it directly from you. Have you discontinued it?
This product has been my go-to moisturizer for 10 plus years. Gives my face that fresh outdoor-look year round. Love how it makes my skin look and feel. Lots of compliments. So WHY discontinue a GREAT product? Noticed many similar comments online. Also noticed that only product complainants received feedback from company. Comments and pleas from loyal customers go without company reaction. I would pay DOUBLE the price to bring back HD tinted moisturizer. Listen to your customers!
There is no other moisturizer out there with light tint that doesn't break me out or hurt my skin. It protects me from the sun and keeps me from looking like a white ghost. I wouldn't think of using anything else. It's perfect. Why would you discard it? I beg you to bring it back!
"I have been using the tinted version of ""Healthy Defense"" for many years and there is no product I can find to replace it. Please, please put it back on the shelves. I purchased the replacement recommended to me by the vendor and it does not do the trick. Now I'm stuck with 2 tubes of an inferior product."
"First you got rid of the light tint Oil-Free Moisture, and now I can't find the Healthy Defense with light tint. Please, please bring it back! It is light enough that I don't feel like I'm wearing a mask, keeps my skin moisturized, and the tint was perfect."
"I started using this product this year when my doctor recommended a SPF. It works really good under your make-up and is a great base/primer. It does't have a smell which i like because i was scared it was going to have that strong sunscreen smell. The only bad thing i have to say about this is that it's very expensive. The bottle is very small, but lasts you a good amount of time. I used it every day for a year and just ran out. (You only need a little bit or your face will be oily). I will for sure be buying another bottle of this."
"I started using this product around a year ago and haven't looked back since. The smell isn't overpowering and it applies beautifully. It reduces the redness on my face (a good thing) and I keep on getting compliments on how beautiful my skin looks because of this lotion! The high SPF is another BIG plus, and I love that Neutrogena now has a Purescreen as an option instead of Helioplex (which irritated my skin)."
"I have used the light tint moisture for several years and have been so pleased. It is my moisturizer, make-up and sunscreen...all in one. If I want more coverage, I just mix my foundation with it and it just glides on more smoothly and evenly. Great product....Never change the formula."
I agree with prior post. Please bring back tinted moisturizer. I never wear face makeup but I wear this and it looks so natural. I had ordered 3 boxes the last time I ordered it and I would have ordered more if I knew it would be discontinued. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!
I have been wearing this light tint moisturizer for over 20 years. I absolutely love it. There isn't a lot I can wear because of sensitive skin but this has always worked for me. Several years ago I had a hard time finding this in the store but finally found it on line. Please bring it back!!!
I have been using this product for several years and have looked everywhere but assume it is now discontinued? So sorry if that is the case....such a great product with just the right amount of tint and it doesn't irritate my skin. I have tried other products but can't use anything but Healthy Defense with Sunscreen Light Tint.
Please consider bringing it back.
I am an Octogenarian from Long Island and have used your Healthy Defense SPF30-light tint for about one year. I was sorry that I had not found out about it earlier. Now to my great chagrin I find that it is not available any more. Please do an old lady a favor and bring it back! Would you?
Thank you.
I have been using the light tint version of this product for years. I use it daily. The Neutrogena BB tinted cream is HORRIBLE compared to this. Thank goodness i have old tubes that I've been able to eek out some cream from by cutting off the top. NOTHING compares to the light tint version of this cream. You should really listen to what your customers want and give them a great experience with your product and bring back the tinted version. Clearly there is customer demand for this based on these reviews.
"Please let me know where the light tinted Healthy Defense Moisturizer can be ordered or purchased at pharmacy. It seems from the reviews I read that many are requesting this. It is unclear if it is no longer being made, if not, please bring it back. I have used this product for many years. There is nothing else like it. If I could I would order several at one time. Thanks, Consumer from Boston"
I have been using the lightly tinted version of this sunscreen for years! I use it twice a day! I am so disappointed it is discontinued. I really hope you bring it back so I don't have to switch brands. I have 2 teenage daughters that use it too! I tried the new tinted BB cream and it is too thick and makes my skin dry! I don't like it at all.
Why is this product discontinued? I've been using this product for many years. It looks great & it doesn't disagree with my skin by breaking it out. Since the moisturizer is discontinued I tried the BB stuff. I used it once & my skin broke out. So I will be looking for another moisturizer with light tint.
"I was recommended this by my dermotologist. It not only has a great SPF factor to protect my skin from additional sun damage, but I have found my skin to be softer and smoother. I was using an expensive line of skin care prior to this. I plan to switch all to neutrogena."
"My husband, adult son, and I all use this moisturizer. It was approved by my dermatologist. If I were use any other daily moisturizer with SPF it would be the one sold at my derm's office but that one is extremely pricey. I'll happily stick to this one. We all love it."
I miss Neutrogena's Healthy Defense “lightly tinted” moisturizer with spf 30.
Please consider bringing it back. Must know 5-6 other friends who agree with me. Such a great product....sort of kills two birds with one stone.....lovely tinted moisturizer and sun screen
"I bought this product a month ago due to the SPF and being that is Neutrogena, i usually use the oil free sensitive moisturizer but decided to go with this one. Worse mistake! I am 37 years old and never had acne ever since i started using this product my face is a disaster, i get a huge red painful pimples and very dry skin. Do not buy this product!"
"I have sensitive teen skin and this is perfect. My skin feels all nice and soft, and the SPF is really great so I don't have to worry about adding another product to my skincare routine! I use it about 2 times every day. My only complaint would be that the price is kinda high for the 1.7 ounces you get."
"PLEASE bring back the light tinted version! My teenage daughters and I use it instead of using makeup. We live in Colorado and with the active lifestyle we have, we don't wear foundation, we wore the tinted version instead. I purchased Visibly Even and tried it and don't like it at all! I came to your site today to order it online, but it looks like I will have to look to other brands if you don't start carrying it again."
i've used this product with the light tint for years and it is my favorite daily skincare product. But the tint was key as it gave a healthy glow in the winter and summer - made me more likely not to forget to put it on. I bought two tubes of it from an online source earlier this year and am running out and can't get it now. I don't want to search out a replacement brand because I LOVE this product. Please bring it back.
"I'm so sad. Where did the tinted moisturizer go? It is the perfect product. I am destroying the bottle trying to get the last drops out of the container I have. The Visibly Even tinted stuff is not the same, not better, not worth it. Please, PLEASE return to us the magic tinted moisturizer!"
"I have been using the light tint moisturizer for years and love it. The new tinted BB cream looks terrible on my skin. The other one worked so well, I have turned several friends on to it and have not found anything else that I like as much. DO NOT DISCONTINUE IT! Thank you - happy skin"
"Where is this product. I just love it and can't find any. I am lost without it. If you stopped making it please bring it back. The color was prefect for my skin. I tried using your new product, visibly even BB cream with a light to medium color. It is not even close to the color that matched my skin like the original. I will be taking this back. Please let me know what's going on before I switch products. Thank you, Jan"
"I have been using Heathy Defense for at least 15 years. When you reach the age of 78, and your Dermatologist's, other MD's, family and friends constantly ask you ""what do you use on your skin? You look fabulous!!"" - you know you are on to something good so you share the news. I am really sad that you have stopped making 'Light Tint' as it became my favorite once I hit 70. Please bring it back. Other brands just don't compare!!"
Works better than any moisturizer I have ever used and I am very big on what I use to make my face look as good as possible! Totally recommend it if you have ever had a problem with any other moisturizer. My skin is the softest it's been in a long time and the moisturizer has a awesome scent!
"The reason I prefer this to other products is that it does not rub off on my clothes or car, and is broad spectrum and fragrance free. I have sensitive skin and sensitivity to chemicals including fragrance. I use this product especially on my arms for going out in the Florida sunshine. Higher SPF Neutrogena products and products from other manufacturers leave residue on my clothes and things I touch!"
"I always look for moisturizers with SPF and this one had spf 30 which i was really excited about! Usually i can only find good moisturizers with spf 15. This moisturizer is awesome, it does not make my skin oily and rally hydrates my skin. It does not make me breakout and i am so happy i bought this! On a side note, I use the non-tinted kind if you are curious."
"I have very sensitive skin, I am African-American, and I am a melanoma survivor. As you can imagine, an effective sunscreen is a must. This product meets all of my requirements with flying colors. I don't burn, period. It blends in very well (no 'chalky' look) and I have not had any reaction (rashes, etc) whatsoever. I hope it's not on sale because it's being disccontinued! I have tried many, many sunscreen products, but this is the only one I'll use."
This moisturizer/sunscreen never makes my face feel oily or clogs my pores. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I have used very expensive sunscreens that didn't work as well and made my skin sting. This product does what it says it will and is affordable so I'm not afraid to use the amount that I should without thinking about how money I'm slathering on my skin.
This is the product I look to everyday for protection from the outdoor elements. I have been using this SPF moisturizer for at least three years. I spend a great deal of time outside. I prefer a moisturizer containing sunscreen rather than sunscreen alone. It was first recommended by my dermatologist. I love the silky feel and feel confident that I am protected.
I usually have extremely sensitive skin. I am truly amazed! I did not have an allergic reaction or get any pimples/breakouts. I usually have to be very careful with what I put on my face. I love this product! I highly recommend this one. I have experimented with very expensive creams and department store brands but this product is my favorite!
"I used this four days ago and my face became red, blotchy and very itchy. I have used Neutrogena before but this was the first time with helioplex and unfortunately I had purchased two. My face was on fire for the first two days and now it is still very itchy and scaly. Horrifying. Very disappointed and annoyed. I hope this clears up soon."
"I bought this because I love Neutrogena products and wanted the strong SPF. I used this product two days in a row - my face swelled up to the point of making me unrecognizable - my eyes could barely open, my face had red rashy blotches as well as being dry and tight. After 3 days of antihistamines, the swelling went down and the rash made way for dry flaky skin. Two weeks later, my face is still dry and itchy. I was on a tropical vacation that was ruined due to this product - be sure you try it in small are first."
"After years of using the light tint, I was completley dismayed to learn that it had been discontinued. Being a loyal Neutrogena client, I tried the visibly even and was incredibly disappointed. It's makeup. It's not tinted moisturizer. It doesn't blend in to the skin well. As such, it doesn't look great and it's less efective as a sunblock. PLEASE read the reviews and listen to your clientele. We want the light tint option back."
"This stuff smells awful. Where is the regular one. I have been using the Healthy Defense for years. I was disapointed when you discontinued the white one. Please don't discontinue the one with tint also, you will lose a customer. I have had skin cancer removed from my face and I use the original one everyday. I like the regular one because it doesn't smell like sunscreen. I have tried the newer one with Helioplex and I don't like it."
I have melasma and dry skin so I have to wear sun protection and moisturizer daily. This is the only moisturizer with SPF 50 sunscreen that I have found that I can wear daily that does not irritate my skin. I love how it is lightweight so I can wear it under makeup or alone. I keep a tube in my purse and in my gym bag so I can re-apply it as needed throughout the day.
"After wearing this two days in a row my skin is red, irritated, itchy, and covered in a rash. I am throwing away the rest of the bottle. I usually use the Neutrogena daily facial moisturizer with SPF 15, which I love. I decided to try a higher SPF rating. I am going back to my old moisturizer and will use regular sunscreen if I need higher sun protection on a given day. Also, this product is greasy and smells like sunscreen."
I have sensitive skin and need to choose my skin care regime carefully. I am glad Neutrogena came out with this type of SPF moisturizer. It is easy to apply and does not make my skin break out. I live in a place with hot summers so the SPF50 is a must have. For some reason it makes my skin tone look more even as if I am wearing foundation. Needless to say that I will keep on buying this one.
"I received a sample of the Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer spf 50 from my dermatologist. I absolutely love this product. It makes my face feel so smooth, non-greasy, lets my foundation glide on just perfect and all of the above and protected by the sun too!! I'd recommend this product to all."
"i've used the 30 health defense for over 10 years and found this formulation in the store. since i'm getting older, i thought i could use more sun protection and more wrinkle protection. they've been able to remove most of the sunscreen smell for this formulation and i use it exclusively now, even around my eyes and when exercising and playing sports!"
Have used this product for years. I have livestock and am outside everyday. I use it alone and under makeup. No sunburn and keeps my skin moisturized. I have sensitive skin and have had no problem with this product.. Don't know what I would do without it.
"I bought this product because I was looking for a moisturizer and sunscreen combo. I am typically a huge fan of neutropenia products especially their sunblocks with helioplex. Unfortunately, this moisturizer makes my skin turn red and have a burning sensation. I am pretty disappointed in this product especially considering the standard I expect from neutrogena. Oh well..."
"I'm 40 and want to protect my face from the sun. I have used other products in the past with SPF 30-50 without issue. I tried this Neutrogena product since the brand is most noted for skin care. Within about a week to two weeks, this product caused 3 of the largest and deepest pimples I have ever had in my life that are taking weeks to go away (cystic-type). The only thing I changed in my skin regiment was this moisturizer (I wash my face 2x day and never sleep in my makeup)."
"I've been using Healthy Defense® Daily Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 50 for several years now and just LOVE it! It's my 1st step after washing my face each morning. I allow it to set for about 2 minutes before applying powdered mineral makeup and it stays put all day. I have a t-zone oil issue, but only need 1 small blotting tissue by late afternoon to control it. I HIGHLY recommend this product!"
"This is a decent combo product of moisturizer and sunscreen. It was easy to smooth it over my face and neck and didn't leave any white cast on my medium skin tone. The only thing I didn't like was that it left a thin residue on my face and neck that seem to not absorb as the day went on. I didn't like that it didn't fully absorb into my skin, but it's a nice SPF moisturizer that can get the job done."
"Finally a sunscreen/moisturizer with only titanium dioxide and zinc. All the other sunscreen ingredients made my skin look horrible. Not this one. I have dry, blotchy and sensitive skin. I am also 42 and must use a daily moisturizer. This one does the job, it makes my skin glow and the white stuff evens out my skin tone. My face is protected enough from the sun and I have been getting a lot of compliment on my radiant looking skin."
I picked this up over the summer since it was a combination moisturizer and sunscreen. One thing I like the most is that it didn't sting my eyes when I sweated. Very few products out there that can truly claim this. I've been trying to locate another tube as I have just run out and will keep looking. Have tried [...] without luck now on to [...]. If you can find it definitely try it.
Sad to say that this has caused major problems for my skin. Small whiteheads and irritated spots. Didn't change anything in my skincare routine other than adding this so it is the only thing causing the breakouts and excessive oil. Used for 2 months and skin never adjusted. Don't buy.
"I have dry and sensitive skin, so I decided to try out this moisturizer. I have used other Neutrogena products for years now. It was fine the first day, but the second day I got a horrible reaction from it. It left my skin feeling burnt and in pain. I had a rash that covered my whole face and it took about a week to go away. I had to go to the doctor because the reaction was so bad. I will never again use this moisturizer. Very disappointed I spent money on this product."
"I have been using Healthy Defense Moisturizer for more than a decade. It was originally recommended by a dermatologist who believed that spending a small fortune on department store skincare was a waste of money. It's lightweight, fragrance free, and works beautifully under makeup."

It worked well and is leaving my skin sun burn free and soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this awhile ago. If I use too much of the product it ends up flaking off and clumping. Really annoying! Also gives me a kinda greasy feel.
I used the tinted version of this product for years. It was one of the only moisturizers that wouldn't make me break out horribly and I loved the sun kissed glow it gave me. PLEASE bring it back!!
"Please, please, please bring back the tinted version of this product! I have used the tinted version for years & love it. I don't wear foundation & this was just the perfect moisturizer for achieving a nice sunny glow."
This is the ONLY product I can use and have used for many years.
Have gotten 2 of my sisters to use it also.
PLEASE CONTINUE to provide the light tint version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have been using Neutrogena Healthy Defense Moisturizer LIGHT TINT for years. I love it. The tint is just enough color that no other base is necessary. The moisture is light and just right. Why is it so hard to find to find the tinted version now?
This is the only moisturizer with a light tint in the 30 spf that I have ever used that looked like a real none makeup moistureizer. All of the others are way too heavy. Even Dr. Oz recommended it on his TV show. Why have you discontinued it?
"I am so surprised to see it off the shelves and not on your site. PLEASE BRING IT BACK! Why am I not seeing the customer service team responding back as to why it's gone? Please give us an answer, we're lost without it!! Thanks!"
As others have mentioned please bring back the light tint moisturizer.
I've been using it for years and I haven't found a product that I like as much.
I'm down to my last tube of the light tint version of this moisturizer. I have used this for years and can not find a good substitute! I'll be devastated if it's discontinued for good :-(
"I've used the light tint moisturizer for years. I recently tried the Visibly Even BB cream, but it just isn't the same. I can't understand why you would stop making a product that was so good. Nothing I have found compares!"
I use this product all year long for years. I have very fair skin and need to stay out of the sun. Is there anyway to buy any leftover light tint ones?
I have been using this moisturizer for a few years. The light tint was just the right shade for me. Love this product but I won't buy it without the tint. Please tell me you are still making it and where I can buy it.
I love this product and used it daily as I have for many years. Very disappointed that I can't find it anymore and it has even been out of stock on the Neutrogena website. Obviously discontinued.
"I have never been able to find a product as light in texture with full coverage and perfect color. I am 63 years old and frequently complimented on my complexion...I have used no other product for 20 years and need you to continue making it, please."
"I love this Light Tint. It's the only sunscreen I'm willing to put on my face, and the tint is perfect for me. It makes me look better. I NEED THIS PRODUCT. Please get it back on the shelves soon."
"Why in this world did your company discontinue this product?. I have used this for years, loved the texture and the way it made my face feel and look. Every time a product works someone takes it off the market, I'm very disappointed."
have been using Healthy Defense with spf 30 and light tint for several years. I have tried other brands and they make my skin look pasty! Please bring it back or reply to all the reviews like mine and tell us what is comparable. Thanks
"Bring back the light tint version. I've tried all your other tinted facial moisturizer products and nothing matches this one. It is very lightweight, subtle & avoids the heavier/foundation look of the other products. Please bring it back!!"
"I LOVED Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30, Light Tint. I don't ever wear foundation, but I loved this product! Why would you stop selling it?"
"I'm also asking for the light tint. I bought Visibly Even BB Cream and both of the tints were too light. Had to give them away. Healthy Defense was nice because it was three in one, moisturizer, sunscreen and perfect tint."
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. I HOPE YOU BRING IT BACK BEFORE THE TUBE THAT I HAVE RUNS OUT!
I have used this product for at least 10 years if not longer and I LOVE the light tint version. It is the only product I ever use on my face and I get complements on my complexion all the time. Please bring this back.
Please bring back the lightly tinted healthy defense--i have used forever and it really is one of the best out there! Please bring back--bb cream is not the same.
"I use the Healthy Defense Light tint moisturizer every day and now can't find it. Please bring it back. The new substitutes are terrible, like wearing pancake makeup."
The untinted new Version is just not as good as the light tint one I have come to love. Neutropenia has no good alternative from what I have tried. Please bring back the light tint!
I totally agree with all comments made about the light tint spf 30 Healthy Defense. Have been looking all over for it and I guess its discontinued. DO NOT like the replacement --too heavy.
Have used this product for 2+ yrs. Have hard time finding replacement for the TINT version. Please bring it back so I don't have to keep searching.........
"This product is great, works as a wonderful moisturizing base to even out skin tone (I used it instead of foundation) great product, hope they bring it back!!!"
"I absolutely love the Light Tint Daily Moisturizer and I can't find it anywhere. Nothing else I've tried covers the same or has the same color. Will you be bringing it back (please), or what is your recommended replacement?"
"I love this product and have been using it for years. I use it daily, it provides great sun protection, and even works great for those ""no-makeup"" days! Please, listen to your customers -- we want the Light Tint version available again!!"
Are you listening to your customers??? There is a demand for the Healthy Defense Tinted Daily Moisturizer. BB Cream is not a good substitute - too heavy and unnatural looking.
"I have used Healthy Defense for years and now I can't find it stores or online. Has it been discontinued, if so please bring it back. I have tried other TINTED daily moisturizer but not as good."
"While you no longer sell Healthy Defense Lightly Tint in stores, you could still sell it online. Tried BB cream, my skin does not look as healthy and happy using that product."
"Went through this ""shortage"" a year ago. When the product magically appeared again I bought 5 boxes and ran out a while ago.I want it back.....NOW! Healthy Defense is a great line, just stop playing with it"
I have used this product every day for years. It simplified my mornings and looked good too. I don't understand why it's no longer available when all the product reviews rate it so highly.
I can't find the light tint and I'm so disappointed. I don't wear makeup just my healthy defense.
Please let me know where I can find or what can be used in its place.
"The only ""make up"" I have worn for years is Healthy Defense tinted moisturizer. Keeps my skin soft and protected with just the hint of color I need. I am 72 and do not want to break in a new product.. Or start using 2!"
Where is the daily moisturizer with light tint? The color was perfect for me and I used the product every day! Your new products that have color are not as good. Please bring it back!
"I am sick to discover the LIGHT TINT Healthy Defense moisturizer is discontinued after searching everywhere! Please bring it back, it is my daily staple and it appears the demand is there! What a ridiculous decision to discontinue it!!"
"I've been coping with oily, sensitive, acne prone skin for over thirty years. Recently I was diagnosed with eczema (not fair!) This is the only sunscreen that is soothing to my skin. I hope Neutrogena makes this forever!"
"I need my Neutrogena Healthy Defense Light Tint - please bring it back, I've tried a bunch of other brands since Neutrogena discountinued light tint, and my skin is a mess."
I ordered this product to replace the Daily Moisturizer withTINT that I have used for years and is no longer available. I cannot understand the reasoning behind the discontinuing of that product.
"I have used this product for over 15 years. There is no substitute for it. I am lost without it. I have tried the BB and hate it. I hate to change to another brand, but I might have to. Please bring this back."
I m disappointed that I cannot find this in stores any longer. I have used the tinted moisturizer daily for years at the recommendation of my dermatologist.
Please bring it back!!!!! I have been using for years. I live in Florida and it's a great moisturizer . It absorbs very well in the skin. I wear it all year long.
Cannot find a substitute for the Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with light tint...... please return to your product line up.... Only product that I use year round in South Carolina
"I have used this product w/ light tint for years. I don't like heavy makeup and this has been my go to... Now I can't find the light tint moisturizer anywhere, not even online."
"I love this product and have been using it for years. Please don't discontinue the light tint. I love the look and the feel of this daily moisturizer. Please, please, please!!!!"
I have searched everywhere and can't believe that this product has been discontinued! I loved that this moisturizer had sunscreen and a light tint! I'm not a big makeup wearer so this was perfect for me. Please please bring it back!!!
I have been using this product for 20 Years and I credit it for keeping my complexion looking great at 50. I'm a no makeup kind of girl and Tried the BB cream bus the color is off and it seem to have a drier texture.
This product is great .Please bring it back. I have used this for years and it is the only product that works for me. Why spoil a good thing. BB is too heavy.
I used it every day and my skin feels good all along the day. I used it since I am 20 I am getting a lot of compliments on how my skin looks for my age(45). Good value!
Please return to stock. His product has helped the overall appearance of my skin. I have been using it for years and love that is has sunscreen plus a light tint and moisturizers as well.
Sad to hear that you are going to discontinue this product. I have used the light tint for years and absolutely love the way my skin looks and feels. Please reconsider this decision.
I have used Healthy Defense moisturizer with light tint for years and nothing else works like it. I have tried the BB cream and it is too heavy and the color is off. Please bring back Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with light tint!!!
"I've been using Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with light tint for 10 years, Now I can't find it any where, please continue to manufacturer it! I don't need helioplex- I live in the midwest for goodness sakes!"
"This product has the double effect of moisturizig as well as having sunscreen benefits...I spend many hours everyday outdoors, and I have had great results with the daily use....no dry skin! I especially like the tinted selection. Great product!"
"i have used this for years!! if i tried to substitute with another brand, i wouldn't finish that bottle and would return to neutrogena. has never broken me out. will never switch--excellant product."
"After I put this on my face, I literally look like I've put on a white mud mask. It doesn't get absorbed into the skin. Even after I tried to cover the white film with make up, I still walk around looking like a geisha."
I've been using this product for years and is the only makeup I use on my skin except for blush;I'm 71. Now I cannot find it in the tinted version; other tinted versions likeB&B creams are not the same.
"swear by this stuff and love it. gives me a great looking color and i have spf 30. i bought the cvs generic one and i hope to find that one again. is says ""tinted"" not light not dark just tinted. thats the one i love."
"Only one star because I miss the Light Tint one ! I also tried the Visibly Even Cream, and was very disappointed. No moisturizer compares and gave me the nice, even glow like the Healthy Defense Light Tint one."
I have been using this for many years. I have tried 6 other brands since this disappeared from the store shelves. I do not like any of them and they were all more costly than this. Please bring it back.
Please bring back this product. I have used it for years and love it. I have tried your BB product and it is like wearing paste. Please consider restocking the stores with Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 -- light tint.
"With all my allergies, Healthy defense light tint has been wonderful. It is all I use - I need it back. Tried one of the summer moisturizers and had a reaction so was not pleased."
"I love this product and have used it for years. Please, please, please BRING IT BACK!!! There is nothing else as effective as this, anywhere on the market"
I am so bummed out. Why in the world would you discontinue a product that everyone loves? I can't find anything even close to what the Healthy Defense light tint was like. Please bring it back. Please? Pretty please?
"I,ve been using the light tint for 20 yrs, am 55 years old and get complemented frequently about how nice my skin is and that I don't look my age! I've been buying it on-line the last 2 yrs because I can't find it! Please bring it back!!!!"
"This was the best lotion, the new ""cc"" lotions are thicker and look like foundation. The best part about this lotion is it looked natural with the light and medium tint. Please bring it back!!!!"
"Need a sunscreen every day however I just can't get rid of the ""white"" filmy look especially towards the hair line. Just can't rub it in enough. Friend had the same issue. Also, too thick to wear under make up. Do NOT recommend."
"I've been using this for a year now, and my discoloration spots and overall skin appearance has improved. I get compliments about how ""fresh"" my skin looks...and I credit the healthy glow I get from using this"
"I have searched everywhere for Healthy Defense with light tint. Anything else with tint is too thick. I do not understand why this excellent product was discontinued. I used to use it every morning as my daily moisturizer. So, so disappointed."
"I have used this product for years and have the skin to prove it at the age of 52. I love the ease of sunscreen, tint and moisture all in one. Don't make me look to other product lines. When something works you don't fix it or throw it out.."
"I have been using this product for years and love it. The replacement you have created is not nearly as good. Please bring back the Healthy Defense with a light tint right away! If not, I'm going to buy Clinique or another product."
I have sensitive skin. Not with this product. It gives me just enough color that I don't need a foundation. I hope you do not discontinue producing this product. Where can it be found?
"I am in the sun a lot; mountain biking, trail running, and horseback riding. So, sun protection is very important to me. Healthy Defense applies easily and I look forward to using this product for a very long time."
Just love this product. I have been searching and try different SPF products; finally I FOUND IT...........Thanks Neutrogena. It stays on and protect my face plus the good part when I put my make-up it goes on smoothly. Just luv it!
I have sensitive dry skin and I just love it. It moisturizes skin and keeps it hydrated whole day;. makeup looks very natural and invisible when applied on it. The price is very good for such an amazing quality cream. Thank you Neutrogena !!!
My doctor suggested I purchase a daily moisturizer with sun block and so I chose this one. I use it every day (even in the winter). Great stuff. I wished Neutrogena didn't change the container.
"My dermatologist recommended this product because I spend a lot of time outdoors. I'll be 60 next year and feel very happy with the looks and tone of my skin, thanks to using Healthy Defense. Goes on light and greaseless - a great daily moisturizer."
I loved this product the minute I applied it to my face and neck. It goes on smooth and doesn't leave a residue. Helps with wrinkles and smooths the skin.
"This product is alright alone, but when I applied it under my makeup it made my skin look like a flaky mess! A couple hours later I also felt really greasy and my makeup did not stay on well."
I treat for rosacea and need a product that will both moisturize my skin after treatment and protect from UV. Healty Defense fills the bill! I would recommend this product for its moisturizing and UV protection quaities for anyone.
I have been using the Healthy Defense Medium Tint on my eyelids for almost a decade. I used it as an eyelid primer. I have med-tan olive skin tone and this tint was perfect as a primer with sunscreen. This product was thin enough to be used as a primer and perfect for helping eyeshadow look better and last longer! HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED this was discontinued!!
"I've been using this moisturizer for years and I know it shows. My skin looks very clear from any sun discoloration or age spots at 58. My 4 sisters all have skin discolorations/age spots and we are all close in age. Goes on great. I rarely ever need to wear foundation! Gives the skin a nice dewy appearance. SPF 50! Apply to face, neck and decolletage. This is my go to daily moisturizer and price is excellent on Walmart.com"
"The product works well, but unsure why the tubes received expire in six months."
Best price anywhere is on jet.com.
"This lotion was recommended by my dermatologist years ago, and I've used it everyday since."
I love this product-- highly recommend!!
Bought several tubes of the this product...now cannot read the expiration date on the box or the tube. Why is Neutrogena making it difficult to read this information? Other than the obvious-they want us to spend yet MORE MONEY if there is a question as to it's shelf life.
Unless & until Neutrogena makes the information legible I will be buying Elta MD from my Dermatologist or online.
"I purchased this product in hopes for an inexpensive facial moisturizer with SPF, and Neutrogena has always been a dependable, safe bet for me, but this time I was sorely let down. This product made my face break out into little bumps all over and left it feeling greasy. It was a horrible experience."
"I have normal to dry skin and my skin was never sensitive I don't even usually get pimples, but for some reason this product caused an allergic reaction. I gave it a chance for one week and it just got worst! At first it was only red spots and my face was burning but now my whole face is red and itchy with tiny bumps all over. I should've read the reviews before using this product."
The light tint moisturizer is the only moisturizer I use. It conceals blemishes but you can't tell it is on. Wonderful. Please bring it back!
"I have used this tinted moisturizer for years!! Please, please bring it back!!!! Nothing else compares!"
"WHy is the light tint discontinued? There is nothing else like it on the market. Other brands have similar, but are a thicker consistency."
PLESE bring back the tinted! BB cream way too heavy! So disappointed. Will buy another product . No longer a fan!
it's an awesome product. It is better than any alternatives currently available. Or at least post an explanation of why you would discontinue it.
"I have used the TINTED daily moisturizer for many years and would continue to use it. Like so many others I am hoping you will continue selling it,"
I use your daily defense moisterizer with the light tint everyday I like the way it looks and feels on my skin Could you please bring it back.
i have used this product for over 10 years. I've also tried the BB cream and it doesn't compare. Please bring this back!
why is it you cancel or discontinue the tinted version of this I will never know. but please bring it back..........
"I was looking for a daily skin moisturizer with sunscreen after shaving. When I applied this to my face, it left a white film on my face all day."
I love the healthy defense products but really missing the light tint. It was my go-to product especially in the summer. Please bring it back
I have already switched brands to find something i like as much as the tinted version. I would switch back it the tinted came back.
I've used this product for many years. I have tried the BBB and the no tint and it's not the same. Please bring it back.
I love HD with light tint. Where is it. I can't find it anywhere. If you have discontinued it please bring it back!
"Love this product, using it since I was 28 years old and my skin looks great....now in my 50's. I am hooked!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
"I love the idea of it having ""natural ingredients"" ...BUT it leaves my face with a white tint. I hate to wear it."
"I have the sun protection, it is very smooth to put on and does not make my face white like other products I used. The smell is very fine, decent."
I've been using Healthy Defense light tint moisturizer for many years. Cannot find it now! There's no substitute!
Healthy Defense with a light tint was the best and no other product comes close. Please bring this back.
"This cream provides moisture and softness without clogging my pores, and provides sunscreen benefits too!"
"I had been using only 15 spf in my daily moisturizer. I am so pleased to increase the spf at a reasonable price. I love Neutrogena products,"
"I'm satisfied with how the product absorbs into my skin, is not too heavy, and has no irritating fragrance."
I love this product! I wear it everyday & have it in the chemical formula and it is not as good at all! I am so glad this product exists.
"this doesn't make my skin sting like chemical sunblocks do, and it's light and not greasy. definitely will recommend to friends!"
I feel safe in the sun with this and love the fact that it foes not leave a white film like most sunscreens!
I have been using Healthy Defense since my dermatologist recommended it many years ago. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.
"My mother is 89 years old and had used this product for many years.Do you know how hard it will be to find another product, she will be happy with? Thanks neutrogena"
I have very dry skin so I thought this would work but for some reason when I apply the lotion it pills up or rolls on my face. Any suggestions on how to fix this problem?
"Years ago, a fabulous dermatologist recommended this product. I am so thankful that the Neutrogena website offers it still. Can't find it in the typical stores."
"I have been surprised by my skins reaction to this product. My face looks like every ounce of moisture has been pulled from it. Also it itches. I know it works for some, just wish it had worked for me."
I loved it! I am at an age were i need all the defense I can get this product is perfect! I will purchase more!! Thank you Neutrogena for offering great prices!
"I started using this product at the recommendation of my dermatologist. At first only using on neck & chest area which was fine and didn't cause break-outs like a previous moisturizer. This week started using it on my face also and for about 1-2 hours after application, my face stings & has a burning sensation. Also causes my eyes to sting. Will continue to use on areas other than face but trying an Avon SPF50 product for face."
"I usually buy the men's SPF 30 moisturizer and have been happy with it. Unfortunately, I ran out a few days ago and the store was sold out. No biggie at the time though because I saw this SPF 30 -- great I thought! Well, 3 days later it's all gone. Normally I can expect 1.7 ounces of the air bubble-free men's sunscreen to last me at least two weeks, so I'd have to suggest that over this. No worries ladies, the men's SPF 30 for sensitive skin smells girly anyway and costs half the price!"
I will never use this product again! I purchased this product after calling your help line only to find out you all have discontinued the Light tint. I have used the light tint product for 5 years or more and never had a problem. Now I'm tasked with finding something to heal the skin burns after two uses. My entire hairline is inflamed.
"My skin is not exactly what I call sensitive, nor do I have bad allergies, but I used this for one week and my skin became puffy and red and bumpy. I stopped using it, skipped make up for a few days and had to use hydrocortizone multiple times a day to get rid of the inflammation. That phase is over with, but now my skin is flaky and rough and itchy. I've never had something like this happen before."
"First time using it, my face was burning and reddening after an hour--not good. I do have sensitive skin, but I thought this would be okay since it said it was formulated for sensitive skin. Called consumer line, was cut off during first call (accidentally, I'm sure) so had to go through whole recorded spiel to get through again. Satisfied with eventual response."
"My combination skin is very tempermental. It's been trial and error in finding a moisturizer that can control the oily t-zone, yet not dry the rest of my face out either. My dermatologist recommends this and I love that this is a high spf and great protection from the sun, but it's not for me. Although the dry areas of my skin stay hydrated, my t-zone ends up getting shiny/oily mid-morning. Every once in a while, it also irritates my skin around my eyes and the skin will stay red for an hour or so."
I was recommended this by a dermatologist and started using it 3 days ago. A little goes a VERY long way (so don't be too dissuaded by the price!) My skin is super soft and it has literally been keeping my skin moisturized ALL DAY LONG! I love this product!
I love this product but I am not able to find it any more. Please bring it back!!!
Please bring back the light tint!!! I can't find anything else as good
Dear sweet baby Jesus- bring back the light tint!!
"Bring back Light Tint!!!! It works, so why discontinue it???"
Have been using this with light tint for 20 years. Please bring the light tint back!!!!!!
I've been using Healthy Defense with the light tint for years. Please bring it back.
ditto to ALL the other posts about light tint! Are you ignoring us neutrogena?????
"Have used this product for years. Now cannot find anywhere. Please bring it back, Neutrogena!!"
Pls pls bring back the light tinted moisturizer. Nothing works as well!
This has been my go to forever!! Please bring it back
Please bring back the light tint healthy defense face cream. My husband and I both use it everyday.
I have been using the light tint version for years...please bring it back!!!
I'VE USED IT FOR YEARS BUT I WON'T ANYMORE.... I WANT THE LIGHT TINT PLEASE BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!!
"Love this, my skin feels soft, hydrated and is great even under make-up!"
I love this product with the light tint - I can't find it anywhere though
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO REPLACE THIS WITH!!! ITS THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET!
"Bring back the light tint version back, the new version is terrible."
I have lupus and it has protected my face for years against the sun! (light tint) :( :(
I've used this for years & it's perfect for my skin. Please bring back tinted --- please!!!
I've used the light tint version for 20 years since I was 16. Please please please bring it back.
I used the light tint for years. The new BB product is horrible! Please bring back the light tint.
great for people who don't want to use toxic chemicals on their skin
"I liked the sheer tint with the 30 SPF, but I guess you discontinued. Bring it back."
"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back this moisturizer in ""Light Tint!"" We look like clowns without it!"
"Love this product, after starting to use this, have not used any other facial moisturiser.!"
been using for several years in place of foundation
Love this product. It goes on so smooth and covers great. The replacements are NOT the same.
I have been using for over 15 years. People alwaya remark how great my skin looks.
Please bring back the light tint.i have used it for years and I love the creamy feel.
Every other sunscreen irritates my face - can't find it in many stores - please don't discontinue!
"This moisturizer is not too heavy for the SPF of 50, great for everyday."
I think this is a great product that really works and I definately recommend it!!!
i used this product in the past 4 months and found it to make my skin sticky
My skin feels so good after I put this on. It is so soft and smooth and easy to apply my makeup.
This product is so awesome and it leaves my skin feeling healthy and beautiful
"Smoothes on easily, doesn't irritate skin, and provides sun protection"
A fact: I simply don't leave my house without using my moisturizer with sunscreen. It makes my skin softer and younger and it's not greasy.
I tried the other version and broke out terribly! I can only use the light tint healthy defense. Why would you discontinue?
I love this moisturizer and use it every day. I apply it right after my shower. It helps to protect my skin from sun damage.
I have been using this lotion every day for a really long time. I works very well for me. I never get sunburned when I use this and it keeps my skin moisturized. I hope they never stop making this lotion!
"I have used the other Healthy Defense daily moisturizer and when I bought this one, I had a terrible allergic reaction! The active ingredients are completely different than the other one. It should be labeled differently with a warning!"
I've been using Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer for years and several years ago moved up to the SPF 50 version. My skin feels soft all day and I feel protected from the sun while going about my daily activities.
"I love the light tint daily moisturizer. Its easy to apply, not greasy and absolutely love the light tint. Even though I see it on the website, its very hard to find anymore. Are you still making it? PLEASE DO NOT discontinue this product!!!!!!!!!"
"I hate buying consumables online, but I to buy this. It is the only daily moisturizer with sunscreen that I can wear. Others that I have tried make my skin feel greasy or if my eyes water at all I end up with stinging eyes and running mascara. Please, Walmart, stock this on your shelves!"
"It feels great, I love that it's not sticky. It also doesn't make my face look super greasy. It's my favorite sunscreen so far. I have realize that it's not as sticky or greasy looking because it's actually a moisturizer + sunscreen in one, because I tried the other Neutrogena healthy defense sunscreen that's not a moisturizer and that one is more sticky and thick, but that one is water resistant while this moisturizer one is not, so just something to keep in mind."
I have been using this product for years. Mostly because it is a moisturizer and sunscreen all in one. I put it mostly on my neck/chest area but also on the backs of my hands to prevent age spots from the sun. Sometimes if I'm not going out I use it on my face too instead of makeup.
I went to the store to look for Neutragena daily moisturzier spf 30 with light tint and did not see any. I came across this new product and thought maybe I can try it since the other one was out of stock. I was so disappoint because it gave me a rash from my face all the way down to my chest. I never had a bad reaction like this before. It took over a week for the rashes to go away. I would not recommend this to anyone.
"i tried this 2 different times about month apart and only used it 1 time each and it made my skin extremely dry with scaly patchy flakes and itchy and red. i bought it because usually Neutrogena is a good brand, but something is not right. 1 use and it takes me almost a whole month to get my skin back to where it was. Since i used it on my face it was totally noticeable what happened to everyone"
"I have combo skin and this moisturizes but way too oily. It was worth the price for the spf, but just way too oily for the summer. Still on a search for an spf moisturizer that isn't too oily. Other than that, no complaints about smell or how it feels."
"I Love this product, I just got this two days ago and it has already made my skin better!"
"I am a fan of Neutrogen products, have been using since 1991."
i love this product a lot !!! i have it in 30 SPF it works great my skin feels so soft after wards....
"Goes on light and non greasy. A very good moisturizing lotion, with SPF protection. Much better than regular sunscreen because it is not hot feeling in the humid Florida weather."
This will prevent wrinkles! I have been using for over 20 years. It is creamy and blends well into skin after a shower. It is a sunscreen but good as a moisturizer.
"This is a great moistirizer because it goes on smoothly and makes my makeup go on smoothly too. It also has the sunscreen in the higher number which is great for my fair skin, I use it everyday!"
I bought this product because others made my skin break out. This one worked well and did not cause any bad skin reactions. Also I like the fact this product is not greasy. I would recommend it to others who have sensitive skin.
I've used this product for 2 days and woke up with a badly swollen burning face! I had to take anti histamines for the first time in my life. The pharmacy also recommended cortisone creame for a couple of days. My skin still feels a bit leathery and looks wrinkly from the swelling. I just wanted a good quality sunscreen for my face.
"I used this product for about 4 days and woke up this morning to red blotchy skin, swollen lower eyelids, and peeling skin. I look like a monster, it's so embarrassing. I've never had a problem with any other Neutrogena product but this one is just not good. Many other customers had the same reaction to this product (found many negative reviews on Amazon)."
I have used this product for many years with light tint and I have not been able to find it. Have you stopped producing it with a tint.
My favorite moisturizer.kinda expensive hope they will lessen the price.ive been using this for 5 months.helps my face look young and fresh
This actually feels like a face moisturizer and not sunscreen. I use it daily under my makeup. It's not greasy and absorbs quickly.
"I love this sunscreen. It's light, does not cake on face. I use both, Neutrogena 110 Age Defense and this one to prevent sun damage, dark spots."
"Sunscreen is no longer an extra step. Glad that this combines sunscreen and moisturizer, saves time in the morning"
"The box said it was lightweight, but it feels super heavy and has a greasy finish. It's ok if you put makeup over it, but otherwise I would not recommend this product."
This product used to be available in a tinted version which was wonderful. For months I have not been able to find it tinted although Neutrogena tells me it is just out of stock. Please bring it back as this untinted version is not anywhere as good.
"Have used this for years now. Not too rich or runny and the only one I can find with spf50 at a decent price. Only problem is I have trouble finding it on the shelf at Wal-Mart, so have to order online."
I had previously ordered a very similar moisturizer in a very similar container. But the earlier product was skin tone and thicker. I like it much better.
"I really liked this lotion, but my face became more and more irritated. Now it stings when I put on the lotion and also my regular makeup hurts on the inflamed skin. Ouch."
I bought this because the store was out of the Neutrogena Daily Moisturizer I usually buy. I can't say it's a bad product but I broke out in a rash all over my face and I don't generally have sensitive skin.
"I started using this around winter but my skin starts getting really dry. I had to use my night cream under this product, then it worked fine. Will not recommend if your skin is dry during the winter."
"Even with very little application, the product leaves a ""white"" film on the face."
Best moisturizer/SPF I have found at a very reasonable price. No oily feeling on my skin.
I have been using this for years and I like the way it stays on my face and how soft it leaves it.
"Using this for years. Works great, feels good on skin. Helioplex is good to have in spf"
This product is awful. I've been using Neutrogena SPF 15 Moisturizer for years. There is no comparison.
"Made my face break out in 4 places. Large, nasty pimples after a few days. Not for me."
