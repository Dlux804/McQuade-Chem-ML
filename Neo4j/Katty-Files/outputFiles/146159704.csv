I have to say that this product is simply amazing what it does for your skin !!It is so creamy and a little bit goes along way.Buy it ladies you won't regret it and it smells so good and I received those as a compliment gift And I truly cannot stop raving about these wonderful beautiful products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the sample on December 15th and have been using it daily for a month now. I had my husband take before and after photos of me wearing the same clothes and makeup. The lighting was a little different. It feels really good going on and my skin feels smoother and softer. I have a but yellow undertone to my skin so I think it helped cool it some. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I age my skin tone became shallow. It didn't take long for Age Perfect yo give my skin tone that dewy pink undertone and glow women want. I will never be 25 again, but as a 69 year old woman, I still want to look healthy and vibrant. Age Perfect. Is great!"
Thank ypu Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for 3 weeks. I love that it is non greasy on my skin and the moisture lasts the entire day. I do feel my skin is Rosy and more youthful. I received this product to use in my home and to give my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This L'Oréal Age Perfect Rosy Tone moisturizer is a nice day cream for people with mature skin. I would prefer an unscented moisturizer, but it doesn't seem too heavy. This product has given me just a hint of color but not too much. I received this product complimentary for my honest feedback. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love Loreal Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream! It's like it was made just for me! The cream has a real nice consistency and my face feels so smooth and soft after applying. I like that it's not greasy at all which is a plus! I found that I don't even have to wear liquid makeup if I don't want to as this amazing cream gives me a nice rosy glow! I'm so happy I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this item a little over 3 wks ago at no cost to trial and provide my review. I began using it immediately. This moisturizer has a nice fragrance, smooths on easy, and feels as soft as a rose pedal. It absorbs into my skin providing a light touch of color to my pale skin. Like myself it's a great moisturizer for the older woman. At this time I have not noticed any cell renewal, only softness to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product totally surprised me it is luscious and so smooth it glides on your skin. I applied to this at night and love the way my face felt of the morning. My face feels younger and looks brighter [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Rosy Tone skin moisturizer works really well in fact a little too well for me! I have pretty oily skin even at age 50, so I have to use a very light touch with this product. Otherwise my skin will feel really oily. The packaging is really pretty and the moisturizer is a gorgeous rosy pink color. I received the product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this moisturizer three different times on the days I tested it. Each time my face began to sweat as if I had just worked out. I currently use a face moisturizer, therefore, I know it is not my skin type. Also my complexion is very dark and it did not have the Rosy Glow. This was sent to me to test as an Influenster! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not a fan, too many chemicals, didn't do a thing. No noticeable difference, and I really don't like mica or scented creams on my face. This was provided free of charge by Influenster for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'OREAL Rosy tone cell renewal moisturizer was wonderful to use. Made my face bright and smooth. The texture was rich and creamy. Didn't notice a peony sense or smell to the moisturizer when applying. Used for the past week every morning before applying foundation. Received a complimentary bottle for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received L'oreal's Age Perfect Rosy Tone Cell Renewal free from Influenster for my review. It has a pleasant scent, sort of like roses, and feels good on my skin. My complexion is kind of sallow and this cream does take it away. It has a slightly sparkly sheen, but it's quickly absorbed and looks natural under makeup. It does brighten my skin and doesn't feel oily. I wear it alone at home [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product almost a week ago compliments of Influenster to test it and review it. Well all I can say is.... so far so good!!!! I am seeing an improvement on my face already! If it works this good this fast then I can't wait to see the results a month from now! Stay tuned world!! This grandma is lookin' good!! Before & current photos below. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am blessed enough not to have many issues with my face or my skin for my age group. I do have a few areas where my tone is uneven. I received this product as a sample, for testing purposes and I am very happy with the results. It was not greasy and did not leave a residue. My face felt soft and not greasy or oily after use. I look forward to continued use of this product after my sample is finished. This is a definite purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started to use Rosy Tone Moisturizer and Eye Brightener. I have to say I am amazed how soft my skin feels and about the healthy glow, I can see, even after a short use. I can recommend this produdt. I received both products as part of a free testing from Influenster which did in no way affrct my honest review"
I love how my skin looks and feels after using this over several days. Definitely gave my skin a rosy glow! I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this this product from Influenster. I have tried this and love it! I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Would love the product if it didn't have the rosey additive. My face has a natural rosey color to it and adding this product to it just makes it worse [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was complimentary For review purposes. I really like the light creamy texture. I also like the rosy color. I gave my skin good moisturization [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received a complimentary jar to test on my face. This daily moisturizer instantly revived my skin. It helped exfoliate my dry, dull skin and renewed my face back to it's pink tone. I highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this product complimentary. I was pretty sceptical at first. I don't follow directions very well so I applied this to my face and neck before bed. I expected to wake up an oily mess. Let's face it, I'm an oily skin girl. I got up, fixed my coffee and processed to apply makeup. My skin was fuller and had a distinct healthy glow. I've continued using the Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer every day since. I am obsessed with this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this moisturizer complimentary to review and I have to say I was really excited to try it! I was sad that the smell and texture really were not so appealing to me. It felt a little gritty and the smell was no to good. I did use it a couple of days to see if it was moisturizing my skin and it was pretty good but not my first pick! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this rosy tone moisturizer by loreal from influenster. I am using this product complimentary for testing purposes. This product is so amazing, it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I can see my. wrinkles have diminished and my skin feels so smooth bringing back a more youthful appearance. Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this Day Cream complimentary from Influenster for a trial. This is a very thick cream so you do not need to use a lot of it. It does not feel heavy or greasy and works well under makeup. I am hoping with regular use it will dimish the fine lines around my eyes. Over all I would say this is a very nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a thick consistence. It guilds on and is well absorbs by the skin. It has little to no scent. It has a peachy hue yet goes on clear. Giving you a radiant lite from within look. Very nice everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this rosy toned cream. Feels very nice going on and not greasy, just creamy. I saw an ad for it on an older actress and since I am ""older"" thought I would try. Very nice, and I like not wearing makeup occassionally and this just ads a nice glow."
In just a few days my skin has a new youthful glow and feels soft and supple. This product has done wonders for my 70 year old skin.
I received this product to do a review on. I do like the product. For me and my oily skin it feels heavy by the time I apply enough to feel moisturized. The rosy tone is nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this from influenster and one of their boxes. Love it. Works all day, under my makeup and doesn't feel greasy. Im 52 so this is great for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm approaching 74 fast. I have natural rosy undertone to my skin. But after trying a sample I was sent. I love and need the moisturized and healthy look I get without using a makeup that tends to show during daytime.
"Moisturizes well...puts a few roses in my cheeks... I look like; Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, when I wear makeup...so.... It's L'Oreal....they know what they're doing!"
"I was sent this to try and then review. I love the product. I almost 68. This made my skin feel amazing, wrinkles (which I have few) were less visible and people said I had a glow. Thank you ..you made me feel more beautiful [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed the skin on my forehead felt rough and was afraid the rest of my face would become leather-like. Using Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer for just one week has my entire face feeling smooth and youthful. This rich moisturizer is just what dry, thirsty skin needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been looking for the perfect product for my aging skin and finally found it with this product. My skin is smooth and glowing. My mild rosecea and spider veins in my face also seem to be lighter. I'm 62 and most people guess my age to be mid 40s. Thank you loreal for this wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the way it made my skin feel and look, definitely worth buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is very heavy and feels smothering to the face. My skin wants to breakout. Was not what I expected. Would not purchase again.
"This is an amazing face moisturizer, Skin feels soft and hydrant all day along. Hard to find in Fiji but I usually buy from USA."
"I am definitely aging faster than I want. This Age Perfect Cell Renewal is a good addition to my skin care regimen. The cream is somewhat thick and pink in color. It spreads on easily and has a light tint to hide redness, age spots and more. It works to moisturize, hydrate and exfoliate your skin while stimulating new cell growth closer to the surface. With continued use, your skin will look brighter and smoother. I recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Before I started using Age Perfect, I hated getting up in the morning to see my drab skin. Since starting to use this product a few weeks ago, I've noticed the youthful radiance I remember from decades ago has returned. Thanks to Age Perfect Cell Renewal I again feel and look younger than my actual age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been purchasing different moisturizers, trying to find the right one for me, and although this one has a pleasant scent and rosy tone, it's not creamy nor velvety enough to spread over my skin. I find myself having to tug at my face to spread it which isn't good, as that'll cause my face to lose elasticity. I'm going to resort to mixing this cream with a serum or another lotion just to be able to spread it all over my face and neck."
Loved the hint of rosiness. Great for my aging skin.
It is just as advertised. Very pleased with item
I received this complementary for testing. I love the tint as it helps to give your skin a rosy color without looking like makeup. It really helps to smooth the skin and make pores and fine wrinkles less noticeable. I saw results with the first use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this item as a complimentary gift from Influenster. The first thing I noticed was the amazing fragrance it has. Then I noticed how soft and fluffy it is and evenly it applies to your skin. Finally it has such a light coverage and light moisturization that my foundation sinks in like butter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After only a few days, I can see and feel a difference in my skin. It's smoother, tighter and has a nice glow."
My skin is very dry and this cream is wonderful. Rubs right in and has a lovely subtle scent. I love it
"I received a free sample from #PinchMe. I am so glad i did. After the first use, i had to purchase some. I also bought the mask. My skin feels and is looking pretty good for s seasoned woman...."
"It was a very product, made my face very Rosie and I have a lot natural pink tones in face so not sure if that is a plus for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received a sample of the cream via Pinchme.com. It went on very smooth and left a nice soft feel to my skin. I give it a thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received L'Oréal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes from #Influenster. I used for about a month, and I definitely noticed a difference in the tone of my skin. The rosy glow of my youth was coming back. It is light weight and absorbs into my skin quickly without a greasy or sticky feeling after application. L'Oréal never disappoints with their amazing products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. It makes my skin look great. The color is not strong, but just a hint of a faint rosie glow. I put it on before going to the kitchen along with a little creamy blush and just a touch of light lipstick. Makes me feel like I look nice. It's a good day cream. Try it, what do have to lose!"
"I bought this as I wanted to see if it really did give the rosy glow to my skin. I love L'Oreal skin products in general but I feel that this one, although nice on the skin, does not give the rosy glow that we see in the commercials. It's still a good moisturizer and possibly a cell renewal cream, that remains to be seen."
I saw this on TV and thought what the heck---I'll give it a try. My face is fairly wrinkled from all the laughing I've done (ha ha) but this product makes it feel soft and supple. It does give your skin a rosy look. I would recommend to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my complimentary L'Oreal Paris Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer from Influenster!! I have been using it for a couple of weeks now. I have noticed a big change in my skin. It has become firmer, softer, and I'm noticing fine lines and wrinkles disappear. I have never had a beauty routine before. I love my L'Oreal Paris Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer!! Wouldn't trade it for the world thank you in Influenster!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received a sample size, I was excited about it because it felt nice on my skin. Then I took a look in the mirror and noticed the shimmer all over my face. I was Extremely disappointed. They almost had me... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow! This primer is so Hydrating, keeps my makeup from setting into fine lines and wrinkles!! My make up lasts all day even on hot summer days!! It gives a healthy glow! Doesn't feel heavy at all! My make up doesn't get all over my phone either! Very nice! I also use Loreal True Match Super Blendable Makeup. Thank you Loreal you never disappoint!!!!!"
I got this sample and used and look 10 years younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I brought skin care, hair care moisture and makeup products last week and I am highly satisfied [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the tint and the scent and the fact you use just a tad and will last forever but the product is very greasy if your not careful so I have to use little. I also do not notice it working
The product turns me orangy. My skin does not feel moisturized at all. Obviously I do not care for it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this cream, but how I wish it came with SPF in it. It would really complete the package!"
"I recieved this product complimentary from loreal through Influenster and have used daily for 2 weeks, I'm impressed with the quality, the texture, the smell and how well it works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love using this. My face feels smooth and soft all day. It also smells good. I don't see that it tints my complexion. Adding some sunscreen would be great.
"I am 70 years old and I can't believe how many compliments I've received about my skin tone. People cannot believe my age either. Love, love this product. I highly recommend."
"I was so ready to love this product:) The ingredients and description sounded just like what I was hoping for. However! I can't get within 30 feet of an open bottle, it is highly perfumed ( from flower essence and fragrance). I am highly sensitive to perfume and when I opened the bottle I began to wheeze, cough and my eyes watered. Please make a fragrance-free version!"
"This product may have been wonderful IF they had not put a TON of glitter/sparkle in it!!! Since this is marketed for woman ""of a certain age,"" it seems ridiculous to load it up with glitter!!! I will not be wearing it as it makes someone 'over forty' look absurd. This is a huge disappointment --- I think they should have disclosed the fact that is full of ""glitter"" on the packaging, so I wouldn't have wasted my money. Do NOT recommend!"
"Good Luck finding this stuff. I think I managed to grab the last jar in all of Oregon. To all reading this review, I couldn't find additional jars anywhere, not even on Amazon. That being said I can understand why it appears to be out of stock everywhere. It truly does give your skin a rosy appearance and it makes my face appear brighter. My friends have commented on how health my skin looks."
"I had a pink toned moisturizer before and loved it but it's discontinued. Thus I got excited when I saw this one. Unfortunately, I don't notice any difference in the puffiness or crows feet and I haven't used it much because I can't seem to get over the 'gritty' feel of the cream. I was thinking that the pink color would add color to my face but so far it appears to disappear as I apply it. I'll keep trying it but so far, sorry Loreal, I'm disappointed."
Very attractive packing but more importantly applies smoothly and leaves my skin so soft and glowing. I am 73 and have only used L'Oreal liquid moisturizer on my face for many many years so it is a big deal to switch to a creamy moisturizer. If it contained sun screen protection the rating would have been 5 stars instead of 4 stars. CVS Pharmacy sold out had to drive to another town to find product.
LOVE IT!
"At my age (61) and with my freckled face & many shades of grey hair, I love this product for the way it brightens my face! It smells great-- I am a gardener and I love peonies! I like products that make me feel beautiful, yet more than that products that benefit my aging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I truly love this cream. I used to use Cyndi Crawford's Meaningful Beauty and this works better and faster! I am 57 and love the way my skin has responded to this. Now to be honest, I use this in the morning but a different deep wrinkle serum at night. However, as far as making my skin look good enough to actually even go out sometimes to run errands with just lipstick on, this has done it! I'm on my second jar and will never be without it as long as L'Oreal makes it!"
"I purchased this renewal cream several weeks ago, but have only been able to use it once. First let me say that the pink tone of the cream is perfect. It leaves a light, healthy glow on my face. My problem comes from the heavy fragrance. It is so strong that others were noticing the smell. Not unpleasant, just a strong perfume odor. Please Loreal, make an fragranced version of your cell renewal cream and I will be happy to use and review it."
"I have been using this for two months now and notice a softness and glow to my skin. It is easy to apply and for a few minutes after application my face feels cool and rested. For the first time I feel comfortable without make-up for an everyday use; and when I want to put on a light make-up, I don't need as much and it goes on"
very smoothly.
"My skin looks better than it has in years! Imparts a beautiful healthy glow to my complexion. I love the smell. A little pricey, but look for it on sale with a coupon. A little goes a long way! I find that I don't need a foundation anymore. Definitely will buy again."
I am anti-lotion and anti-makeup but at age 49 my skin needed something. I apply every morning and love the change I see! Looking for a rich cleanser to pair with this. Unlike other reviewers I am glad there is no SPF as that changes the smell and consistency.
I received this about three weeks ago to review. It smooths on easily. I love the coverage and my skin looks like I have applied a foundation. My husband noticed and said good I look. Thank you for allowing me to try your product. Will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product really does work on me. After only a few weeks, my facial skin took on a rosy healthy moist look I haven't seen in decades. So many people kept saying I didn't look at all like 70 years old. The peony smell makes me so happy every time I open the jar."
"Miraculous, no. Moisturizing, yes. I actually use it as a night moisturizer as it's too heavy for daytime for me. My skin is dry and definitely has signs of age, but my makeup tends to slide using this as a daytime moisturizer. Lightly scented. Having been using 2 weeks, it's ok."
"I never did like wearing foundation. It makes my skin feel like it can't breathe. I've tried other tinted moisturizers but they always end up feeling too greasy. This is perfect. It gives a nice glow, is not greasy and doesn't feel like it is smothering my face. The only thing that could make it better would be to add SPF30 since it is for day wear."
"I was extremely happy with the results of this product. I am almost 60 and have combination dry/oily skin. To my surprise, this product was able to take care of both without over doing it. Not to mention the scent was not offensive. It was quite nice, actually. At the end of the day, my skin was still hydrated and I received compliments from my friends about how dewy my skin looked. I would definitely use this product on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i am 75 yrs old, i have tried so many products,finally gave up. when i saw this product i thought okay one more time. i received this 4 days ago and used it morning and night i already see a difference in my skin and wrinkles are already going away GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"
"I bought this after seeing the commercial and I love it. I have very dry skin and most moisturizers do not absorb. This went on smooth and absorbed. I have not noticed a rosy tone but you can't have everything, I have however noticed my wrinkles are not as deep which is a big plus. Just ordered a second jar."
"I have been using Rosy Tone for about a month. I adore it! Just a hint of color makes my skin look dewy fresh and healthy. A light swipe of blush (or not) and my face is done beautifully! This is a must have for a healthy, beautiful, moisturized face!"
It did not work as well as other L'Oréal products that I have used. The moisture feeling on my face did not last long. It seemed to give me a dry feeling within a couple of hours after use. I am 66 and live in Texas. I bought the product because of the person who was advertising it.
"I received this product as a sample to try and review. I really like the product and will continue to use it. For me, it is great for the weekend when I only want to wear a little powder and lip color. I am 54 y.o. with more normal than dry skin. I could not wear my normal foundation over this as it was too moisture rich for me, but if your skin is on the dry side, you should try it - I think you will like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw this at the store I decided to give it a try. It's now a must have. I have dark brown skin that is on the combo/dry side. This primer gives my skin a subtle glow and keeps my skin hydrated but not greasey or too shiney. Works great under my foundation and makes it look flawless! Please don't ever discontinue. Great primer!
"I purchased this product in a drugstore when it first came out. I returned it (the store's policy allows return of any cosmetic a customer is unsatisfied with) the next day. The overwhelming ""fragrance"" in this product is very off-putting. Why does it have to smell like a cheap cologne? I would REALLY appreciate it if you returned to products that are only slightly scented or not scented at all. The Youth Code line was always my favorite because of the very slight fragrance that dissipated very quickly."
I won this product and absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel and look. It goes on smooth and gives my skin a little tone if I am not wearing make-up. I will be switching to Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer. It smells good too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't had much success with moisturizers as I have gotten older. When I was offered the L'Oreal Age Perfect, I thought I would try it. Wow, at the end of the day my skin feels dewy and fresh and dare I say it, I think my skin is in the best condition of my life. An absolute must for grownup ladies! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The look is pretty like on the TV ad, but not worth the price in my opinion. The reason for the 1 star is lack of moisture. This cream has no where near the moisturizing properties of the other products they make. It goes on nicely, but feels cakey after a while, so I end up putting my regular moisturizer over it, then light blush. That leaves me asking why this higher price and no advantage to putting it on? Won't buy this again. Sorry L'Oreal this is a fail."
I started using this product about 3 weeks ago on a daily basis and love it! My face doesn't feel dry at all even as the day goes on. My face feels smoother and rejuvenated. I won't go back to my previous face cream since this product is perfect for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a testing sample. The product has a pleasant smell and is delivered in a nice package. Large size and attractive packaging. I wanted to love it, but alas even with the pretty color it did not moisturize my skin as I hoped. I used it religiously but never got the moisture I needed.

I enjoyed the way my skin felt after using L'oreal's Rosy Tone Moisturizer. It looked and felt fresh and bright. I will enjoy using it in the future and I am likely to recommend this product to people I know! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a retired esthetician who formulated a custom skin care line, I preferred more natural and lots of Peptides and lab cosmeceuticals. However, with 65 yer old skin I thought ""why not"". Skin looks smoother, faintly rosy, moisturize, and faintly less fine lines. Overall pleased. Will purchase again but add my own anti-aging boosters ;)"
"I rarely use moisturizer, I do not have a skin routine. I never took care of my skin because I didn't feel the need to do anything, then one day I woke up and realized that I was looking older, suddenly not aging so well. I would try a new cream for a couple weeks then ditch it, still not worried about my skin. I saw the ad for this and thought I'd give it a try, not expecting much..... I LOVED it from the first use!!! It makes my skin look dewy and fresh."
I was reluctant to try a new product before the holidays and I only use good products on my skin. I have been using Age Perfect Cell Renewal for 2 weeks now and I really like it! I already see a difference in my skin. My face feels very hydrated and soft. I like the little bit of extra color it gives me. I will continue to use this product.

"I received your sample from Influenster to review. At first, I noticed that the product left my skin looking and feeling oily but afternoon about an hour it had soaked into my skin.

I received this from Influenster to review and I have found a product that I will definitely add to my daily skincare routine. The formula is soft and I had immediate results after the first use. It's so creamy and my skin absorbed the product quickly. Love the color and I found that it didnt break out my sensitive skin. My friends have been commenting on my rosy glow and what great skin I have recently. Thank you for a great formula! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer feels incredible! Applying it to clean skin every night takes away that lingering dullness I've struggled with. This product brought a certain brightness that I can't deny!

"I've been using this product for one year and am very pleased with it. I have sensitive skin and have rarely found a moisturizer I can use. Over time, it has improved my skin's appearance and lightened my age spots by about 40%. I have light skin. The only other thing I put on my face is concealer by my eyes. I love the smell which disappates after 30 minutes. I like it so much I gave it to all my female relatives for Christmas."

I received this product complementary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review.
This moisturizer was a little heavier than what I normally use. It did blend quickly and soak in to my skin. I didn't really notice a rosy tone but I did use it sparingly. My skin isn't super dry so not sure if I will continue using this or not. If I use products that are too heavy my skin will break out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer has as a nice texture, does not feel greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly. My skin felt hydrated and refreshed after adding this into my morning routine.

Left my face feeling softer and younger. I love how it moisturized my skin and kept it feeling fresh. Would recommend to friends and family.
This product was a complimentary gift. This is my review of what I thought. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The first time i applied this product my face looked so pink and i was thinking this looks like i put blush on my whole face. But after a minute or so the color faded and it adjusted to my skin tone making it look more natural. The fragrance is nice and fades after applying. I would recommend this product to help even out skin tones. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and this review is my own opinion.

I received this product complimentary from Influenster but this will most definitely be on my shopping list and part of my beauty regimen for a long time to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free from Influenster to try and review. This stuff is pretty amazing. It is so smooth and creamy. I love the feel of not knowing my face. However when you try this (and you should) don't freak out. It turns your face a rosy pink for about five seconds. Then it's absorbed and you look great!! I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product about a month ago to try and review. It's an amazing moisturizer. I love the rosy glow it adds to my skin. I could definitely see that fine lines were plumped up and reduced while using. The only slight downside was that on my oily cheek area, it was a bit heavy. I would probably like a less oily moisturizer to use on those areas. I definitely noticed how wonderfully it moisturizer my neck. Overall, I love the light texture and rosy tone of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this great moisturizer compliments of Influenster, After 1 week of use I can see a huge difference in my skin.

Thank you L'oreal for making this magnificent product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked how it made my skin feel. I have to be careful what moisturizer I use due to my skin being very sensitive. I think it gave my skin a glow and a brighter tone. At my age anything helps. I would recommend this to my friends. I think it is a little pricey for my budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary to try and was sold after a week of use. It seems to instantly brighten my face and leaves it feeling very suppleand dewy, like a rose!

I received this product complimentary for testing from Influenster. I did not get a Rosy glow. No eye sensitivity but really wished it had no frangrace. I don't have dry skin so it almost over moisturizing effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this for complimentary testing and I absolutely love this and the eye cream. My skin was instantly brighter and felt really moisturized with no stickiness. The smell is very light.

I am happy I did without my husband knowing I was trying it, he complimented me on my glowing skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works very well at brightening your face but is a tad too heavy for me in AL plus no SPF protection. That's okay with me as can use during cold weather when I'm hanging out at home with no makeup on. Thanks to @Influenster and @L'OrealParisUSA for letting me test this product complimentarily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was sent this for testing and I am so glad I couldn't wait to try it and it did not disappoint the texture of this cream is a little different but wonderful and moisturizing I have very oily skin and I just love it so glad I was sent this I will repurchase
"It feels good on my skin and is not greasy. It's light and airy. Similar to whipped cream in appearance, has a pleasant smell. It does smooth and plump wrinkles. Helps camouflage dark circles. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for review and tried it for a few days. I found that it didn't seem to do anything other than irritate my face. I think due to the peony and rose scents. I'll try again to see if it's the fragrance that's irritating me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free to give my honest opinion of and because I have red undertones in my skin, I didn't notice and increase in being more rosy. It is tinted so it must make a difference. But isn't transferable or greasy. Light weight and light fresh scent. Great under your makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture was very light, almost the consistency of a mouse. I havent used this product long enough to notice any long term benefits. I will say that the cream felt a little strange on my face when I happened to perspire which I didnt really care for. I received this cream complementary for testing."
"I received this product free in turn for my honest review. After the winter, my skin looked very dull. This added a radiance to my skin and I'm in love. I even wear leases makeup because of it. It melts into the skin beautifully and just leaves you looking healthy which is why I would highly recommend this moisturizer."

Very hot here in Oklahoma. Texture was nice, no major improvement in skin though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have used this moisturizer at three different times on different days. Each time my face began to sweat and I looked as if I had worked out.

"I was excited to try this Rosy Tone Cell Renewal Moisturizer. I learned right away that rosy tone does not compliment my skin at all. At first it seemed to moisturize well, but by late afternoon I noticed flakiness from my skin and as I rubbed it I realized it was the silicone in this product. Not for me. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from Influenster to review , L'Oréal has always been my favorite skin care product and this is as I would expect a great product . The smell is very rich! It smells like it would be quite expensive , The moisturizer leaves my skin soft and very moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this as a complimentary gift and I'm glad I did! This is perfect for us “older women”. It feels good to the touch, feels light and has a wonderful fragrance. Gives a hint of color and not oily, and disappears into your skin, without leaving any residue. Just the perfect hint of color. Definitely purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal has a reputation of offering a good product at a fair price, and this one is no different. The texture was creamy and was easy to apply without dragging on my skin. The rose tint is ok if you are not wearing other product, however, I prefer moisturizers to be invisible as I also wear foundation. My skin did feel softer and seem hydrated while I was wearing the cream but did not notice a permanent improvement. This product is a great solution for summer wear as long as you remember to use sunscreen."
"Not only is this cream an excellent moisturizer, but it adds a flattering hint of pink to my complexion that is flattering enough that I rarely apply makeup."
I only used a little bit and it made my skin feel so good. It looked “fresh”/bright. The one I purchased has a light scent and I liked that also. My girlfriend liked my look so much that she wants me to order her some.
"I got a sample and I fell in love! It feels great on the skin, no stickiness or greasiness. Plus, it smells amazing! Awakens the senses."
Love it! I'm so happy i finally made this purchase. Moisturizes my skin really good and adds an extra glow.
I purchased this a few days ago and have used it twice. I find it not creamy enough to distribute over my skin evenly. Perhaps I'm not using enough. It's very expensive and for the price I thought I would get more. I love the rosy tint.
I have been using this for almost a month now and I know I am going to continue to purchase it. It goes on beautifully and does provide a rosy glow to the face. My family have all told me how much brighter and nicer my skin looks!!!!!
"I used this for the 1st time yesterday after washing my face I applied a small amount. It made my skin tone even and actually gave me a mild healthy glow. The cream is so silky smooth. I usually wear blush when I go out, not any more!!"
"I have ivory skin and ash blonde hair going white. This is just what I needed, just a hint of healthy rose tone subtle enough for every day. Love this stuff, please don't ever discontinue it."
Tried it daily about 40 days ago I love it! It is wonderful I like the feel of it almost out will buy more tommorrow. Again I love the stuff. JB ps needs spf added.
"I've been using it for 10 days now, and am very satisfied. I don't see any hint of color but my skin feels hydrated. Will buy another. Ample size is a plus!"
"I bought this a couple months ago. I love the texture, but wish it had sunscreen. I put this on first, and then a sunscreen, but it feels like to much on my skin at one time."
"I purchased this cream nearly 2 weeks ago. I REALLY wanted to like it,but, it has a sandy,griity feel . It doesn't matter how little I use,it still has a texture.Needless to say I won't be buying this again."
Thank you for your Fantastic product. My friends and coworkers ask what I was using and told them. I love the glow it gives my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as a free sample in my PINCH ME box. I applied the cream before foundation, and to my surprise, I didn't need my foundation. This product is wonderful and superseded my expectations. Now I am a Loyal Consumer."
"Perfect for my foundation, or tinted moisturizer, brightens my face with a glow, and feels natural, doesn't feel cakey, or harsh to my skin when I put it on."
I saw the Helen Mirren ad and I thought why not? Being fair skinned and prone to cancer I liked the idea of enhancing my natural tone with this. I loved it from Day 1 and look forward to using it daily.
Used free sample and loved the way it worked. Rose tint was just enough to make my skin look health and feel good. Not oily and did not have a strong perfume smell.
Will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this primer because it adds just enough pink to a yellowish foundation and it helps the foundation match my skin perfectly and it smells amazing!!!
"My skin tone improved, and I was not the only one who noticed. Family members and friends commented on it. I also received lots of compliments from strangers.Thanks L'OREAL. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I just turned 60 recently and I thought my skin had lost its glow! I noticed after my first application my face was glowey with a warm pink tint! I can't wait for future benefits of using this cream. Thank you L'Oréal
I bought this a couple of months ago and I just love the way it makes my skin look. So hydrated and a healthy glow! I will keep buying this product because it is perfect for everyday use when you do not want to wear make-up.
I received this in my Vox Box. Not impressed. Although the color was pretty in the jar it didnt leave a rosy glow on my skin. Not very moisturizing. Doesn't perform as it states. Disappointed.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a complimentary sample of the Loreal rosy tone moisturizer. I am so glad I tried it. My face felt extremely smooth and I liked the slight rosy tint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I started using this a week ago and I can tell a major difference in the texture of my skin. It is very soft and makeup goes on easily. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this product last week. While I like the concept of this I find this product cakes up on my skin. It doesn't spread smoothly. Am I doing something wrong?
"I would like to continue using it, can you offer any suggestions?"
I was given a sample in exchange for a review. I liked the effect the moisturizer has on the skin. It gives you a nice color that you lose with age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Was given by Influenster to try and review and i can say after only a couple applications i can feel a moisture in my skin...will continue using and hopefully i see a big change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The rosy tone light weight moisturizer smooths and brightens my skin. I use it under my foundation. I also use it with my nightly skin care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received complimentary for review purposes. Did not like the smell and felt it could only be used as a blush due to the color. It did look nice as a hint of color on the cheeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is way too thick , strong smell that I do not like . Have not seen or felt any benefit from this product . Will use it up because it was too expensive to waste. Will not purchase again"
"I love this Moisturizer, the only thing that threw me off was the tiny lil white pebbles in it that is supposed to exfoliate. I end up picking them off my face."
I got cell renewal rosy tone moisturizer for free for testing this product and really glad I was selected because I really saw a difference in my skin after using it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a complimentary testing product. I really like how it's giving my face a nice glow and it's so much smoother. Love the smell too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this in an Influenster box. I usually use a night time moisturizer, but I have been using this and my skin is really soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to get this free sample of Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer! I decided to share this free gift with my daughter in law. Hallelujah, we are both getting our Cells Renewed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
On the second day using this I ran into an old friend and she commented on how wonderful my skin looked and that I was glowing. I've never received a compliment on my skin before.
I received this in my voxbox and it is my favorite thing to have received so far. I am 60 and I love the way it makes my skin look and feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face has been thanking me every time I put this moisturizer on my face not only does it go on silky smooth but it also evens out my skin tone as well. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.
I received the Rosy Tone Moisturizer to try. At first touch it felt smooth. It went on smooth and feels light on my skin. Though I don't have a light or fair complexion it still livened up my wintery dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this L' Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer as a sample.
"The first week I used this I wasn't sure if I liked the thick consistency. The results were very surprising, my skin was so soft and glowing. I really liked the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received this product complimentary ~ wonderful fragrance, no mineral oil and no greasy feeling after applied! Honestly, I would have never tried this product, only because I usually do not change my skin care protocol because I have VERY sensitive skin. I love this moisturizer, no breakouts, results in smoother skin within a week! Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very dry skin that burns. This product came as a free sample. I have tried so many different brands with no luck. I was very impressed with my results. I highly recommend thus product. Thanks for something that works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far I'm loving this moisturizer, I was a little worried at first with the rosy tint and it being a thick cream. I'll admit I got a little carried away the first time, and used to much. Lesson learned . A little goes a long ways. Since I've been using this my skin has been so soft and moisturized and I like the nice soft tint too. Thank you Influenster for sending me this product complimentary for testing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After applying this to my face after using the Cell renewal Rosy Tone mask it went on smooth and I didn't have to apply a lot of it because the little bit I used went a long way. My skin felt really soft after two weeks of use. It was creamy when I applied it my only complaint is that it made my face sweat after about 20 minutes of applying this and this is with each application. But, other than that it did moisturize my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free and will definitely be purchasing in the future. I have never used a moisturizer due to an oily t-zone. But this stuff is great. I've noticed how much smoother and more youthful my skin looks only after a week and half of using. And bonus, it has caused me to break out!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from Influenster complementary to try. I liked the way it made my skin feel, and my make up went on nicely, but the shimmer in it is just too much. I usually rub the excess moisturizer into my hands after I apply to my face. When I did that with this product I left shimmer on everything else I touched. I assume the shimmer is what gave my skin the nice glow, so I just use a make up wipe to get it off my hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of L'Oreal® Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream from PinchMe and I am so happy I did. I find as I am getting older my skin looses moisture more easily. The L'Oreal® Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream left my skin fresh and soft with a nice rosy glow that looks natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so excited that I received this complementary Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer! The cream is rather thick yet spreads onto my face nicely. The moisturizer leaves my skin dewy fresh with a nice light rosy glow that looks natural! I love it and am feeling fresh and beautiful today and every day now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from Influenster as a complimentary sample. The Rosy Tone Moisturizer felt so luxurious. What I loved best, in addition to its rosey tone, was how thick and non-greasy the product was. A little bit goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product to review from Influenster. I love it! I didn't expect that it would be so unique for a day cream. It doesn't turn your skin red or rosy! What it does is hydrate really well. It's great under BB and CC creams which tend to be drying for me. I will definitely purchase this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this to sample complementary from Influester . I love the soft silky feel of it on my skin. There is no greasy feeling left from it at all . Have only used it a few times and can't wait to see the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this for review through Influenster. So far, I really like it. It feels great on the skin and adds a non oily but moisturized look. It has a light pleasant scent that doesn't linger. I'm hoping it eventually improves my skin texture after continued use, but so far I haven't noticed anything but less dryness in the dry areas of my face."
I received an Influenster box with this item. When I opened the glass jar at first I was worried because it was pink. It's quite moisturizing and it blends in quickly and leaves no staining. I have been using for a week and my skin feels fabulous [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has made me so happy.I apply it in the mornings.I like the faint scent it's not over powering in any way.It leaves my face hydrated and feeling fresh.I recieved this from Influenster for testing purposes . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free in my Vox Box through Influenster ...This lotion is light and creamy and didn't break out my sensitive skin ! It also smells wonderful! It works great with the Rosy Complexion Mask too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first saw this product advertised on television, I thought there is no way it would work for me - an African American woman - because of the ""Rosy Tone."" While it seems to work fine as a moisturizer, I did not care for how it made my skin look. The rosy glow is not compatible with my skin color, so unfortunately, my initial thoughts were correct. I am disappointed and that is not how I usually perceive Loreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I returned home to Florida yesterday after celebrating my 53rd birthday in New York I was delighted to find this product from Influenster. My skin was dry from the New York winter cold, as well as from traveling on the airplane, and this product was just was my dry, parched, dull skin needed.The cream is smooth, not greasy, and sank right into my skin. I only used it once so far, but I believe I will be purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recived the Loreal-cell renewal free to test by the influencer . I am so verry happy at how this product is working in just the first few days i could see a mayger difference in my face the dark brown spots have goting so lite an the smoker ring around my mouth is completely gone.I will be staying with this product from here on out. My face is now brite an soft . loveing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product and my skin felt lighter, softer, smoother. It did not feel greesy at all after I applied it which is what I was looking for. I did receive these products as complimentary for testing purposes but they are exactly what I have been searching for. The fomulas are amazing. I just can't get over how nice my skin feels! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
" I received this moisturizer in a vox-box from #influnster to try. I was looking forward to trying this product, but did not live up to my expectations or its claims. It was tacky to apply and did not blend very well. Not enough moisturizing effects for dry mature skin. The only rosey tint I noticed was the color of the product in the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a complimentary jar to try and love the nice rosy glow this product gives my skin. I worried that it would be too pink but it is a subtle glow on my fair skin. It isn't too heavy and works well under my make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received thru influencer and was so happy I was. I have extremely dry skin and this is so thick and creamy yet absorbs right in. Has a very nice smell. I did team this up with the all over honey balm on days I was going to be out in the wind and that seemed to take care of any extra issues
This moisturizer feels like silk!! I just recieved it today in my influenster box! My face feels so pampered after trying these products! Third is my favorite so far! I will be back in 7 days ti give another review! Thank you Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Iâm 38 and I have dry skin, but yet my face breaks out. I have tried so many face lotions that either donât moisterize or break my face out. This lotion is amazing! My face hasnât looked or felt this good in a while! My coworkers even say I look like Iâm glowing!"
"I bought this product after seeing a commercial on TV. After applying it, I started to feel a tingling sensation ....making my skin feel as if it was being rejuvenate. I will continue to use it to see how much better my skin really changes over the next few weeks."
"i bought this product, used it and it caked on my face , thought something was wrong with it and returned it and got another bottle of it. well it still seems to cake, it does not spread very good,i dont know what could be wrong..i do not put alot or to little on. is it suppose to not spread evenly?"
My Wife is very pleased and states it really works.
Love this moisture cream and it has a light tint to give your skin colour.
"This is wonderful, gives your face a rosy glow and smells great too."
I bought this after seeing the commercial for it and I really love how it makes my skin look. It gives a bit of coverage for everyday wear and so I don't feel like I need a foundation. I really wish it had sunscreen though because I wear sunscreen everyday rain or shine. Seems like I will have to save this for evening use and not daily.:(
"This is a great mood-lifter for winter time because it is very rich and moisturizes skin parched from dry, cold weather. It feels heavy in the jar but goes on sheer and smooth, leaving a silky textured finish. It adds a subtle rosy flush to dull complexions with a slight shimmer that is more glowy than disco ball. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this over six months ago and us is religiously. Light weight and light fragrance. Does show a light rose tone which is good. I normally have a rather light tone skin. I don't like wearing makeup whether it be foundation or powder. This services my purposes.
"Recently, I received a L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream sample from Pinchme. The sample was really small, but what i did like was it went on smooth and wasn't too greasy. What i didn't like, was the rosy color it left. It would be fine if it was just for my cheeks, but not my whole face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample of L'Oreal® Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream from @PINCHme. I found the product to be absolutely amazing. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. It left a slight red tint to an already pink complexion. I absolutely loved this product and look forward to buying some in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free sample of this product recently and really have enjoyed your product. It was very creamy but sample was to small to use allover. I have a chunky face and it was just not enough for me. But I did enjoy the softness that it made my skin feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of this cream from #PinchMe and I was very impressed. The light shading was subtle, not at all ""painted"" looking, and it left my skin very soft. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that there is no sun protection, and I insist on using moisturizer with sun protection in the day time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product from PinchMe-I wanted to try it as I'm anemic and am paler than normal. I like the light feel of the cream and the cooling sensation after using it. After a couple of days, I noticed a slight amount of pinkness to my face. I am looking forward to getting a full-size bottle to see if It continues to give me the fresh blush look without needing to use makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try a new product. I was also a bit hesitant because of the rose tone; I assumed it would not match my skin tone. But I tried it and I am so glad I did. The color was perfect. I loved the light fragrance- I am also sensitive to smell and this was very pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just bought this product last week, and it's already my favorite! I love the texture and scent of this cream. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave my skin shiny or sticky like other moisturizers. The rosy tone imparts a youthful glow to my complexion, making my face look naturally vibrant and healthy. Love it!"
"This rosy tone moisturizer feels really good. It's not oily; it's not too thick. I like the way my skin absorbs it and how my skin feels afterward. I was worried it would be like a stain from the pigment, but it truly is not. It does give a good healthy glow and I feel good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so happy I got to try this new product. I found the moisturizing elements lasted all day. I have age (brown) spots and I found it provided coverage when I had previously used a concealer. Thank you for this experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought I would try this because I tried Olay and found it to feel dry. With L'Oréal my skin feels emollient not dry and actually looks younger. I like the smell. I don't have a pink glow but my face looks better and this makes me happy and confident.
I have been using Age Perfect Cell Renewal for 3 weeks. My skin is very sensitive and the product does not irritate. I am beginning to see real results although I wasn't expecting much. I will continue to use this fab product from Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this product recently and I love it. It goes on so smoothly and it's non greasy. I blends into my (fair) skin beautifully and gives my face an even skin tone and reduces all the age spots and freckles. I can leave the house without all the extra foundation. I will certainly purchase this again and other Loreal products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After just a few days I knew I would be saving up to buy this! And, at the price, that will be easy. My skin feels moist, just like a flower petal. There is a definite difference to the appearance of fine wrinkles (I could weep for joy). I am in love... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the Rosy Tone cream by L'Oreal. The cream is very moisturizing for my extra dry skin and that seems to last longer than many of the face creams I've tried. It has a nice smell and I like the glow effect that the rose tone gives my skin. The cost is a little high compared to what I paid for face creams in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as part of a sampling program - and am I glad that I did. Everything from the scent, to the light texture, to the way it kept my skin hydrated was great. I'm over 50 and dry, dull skin is an issue for me, especially in the colder months. This smoothed beautifully into my skin and kept it feeling great all day. I think it improved both the tone and texture of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very nice moisturizer.
tried this for moisturizing & blush/rosy look........
feels pebbly & not much color to it.
displeased with this product.. so much for hype
Great product. It went on smoothly and my skin is feeling better than ever. I am now looking to get the other products in this line.
Have used this for atleast a year or more. Everyone compliments me because of my complexion. They tell me how healthy I look!!
Love love love. A great product. Would highly recommend!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received complimentary from influenster to test out , I was not expecting to see results right away but was surprised that in just a few days my skin toned seemed more fresher looking and it brought back life to my 60yr old skin . I will definitely be purchasing . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
nice cream and color added to it makes a rosy complexion
Loved the moisturizer and the rosy glow it left...my only suggestion is that L'Oreal put an SPF factor in the mix.
I can't believe how bright this has made my face look. Loved it from the first time I used it. I would definitely recommend it to aging skin.
"I have never tried primer so initially was bit hesitant to try but to confess,this was really really awesome.I liked it undoubtedly."
"I've been using for two weeks, I can't believe how great my skin looks....I've gotten numerous compliments"
This is the second time I've purchased the Rosy Tone moisturizer. I love the pinkish glow it leaves behind and the fragrance is wonderful.
"For people with allergies, this moisturizer may work great, but has way too much fragrance for me to use"
I. LOVE. THIS. PRODUCT!!! It is the richest moisturizer I have EVER used! I recommend it to all ages! Thanks L'oreal!
"Love this product,made my face look healthy and illuminating, almost instantly. Highly recommend, not to costly either"

I received a full size sample for review from Influenster and I'm so glad I did. This face lotion has no greasy residue and moisturizes my nose and under eye area so well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complimentary for my honest review. This made my face feel really nice. You leave it on only 5 mins. My skin was so smooth and soft. I use it twice a week. I will buy this when i run out.

I love the way my skin looks and feels after I use this product. Very rich and creamy. Blends in perfectly. Looks great under makeup. Not badly priced. Great stuff
"This ""primer"" is an awful oil slick that will ENHANCE your wrinkles and pores and make your foundation look like literal cake batter on your skin. Steer clear."
"Cream sits on top of the skin and does not absorb well. Not much of a ""rosy tone"", skin just appeared darker. Would return, but ordered online and tossed packaging before trying."
Been using it a few weeks now and although I haven't seen any lines disappear I can tell an improvement in texture. Goes on velvety smooth and smells awesome. I will use this forever ♥️
I used l'oreal and I LOVE IT. No this rosy tone moisturizer. feel like play doe sticky and if rub ( we need to do it.) make crumbs. I just put it on trash can:(
My skin is super sensitive and I thought this was not going to work but I was wrong. It does work and I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this facial moisturizer. It has softened my skin but I haven't used it long enough to notice any lightning of dark spots yet. I would recommend it.
It's advertised to help hide under eye circles. Doesn't work for me.

I started using this a week ago and my skin feels really soft and smooth. I do not notice the rosy tint on my face since I live in Florida and my face is really tan. I will continue to use this product as I feel it does really help my skin.
I find the fragrance to be overwhelming and cloying. I nearly stopped using it because of the scent.I hold my nose after applying it. The smell seems to go away after several minutes.
this is the best moisturizer I have ever found....I don't even have to put on makeup.....my skin just glows with color and freshness....I will always have it on my makeup table...
Have been using for a couple of weeks now. My skin tends to bem dry and has been quite moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Happy with this product.
Love it!
Like the tint. Very soft
"The texture is nice, but the fragrance is a bit overwhelming. Also, you really can't use the product all over your face unless you want that ""rosy"" tone everywhere. It looks great on the cheek area, but when I used it all over, it made me look like I was under a tanning lamp. I think the product could be improved with less color and less scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample but I thought I would not like this moisturizer, mainly because I am pale with a rosy tone already. This product actually smooths out the color and gives a warm, soft glow. I am really glad that I gave it a try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was able to sample this from Pinch Me. I liked the feel and the slight glow that it provided. The only issue was that the sample was so small that you didn't really get a good feel for how your skin would be after using for a week or so. My skin is not terrible sensitive but tone and texture definitely changes after use with different products. In general, from what I was able to assess, I did like it and would try in the future.

The only issue was that the sample was so small that you didn't really get a good feel for how your skin would be after using for a week or so. My skin is not terrible sensitive but tone and texture definitely changes after use with different products. In general, from what I was able to assess, I did like it and would try in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was surprised and pleased by the feel of this moisturizer when applying. It was so smooth and my skin felt like it was drinking it in. I liked the tone or color also. Made me look like I had been out in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of L'Oreal® Paris Age Perfect Rosy Tone Cream from PinchMe to try. I did like the cream and how it felt on my face, however, I am not a fan of several ingredients used in this cream. For this reason, I do not plan to purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this as a sample and it was love at first use! The texture is perfect, not too greasy and just moisturizing enough. Perfect for under eye care, especially with the rosy tone. I will purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free from pinchme.com. I was pleased how it made my skin feel. It hydrates my face wonderfully. It goes on smoothly and blends well. I will be buying this and recommending to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product a month ago and can really see a noticeable difference. My skin looks more supple and the fine lines are nearly invisible. I looked back at pictures from my sons wedding almost 5 years ago and I think I look even younger now than I did then. So glad I found this product before my daughters upcoming wedding [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Day Cream from Pinch Me. I liked the texture and mild fragrance, as well as the ease of distributing the cream on my face, but I did use it predominantly on my cheeks as I don't prefer a ""blushed tone"" on the rest of my face (I'm in my early 50's and I get ""blushed"" often enough from hot flashes).

"I received a free sample of L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Mask and Moisturizer from PinchME in exchange for my honest review. While this does moisturize and I love the scent, just watch where you put it because it is tinted. It may not work for all skin types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a sample of this to try. Fortunately, I had the sample and I didn't get a bottle. I used it right before bed, and I actually had to get up to take it off. The smell was driving me nuts! The only thing I can compare it to is hair color. And I [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a sample from Pinchme and was very impresses with this product. The Age Perfect Rosy Tone applies creamy and wears well all day with a slight hint of blush and brighter skin. It also withstands in humid and windy days. I recommend this product to anyone seeking a moisturizer.
I could tell a difference even after the first use. Even the next morning my complexion still looked better than it had in years. I had just finished up a product from philosophy id been using a few weeks before i bought this. This product is much better and it cost three or four times less. Kudos loreal Paris
I am a Clinique user and have always used their products and am accustomed to using their Turnaround creme however I was fascinated by this new product I saw on Dr. Oz. I found the creme to be so thick and heavy so that it made it difficult to glide across my face. I also wasn't seeing any pink tint on my skin although it is very clear to see it in the product. It must be due to my very pale skin tone. So disappointed as I was hoping I had found a new product.
I kept seeing ads for this product starring Helen Mirren.
The pink fluffy product pictured was attractive to me and I admire Helen. The actual curdled consistency is thick and heavy. My skin is flawless anyway but that heavy cream feeling and slight chemical fragrance lingered for a bit. My skin remains smooth and a bit brighter with use. I will not purchase a second jar. My grey/white hair color is not listed as an option below.
"I decided to try this product after reading so many wonderful reviews . I actually sent myself a reminder on my iphone to remind myself to purchase it and i am so happy I did. I live in a tropic climate and have somewhat oily skin. This product goes on smooth, feels light and silky. No oily greasy feeling all day. I've used it without makeup and with, with great resukts! Thank you L'Oreal, for making a magnificent moisturizer with added glow! Love it!"
"I bought this product along with the matching Serum a week ago and have not looked back. Like others have written here, on lazy days I just wear this product without makeup and my face looks radiant with a slightly rosy healthy glow. It feels wonderful on my skin and smells great too. Love, love, love it!! Thank you Loreal."
I received this to try and I have been very pleased with it. I love the subtle color that it gives to my face. It makes my skin feel a little tight after applying but not in a bad way. I will certainly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't know what to expect when first trying Age Perfect Cell Renewal. By rubbing into my entire face, I was concerned my skin would turn red. Instead, it had a rosy glow that seemed to come from within, rather than from something applied on top. What a nice surprise to look and feel sunny and bright. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure about the rosy color at first. Upon using the cream daily, I find my complexion is warmer color and definitely softer. I would recommend this product to all my friends. Thank you for letting me enjoy this experience! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as part of a Sampling and Review Campaign. I immediately noticed the beautiful color and scent of the cream. I have been applying it every morning for the past 8 days. Monday thru Friday I wear it under my liquid foundation. On the weekends, I only wear the moisturizer. I have noticed a tremendous change in the clarity and brightness of my skin as well as the texture."
I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for a couple of weeks now, and it's the only one I use day and night since then."
"It's perfect for my skin, because iit makes iit feel fresh and firm, light and even toned and smooth."
"You can see the results in just a couple of days, and the skin just keeps looking younger and firmer with time. I almost don't need to wear makeup any longar!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'll be honest .. I was very skeptical when I got this product... however from the minute I opened the jar I've been impressed! The fragrance is great .. the cream wasn't greasy ( I have oily skin) and it made my face feel so soft and gave my skin a healthy glow!
I will definitely keep using this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product goes on smooth but does not have the moisturizing depth I require. For less dry skin it would probably work fine. Also, I have medium olive skin so the rosy tint never Surfaced for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this to try and have been using it for a week. I have noticed a change in the feel of my skin, it feels smoother. I do notice a bot of a rosy glow when I first apply it but not afterward. I love the way it feels on my skin, it is super moisturizing and non-greasy. My skin feels really good after applying. The scent is also pleasant and not too strong. I will continue to use it to see if I reap even more benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using for a week. It is a great moisturizer. I have some age spots so I am not entirely comfortable going without my base makeup. I did not notice a rosy tint on my skin. What I did love about it was moisturizing all day without feeling greasy. Stayed in place and my base make up glided smoothly over top. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received Cell Renewal* Rosy Tone Moisturizer from L'Oreal to review. Seeing the pink tone of the moisturizer I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. However upon use, it left my skin with a dewey fresh look. To the touch, the moisturizer felt silky and left my skin feeling soft smooth. I was pleasantly surprised! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this cream a week ago and I'm impressed with how soft my skin feels. The cream feels like silk and putting it is easily absorbed. I like the way my skin feels and looks after using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Fair warning - I am a notorious sceptic!!! I tried this product expecting to be disappointed as I have been by countless other moisturizers. After three days I couldn't stop running my fingers across my cheeks to feel the smoothness. This is the real thing!!! Amazingly, my skin is much softer and smoother than it was just 10 days ago. I even called my daughter to rave and urge her to buy a jar (she did). Run, don't walk, to get a jar of this magic for yourself! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have received this product and have been using it for 2 weeks, i have to say that i am very satisfied with this lotion/cream."
"It moisturizes my dry skin and gives it a nice glow all day, it has a good, gentle smell too. I will definitely buy, and recommend for mature and dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this stuff! My face is so dry and this goes on so smoothly and I've noticed a positive improvement in my skin. This has helped with my uneven skin tone and I can see results in just a week and a half. I love the tint of color which eliminates that dull and sagging look and it's not greasy at all! LOVE IT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample via vibrant nation to submit comments. I like the thickness of the product but not on my face and neck. It feels heavy and sticky even after several hours. I have used it on my hands and lower arms as well with better results. No visable difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this from Vibrant Nation, but I'll be buying it myself from now on. It really does do exactly what it claims, adding a subtle but apparent rosy glow to the complexion. It's also a very effective daytime moisturizer. My only complaint would be that it doesn't have SPF, but hey - when my skin looks this good, I have no problem applying a separate sunscreen.

"I received a free sample of this product. I'm 47, at during the fall/winter months, my skin looks a bit pale and dull. I was very excited to try this product since it provides a pink tone.The texture is good - not greasy yet moisturizing. The rosy tone is definitely a bonus. What I didn't like was the strong fragrance.Way too strong! Could do without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for about a week now. Really like the thicker texture and the way it absorbs quickly. I have been applying the product both day and night and really like the way it makes my skin feel softer and smoother. This product is excellent for those who do not wear foundation but like a soft rosy glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this cream for about a month now and haven't seen any difference in my skin. I have not seen any evidence of a rosy glow except in the jar. The cream is incredibly thick and not easy to spread. It is very heavy so only suitable for dry winter conditions. It will be far too heavy for me to use in summer time. This is the best smelling cream I've used. So I'm stowing the jar until colder temps prevail.
I received a sample of this to review. It feels great on my face all day. Light but full coverage. It's so hard for me to find something that won't make my skin oily by the end of the day. Improved the look and feel of my skin. I will definitely buy this when my sample is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first day I used this glowy creme, I didn't apply any makeup over it as I was headed to the gym. TWO people mentioned how good my skin looked! I had to check myself out in the mirror! Sure enough, I looked remarkably good for being at the gym! I had a beautiful rosy tone to my skin (not the sweaty kind of glow)! Since then, this rich creme has given my foundation a beautiful warmth and richness like nothing else I've ever used.Thrilled? Absolutely! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first got this product, I thought I was asking a lot from one little container of cream. I'm a naturally pasty girl and the winter wind had left my face downright flaky. Age Perfect to the rescue! It adds just a hint of color, without looking phony. And bye-bye flaky skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for about 2 1/2 weeks and have found that my skin does look healthier and brighter even during these winter months when I usually get very pale. I was concerned that the ""rosy"" tone might be too pink for me, but instead it jut provides a healthy look. I love how light it feels when I use it and have had no issues with break-out, being too dry or too oily, etc. It's a great balance and my skin looks and feels smooth and healthy.

I've tried L'Oréal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer daily in the morning for a week and I can already see a difference.
First of all the texture is non greasy. The rosy color is not a foundation. It blends into my skin. It brightens skin and evens the tone of your skin. It helps fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used high end face creams as well as skincare bought at mass marketers. I will say I was surprised (and pleasantly so) at everything about this cream: texture, fragrance, moisturizing ability. And over the past two weeks, I had TWO unsolicited comments on my skin (one of them specifically about the tone). The only thing I'd like to change is something other than a jar. It can be challenging as the cream goes down! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for 3 weeks. I love the feel of this Renewal cream. It is not greasy at all and leave a luminous not glittery tone to your face. My face is especially dry at this time of the year and I can really tell a difference in the face. i notice this diffence after using the product for approximatley one week.

"WAS SENT THIS TWO WEEKS AGO FROM 'VIBRANTNATION' TO SAMPLE & REVIEW....A FULL-SIZED JAR!!! THIS HAS CHANGED MY SKIN FROM THE VERY FIRST USAGE & EVERY DAY I USE IT, IT MAKES MY SKIN BETTER.

I have been looking for this product forever!! I love the extremely creamy texture with zero greasiness! Moisture rich and soaks in immediately and the softness lasts and lasts. Results were noticable and appreciated!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I adore this product. It arrived right before the holidays and rescued my over dry, over tired skin. It is light but works like a charm, absorbs instantly and is not greasy, perfect for my middle-age combination skin. This product is a win and helped me glow through the holidays! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received as a trial offer. At the beginning I thought the rose scent was a little strong as the moisturer I had been using is unscented. The cream applies easily and the rose tint is just enough that going out without make up I still felt pretty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have problems with many skincare products--my skin is very sensitive to ingredients in many products. I'm thrilled to say that after two weeks of daily use, I have had no reaction to Age Perfect Cell Renewal! My face is moisturized and does hold a rosy glow. It has a really nice fragrance, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of Age Perfect and I was excited to try it. At first when I saw the pink color in the cream I thought that my fair skin with rosy pink cheeks, would be too pink after using the product. I was so wrong. I saw a visible difference in my skin after a few days of use. My skin felt smooth and moist. The best news was when a friend told me my skin glowed and asked what I was using on my skin. A compliment says it all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a sample two weeks ago and tried immediately. Since it is non-greasy, it is easy to apply make up after morning application. My skin feels fresh as if I just a facial. My skin looks refreshed like I had a good nights sleep. The results were obvious after the first five days. I look forward to continue using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product in the mail from L'Oreal. I really loved the way it made my skin feel after using it for only three days. I am very sensitive to products and this did not break my skin out. The one things I loved a lot about it is that my skin was smooth and noticeably had a glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin was flaky and sensitive and none of the moisturizers I used helped much. I just tried Loreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal. It is lightly scented and is moisturizing but not greasy. It is a lovely light shade of pink. I gently rubbed it on my face and my flakiness disappeared instantly. I love that it gives my face a natural flow. I will definitely buy this moisturizer again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was a free full size sample to try. It's kinda pasty in consistency. I like a creamier feel. The fragrance free makes it smell unusual. I like fragrance. There has been no change in ny skin. I was already moisturizing twice daily before trying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Awesome, really shimmers, helps tightens skin, giving a firm feel. Also gives an all-time coverage."
Does not give rosy glow as advertised and has too much perfume scent.
This is my newfound bestfriend when it comes to skin moisture!
I'd buy this stuff in a second if it had any SPF protection
For me this feels very heavy and tacky. I prefer a much more creamy product
I really love this moisturizer! It is very hydrating!!
Good product. Works as well as much more expensive creams
Goes on smoothly and evens out facial color. Help other face products go on smoothly too.
Adds a healthy glow to mature skin. I love it! Great
love it for people who are over 65 gives a little color to face
"It takes very little and spreads good, my face smooth and moisture. Highly recommended!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Fells light on skin and saw results within a week. Made me feel as though my skin has a glow before use my skin was dull.
"I received a sample of this product in a magazine a few months ago. This made my face so soft, bright and rosy!! Love it!!"
I like the product very much when applied as a base under my foundation. it really improves the final look.
I have noticed sand grain sized white beads in the cream. I find 3-5 a day. Hasn't stopped me from using it. My skin looks great! I'm just curious.
"I would prefer it didn't have a scent, not particularly pleasing. Haven't been using it long enough to know it will renew cells."
"It works, I noticed a definate softening of my skin and wrinkles disappeared. I love that rosey tint!"
The moisturizer is soft and silky and gives my skin a rosey glow so I don't have to wear makeup. Not bad for 62!
Imparts a subtle pink hue to skin. Feels good and smells good. My skin looks less tired since using. Very happy with product and will buy again.
I received a free sample and loved the slight tint. It was easy to apply. And absorbed quickly. Made my face look and feel great. Thank you!

Bought this expecting a Rosy glow with moisture for skin coming out of a dry winter. Found it ended more drying on my skin. Went back to my age perfect cream
"I bought this at my local drug store and I really love the creamy texture, the soft rosy tint and I happen to love the light scent. I just wish they offered it with SPF protection!"
Love this product. I have dry aging sallow skin. This product changes the texture and adds brightness. People think I am 10 years younger than I am.
"I bought this without checking the reviews, wish i had checked them. Love the feel of the product but the smell is awful can't hardly stand to wear it, and my husband thought i got some sort of chemical on me, lol which i guess i do."
I agree with the other reviewers. The rosy cream is lovely but the scent is overpowering. It lingers longer than I'd expected. Please offer an unscented option. I don't think I can handle long-term use with this heavy fragrance.
I am 66 years young. My skin was very dry so I decided to try this product. I love the way it made my skin look and feel so much that I gave up wearing makeup. I only use this product and have noticed my skin looks and feels so much better.
Cream is silky smooth as my face is after I apply. Gives me a color glow that makes feel I can go face the world. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I recently bought this as I am turning 60 & my skin has changed. This cream was so nice putting on. It glided on w/a hint of a fresh rosy tint to the skin making my face come alive again! I loved the texture and found that I didn't have to add much foundation which gives you a fresher look. I also use the Loreal Skin Renewal & the HydraFresh which are also wonderful products!
I have been using this moisturizer for 3 weeks and love it! Tonight I looked in the mirror and can definitely tell a difference in my skin tone! The lines around my mouth and eyes are definitely much less noticeable! Love the improvement to my facial skin tone and definitely recommend!!! Thank you for such an awesome moisturizer!! (3 of my co-workers have commented on my facial glow!)
I absolutely love this moisturizer. The rosy tint is fabulous. It does have a subtle floral scent but that's not a deal breaker for me. Great moisture and goes on so creamy. My skin looks and feels so soft and smooth. It is really hard to find and a little pricey. Just order it online and you shouldn't have any problems. Only issue I have is it does not contain an SPF.

"Altho' I love the texture of this moisturizer and the fact that it has a very light scent, after about 1/4 of the way into my 2nd jar I had to stop using it. I loved the ""glow"" it gave me but I hated the fact that my darker spots (that I had worked so hard with Vitamin C products to fade) began to become darker and more prominent. How sad! Once I stopped this moisturizer and went back to the Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition moisturizer, within a few days the spots had faded again. So altho' I loved it, it is not for me. :-("
"I was lucky enough to have received a free sample from PINCHme in the mail. At first I was skeptical about what my results would be. However, after using the product I must say I was wrong.

"Recently, I received a L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream sample from Pinchme. What an awesome product! I felt so pretty with it on my cheeks. This product would be perfect for when it's Winter and I need color to erase those Winter blues. The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream sample was easy to apply. I like this product so much better than blush because it blends well. The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream is truly ""Luxury at it's Finest""."
"I received a free sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream and loved it. It went on smoothly, felt creamy and I loved the slight rose tone to it.

"When I was given a chance to try L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream, I was very excited. I had seen the ads and thought it was a lovely idea. I could think of lots of older women that this would benefit. I have been using tinted moisturizers for years, but they are flesh toned, or beige, essentially. When I used this, I was surprised at how my skin looked. I loved it! I never, ever would of ithought using a rose tone on my skin, but it was great!

I received a sample of this product to try and am sorry to say that I was disappointed. I did not like the smell at all. It smelled like I had put perfume on my face.

"The samples were small but still it went on smoothly and did leave my face very soft as for a rosy tone yes it did give a bit of a tint I personally would not but this not because I didn't like it cause I did, it's the cost and I'm on disability [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Rosy Tone Cream from PINCHME. I really loved how it made my skin feel with just a hint of pink color to it. It didn't make me look like I had a rash either like some other products do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample from Pinchme in exchange for my honest opinion on the product. I'm 46 yo and my skin is changing - is losing the youthful look. The sample was small so I really couldn't put the right amount on my face to get a fair opinion. From what I could see that it had a nice texture and went on smoothly on my skin. It did leave a rosy tint to my face. I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got a sample through Pinch Me. I had a sample of the mask and the L'Oreal mask and the age perfect rosy glow moisturizer. There was nothing in the mask sample except air so I can't review that. The moisturizer was very nice though. Enough for two uses. It felt nice on my skin and did not have too much color. I will purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received a free sample from Pinch Me and was a little skeptical. I used it for 2 days and I must say this is the perfect moisturizer for me. My skin is glowing, looks fresh and some of my fine lines are invisible. This is the kind a moisturizer I been looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of Loreal Age Perfect from Pinch Me, even though it was a small sample I was able to use it for 2 days.

I intend on purchasing this because at age 63 anything that makes me feel better about myself is great!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample from PinchMe in exchange for this review. i am so happy I was selected because I never would have spent the money for this product without a sample first. I liked it as a moisturizer that was light for this time of year and it did not make my face feel oily. However, I am still unsure about the 'rosy"" part but I will hold out hope for after I purchase and use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a sample to review from PinchMe for my honest review. I really liked how good it felt on my skin. Not greasy and very supple healthy feeling to my skin.

I received a sample of L'Oreal Paris age perfect rosy tone cream and after the 2nd time of using it i fell i love with it. Even in the TX heat my skin is feeling much more hydrated and softer almost all day. The cream is really light weight and so very easy to apply. It isn't sticky at all.

"I received a sample in the mail of L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream. I used it on my face the next day after showering. Florida is too hot during the day, especially in summer, to wear make up. I have an olive complexion and my face could look dull without make up. This product put the life back in my complexion and looks great in bright sun. The rosy scent is delicious. I bought two at the store. One for my daughter.

I received a free trial of Age perfect cell renewal Rosy tone cream by L'OREAL from PINCHme and i really liked the cream it made my skin feel so soft and smooth but the Rosy tone color was a little to much for my skin color . I would say it would be awesome for some woman depending on how much rosy color you want your face to have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of the Loreal Rosy Complexion and at first I was a little hesitant about using it because my skin is sensitive. Much to my surprise, it did not bother me at all and my complexion had a beautiful rosy glow. I will definitely purchase it."
I received a sample of this from pinchme. I liked the creaminess of it. Trying a sample for a day or two doesn't really show you an overall effect. I'm the time i used it I saw no change. It did keep my face hydrated throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

[Declarative: I was given a sample of this product for the purposes of review.]
"My experience was yes, lots of silky hydration, but not quite as rosy as I'd imagined. I have rather stubborn skin so I'd likely chalk that up to the reason behind my 'lesser rosie-ness'. But all-in-all, a fine item to add to one's skincare regime :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of the mask through my PINCHMe account. I enjoyed the mask overall, but it left my skin a little too moisturized. If you don't have an issue with excess moisturization, then you'll love this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product is  creamy yet light weight. It feels good as it goes into my skin, providing me with long lasting moisture and a definite firming and softening of my skin as well as even skin tone..  I have purchased creams that were very expensive, which did not do as much as this product.  I only wish I had a larger sample to give more of an opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream. The cream goes on your face feeling very soft and light. It does indeed give your skin a rosy tone. I very much liked the way my face felt but I'm not as sure that I like the rosy appearance on my face. Very unique product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of the L'Oreal rosy glow moisturizer and mask in my pinch me mask, and I really liked it. Not only did it make my skin feel all soft and smooth, but my skin looked so fresh and glowing. In fact my husband, who never notices anything, said that my face looked pretty and he wanted to know what I did differently. Thank you for making a product that catches even my husband's eye. I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream from PinchME. The overall feel of the cream was very silky which I liked. But I didn't see any rosy tone to my skin, so I didnt feel like it lived up to its claims. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample and while the cream was light and fluffy and moisturized well, I did not notice a rosey tint to my skin. Perhaps my sample was too small. It was a nice product for what it does for your skin, but the rosey tint I just did not get."
"I received a sample of the Loreal Age Perfect cell renewal. I liked the texture of the gel mask. It was easy to apply and rinse off. After using it for a couple of days, my skin felt soft and had a light pinkish glow. I also liked the flowery fragrance. It is pricey, but I will buy some and see how long the 2 ounce jar lasts.

"I received a FREE SAMPLE of the Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream. I tried it several times and found that this does not absorb as quickly as I would like- it felt sticky on my face and finally absorbed after 2 hours. Also, it leaves a scent after applying; while some people may like this, I do not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my free sample and it did give my skin a rosy glow. My skin felt smoother but it was not as creamy as I would like making it harder to spread on my face. I feel that used regularly it would improve the condition of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received a sample to try. It smelled & applied great but I did not like the rosy tone. I would buy if it were an anti-aging product minus the rosy tone as I really liked the consistency of the cream. I would recommend to someone who could use it, but it's not my taste.

"This product is easy to apply & did seem to even out my skin tone and texture. The scent was pleasant enough, it didn't bother me (I can be sensitive to scent).

"I received the Age Perfect sample in my pinch me box. I was very interested in a product that provided a rosy tint. Upon application the tint was almost too obvious, but it quickly faded into non existent. Unfortunately the fragrance of this product will prevent me from buying more to see extended results. Cream was light and whipped and went on with no greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I do like the rosy tone that this gives to my skin. Does bring softness and smooth feeling skin back. I feel that it does give me a glow. The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is it was a little pricey for me.

"I was sent a sample of L'oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal by Pinch me. I did not use it for awhile as I needed to apply the mask, and leave on 5 minutes. That doesn't sound too hard, but, I just didn't seem to find the 5 minutes of ""quiet"" time... When, I did finally did apply the mask, it went on smooth, and the fragrance was sooo relaxing. my skin felt refreshed and oh, so clean. Thank You Pinch me and L'oreal..

"The way this item is described you'd think my face would turn into Jennifer Anniston's after using it. Calm down on all the ""claims"" and stick to the FACTS. It does make your face softer, it is a next texture...it doesn't leave my face with this rosey glow, it doesn't remove my wrinkles at ALL. Nothing does that. This is a nice cream though, it doesn't have an offensive odor. It did NOT make my wrinkles disappear after 7 days of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I got a free sample of this. I personally did not like it. The rose smell was overwhelming to me and I my face didn't have a rosy glow. I looked more like I was working out and was red in the face. Not for me. Sorry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this sample from pinch me and I must say I am very impressed. It has softened, smooth and brought my dull skin back to life.

I have very sensitive skin and this product never affected me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a free sample from PINCHme. It had a nice subtle fragrance. It went on easily and wasn't greasy. I was warm from taking a shower, so I'm not sure about the rosy tone of my skin coming from the moisturizer or not. My skin did feel soft, even after one use. The amount was too small to know if over time it would improve my skin, and that's why I'm only giving it a four instead of a 5 rating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received a 1 use sample. Unfortunately It wasn't enough to really have an opinion, but based on that 1 use, it wasn't really flattering and felt a little to thick.

"I received sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell renewal 'a rosy regimen'. I was a bit skeptical. I gave it a try on just any ordinary do nothing day in case I did not like it. Well it was really pretty, softened my skin and left a very lovely rosy glow."
I simply adore this moisturizer. It is creamy. It feels good on my face.
It does moisturize and softens my face. The Rosy Tone Cell Renewal works best in the morning after my shower and at night after I remove my makeup. It is my every day moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a sample of L'Oreal age perfect rosy skin cream from PinchMe in exchange for my review. I liked the cream a lot. It moisturizes wonderfully, adds a “rosy” glow to skin and you could feel it working all day. Other similar creams I've tried tend to wear off quickly or feel like they stop working, but the L'Oreal worked great. I would highly recommend it.

"I was sent a sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal to try. I found it to be easy to use, with no irritation, it felt luxurious on my skin. I will continue to use it everyday, loved the way it made my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thanks to Pinch me I received this sample of L'oreal Age Perfect Cell renewal Rosy Tone Cream . This product felt Luxurious on my skin and left my complexion looking more youthful . I find most of their products to be top of the line and for a fraction of the cost of department store skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of Age Perfect and I love it, makes my skin glow and feel so smooth. The price is a little high for me so not sure if I will by buying it, but would recommend it to anyone who can afford it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I recieved a sample of L'Oreal Rosy tone From My friends at Pinchme and L'oreal
First thanks to both of you! The product was new and felt good on my face. Of course a sample is what it says. This is a great product from L'Oreal as a light skin older woman i liked the product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried Loreal Cell Renewal Rosy Glow as part of a free sample website. I loved it. Not too much color, but just enough. Made my skin feel nice and smooth. Would recommend this product and hope they would like it as much as I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didnt care for this product. It moisturizes well but had a strong perfume scent. My face stays red so i didnt care for the rosy glow part. I use alot of Loreal products and love them all. I just wasnt crazy about this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of this and I have mixed reviews. I love the color and it does fill out the fine lines, but it was too heavy for my skin. I got itchy. My daughter also tried this and loved it. I would recommend it to others, just not for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really didn't like the Loreal Paris Rosy Tone Moisturizer because it rubbed off of my face and I found it to be very greasy...... I wish that I could say something better about Loreal Paris Rosy Tone Moisturizer,but I can't and I am being truthful...... Also if there's anything else in the Loreal product that you have to try then I will be willing to try any item you have out..... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a small sample of Age Perfect rose tone cream, it seems to make my skin softer and give it a slight rose tint. My skin has become dry and dull as I age so, I would definitely try it next time I need a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received a sample of the Age Perfect Cell Renewal product and I found it to be moisturizing and did make my skin feel very silky. However I'm not a huge fan of fragrance in my skin & hair care products so I would have probably enjoyed it more if it was unscented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this sample from Pinchme I liked that it went on easiy and felt light...the scent was a bit much but the little bit of rosey-tone blended in nicely with my freckled face. I need to use more to really see if it has a real effect on my face but I liked the feeling it gave. (soft) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of L'OREAL Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rose Tone Cream in the mail. Another sample of another cream. But this was different. First it smelled amazing. It went on smoothly and I had no reaction with my sensitive skin. It wasn't greasy or oily or heavy, yet it wasn't watery either. It glided on and did indeed leave a glow. I was very impressed. I will be buying this with coupons and sales. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this cream a couple weeks ago. Since then I have noticed a more even, brighter skin tone. This is a very nice cream that is light and smooth. It does not feel oily or heavy on my face. It has a very faint, clean fragrance too. I would recommend this to anyone looking to brighten up their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this about a month a go and I like how it glides on and absorbs easy. I find it lightweight and it has a light pleasent odor. I didn't think it moistured as well as some other products but, I liked it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Rosy cream and really liked it , but the sample was rather small , so it was hard to know whether there are added benefits to using it regularly. It did seem to brighten my complexion and it went on very smoothly and wasn't heavy . I will have to buy the product to really know how well it works .

I received a free sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal from #PINCHme. My skin is a little dry and this made it feel drier plus the scent was stronger than expected. Not unpleasant but a little overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't' mind the fragrance in this product although I would have preferred it without fragrance. The main thing I didn't like was that
my face look too shiny after using the product. So this is probably a product that I wouldn't use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried a sample from Pinchme. It was nice and smooth, but my skin tone didn't quite agree with the tone once applied. It does look a little youthful, but at my age it didn't feel natural with my wrinkles and gray hair. It has a great fell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this about a month ago in a sample size. There needed to be more in the sample as there was not enough to cover my face. It did smell good an went on smoothly. Not sure if I like the rosy coloring. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of Loreal cell renewal Rosy glow from Piinchme. I tried it and went right out and bought a full size bottle. This stuff is amazing. My skin really does glow, it looks healthy and younger. Super smooth and soft. It has a light pleasant scent. I have since bought several more bottles and gave out as gifts. My mom and best friend loved it as well. You can't go wrong with this. It will now always be a part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of L'Oreal's Rosy Tone Mask from PinchMe and found it to be an excellent product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a little expensive for me as I live on a fixed income. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved a sample of the age Perfect Rosy Tone product. I love the moisturization, although it was a bit difficult to apply. I wasn't really happy with the scent. But, the rosy tone I usually have was perked up quite a bit with this product and my skin felt great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a sample of the L'Oreal age perfect free from my pinchme box. I am so happy to have received it it made my skin feel wonderful and the smell did not bother me at all I truly recommend this to anyone who wants to feel great skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of L'Oreal® Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Moisturizer from PinchMe for evaluation. I think I will be buying a jar based on the sample. It is meant to be used in the morning as part of your daily beauty routine. It adds a light healthy glow to my skin and makes it really smooth. Do not expect a full coverage color from this, that's not what it's meant for! The scent is pretty strong, but not offensive. 4 stars because I prefer unscented face products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this as a sample and I like the lightness and non-greasy feel. Even thou I do not wear any kind of make-up I do like the results which was -can't believe I'm saying this) pretty impressive.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoyed the moisturizing feel when I first applied the cream but my face began to feel dry within an hour or two. I think this product was made for someone who doesn't have very dry skin like I do. I would recommend it to a friend who needed a lighter degree of moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a sample and unfortunately, with only the one application I can't say whether this works or not. I didn't notice any difference. It's too bad they can't give you at least a week's worth to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product and thought it was good as far as moisturizing, but I wish it had a stronger Rose tint. Since it is a day cream, I want to use it instead of foundation. Being fairly pale, I would prefer more of an overall blush to help me look more youthful and less drawn out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of this from Pinch me - from the minute I used it I could see a glow on my skin. There wasn't enough for me to use continuously but it has made be intrigued enough to buy a full jar of it. It feels soft when you put on and blends in easily. I thought it smelled good as others have made complaints. I will definitely be buying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this a week ago, and I like it.I wasn't sure if I would.After, using one product for quite some time.It left my face feeling soft and smooth, and after a week or so of using this, I began to see a difference in my skin.I am very happy with this product.

I received this as a sample from Pinch Me and I'm glad I did! L'Oréal Age Perfect is perfect for aging skin. My wrinkles seemed less visible and my skin smoother. The fragrance is wonderful which leaves on feeling pampered! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of this facial cream and I really liked it. The rosy color of the cream was such a brilliant addition and left a nice glow to my skin. I didn't love the scent but it didn't last very long so it was tolerable for me. Overall, the cream left my face feeling soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried a sample of this Loreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream at night before sleep. I have light skin so it did turn my skin pink. I have a need for moisturizer and just one sample may not have been enough. I like this product but am not sure if I would purchase or recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample of this in a Pinchme Box. I am 60 years old with very dry skin. I've used many different moisturizers. The Loreal Age Perfect felt nice going on and made my skin feel soft. I did not notice any Rosy glow though....but that's OK. I still liked it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got a free sample of L'Oreal age perfect makeup. I already used and trusted L'Oreal products. They are a leader in hair and skin care. As I'm getting older and living in the South I've started using more facial products. This smells nice and was gentle on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the way this product smells and feels. A bit thicker than most of the moisturizers that I've used. Have not really noticed a difference in my skin tone but have only used a small sample provided. I do love the L'Oreal brand overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So easy to use! Feels natural. Helped my skin regain it's ""youthful"" glow. Doesn't feel greasy while applying to your skin. It sure did make my tired and old skin look so much better. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the first time I've tried such a product is this so I'm not sure as to what I should be expecting. To be honest with you other than washing my face and putting moisturizer on it I don't do anything now to my skin after years and years of being sick and bedridden. For me it's all about no fuss no muss and be blessed with what God gave you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample In my PinchMe box and was so glad I did. It felt so light and clean on my face with just a hint of color...I applied it after a shower and went about my day of errands and my face felt so fresh and dewey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Cream a few weeks ago because I was intreagued by it's color. It's lightweight, has a beautiful rosy undertone and a subtle scent. I like the fact that I can put this in by itself and run out to do errands and feel a bit made up. The price point is in line with other products out there but I think I'll be making this a part of my daily ritual. Not greasy at all. A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the way LOREAL Age Perfect made my skin feel, though I wish the scent was a little less. It was a bit overwhelming. Beyond the scent, I do love the results of the cream. My skin feels smoother, the fine lines are less noticeable and I will happily recommended to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this from Pinch Me in their free sample box. It performed like most L'Oreal products, very well. I was happy with the feel and look of my skin after using this product for approximately a week. It corrected some dark spots that I had on my face, yeah! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried this when I got the sample, and totally fell in love with it. The color was very subtle and my skin felt so smooth. Great product, told my friends and definitely going to buy both the moisturizer and face mask. In combination they work best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since using this cream I have noticed a slight difference in my skin tone. With that being said I think it is a little to thick and the scent is a little overbearing. Probably would not recommend since I feel there are better products available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The 1st thing I noticed was that it was not your typical white cream. In addition to the color, it feels creamier and goes on very smoothly. It felt good on my skin and left it soft and not oily. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been interested in trying this product and was excited when I was able to receive a sample of this from Pinchme. The Age Perfect Rosy Tone applies easily and lasts all day. I like that it adds a little bit of blush to my skin. At age 50, I no longer have the natural blush in my cheeks that I used to! I like this product and will be purchasing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a big Makeup nor face cream person, but was willing to give it a shot. It was expected of my experience. I didn't care for the rosy tone, its was a bit unnatural for me. And a bit heavy in my opinion. And as it is a cream, I didn't like the way it spread on. But that said, as I'm not a Makeup nor face cream person, this may work fantastic for another person, just not this person [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product and liked the feel and texture. Was moisturizing, however due to my olive complexion, the rosiness from the product wasn't very noticeable. Only reason I wouldn't buy again is that my skin doesn't show the rosiness but overall it's a nice lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the texture and smell of this product. it made my skin fell soft and smooth.
"While i have very pale skin, i occasionally blotch red so I don't think i will but it."
but it was a very good moisturizer; especially for women of a certain age like me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I went through my first jar of this cream and LOVED the results. I needed help with fine lines and the overall texture of my skin. This cream made my skin noticeably softer and smoother. I had to buy a second bottle after I was done the first bottle and saw the wonderful results. I will definetly continue to use this product!
"My aging skin has never looked or felt better! I have a rosy glow that I'm happy with and, most days, I now skip foundation and opt for simple concealer and a sheer powder. I get more complements now than I have in 30 years. I look fantastic and I love it!"
Thank You for making this wonderful product.
"LOreal Paris Age Perfect Rosy Moisturizer is very silky and leaves my skin very smooth, and with a slightly rose glow. My only criticism would be I'm not crazy about the scent.. thought it would be a light floral, but its not.. hard to describe, almost like cardboard. So that was disappointing. Fortunately it dissipates. Other than that, feels very nice on my skin."
"I never do reviews, but this moisturizer deserves one! This stuff is amaaaaaazing!! I had surgery 2 months ago and the anesthesia left my skin on my face feeling incredibly dry. After trying several moisturizers, this product is the only one that worked. My face feels better than ever!! It has a tiny bit of color, and smells wonderful. It deserves 10 stars!!"
"I tried this moisturizer with very high expectations, but was very disappointed. It leaves my skin with an unpleasant grainy feeling — the way I would feel after being on the beach — sandy/salty!! I had to immediately rinse it off after drying. Will be returning this product!"
I am so glad I was able to try this product. It has helped my skin so much. The moisterizing portion stays with you all day long and the rosy part puts a nice rosy color to your face that looks very natural. I have light skin with feckles and some age spots. I'm 60 years old. :o) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have seen this moisturizer on TV ads and thought at the time I would like to try this. I did try it and I love it!! It gives a brightness to the face along with a little color and I think it really helps with dull and colorless complexion. This moisturizer is a keeper and I will make it a part of my daily routine from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product and was asked to try for a week and then review. I have used it each morning as directed and am happy to report that I really like the texture of my skin and the natural rosy glow my cheeks now have. It is absorbed quickly but leaves a light dewy feel I really like. The smell is nice too. I gave it 4 stars because I'm disappointed the natural blush color is only visible on the cheeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product for 40-somethings to introduce into the world of anti-aging skin cream for mature skin. I love the results of a healthy glow to my skin and my smooth texture increased several days into using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given a jar to try and review. I love the feel of it, creamy and not too oily or gummy. I have a fair complexion and no skin issues so I'm glad the cream did not seem to clog up pores. It seems to give a slight glow under the lights, just a little color and seem to plump up the tiny lines at sides of my mouth and outer corners of my eyes. But I think I may need to try another product to tighten my emerging loose neck skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could tell as soon as I put this on that it was great. It smells wonderful and the rosy glow is nice but not obvious. As I've aged, I actually use less make-up - no foundation now just a little cover cream for those age spots - and this cream gives me a nice glow that makes up for the lack of product. My skin looks healthier than it has it years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given this product for free to help facilitate my review here. I like that this age perfect cream is light weight and makes my skin feel soft.

"I received a sample of L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal to try, and I'm so glad that I did. The cream is light, non-greasy, and leaves a delicate, rosy shimmer on my face each time that I apply it. I have combination skin, and this has helped prevent both dry patches and oily areas. My skin feels softer and healthier, and it definitely looks more vibrant. I would highly recommend the Age Perfect Cell Renewal, and I've already recommended it to my friends. Thanks, L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the most amazing cream ever. I am on bio-identical hormones and have been suffering discolored skin and breakouts and within one week of using this, my skin looks younger, clearer and the discoloration vanishes when I put it on. My critical mother-in-law remarked on how good my skin looks and asked what I am using.It is lightweight and easy to apply and lasts all day. I will continue to use it daily and know there will be even more spectacular results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that Helen Mirren is the spokeswoman for this product. I'm also a big fan of L'Oréal, so my expectations were high. Age Perfect Cell Renewal didn't let me down. It kept my skin hydrated and lasted all day. I have lots of pink to my skin anyway, so I was afraid it might be too pink, but not at all. Keep up the good work, L'Oréal, and I'll keep using your products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a sample. I had been wanting to give it a try. I am so glad I did. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated without being greasy. I also love the glow that this product gives your skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the texture of this product. It's creamy and spreads so smoothly on my face. It does give you a rosy glow so I don't even use foundation over it. The fragrance is a little strong at first but after a few days I don't even notice it. The only thing that bothers me is the addition of parabens. I wish this product didn't have any! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was chosen to sample this product and am very happy with the results. After just a couple days my son & boyfriend noticed that my skin looked healthier and I had a natural, healthier glow!! The product is so creamy and rich and is an absolute delight to use. I could see a difference only after 2-3 days. Really feels great when you apply to your face and the results are awesome!!

"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Loreal Age Perfect. I am in my early 50's, and although I think my skin looks okay, this product really makes my skin feel AND look good. I have been using it a short while only, and I cannot wait to see the results over an even longer period of time! *I did receive this for free, however this does not influence my review whatsoever.

"I was chosen to sample Age Perfect and submit a review. First off, I am not one to fuss with how I look. I used this product for a week and I will continue to use it. My skin tones are all over the place and after I apply Age Perfect I have even skin tones, smoother looking skin, and a smile on my face. Thank you for creating such a great product!

"I really liked the product, especially the smell! The texture was not too thick or heavy. It seemed rosy at first. As far as if it changed my skin, it's hard to tell on a 60 year old after one week of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product feels thick-ish in the jar, but doesn't feel heavy, sticky, or thick on the skin. The texture is very smooth and light feeling. Although it's pink, I don't think that it has enough color to affect my skintone -- which is a good thing. Fairly strong fragrance of almond extract (or maraschino cherries). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Got this product to try out and first tried it on the back of my hands and it helped with the wrinkled skin and wanted to make sure my skin didn't have any sensitivities to the product. Then tried it on my face, neck and décolletage and have seen improvements in skin tone and appearance. Haven't been using it long enough yet to see a reduction in wrinkles yet but will keep trying it to see if it reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles.

I received a sample of this moisturizer and have used it daily for about one week. I agree with other reviewers this moisturizer is non-oily and has a matte finish that is much like a primer. I have medium olive toned skin and did not notice any rosy tint. I would prefer that this contained sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is wonderful. My skin has a tendency to be dry and tight. Since I have been using this cream my skin feels hydrated all day. It goes into the skin and feels silky and not sticky. My foundation goes on better too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this moisturizer in the mail and have been using it for a week. I'm impressed. I am 71 years old and have dry, washed out skin. Your product keeps my face soft all day, and I like the color it provides. I have used other L'Oreal products as well, and I like all I have used. I plan to get the nighttime moisturizer also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a wonderful feel on the skin--not too heavy, but not so light it feels like nothing. I love the rosy color and don't worry about it really tinting your face. It doesn't. Just a rosy glow like the name. My skin is much more hydrated and feels healthier. I would give this 5 stars if it had any SPF in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a full size jar of this product to test & write a review. One of my friends has been raving about this product since it first came out. I wasn't sure if I would like the rosy tone with my olive skin but after using it for a week I think it has evened out my skin tone a bit. It has a nice feel & adds just a hint of color.

"I really like this product. After using it for about a week or so, my face felt softer and smoother. There is a very pleasant light scent to it, and my face felt immediately better when I applied it. It was almost like I could feel it starting to work!

I was asked to try out this product and as I'm always looking for a new product to help with my aging skin and skin tone I was happy to participate. I really like the way my skin has a rosier glow to it and feels smooth after using this product for about 10 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product 3 weeks ago. The first time I opened the jar I was in love. It smells good, the pinky color is appealing and the creamy texture makes my skin feel good. I noticed after about a week that the discoloration I had from sun damage was fading out. Now after 3 weeks, I look at my face and no longer see discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the smell and feel of this cream but I put too much on at first and my makeup would not adhere to my face. I tried using it at night since it is so rich and that worked well. I believe it does hydrate my skin and I like the rosy glow. It will be great for wearing on the weekends when I don't have to wear makeup and will give me a healthy rosy glow. This is a great idea to make a cream like this and I will continue to use it.
I could feel it sort of tingle and work. In the meanwhile it absorbed nicely into my skin and left it with more rosiness. I have olive skin and without a tan can seem very pale. This gabve me a healthier glow. I really wish I had taken before and after photos!
I started using Age Perfect Rosy Tone 8 days ago. I definitely see an improvement in my skin! My face feels and looks smoother and my makeup seems to go on much better. I also love the light fragrance of the cream. It adds moisture but does not feel greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited about this cream. The scent is lovely and the pink tone is actually perfect for my skin tone. The only issue for me is that, in winter, I need more moisture than this can provide. I actually used it on some discolorations from a scar on my leg too and within a week, the area looked smoother and less dark. All in all, a nice cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I saw the commercial for this product and was instantly curious about it. I've been using it for over a week and absolutely love it. First off..it smells wonderful! Not a strong smell, just the faintest aroma of almond. It's almost mousse-like in texture. Goes on smoothly without being greasy. Gives my pale skin just the right amount of glow. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this product to review, a first for me. I'm nearly 60 and actually had been looking for a product that would make my skin moist looking all day. I don't need the pink pigment, so I can't attest to that feature, but I love how my skin looks throughout the day. I did start using a setting spray after using for a few days and that helped too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product almost every day for the last week and have mixed feelings about it. It feels very good and glides on easily, but for my freckled skin tone, the tint does not look natural. The fragrance is light and pleasing.When I use it on my chest, instead of my face, it does a good job. Not too thick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin feels so soft and moisturized with this cream. I think the rosy color helped my skin look better too. I have very dry skin and the cream helped with the dryness. I would definitely buy this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a person unaccustomed to taking care of my skin, I like this product. It is lightweight, has a nice fragrance, and moisturizes my skin well. I am sixty years old living in a sunny, dry climate. I have been using AGE PERFECT at least once most days for about a week. Now, I have softer, less wrinkly skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am trying this product as a trial and am very happy with the feel and the scent of the product--only been using for a week but most products leave my face oily and this one doesn't plus adds a light glow to my complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for only about a week, and so far I like it a lot. Feel great on my skin and smell good too! My skin does seem a little more rosy...Going to continue to use and see what happens in a few more weeks ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this as a sample and I'm so glad I did. I had been wanting to try it for awhile but kept forgetting to buy it. It brightens up my dull lack luster skin and feels very nice also. I will definitely keep using it. Thanks for the sample !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 70 but look younger and want to keep it that way. I received this product through Vibrant Nation as a sample for review. I have only been using the product for a week, and can't really see a difference. I noticed on other reviews, it takes 2 weeks or more to notice a change. I have sensitive skin, and usually break out with new product, and that has not happened. So far, so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
To my surprise I received this great moisturizer in the mail. I began using it the next day. I really do like it. It does leave a slight pinkish tone to skin leaving it soft and supple. The smell of it is ok...not my fave but does dissapate. I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thanks so for sending me this Loreal product, just the thing for my extremely dry skin. It shares a very pleasant rosy color to skin; also nourishes my hands, arms, neck and even my elbows. Tested on many body parts and came thru with good results. I would diffinitely recommend to all ages; as I am 72 this is a universal age product!"
"Great product. Gives a very slight blush to my very pale 'mature' skin. Brightens up my skin tone and gives me a radiance of youth. Although nothing can 'turn back time,' I like the soft healthy glow I get when I use this. It's a good moisturizer as well. Leaves my skin in better condition. Can use with or without makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Leave it to L'Oréal to create leading edge products, how they manage to make a product so rich yet so light on the skin with visible results is nothing short of magic. I can even go without a foundation on some days! Having spent thousands on my skin over the years, cost means nothing ladies, it's the ingredients and brand name to trust."
"I would love to give an outstanding report of the age perfect cell renewal creme, but honestly I used it faithfully every day and cannot really notice a big diffrence in the texture or color. I am 72 and I have, for the most part, taken good care of my skin over the years, so maybe it is for more aged skin. Thank you for sending me the trial of creme to critique. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the way this moisturizer makes my skin glow, making it nice and rosy. Before I used it my skin was pale, but now it looks much healthier and I liked the way my skin feels, very soft to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free jar (thanks!) so that I could try it and review it. So glad I did. It has a great feel, leaves my skin smooth and soft; and so far, I have to say, it makes me look at least a little younger. Can't wait to see the impact over several weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer went on easily and was absorbed quickly into my skin with no greasy residue left behind. My skin felt very soft as the week continued. I wish they make this creme with a spf option so I don't have to use another product to protect my skin when I go outside. I'm glad I was given the opportunity to try L'Oreal Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample to use and give a review. I have pretty good skin tone and texture (combination of genetics and skin care) although I have some sun damage and I am getting older. I have been using the product daily and find that it makes my face feel soft and smooth all day, and even after I clean my face at night. I don't know that it makes my complexion rosier, since I kind of have a rosy tone complexion, but I like the way it makes my skin fee. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion has a wonderful texture and light feel once applied. I also love the fragrance. My skin feels smooth and moist without feeling oily. I have not experienced any clogged pores. I will continue to use this product as part of my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of this moisturizer on my skin, but I do not like the tint of it. I would definitely consider using the same product without the added coloring. I understand the premise of the hue, but did not care for it with my skin tone. I received this as a promotional campaign. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was provided a jar of this moisturizer as a sample to provide an honest review. I love the color that it leaves my skin. Have been using it just over 1 week (AM and PM) and haven't noticed a lot of difference in my skin, but the coloring is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only used this product for 11 days, but I am already impressed with this product! It's thick and creamy but not greasy. It applies very smoothly and makes my skin feel velvety. But my favorite thing about this product is that I no longer need to use a primer under my foundation! The moisturizer makes my skin so smooth, the primer isn't needed. That is a time and money saver! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a sample and used this for a week as instructed. I can't say I noticed any difference in my skin. But I liked that even though it had fragrance, it wasn't overpowering and didn't linger. It also seemed to keep my skin moisturized without feeling heavy or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm on my second jar of this creme and recommend it. It is easy to use and my skin seems to love it. Oh, and I do think the ""rosy tint"" is a helpful addition to my face. Just a slight advantage. I don't apply it very heavily and use it nearly every day and it seems to last quite a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually was part of this campaign before in December 2016. I was worried my skin would break out to it due to the many hairs older women get on this face but I was pleasantly surprised! I LOVED THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE USED IT EVER SINCE! I joined this campaign so I could let people know how much I love this product!!! I really does wonders for making your skin look better!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received this product to sample, and I will continue to purchase. I'm 56 with some lines but noticed a dullnes to my complexion. This product instantly brightens my skin, and gives a beautiful glow. Love the texture, and absorbs instantly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm liking this moisturizer....its a nice kind of thick cream; it has a really nice smell and I love the rosy tint. I feel as though I am getting a touch of color with this which I think is a good thing since as I get older I feel so washed out. I approve and will be buying in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent a sample in the mail. It was a generous full size. It has a wonderful texture and a light , lovely scent. It does give your skin s subtle , lovely glow. My skin feels soft . My best friend asked what was I now using because she thought I looked so refreshed. Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Vibrant Nation Sampling and Review campaign sent a full size sample to me..I was sceptable upon receipt but found this product did a very good job of sinking in and leaving a very nice barrier for my foundation to rest on. The texture of this product at first reminds me of waxy clay, but very quickly applies when using the circular motions per the directions. No breakouts or clogged pores.. look forward to repurchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The only thing I did not like about this was that it did not readily absorb into the skin. When I put it on it kind of stayed on top of my skin and balled up and flaked off. I tried putting it on directly after getting out of the shower whilst my skin was still damp and the bathroom was steamy and that helped some. I was told that my skin looked dewy and brighter. I will continue to use the remainder of the jar but not sure I would purchase again.
"I received this in the mail, and after using it for five days I have found this to be an excellent moisturizer. It is not greasy, it feels light and creamy, age perfect leaves a pretty pink glow that is not too obvious, it is very subtle. my skin looks smoother and healthier. At age 74 age perfect is perfect for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a fan of the Age Perfect line so I was eager to give this a try. I have found this to be an excellent daily moisturizer that should be perfect for the cold weather ahead. I didn't notice any additional glow to my skin, however, my skin tends to the pink on an average day. The scent is pleasant. My only caveat is the cream is a little thick. I generally prefer a light cream for easier smoothing of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer to try and I love it. It smells great and goes on effortlessly - glides right on. I've used it for a week and already can see the difference in the deepness of my wrinkles - they seem to have lessened! Going to keep using Rosy Tone Moisturizer on my face. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used other products in the Age Perfect line and this one seems to fit in nicely with those. It has a nice cream texture, no too thick, along with a light, pleasant fragrance. After using it for a week, my skin feels soft with a light, rosy glow, and the size of my pores seem to be reduced. I am interested to see how well the product performs with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of the L'Oreal Age Perfect Rosy Glow Cell Renewal moisturizer last week and have used it now for over 7 days. It's just lovely. The fragrance is mild and slightly flowery. The millennial pink glow transfers lightly to the face, which I appreciate as I don't often wear foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the hydrating properties of this product. However, I prefer white-toned moisturizers and sunscreens for brightening my sallow complexion before applying foundation. I think this would give life to an older woman with pale skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure I would like this product at first, but after a week of use I find myself liking it. The product is thick so I thought I wouldn't need to use very much but my skin tends to be dry so I needed to use more just to get the coverage. It wasn't greasy like I thought it would be and I like the way it makes my skin feel. I'm not crazy about the color. I have an olive complexion and the pink tone was just a bit too much pink for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After one week of use, my skin seems to be more moist and a little rosier. I will continue to use my sample and see if there are any permanent changes in skin tone. Thank you for including me in your study. I am 78 yrs. old."

"Really like this moisturizer....its a nice rich cream; due to this a dab will be sufficient. Also, really like the fragrance, very light. I feel as though I am getting a rosier glow using this moisturizer; which I guess is the intention. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using this for a little over a week, but I love it so far. I can go without foundation on casual days and not feel daudy. The only thing I would change is to have a different container that didn't either require dipping my fingers or using a scoop to get the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product worked for me on many levels. First as a product with anti aging benefits, then as beauty enhancing cream. I also was pleased at the light scent and how quickly it absorbed. Last but not least, the healthy color and glow to my skin shortened my beauty routine to concealer where needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the age perfect cell renewal as a free sample to try for one week. Today is the one week mark and I must say, I'm impressed. I love the tone my skin has just after one week. I am almost 58 and I go all the way down my neck as well as my face. I'm super moisturized. My neck appears less wrinkled/crepe after one week. I'm anxious to keep going to see additional results. Thumbs up for sure!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was sent to me via Vibrant Nation sampling and review campaign: I am posting my review after 7 days of use as per their instructions. Although I am enjoying using the cream so far, I feel 1 week of use is not long enough to judge any long term benefits/ results, but I do like the rosy tone it imparts on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I sampled this product and am so glad I did! I'm over 60 and have very sallow, dry skin so I use a cc cream to even out and add color. The first day I tried this product, my skin had a rosy glow and was instantly hydrated. After 1 week, I no longer need the cc cream and my skin looks glowy and healthy. I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well, no longer! I am 64 and even when I wear makeup I look pale. I have very sensitive skin also. I tried the Rosy Tone Moisturizer and to my surprise I did not break out in a rash and I have a little color to my face now. Thank you L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I truly love this product. I am in my 50s and this moisturizer freshens my skin tone and seems to tighten any small wrinkles. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and younger. There is a beautiful glow created by this face cream. I will 100% buy this again.
I agreed to try this in return for a review. I am a product junkie and enjoy
Trying different skin care products. This is of fine quality cream moisturizing my aged skin and giving it a soft pinky glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is wonderful. The cream is light-almost like it is whipped. It gives the skin a glow and smells divine. It does what is intended-restores a rosy complexion from my youth. While it doesn't cover wrinkles, that is not what it claims to do. It softens their appearance. I love the way my skin feels after aplying, and all day. I will continue using. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my sample one week ago and I love the way it feels and looks on my skin! in fact I like it so well after telling one of my patients about it she tried it a couple of times and the bought herself a jar. This product does justice to its own advertisement!
Thanks L'Oréal for including me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! The smooth, non-greasy moisturizer glides on like silk, and makes your skin feel soft and smooth all day. The light rosy tone doesn't make your skin look red at all, and provides a nice base for makeup. On those days when makeup is optional, this product is sufficient by itself to provide just the right amount of glow to get you through your day. I would highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free trial of Age Perfect and I've been using it for 1 week. I tend to stick with one or 2 moisturizers but tried it anyway. I love the way it feels on my face and I've noticed a difference in my skin tone along with the lessening of fine lines, plumpness and firming and the smell is lovely. Definitely a skeptic with most products so I was so happy with the results and will continue to use the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for about a week, and my very dry skin is not as dry as it has been. There is definitely an improvement, and I believe in a few more weeks, I will see amazing results. Would definitely recommend to anyone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using for about a week but was surprised it didn't make my face feel too greasy since I have oiler skin. I don't think I could use in the summer though. I normally like fragrance but I really don't find this particular fragrance appealing at all. It smells way too fake for me and I only notice the rosy color when I first apply. Overall though, a decent product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is great for my ""change of weather"" skin. I usually get very dry on my nose and cheek area as soon as it starts to get cold. It didn't happen this season with my Age Perfect product! And I love the pretty smell also! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin and was delighted to learn that this product not only worked at tightening my skin and bring a nice rejuvenated color back, but it did not hurt my skin or irritated at all! This is a real winner of a product and I'm so happy that I tried it! I've already referred it to several of my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for one week and am really impressed. Already my skin feels softer and has a bit more color. Which is really nice when summer is gone and the days are short and gray. It makes me feel younger as the dullness of my complexion is starting to get rosier. I am excited to keep using it to see the results after 4 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for over a week and I don't think I can continue. It seems to sit on the surface of the skin instead of sinking in (and I have very dry skin). I also didn't notice a rosy effect. But the deal breaker for me is the scent - I find it overwhelmingly perfume-y and it lingers way too long. Reminds me of stuff my grandmother would have used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Thank you for letting me try the Rosy Tone Moisturizer. I found it to be non-greasy and it absorbs quickly. My skin feels soft and smooth. I look forward to see what continued use will do. Giving me the hint of color without makeup is exactly what I was looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product a few weeks ago and I'm so glad I did. Age Perfect Cell Renewal* Rosy Tone Moisturizer really does add a rosy glow to my dry, dull skin. I use it every morning and I can instantly see a difference. I've noticed my skin texture has improved and I love the way my face looks after applying the product. Plus, the price is amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only had this product for a week, and I love it. From the moment I first opened the jar and saw the beautiful color of the cream, to the silky feel of it on my fingers and then my face, I felt like a queen! Bright and well-hydrated. I have good skin for my age, and this made it even better. I'm looking forward to seeing what the results are after using it for a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was glad to be chosen to review this product. I have used it for a week now and have already noticed a change in the texture of my skin. It smells wonderful, it is light and not greasy. It has a wonderful rosy tone (not too much). I have noticed that I might skip the heavy foundation and just use this. Love this product and would definately recommend it to anyone. It has now become a part of my daily morning routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using for only a week, but immediately like how light weight and nongreasy it feels. I LOVE the nice little glow it gives my face. It looks natural rather than ""cosmetic."" I look forward to seeing the effects on my skin tone over the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first time I slathered this on I knew this was going to change m skin care ways. It just feels good going on. What a nice way to start my day! I've used this product one week and my face is smoother, softer and brighter. I love this change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was happy to be selected to participate in the Vibrant Nation Sampling and Review Campaign for this product. I was worried about the promised ""rosy blush""--would it look too pink? It does not. It smells divine and it soaks in beautifully. I have worked it into my morning skin routine with serums and sunscreen, and am very pleased with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, but feel a difference already. My skin is smoother and more hydrated. Love the smooth way my foundation goes on.

"52 years old and have been needing something to rejuvenate my face. After using AGE PERFECT for a week, my skin just feels smoother, does not feel dry during the day and my makeup goes on smoother. I am so happy to be chosen to try this new item. And, the price is right !!"
I am pleased that I received this age perfective cell renewal by L'Oreal to try. The rose tint I enjoyed but I really appreciate the texture and how thick and creamy the lotion is. I sure I will like it even more in the Wisconsin winters !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for testing 3 days ago. It is presented in a pretty package. The Age Perfect cream goes on smoothly, gentle to the skin and the rosy tone cream adds a touch of color. I use it once a day in the a.m. My face is smooth and clear but more days will give more positive results. I am happy I was chosen and have confidence in L'Oreal that there will be more changes to my skin soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was amazed from the very first time I tried this creamy rose toned moisturizer! I immediately saw a different ""cast"" to my skin, and I liked it. My skin had started to look drab and flat and this creamy though light feeling moisturizer has really brought some of the youthful glow back to my face. It has been a week now, and I am also noticing how much smoother my skin feels. I'm hooked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not sensitive to fragrance and have never had any prior issues. This was a first. Due to its overwhelming scent, I stopped using this product after 4 days."
"Although my face and neck felt appropriately moisturized, the tint was not noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for a week so far. I just started using only Loreal products morning and night and really like this moisturizer, it is thick but is easy to use and my skin feels so hydrated. The scent is pleasant also. I definitely will recommend to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for the last month & absolutely love it and was very happy to receive a sample jar. My only question is whether it is designed to be worn alone or under or over a foundation? I have tried it both ways using very little foundation underneath, but have also used it alone I find it takes very little of the product & goes on smoothly on clean skin. Will certainly continue to use this for as long as it is available. It is definitely worth the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"57 years old and have been needing something to rejuvinate my face. After using AGE PERFECT for four days, my skin just feels smoother, does not feel dry during the day and my make-up goes on smother. I am so happy to be chosen to try this new item. And,the price is within my budget."
"I am enjoying the rosy tint to this moisturizer. It goes on so smooth and creamy and has a nice finish. I don't use as much foundation, my skin tone is evened out. I look forward to the next weeks of use to see the improvement in my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample. I usually use, as my daughter tells me, high end moisturizers. The 1st day I applied this product my friend commented, ""your skin has a nice glow."" A few days later another friend commented, ""what are you using on your face, it has a glow?"" I am pleasantly surprised with L'Oreal's Age Perfect. Recommending to all my friends over 50.

Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer is a lightweight product that is absorbed quickly. It's not heavily scented either and has a very pleasant crisp clean scent that dissipates once applied. I also appreciate how it does not make my skin feel weighed down like some moisturizers do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do not get the “gritty“ comments. My slin feels soft and smooth. Only been using it for one week. Not sure if I seem a big difference in rosiness yet, especially when make up is applied over it, but I love the feel of the skin."
My only beef is this is a day cream and there is NO SPF PROTECTION. PLEASE consider adding!
"I often use different brands ,whether on sale or store brands, and do have some some favorites, This Age Perfect Cell Renewal by far tops the list. This smooth application and after feel leaves my slin soft and I do not feel the need to add color to my face as an everyday routine. I'll use this product .

"I've used this product for a while now and I LOVE it! I am 67 and have always taken good care of my skin but, at this age, I needed more than what I had been using for moisturizer. Aging is not for sissies! This product is perfect for my skin. It softens my look and I need less foundation with this product. I highly recommend it. A little goes a long way, so it's worth it to invest in good skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have always been told that I have great skin for my age. I really do not like to wear heavy foundation and have tried tinted moisturizers in the past, but they did not have the skin renewal ingredients. This is the perfect solution! I even went barefaced to work yesterday (with only lip and eye make up!). The tent perfectly compliments my skintone and doesn't leave my face feeling heavy. Love it!

"This is our first time buying L'Oréal cream. We really enjoy this good Rosy moisture cream with a mild wonderful fragrance. We love it and gifted some. They love it too. The only issue we all have is Why isn't this wonderful cream Sealed?!? Sealing face cream is essential for sanitary reason. Thanks L'Oréal & Walmart Pls keep that in stock, we love it"

"I received a sample to try. I am 54 years young and my mom is almost 79. We both have tried and we both love this product! We have been using another name brand product for a very long time.

"I was given a sample of this cream to try and I was very impressed. The cream is thick and luxurious. The scent was very light and disappeared as I gently rubbed the cream into my face. After using this product for just a couple of weeks, my face is noticeably more hydrated and small lines disappeared. I was a bit concerned that it was so thick and rich that I would end up with oily skin, but that did not happen. Instead my skin is softer and smoother.

"I received this product a few weeks ago and have used it everyday since.

"I received this product as a free sample from Vibrant Nation. During the winter my skin gets so dry from working outside in the cold for a few hours every day, so was excited to try this. I love how BIG the jar is! not a skimpy size at all. The color was wonderful. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this a couple of weeks ago as part of a sampling program and I must say I am totally pleased with the results. Since using this, my dull skin now has a glow to it and it has gone from dry to feeling so refreshed. I will continue to use Age Perfect in my beauty routine. My 56 year old skin is worth it.

"I recieved this product as a free sample from Vibrant Nation. It was not a normal tiny sample, but a full size jar!! The color was a little intimidating and I wondered if my skin would be that color. It doesn't leave your skin that color. This cream moisturizes so well and leaves my skin an even tone. I no longer use a foundation. The peony flower extract makes it smell so amazing. My skin look smooth and refreshed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this as a free sample from L'Oreal, and I love it! You don't have to use a lot to get great coverage, but you still get a large bottle! The rosy color doesn't change your skin tone, and the scent is very pleasant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical. Not for any reason other than that's my nature. I have been using the Age Perfect Cell Renewal daily since I received it. My skin looks and feels hydrated and dewey, a tall task for 60 year old sun damaged skin. I couldn't be happier with the way my skin looks and feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a free sample to try for a few weeks and then review. It imparts just the right amount of moisture to my skin and just a hint of color - light rosy glow that lasts through the day. My skin feels soft and I like how it looks. I rarely wear foundation, and this product has bridged the gap from ""naked face"" to bright and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was just getting over a severe reaction to a pricey skincare line. What a wonderful relief to get such great results from Loreal's Age Perfect Cell Renewal Cream. My skin feels and looks so much better, I can even go out without wearing foundation! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to try out the Age Perfect line so signed up for Vibrant Nation's sample program. When the full sized product arrived, I looked at the cream and saw the pink pigment and was concerned this wouldn't translate well on my Filipina skin - but it did, magnificently. I used this in conjunction with my Tretinoin 0.1% regimen and Age Perfect was a perfect moisturizer, especially in dry, cold conditions. I will buy this again.

I received the sample about a month ago. Love the way it makes my skin feel moist and Dewey. Being a dark skinned African American there's no rosy cheeks but I will continue to use the product. Very happy with the result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received L'Oréal Rosy Tone Moisturizer to test out. I love the way my face feels, not dry at all. It lasts all day. My skin has more color. Thank you for the sample. I will be buying Risy Tone Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I love it! It goes on creamy, not greasy. It has given my (56 year old) skin a healthy glow. I've worn makeup over it on my work days but have also worn it alone to run errands without feeling self concious about my bare face. It also has a very delicate fragrance, not overly rosy. I will definitely be purchasing this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for a few weeks and I've had amazing results. At my age, wrinkles are a big issue and I see a noticeable difference in the areas where mine were the worst. I'm super happy with the results, I can actually see an improvement! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product to review. It is very rich and creamy, but feels very light when applied to the skin. It absorbs quickly. My skin looked soft and rosy. Only a little is needed at an application. The cream has a lovely scent, but does not linger when applies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In just a few days, I noticed a transformation of my facial skin from a dry and ruddy appearance to a soft velvet rosy tone. My skin revived after just a few applications of this non-greasy light rose scented cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this to try and I have to say the color in the jar threw me off. On the skin it is smooth and hydrating not greasy with a slight pink glow which restored some life in my skin. My skin feels smoother. It doesn't interfere with your foundation color ot application. I would recommend this product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for about two weeks now and I have been pleasantly surprised by how much I like it. It has a rich feel to it , but it does not feel heavy on my face. I usually like my face cream to be unscented, but this was subtle enough that I did not find it to be a problem. I really didn't find much of a change to my skin in color, but that is not something I would have liked any way. Overall I really liked the product and I can see myself continuing to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can usually tell the moment I take the lid off a new product whether I'm going to like it. This product had an attractive aroma, a lovely color, and a great texture. After using it for over a week, my skin feels better, looks healthier (I like the glow and the pink!), and I can't ask for more than that in a skin care product. I have always tried to take care of my skin as I get older, and it was a thrill to try something new that really does what it says it will do! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using the product a few weeks ago and am hooked. Given that it's winter my skin looks particularly sallow and after using the product, I definitely saw the change in my skin tone to rosier and the product has definitely freshened up my look. My skin also felt nourished after applying, and really enjoy the scent. It's on the thicker side which I like but it does take a little getting used to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer! My skin is hydrated and feels dewy and soft. I'm 59 and my complexion was dry and dull. I feel my skin is starting to look healthy again using the Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer! I will continue to use this wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and it compares very favorably to other products I have paid three times as much for. The rose tint is unique to skin care products like this I have used. Many years ago it seems we all wanted that dry matte look -- which almost looked artificial. The glow that this product gives looks much healthier and natural -- much more attractive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for a little over 2 weeks, and I love how it feels on my skin. It is so soft and blends beautifully. It does give your skin a glow that makes the tone seem more even. The texture of this is so smooth, and you really don't need to use a bunch of it. A little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In recent times, I have noticed dullness to my skin. I have been using Age Perfect for a couple of weeks, and I have noticed that imparts a healthy, youthful glow. It has a lovely smell, fantastic consistency, and it easily blends into my face and neck. As a maturing woman, I found this cream simply divine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Many products promise you will notice a difference and with Age Perfect Cell Renewal I actually noticed a difference the first time I used it. The lines on the corners of my eyes seemed to disappear but the best of all was my husband asking if I got new makeup. I wasn't wearing makeup but had just applied the cell renewal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product as a sample to review. I have been using it every day as recommended. My skin feels much softer and more firm. I had several dry spots on my face which are now gone. I love this and am sure I will purchase a new jar after this is gone. Thanks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love the texture of this cream and the scent is delicate and pleasant. I was concerned that the tint would enhance the general ruddiness of my skin, but nothing could be further from the truth. I LOVE the way my skin looks using this lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am 52 years old and started using this product a week ago. I love the way it feels as it is applied. It goes on really smooth and isn't greasy or sticky. The results are wonderful: a rosy and smooth complexion. I recommend this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this and began using this a week ago. The smell is wonderful and the cream goes on smoothly. I have olive skin and in the winter I fell like I need a little something to freshen my skin.

I've been using this every morning for the past week and I absolutely love it. My skin tends to get shiny so I worry about using moisturizers during the day but this one did not feel greasy or make my skin seem oily. I used it under my makeup and I also tried blending it with my mousse foundation and both worked well. It has made my skin feel really soft and hydrated. I've also used it on makeup-free days and it gave my skin a nice fresh-faced glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As advertised, my cheeks and skin are left with a healthy glow, and I can feel more moisture in my skin. In fact I haven't bothered wearing rouge since I started using Perfect Rosy Tone moisturizer.

"I have been using this product for just over a week now. I was worried when I saw how pink it was that it would look the same way on my face. I really couldn't tell that there was any tint to it once it was on and got no comment from others either. It was a very effective moisturizer for the two dry spots, one on my neck and the other on my cheek. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for over a week and I must say that I am impressed. At first, I was not sure about the tint but then loved it! This is a wonderful moisturizer especially if you have dry skin. It does not feel greasy at all and the tint is light and fresh. I no longer have to wear foundation or powder and that's a plus in my book. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got a sample of this moisturizer to try just as the extreme cold hit NYC. Under any cold conditions, my face dries out, but in the polar vortex, even more so. This rich cream absorbed well and felt great; no greasy residue and I could put make up on right after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Age Perfect Cell Renewal for one week now and I really like it.
It's light not heavy feeling which is important to me. It seems as though my skin has a softeness about it. I have been walking in the cold weather almost everyday and I think the Cell Renewal has help keep my skin soft. Oh and I love the pink color and the smoothness of it. It goes on so easy. Super product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product a week ago to sample and love the look the tint in it gives my face. It is also light and non greasy. I no longer even feel the need to wear foundation over it as it provides such great coverage! Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I've gotten older, I increasingly dislike wearing foundation. It seems to settle in fine lines and just doesn't look good. So I usually go without. But, I miss the coverage it gave me. I think Age Perfect is the perfect compromise. It's a moisturizer, which I like, particularly in winter weather like this. It has a really nice rosy color that is subtle but that evens out my complexion to a pleasing degree. It smells wonderful too! I love this product and am glad I learned about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Age Perfect Rosy Tone Moisturizer adds a subtle gleam to my cheeks. My husband noticed a rosy glow, too, and without being asked! This cream has a light and pleasant scent. A small amount on the fingertip suffices, and the effect lasts all day. The Rosy Tone Moisturizer earned its place in my morning routine - I just love its effect on my skin!

"I'm 70 years old. I've tried foundations, but found them heavy"
