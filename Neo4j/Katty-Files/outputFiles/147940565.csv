Have only used this a few times however I feel itll will definitely become a go to product. Very light and hydrating on face and is definitely worth the money.
"This product was good, but I was disappointed by the way it smells. It is also very greasy feeling. I did notice a difference in my skin though, which was good. The price was not bad either. I would possibly consider purchasing this again in the future."
I tried it but was looking for more moisturizer. It is very light and non greasy but doesnt leave a glow look. It is too light with no moisturizing content
Wow super awesome product saw changing in my eyes within 3-4 days amazing this product work it lift my eyes and smooth the skin and firmer leaving it super beautiful awesome product totally buy it again. It's a good price and value . I will try to buy this year
"This product was great for my skin, it hydrated it and made it very soft. My skin didn't react to it and nor did it do any damage to it, it only made my skin a lot softer. The product was very light on my skin and wasn't harsh. It was good value for money as the price wasn't too high, I would definitely buy it again."
This is a pretty good product. It has a very smooth velvety texture and it is not at all oily or greasy. It has a very faint smell which is quite nice and it is affordable for quality face cream. I have dry and sensitive skin and it worked amazing concerning both!!
"This Olay lotion has a light fresh scent instead of the powdery smell some of their products contain. It is the same smell as their active botanicals line. As a moisturizer it's great for my normal skin. It's light in texture, only slightly thicker than a gel cream, sinks in quickly, does not leave a residue. Makeup looks very nice over top the few times. I've used it in the morning, but mostly use it at night. This is now my go-to daytime face lotion. I highly recommend it. Olay Luminous Light Hydrating Face Lotion"
I absolutely love love this brand. This is a generation brand for me. My grandmother to my mother and now I use it. I have sensitive skin and this cream is a must in my routine. The results are mind blowing and my skin thanks Olay for staying affordable for everyone.
"i adore how clean and fresh my face feels after using this product. others leave my skin feeling weighed down and mask-like, but olay luminous light hydrating face lotion takes care of that right away. smooth and shiny, it feels brand new and youthful"
"It evens skin tone, and hydrating skin. It's little bit expensive for my budget but it can last for long. It's super gentle product. It definitly meet my expectations, and I would buy it again. I recommend it too my friends and it doesn't need any improvement"
This product is simply amazing. I have dry skin and when I use this it makes my skin feel great and not crusty at all. Plus it keeps my skin hydrated all day long not like other products. Most product will only keep my face nice and moisturized for a few hours but not this!! Keeps it all day long and I just love it!
I loved the lightweight feel of the product. Didnt leave my face feeling right or greasy like some products.
Loved this product! Did exactly what it said it do. Maid my eyes seem brighter and fine lines less visible.
This is good for dry to normal skin and keeps it moisturised but can make oily skin look greasy throughout the day
This product applies well and spreads evenly. It doesnt feel heavy on the face and does not make your face oily.
This moisturizer feels so light but makes you look and feel like a million dollars. I would but stock in this if I could

"I've been using this brand of Olay for about 10 years. I have dry skin, especially in the winter. This brand of Olay is a great moisturizer without being too heavy. It absorbs into the skin and doesn't leave a heavy greasy residue."
I live the feeling of his product! I like how they make the product not to oily leaving the skin still stay hydrated without absorbing too quickly. The lotion had a nice gentle smell to it! I really like the effect it leaves on your skin afterwards!
I have always liked sand purchased Olay products. This product is no exception. It gently hydrates your skin without leaving any oily residue. I only use it once a day and it doesn't take much. It's my favorite facial skin hydration product.
Made my skin feel extremely hydrated and looked much healthier. This facial lotion is perfect as it dries quickly and doesn't leave your face feeling wet
This is perfect for undermakeup. It absorbs and soaks up leaving your face feel like you haven't even applied anything. I didn't expect to love this product as much as I do. I just wish the bottles were larger.
Makes my face feel hydrated and feels soft after every use. Was effective and met all my expectations but it's a little pricey for what I would normally pay. First time using it tho was very surprised
Worth every penny! One of my favorite hydrating face lotions. This actually soaks into my skin and doesn't just sit on the surface. I love this Olay product and highly recommend it!!
"I have combination skin, oily on the t zone throughout the day but also dry in the winter months and this product has really been a life saver. It absorbs so nicely into my skin and keeps it hydrated and healthy."
This stuff really hydrates my skin! It literally plumps out any indent I have on my face. It has a cooling sensation for me sometimes but that could be because it's shrinking my pours
Since my face is dry I been using this in the mornings and evenings to help hydrate my skin and it has been working. Glad I started using. I will definitely be buying again. I do recommend if your face needs some hydrating.
I like the feel of this lotion. It's light and silky which I prefer over being thick and creamy. I use as my first step in my make-up routine and it keeps my skin hydrated.
"This is my holy grail product. This is such a good moisturizer for the morning, especially since it has sunscreen. This moisturizer has brightened my acne scars and has just made my skin look even and healthy! Definitely would recommend!"
This Hydrator was Actually pretty nice. It didnt leave my face feeling oily & it wasnt cakey. I was Pretty happy with my first time purchase! I love olay & they dont really ever dissapoint.
Great face lotion. I am someone with oily skin so it was nice buying this and being able to use a lotion I could use and not break out. Olay has done their research and this is product I would recommend.
Great product! A wonderful moisturizer that does not leave a lot of build up on your skin. I struggle with dry skin but some lotions leave a little too much behind for my liking but this product helped me with that! Would recommend!
"Great product! Leave my skins feeling fresh and moisturized without making it oily. I have had many problems with moisturizers making my skin oily, however, this does not do that at all!"
"Anything olay is wonderful. I use Olay face moisturizer every single day, twice. After I wash my face and use witch hazel I apply the moisturizer. So soft"
I love this face lotion. It's lightweight and leaves my face feeling hydrated but not oily. I feel like it's pretty effective. The packing is nice and sleek. Olay Luminous Light Hydrating Face Lotion

Good left my skin feeling fresh and clean. With no greasy residue or dryness. I only used it for a month it was a gift from my mother.
"Again, Olay products are amazing! Olay luminous hydrating face lotion is fantastic! I love the way my face and neck feel after applying!"
I like this cream. It works great on your face. And leaves it soft and hydrated. It is worth the money that you spend.
It did work well for a while but when I stopped using it my skin got worse then before I started using it. It was definitely worth the price though.
I used the product and there was little left of it and did not change anything or did not do anything and it is not good
I really love this product my mum gave it to me and I was so happy it is so amazing and hydrating I literally love it so much will be repurchasing x
"Its so nice and soo goood , because the color is great, and the price is suitable. In terms of size it fits ."
Love this product! Helps so much with moisturizing and fine wrinkles. I use it under my make up because of the spf protection.
This is such a wonderful hydrating brightening serum. It feels luxuriously cool on my skin. This is by far one of my favorite face products.
"Dont cause my skin to be too oily, ot helps hydrate my skin, helps to balance out the skin. It works well with any slin type."

"It is a refreshing lotion, delicious smell and keeps your skin well hydrated. I used everyday on night."
"Felt very light weight, easy to apply. I noticed a softness to my face. It product was gentle to use, I would repurchase."
"wonderful product, used a sample and it makes my skin glow the next day. Might have to try for a longer period of time to be able to tell igf it is an actual suitable serum for my skin. but the sample trial that I used was not bad at all, would consider buying."
I started using the Olay Luminous Light Hydrating Face Lotion because I lay in my tanning bed 3 times a week. It keeps my face extremely hydrated and it never looks dried out from the tanning bed. It more less feels like a face protection that' keeps my face looking fresh and smooth.
When I first put this on I felt like I was at a spa. My skin felt so soft and amazing along with great texture. It doesn't make it oily or greasy. You only need a small amount. It's great for all skin types even mine which is supersensitive. It feels soft and amazing.
"I took a selfy and got recommended to use Luminous face lotion. It sells amazing and hydrate my skin very well it meets all the affect of the product line. However, it does not help to reduce my large pores. I am 32 with sensitive and combination skin, and my main concerns are hydration, pigmented acne scars, and visible pores. This lotion provide great hydration. However, my pores are still very visible. I change to Total effects. I use this lotion on my day off from work."
This is a very light weight face lotion that isn't too heavy on my skin and moisturizes it perfectly for a glow without it looking greasy. I use this product twice a day and is honestly one of the best face lotions I've ever used and the smell is so refreshing. #Sponsored I received products from Olay in return for this review.
I received product from Olay in return for this review. I am in love with the Light Hydrating Lotion! It is so light yet so moisturizing! It gives my face just enough moisture to have a nice glow but does not make my skin look oily. Would highly recommend!
"I received products from Olay in return for this review. Olay has outdone themselves with the Luminous skin care line. Since using the products my skin is glowing. The uneven skin tone I was experiencing is reduced, and my skin is hydrated and fresh."
I love this product because it is lightwight but yet so moisturizing! I am African American with really dry sensitive skin but this product keeps my skin moisturized all day. It doesn't make my skin feel sticky or oily. I absolutely love it and recommend it!
"Unfortunately I saw zero change from using this product for the last 2 months. I like the texture of it, its a very matte type of lotion. It didn't make my face any worse - didn't dry it out or make it too oily, but I saw no noticeable results. My skin tone didn't become more even, my dark spots weren't affected at all, and my skin wasn't any softer than it had been. For the price I was definitely hoping for results but I saw none. I won't be purchasing this again."
"it has some nice features: light weight, moisturizes, nice smell, but I just can't get past the fact that despite using an oil absorbing face primer & matte pressed powder my face is an oil slick after 1 hour. It's disappointing; I would like this product if it didn't make my face so greasy."
I recieved a trial size of this product and fell in love. It is a must purchase if you love alll things beauty. It is soft to the skin and smellls very refreshing. after about 4 hrs I had a slight glow. My skin felt so healty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using this product for my daily moisturizing routine. My skin felt soft and silky after using it for about a week. I didn't see much change on making skin tone even, however I only used for a week. I think over all its a great moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall it's a good moisturizer but not as good as play regenerist .The luminous thing is visible in winters but not in summers .I find it thick and would keep on using it to see its results .Overall not very disappointing .I would recommend this to a friend with combination skin . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this product looking for something to revitalize my face and I wasn't sure if this would work but I bought it anyways and Boy oh boy was Stunned at the incredible immediate results! It felt so good putting it on everyday felt like my skin improved in elasticity and moisture. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love Oil of Olay it is one of my favorites and fortunately my pocket but doesn't allow me to buy as much as I like but this one happens to be a little cost-effective and I can keep it in stock but I highly recommend all of their products even though I haven't tried all of them the ones I tried I have love
I absolutely love this face lotion. I have dry skin and this helps keep it all moisturised.
This product is perfect when you face is dry I think it's more useful when it's summer time
It kept my face feeling smooth and not sticky and or oily. and that is awesome! I'd buy this again
I like this but not as much as my Neutrogena or Younique. It is a bit pricey for the results
"A gentle, hydrating lotion. A bit more shimmer than I expected, but it's a nice bonus."
Great feel. Goes on easy. Easy to buy at any local drug store. Keeps my skin looking younger.
I'm tried this and it just wasn't for me. It was so oily on my skin and kind of sticky.

Love this! You use a small drop and your whole face feels soft and It isn't greasy or leaving you feeling dry. It moisturizes your face and feels amazing
"I love to use this product when I first wake up. It immediately brightens up my face and you would never know that I just woke up! This lotion is also so gentle on your face so if you have sensitive skin, that's perfect!"
