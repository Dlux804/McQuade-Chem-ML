I have been looking for a moisturizer tried all the high end.This one is so moisturizing and see results instantly.My skin feels plumped up moisturized and youthful.
"I don't usually review products, but I'm LOVING this stuff! Been using this for about 3 weeks, and the results are amazing! Skin tone is more even, pores are smaller, and my face is so smooth. I was looking for something light for the summer, and this is a perfect alternative to foundation. I've also got sensative skin, but I've had zero issues with this. Will definitely continue using and highly recommend to others looking for light natural coverage and moisture!"
"I LOVE this product! I have never, ever written a review on a beauty product but I feel compelled to let P&G know that they simply MUST continue to produce this stuff. It is the BEST light foundation EVER! I have tried so many other products and nothing compares. Products with sunscreen leave a residue and less than flattering shine all over my face. This stuff makes your skin look healthy, evens out skin tone and feels so light. Thank you P&G!"
"I've been using this for a few years now. Nothing else compares. I've used the ones by Olay with sunscreen in them, but this one is by far the best. I love how my make up goes on over it, leaves my face flawless. Or sometimes I just apply it with some concealer for a fast clean (try, but didn't really try) look. Keeps my face from being dry, yet doesn't let it get oily. Though I love it, but it is sometimes hard to find in stores."
Love this product. I use this instead of makeup. Goes on so smooth and seems to cover what it should. I highly recommend this product instead of using a liquid make up that shows your pores a lot. Having a touch of foundation in this is great. Highly recommend you try this product! Well worth the price!
"I've been using this product for years, close to 20. I never liked heavy foundations that cake on, or rub off clothing, which this does not. Unfortunately, I'm having a difficult time finding it in the usual places where I buy it. I'm hoping it's not discontinued!! I would certainly recommend this product."
This is the best! I use it as a moisturizer and foundation!
"I love Total Effects! I was excited when I found this product. Unfortunately, the shade is too light for me. If your skin tone is medium, deep or dark then this is not for you. I recommend this for fair and light tones. Olay, please add more shades for more skin tones."
"I've been using this product for a few years with complete satifsaction. Lately the texture of the product is not consistent. One bottle will be of lotion ""weight"" and the next bottle will be so thin it almost runs off my fingers before I can apply it. From past experience, I am disappointed this seems to happen more and more often."
"I was told Touch of Foundation replaced Touch of Sun, which I loved. I tried Touch of Foundation & was disappointed to say the least. The foundation is too dark for the average woman. It is not as creamy & does not glide on as well as Total Effects with Touch of Sun did, which should not have been discontinued."
I love this foundation. It makes my skin feel soft and it the color is perfect.
"This makes me glow! I love the tiny hint of color in the moisturizer. The smell is decent, and it blends perfectly. Hint: use a makeup brush for a flawless application."
"Thus product is absolutely amazing!!! I love it so much, I use it all the time. And I love how it's just the perfect amount of foundation. I totally recommend."
