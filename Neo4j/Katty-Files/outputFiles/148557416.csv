Recommended by dermatologist for rosecea. Absolutely love Bioderma AR. It soothes my face the minute it's applied. It's a little bit pricier than other senitive skin moisturizers but well worth the little extra cash. I have tried most of the other otc products for redness due to rosacea and this is my favorite by far .
