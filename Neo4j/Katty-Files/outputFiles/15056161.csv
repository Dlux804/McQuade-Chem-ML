"I don't use this everyday, but I live in Alaska and my skin hasn't been the same since I moved here. I use this product when u have particularly dry patchy skin. I put it on and it's cooling and so refreshing. And it doesn't leave a sticky or tacky residue after it soaks in. I have purchased this at least 4 times. Also good to use after applying Retinol or hylauronic acid."
I am a 62 yr old grandmother and I have a 36 yr old daughter and 2 teenager grandaughters all we all love this product. Love the way it hydrades without any creamy or slimy residue.I get mistaken fo the mother instead of the grandmother all the time and the girls get asked all the time what they use to keep such clear complexions. Cant beat the price either.
"I love LOVE this gel-cream. It's soothing, calming and sinks right in. My skin gets really dehydrated - medication, stress and weather are the culprits. Still, my skin isn't dry and heavy creams just sit on top of my skin, waiting to clog my pores. I also use it as a super hydrating mask - just slather it on! Bonus - it smells really good (my boyfriend agrees) - super light and not at all fragrance-y."
"My skin is so dry due to the Chicago weather, so on lunch I'm in CVS & I see this product. I was hesitant about the price because I work downtown Chicago, so the cost is more than at your neighborhood CVS. I needed it-my face hurt. I purchased it and sooo glad I did. I use it every morning/night. I absolutely LOVE this product & will continue to use it until they stop making it!"
"cooling gel moisturizer that feels and works great, great smell, too"
"Beautifulllll smell, nice colour, easy/lightweight on skin, very smooth and chill. Adoring packaging and design. Doesn't need any improvement cuz its so gentle. Love love love to this product. Definetly recommending and buying again."
"If you need the lightest of moisture, than this is the right product for you. It is not a Moisture Surge substitute. It is more like the totally diffferent moisturizer gel substitute."
It did make my skin glow but I wish it didn't have alcohol in it. I can kind of smell it. Other than that it was a cheap face cream when you are on a budget. I just hope this skin cream doesn't ruin my skin. It's what I'm afraid of :-\
"Very hydrating. Easy to apply. The texture is nice and doesn't leave the face greasy. It's really good and gentle for the skin. Plus, the fragrance is so so good and very refreshing. It took me a long time to finish it, since you dont need to use a lot of products every day. I really recommend it."
I use this after cleansing and this Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream is so hydrating and applies so smoothly. It has a nice light scent. You only need a small amount of product for the whole face. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I would definitely buy again.
Beautiful products worthy of trust customized by each person due to review the instructions only and make sure of conformity Each product has its properties and wonderful features The company has a popular name can be trusted and distinctive colors and products also suit each person individually and give you better results in each use
"My favorite moisturizer! No crazy perfumes or alcohol bases. My skin doesn't turn red after use like with some moisturizers. No greasy feeling after applying. I do let it sit for a few moments before applying makeup, but that's a personal preference."
I have dry skin and this product is amazing for the summer time because its light yet heavy enough for me to not feel itchy on my dry spots. I love the packaging and how it comes in glass pots because its great for the environment. Ive bought this at least six times and have been very pleased.
"Unfortunately, I got the normal skin, when what I needed was dry skin. I have not tried it. I love the one for dry skin. It is light and feels nice, whereas the night creams are more heavy. I prefer light, and this works well without cause my face to break out."
I really liked this product.Very soothing and cool on face. I will most definitely buy again. I am not good at remembering to have a face routine but this is one I loved using so it made it easier to remember and add into my routine.
"Love this moisturizer. Smells great, good price, very light feeling on the skin and works well for my skin type. Have repurchased many times and would buy again."
This is my favorite moisturizer. I have extremely oily skin and this works great! Provides so much moisture and leaves my skin feeling so so nice. I love using it alone under makeup. I have purchased so many of these that I have lost count!
"Just okay. I prefer the Neutrogena HydroBoost gel cream over this product. Similar formulation, but the Neutrogena seems to hydrate my skin a bit more than this moisturizer. Hydration is key when you do regular facial peels, weekly exfoliation, and acne treatments."
10 out of 10 this is the only moisturizer I like to use under my makeup. It is so hydrating yet it's very lightweight and it doesn't cake up my foundation. It is gentle yet it really does make my skin so smooth and it creates a perfect base for the rest of my makeup. It is inexpensive yet it performs better than the more expensive Clinique gel moisturizer. I highly recommend it
"I love to use this product everyday! I used to use it at night, because I feel my skin gets very hidryted and I wake up with a nice touch of light on it! It's very easy to used thanks to its gel format, very suitable to a mixed-oily skin! I recommend, because there's a great balance between price and quality!"
"i love the rose version of this moisturizer! the jar is such a good size with so much product and a little goes a very long way! it gives your skin a hydrated feeling and a nice glow. the cooling sensation is so refreshing and nice, especially after the sun. this also doubles as a great moisturizer for the body- i have used it on my arms and elbows plenty of times in the summer because it feels so nice and leaves skin glowing."
"Not a huge fan. Well it smells fantastic and was great going on, it stayed oily for a really long time but was not effective in moisturizing afterwards. The price wasn't too bad for the total package and I would definitely recommend it to others with a more normal skin type"
I'm accused of product when I go tanning or in the summer because it is so refreshing after the Sun or UV lights hits your body I would definitely recommend this any female or male who has dry skin and just needs that refreshing feeling I would definitely buy again
I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years now and I just love it! I have combo skin that's very sensitive and this moisturizer is the best for my skin. The only thing that would make this product absolute PERFECTION is if it had spf and some medium coverage foundation.
"I really enjoy the product on my though it leaves a sticky residue. It did meet my expectations as a whole though it made my sink feel great. Mind you I have combination skin so it helps a lot in my trouble spots. I would buy this product agian, its inexpensive and also it if effective!"
A good gel/water based moisturizer that didn't leave skin too dry or too oily. It has almost a blurring effect on pores. I use it with my combo skin in both summer and winter. It spreads easily and has no scent. It's a good cheaper alternative to other brands I use from Sephora.
"I don't use any other moisturizer because cream moisturizers clog my pores and that's pretty much all that's sold in the drugstore. I'm so glad I found this product, just as I was at my wit's end. Even though I have oily skin, I use the moisturizer for dry skin sometimes because I can get away with using less and the jar lasts me for a while."
I've been using this for about a week. I really like the lightweight feel of the gel as opposed to lotion. It smells kind of like aloe. It's refreshing and cooling when you put it on. I've been using it as a primer for my foundation and it does a pretty good job as a primer as well. It's pretty affordable and a little bit goes a long way.
"This cream is amazing, the consistency is great for oily skin. I have combination skin and it works great with my skin type. It dissolves in skin immediately and locks moisture in all day. Its great to use as a primer under make up. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with combination skin."
Hydration hydration hydration. It is all about it. Did not leave any greasy residue on skin. Makeup can be applied easily over it. It will not compensate for the amount of water that you have to drink but will make your face the smoothest and softest thing in the world. Highly recommended to people who need an extra hydration kick to the face
"For the price, it isnt that bad! I decided to give this brand a try because ive seen these advertisement on my phone, tv, etc. I really needed moisture on my face because during the summer and winter, my face tends to get really dry. At first, when i applied this gel, it felt really cooling and it absorbs really quick. i really liked that! It does moisturize your face, but later like in 2-3 hours, you can see a little dry patches so you might need to add another layer of this gel cream! Overall, it is still a great product to try out!"
Was using this for a while. Very good for its price point and did its job. It was light and moisturizing and absorbed into the skin very well. I stopped using this once I found the neutrogena hydroboost but this garnier moisturizer is a great product nevertheless.
"Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream Very pleasantly surprised with this! Let's be honest, skin care can be a little scary and intimidating. You want to get what you need but not spend half your rent in the process. This is a great alternative to some of the other more expensive brands. It truly does moisturize and lock it in! And it didn't feel thick or leave my skin oily. Loved it!"
"I've been using this brand for just about 7 years, and it's literally the only thing that works for my skin. My skin gets very dry and red, and this is the only brand that has dimished my problem."
"Its gel texture makes it so refreshing on the skin and very easy to apply. It feels so nice on the skin after a hot shower because it just refresh your face so much. My skin feels hydrated an I would recommend for people who don't need that much moisturizing, or during summertime."
"I love this refreshing gel cream! Its light, soaks into skin quickly, has an amazing slightly aloe smell, and leaves my skin moisturized and healthier just after one use! Its not overpriced but I do wish it came in a squirt bottle to make my face routine go a litter faster. Its definitely on my shopping list to get more!"
"This gel cream is so good! It absorbs quickly into my skin and it is not too heavy or greasy. I had two very dry rough patches on my chin which used to flake and peel, about the size of a dime. I've used this for three days, morning and night and those patches are completely gone! I can't say enough about this product!"
This moisturizer has given me such good hydration but helps my face not be as oily. The packaging for this product is very nice and convenient. The product could use maybe a little more of a fragrance but that is more of a preference. I would definitely buy this item again.
"I have been using this the past week or so and it has definitely kept my skin moisturized, but I can't tell if my skin is more oily because of the weather or because of this product (it's been gross and rainy and muggy). I'm going to keep using it to see. I have broken out a bit, but I'm not sure if it's the product or because it's that time of the month. The smell however is awful and I'm not a fan."
"Used this as standard moisturizer for a period of time. It was very hydrating and for a good price, given I was using hyaluronic acid and other moisturizers at the time, but it's a cheap alternative to other hydrating creams and does leave your skin feel a bit softer"
"It didnt meet my expectations. I have oily skin, and while it does leave my face feeling moisturized it just did not sit right on my skin. It felt like something I needed to wash off- and pronto. Wouldnt recommend"
I have very dry skin and with just a dip of my finger I have enough to moisturize my whole face. Its very light and doesn't clog my pores. I breakout less and I can get rid of dry skin. This stuff is my saving grace!!
"I love this moisturizer, I have a very oily skin and it helps control my oil all through out the day. It's very light on the skin and does not mess with your foundation or Bb cream. Highly recommend for oily skins out there."
"Made skin feel really hydrated within days of using it. Skin feels younger and healthier. Will continue to use this product!!!! Wish product was slightly bigger packaging really nice, will recommend to others great product, Will continue buying"
Its very moisturizing and refreshing. It makes your skin feel great and very soft. It also has the best and most fresh smell Ive ever experience with a face moisturizer. I would recommend this product to many people.
"I love this moisturizer! I'm someone who easily gets greasy when applying moisturizers but this one is like water, it blends right in with the skin and leaves you hydrated but not greasy. It's a great summer moisturizer and you can't beat the price."
I absolutely love this moisturizer especially during the summer. It absorbs quickly and it leaves my skin feeling soft. It does have a weird fruit scent I would say it smells like passion fruit.
"This is my go-to moisturizer; it's definitely rescued my dry skin. I use it as a primer before I apply my foundation. I hope Garnier never stops making this gel cream, I will buy this forever. It also smells clean and refreshing!"
"This was one of the best moisturizers Ive ever used. The scent is not extremely strong, and its very light on your skin. It doesnt leave your skin feeling oily or greasy, and it also makes your skin soft and refreshed."
Such a nice gel moisturizer. Gel moisturizers are my favorite because theyre deeply hydrating but feel light and dont leave a sticky or shiny feel to the skin. Highly recommend
"Greatfor oily skin, very moisturizing but doesnt leave any residue on skin and helps with oils! Super lightweight and very effective, I would recommend!"
"I have always had oily skin and could not use heavy, oily mosturizers. This gel is perfect for my skin! It moisturizes without clogging my pores. Im over 50 yrs old and I need some moisturizer, but never could find a product that I could use without clogging my pores. This is perfect for my aging skin. It smells so natural and feels like silk. I recommend this product to all ladies no matter what the age...."
I have been using this product for 2-3 years now and I absolutely love it!!! I get so many compliments on my skin and its youthful appearance!! Please do not ever quit carrying this product!! I used to be an oil of Olay user for years until I found this!!! My skin feels amazing and well hydrated... If I could I think I would bathe my whole self in this stuff lol!! Thanks Garnier :-)
"i have crazy skin, like dry in some spots, oily in some and normal in some. so i have the problem with finding something thats not going to break me out ... this stuff is fabulous and perfect and smells nice... and i looooooooove it!!! ill never use another kind so it better not be discontinued ever!!! :D"
"Love, love, love this product! I am a girl who is very picky about skin care. Am most definitely not an all cream or all lotion person. I like my gels. This product's combo fits me nicely. My skin drinks it in nicely and I am using it day & night. No more messy pillowcases!:) Would highly recommend it!:)"
"Garnier Moisture Rescue is amazing! I am so glad I discovered this. It worked so well on my face, that I started using it on my hands since they get so dry in the winter. And I believe your hands show your age first. This moisture rescue is better than any cream I have ever used."
"This is the best moisturizer I've ever found for sensitive, acne-prone combination skin. I have tried so many products, cheap and expensive, and this is the only one that moisturizes without leaving my skin shiny and feeling just icky. Best Cosmo suggestion ever! =)"
"I bought this stuff when it first came out because my skin was so dry. I love it. It makes my skin feel moisturized and its feels like it plumps up my skin. My only complaint is that I wish it had SPF in it (preferably 30 or above) so I only use it at night. But, I will continue to use this as my night time moisturizer till they stop making it. I have and will continue to recommend this."
I have been looking for a moisturizer that does not leave my skin oily and cause breakouts. I have finally found it! This stuff is so light weight and leaves no oil on my skin. My skin hasn't looked better for a long time. I have been using it for 2-3 weeks now and my face hasn't had any breakouts since then but is still well moisturized. it is so lightweight and perfect for under makeup!
"I am almost 60 yrs old and I finally found moisture rescue and I don't flake anymore. I love this product, I have very dry skin and I tried this to see if it would work and I called my daughter and told her about it because she is always saying you're flaking well now she can't, it's the best and I have tried everything. Love love this product it's about time after 30 some years of dry skin Garnier came up with this Gel-Cream and I went back to the store and bought 4 more jars just in case they take it off for some stuipd reason. Love it..."
"I was using a similar product by Clinque at $34 for 1.7 oz jar, this product from Gariner works the exact same but for way less money. I havve my husband and mom using this product as well. My face has never felt better! For best results cleanse your face with Olay ProX system then follow with Gariner Moisture Rescue Gel!"
"I was in desperate need of a light-weight, super moist facial cream and, on a chance, I picked up this gel. I will never use another product again! The gel goes on cool, soothing the skin, and dries quickly leaving the skin soft and moist--never greasy! Plus, this gel doesn't clog or block pores like many creamy lotions do. This is by far my favorite product and it is worth every cent!"
"I tried this product 3 weeks before my wedding, desperate for something to save my extremely dry and flaky facial skin. It was a miracle worker! It is my new favorite facial product - and CVS sells it in their ECB program, so it's a no-brainer for me! I go through a jar of it probably once a month."
"I have combination/sensitive skin. I have a basket full of skin products and this is the only product I can use everyday. I use this product every morning and it does not clog my pores like other lotion type products do, so I don't have to worry about putting it all over my face. This gel-cream is light and smells great. It especially helps my skin in the winter time when it becomes dry and flaky."
"I have a weird combo skin that is actually drier and more sensitive than it used to be so I've been trying different things. I really like how this stuff feels, I have problems with creamy moisturizers feeling very suffocating on my face. This stuff is moisturizing and doesn't feel too heavy or like my skin can't breathe. I also have been using 100% argan oil and I've noticed my dry areas don't flake out and my makeup goes on smoother and looks more natural."
"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used, and happily it is one of the lease expensive. My skin looks noticeably improved and it feels wonderful. Lately, I have been using the normal/combo, which is fine, but I think I had one for dry skin and I have not been able to locate it again. Has it been discontinued?"
"This product is great. My face was so dry it was actually flaky. Some other products were heavy and seemed to sit on my face, I could actually see them under the lights at work and they still left my face dry. I bought this on a whim and I am in love. My husband has even commented how much better my face looks. I have purchased department store moisturizers that cost $35 for a small bottle and this works just as good for a fraction of the price. I know I sound like a commercial but trust me, this stuff works!!"
have combination skin and redness on my cheeks. Ever since I started using this product my dry skin stays moisturized and my oily skin doesn't become overly oily. and the redness on my cheeks have almost gone away. My pores have become smaller and I'm not breaking out as much. I will be buying this product forever and I hope they never stop making it.
I have tried so many different moisterizers that I had become skeptical that this would really be light weight. So when I tried it. I first noticed it really was gel and it felt diferent between my fingers. I massaged it on my face and instanly noticed that my skin was drinking it in and not just sitting on top of my face. Garnier you made a believer out of me.
"As a 36 year old female, you get more and more serious with your skincare routine as the birthdays seem to come faster than normal! I meant to purchase the Moisture Bomb but ended up getting this one by accident and it's the best Moisturizer I've ever used! I LOVE IT. Additionally as a Makeup Artist, I also use this on all my clients!"
"I have used lots and lots of different face products. I love a good moisturizer and out of all the brands, high and low end products. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!!! This is so soothing to my skin. I do break out sometimes and this product keeps my skin moisturized perfectly, makes my skin super soft and allows my makeup to look perfect! Garnier has the best moisturizers I have ever used."
"This moisturizer has a light and clean scent and feels weightless, not greasy or heavy at all. I live in the desert though and it's extremely dry in the winter and it did not hydrate my skin enough then so I went back to my old moisturizer to relieve my itchy flaky skin. Not a bad moisturizer, I just prefer my regular especially with the desert dryness."
I got a sample of this about 2 years ago and I loved it immediately. A little does goes a long way with this. It's really lightweight and gentle on the skin. I use it more in the fall and winter than I do in the summer but it's a great staple to have in my face essentials. Love this moisturizer. It's the best I have ever had. I hope they never stop making this product!
We are having a Harsh winter here in MI and I just couldn't find a moisturizer that was Light Weight and Oil Free so I went to the store about a week ago and was on a mission then I came across this and decided to give it a try I have to say I love it and have notice an incredible difference.....I love the feel of this product and the scent is nice as well
"I love this product. It smells amazing, its light and I can't describe how amazing it feels on your face its really refreshing. Its so moisturizing without a greasy feel or that thick feeling. And a little goes a long way :) Awesome that is oil free I have extremely oily skin and I like to moisturize without adding so that a plus.. did i mention it smells good.."
"I have been having problems with my skin for a few years now im talking horibble dry patches that have gotten horrible this week. Very flaky and itchy and not attractive. i bought this product but the advanced dry skin formula and have only used it twice, last night and this morning. there is a huge difference. No dry spots at all! I cant wait to see the long term affects of this!"
"I've been using this for about 6 months and I absolutely love it! I have normal to dry skin, depending on the season. This product solves any problems of dryness. My favorite part is that it isn't super heavy. I personally love that it's a gel formula so it doesn't make my face feel oily. I love it so much and I even got my sister to like it just as much as me. I would highly recommend this!"
"I have sensitive skin, so I have bad experiences with moisturizers all the time. When I first applied this product it definitely felt refreshing. However, within the first five minutes I had it on, my face became red, burning, and swollen. I had to wash it off asap. On the bright side, I had my mother try this moisturizer also, and her skin didn't react at all whatsoever. Just be warned if you have sensitive skin!"
"This stuff is simply amazing! The light gel formula is so refreshing, esp in the summertime. It makes my skin incredibly soft and it smells great to boot. I buy this moisturizer over & over, and shopped around for years for a product I really liked - this is it!"
"If you're like me and you have combination and sensitive skin, then this product is perfect for you. It is the perfect gel to apply each night after you wash your face and before you get into bed. You wake up with soft, supple skin. It keeps it that way all throughout the day as well. The only downside is that there is no spf in it, so I would recommend using another cream during the day if you will be in the sun. I totally recommend this gel for night application. You'll see the results instantly, and it carries into the next day."
Used this product during a bad breakout in my pregnancy and it helped with redness dryness and cleared my skin. Now after two years I went back to the product nd I'm so amazed of what it's done within 24hrs HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW! Amazing and quick results!
I've tried a number of moisturizers and the results have been disappointing. Having combination skin means that I either have oily skin or dry skin depending on the weather. The gel-cream is a great balance and provides my skin with just the right amount of moisture. There have been the rare moments when my skin felt a little dry after usage and then I add shea butter to retain moisture from this product..
This moisturizer is PERFECT for to use on my sensitive skin on any season even winter and when I apply to my face it made a tingling feeling that means its working too bad the container is not alittle bigger so it can have more but its ok and even tho its almost 7.00 at Target and Walmart and its worth trying it!
"With having dry skin and it being winter my face suffers, it is red and rough but i have found that with this great product, it smooths and comforts my face and neck area and it just feels so nice and comforting to my skin once i apply it, i highly recommend it to any friend!"
This gel is great on my sensitive skin! It wasn't irritating and did a great job of hydrating. My skin tends to be oily in some areas and this does not make my skin appear extra greasy or oily. Just the right amount of moisture for both oily and dry spots. Highly recomend!
I was really excited to try this since i heard it was good for oily skin but i feel like it doesn't do much for my skin but make it soft. It smells good & absorbs quickly but it makes my skin even more oily than usual an hour or two after applying. Might work for someone with normal skin but didn't work for me :(
This is a great drugstore moisturizer for normal to combo skin if you have dry skin get the pink one otherwise this isn't gonna do much for you it's light enough to go over and under other creams and moisturizers i use this during the spring and summer months i even use a dab on my eyes in place of eye cream I've been using it for years and recently switched to a new one from garnier
This is a great drugstore moisturizer for normal to combo skin if you have dry skin get the pink one otherwise this isn't gonna do much for you it's light enough to go over and under other creams and moisturizers i use this during the spring and summer months i even use a dab on my eyes in place of eye cream I've been using it for years.Great for a base for makeup !
I bought this in the winter when my skin was feeling really dry and flaky and this diffidently rescued my skin in the winter!! It feels so refreshing on your skin and it didnt break me out at first! The only problem I have with this product is that after I used it for a while it did start to break me out!! I found that a bit weird but other than that great product during the winter!!!
"This feels so nice on your skin, not heavy, like some can be. I love the combination of gel and cream on this which makes it water like in my opinion. It just sinks into my skin when I use it in the morning, I dont have to wait ages for it to dry before putting makeup on, its drank up in seconds. You dont need to use much either which is good, even though this is not expensive and you can get it in most drugstores. If your on a budget like me Id recommend this for your daily skincare!"
"Excellent moisturizer! Very very light formula that leaves your skin soft and refreshed. Stays on all day and I highly recommend. Definitely worth the money. If you have any kinda skin, it will definitely work. Unlike other moisturizers, it doesn't feel heavy or oily. Not sure if it is water based but this some good stuff!"
"I absolutely love this stuff. Even at age 64, my skin can still be oily, especially around my nose, and particularly in warm weather. On the other hand, other parts of my face can get pretty dry. I get EXACTLY the right amount of moisture from this gel. Plus it isn't overly perfumery. I am having a hard time finding it. I hope Garnier hasn't discontinued it."
"My favorite Moisturizer ever. It doesn't clog pore, super light, not greasy at all. It is more a gel than a cream. The texture remember me the aloe gel for sunburn without the sticky feel afterwards. The only improvement for this would be a white one frangrance and coloration free. I really recommand that product. If you have a oily skin go get it. My skin feel so smooth after the first time that I've never stop using it"
"I love love love this moisturizer. It's light, gel consistency is just what my dry skin needs to lock in moisture but not clog my pores. This is the only moisturizer that hasn't broken my skin in horrible pimples. The price is also really great especially since this has the texture and results of more high end moisturizers."
"I have been using it for years, it smells very good and it hydrates my skin perfectly. The truth is that the Garnier brand I love for the fact that it is crueltyfree. I highly recommend this cream that is for mixed or oily skin, it has helped me a lot to keep my skin healthy and clean."
The term gel is correct. Very jello-esque feel to it. It felt like it sat on top of my skin. Like it never penetrated down into my skin. Very sticky to the touch. I was Not very crazy about this product. I prefer A milky/creamy feeling when moisturizing my face. This product does not provide that.
"This cream works but I don't think it lasts as long as some others. It's good for during the day but I used it before bed a never noticed any difference by the time I got up the next day. The smell wasn't horrible, but also wasn't great. My boyfriend could smell it on me and he didn't like it."
"Honestly this has been the best moisturizer. I usually buy a more expensive moisturizer and I ran out. I picked up Garnier to try it out and also it was a lot less expensive and can I say it has 1. A great scent and 2. Leaves my skin hydrated all day, yet it does not leave it oily !"
This moisture rescue gel is so good! I like to keep mine in the fridge to help with puffiness as well. It also just feels so fresh and good on my face that way. Kind of helps wake me up in the morning. I also love that its fairly inexpensive. I would love for it to be in a pump but I dont necessarily mind the container.
"Not going to lie.. I am not and never have been someone who cares to moisturize. Ive never really found a moisturizer that fullfills my needs. I 99% of the times skip moisturizing all together.. however on the rare occassion that my usually oily skin goes through a dry phase, this is what I reach for for immediate and effective results. It does the trick when Im in need of hydration without feeling greasy or heavy. Its very light, soft, and water like !! Feels like my face is takig a drink if water"
This was the first gel cream I've ever tried and I am highly satisfied with this product I would recommend
I really like this product so far! I have oily skin and I really like that this has a gel consistency and feel. Not heavy or wet/oily feeling!
I have used this product for a while I love it. I put it on before I put my make up on and it goes on a lot smother . And the price is so good
"Great smell, lightweight, refreshing gel moisturizer. It's so nice for a summertime day time moisturizer. I've been using it for at least 8 years!"
I like the texture that its not greasy and its cool to skin but I think the ingredients are somewhat a bit strong to my skin. Its a cute packaging and its my first to use it. Recommended to normal skin.
"This product is AMAZING on my combination skin! I wear it alone or apply before putting on my makeup for the day. My makeup looks flawless, my skin feels like it can breathe and I start my day feeling confident!"
I use this as my nighttime cream in the summer when my skin doesnt need as intense of a moisturizer. Im partial to gel creams because theyre light. A nice light scent that wont annoy you while trying to fall asleep.
I just recently started using this. Its very light weight and I like it on a daily basis. Its a slight tacky but thats great when applying makeup. Not a harsh product at all. I would definitely buy again
This moisturizer is perfect for my combination skin. It moisturizes my skin without making my t-zone too oily. It works well underneath my makeup.
"I used to love this moisturizer; however, Garnier has changed the scent and now I can't stand to have it on my face. So disappointed! I will have to switch and I didn't want to. It had such a nice light scent before."
Love applying this after removing my makeup and washing my face. Feels really refreshing but is not the best moisturizer for my skin. My face is still dried out after applying
"Super fresh this product, I like it, its not expensive and just need a little product for your face."
Love this moisturizer! I find that the gel moisturizer works better for my skin and does not clog my pores like the cream moisturizer does.
My absolute favorite creamer. I just love all the gel creams from Garnier. They leave my face feeling refreshed as well as moisturized.
Good for oily skin since its super lightweight and almost turns into water when applied! Not the most hydrating so works better in summer for me!
This moisturises the skin a lot and hydrated it and oborbes in the skin quickly without making it look oily
"I put this product on after I clean my face, and it moisturizes my face really well. I have very oily skin and when i put it on I don't notice myself get as much oils(not saying that it will make your skin oil free, but it will improve it)."
This product is amazing. I was using another very high priced product that promised everything from softer skin to restoring elasticity. My skin has never been softer and looked better.
Even though I live in a very humid area I still suffer from dry skin. Any other moisturizer I use has to be reapplied or dries my skin out more. This moisturizer makes my skin feel like velvet! I love it!
"I have combination skin that gets all dry & flaky in the winter months, but this product has helped reduce that as well as keep the oils under control."
"I wanted a facial moisturizer to wear under my make-up without the greasy feeling. This was it! A little goes a looooong way! And another bonus, I also use it as a night moisturizer! I noticed my skin has become smoother!"
"I am so amazed by this product. I have very dry skin. The first time I used it, my skin looked healthier. And felt amazing. I have used expensive products for years. I definately recommend this product."
"Best I have ever used on my face no residue,cool feeling, lightweight and doesn't irritate my skin like most products do. It rates a 5 but wouldn't click it :)"
You get way more than you pay for. It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. It has a pleasant smell. I have never found a moisturizer that I have loved so much. I have already recommended this product to several friends.
Love love love this product. It makes me feel so refreshed & ready to go! I've tried other moisturizers but this is the one I use. Hope Garnier keeps this product on the shelves forever!
"I have dry skin and cannot use lotion on my face, just gel...and i finally found one that I LOVE!! This has helped me take care of the flakey skin on my face."
"I love this product. I don't wear makeup and all my ""beauty"" routines need to be quick and easy, but work. Goes on easy. Light, pleasant smell. Feels good on my face."
"This moisturizer is so light and refreshing, and really works well with my combination skin. The smell is amazing too! I love this and will continue to use it for life!"
I have oily skin but this stuff makes my skin feel great when i use too much of my acne scrub and i dry my skin out way to much and it smells great and is very lightweight love it!
"First introduced to any of your products through an ad in a Martha Stewart magazine. Have used your eye product also, for many years. Am very satisfied, happy to ba a customer. F. Steib"
"After trying many products I finally found a cream that actually hydrates my skin all day! I highly recommend this, it is very affordable and worth the money."
"I purchased this product to help combat my oily skin. This is a game changer, by this time of the day I'd have an oil slick on my face, but no today because I've switched to this amazing product. I feel the moisture I get with this is wonderful."
This is my go to moisture product! It doesnt feel yucky on my skin. It drys fast so I can put my makeup on not long after applying. This product is gentle enough that I have my 11 yr old daughter using it now as her regular morning routine!
I bought this a few weeks ago and I couldn't be happier. I have very dry and sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling so clean and healthy. In love and will never use another moisturizer.
"I received a sample of this product in mail, I tried it and went out and bought it the next day! I makes my skin feel wonderful. I have combination skin so it is hard to find a good product, now I finally found one that I can stick with!!"
"I love this product, it has given amazing results. It won't clog pores and won't make my skin oily. I love it much. It soothes my dry skin and stays moisturized for hours. I really recommend it to others."
After the first use of this product my face felt extremely soft and smooth. It is really cooling and calming to put on and has results that last all day.
This is great for the summer as a moisturizer! Its not to heavy but it leaves my skin feeling fresh. My only complaint is that my face feels sticky when it starts to dry down.
Good for hydration and adding glow. Light weight. Subtle fresh faint smell. Would recommend more for people with normal skin. You would need More moisturizing if you have mixed to dry skin.
I absolutely love this eye cream!! I love that it is a gel. It feels so soothing and refreshing to the skin. it has a nice cooling effect. my face never feels oily from it. i have defiantly noticed my face being more bright. highly recommend
The best moisturizer ever. I use this everyday at least twice a day. My man says when I do he loves kissing me even more because its a treat for his nose not just his lips
This was alright. Overly fragranced and I didnt love all of the chemicals but it got the job done and helped me get through the winter why my dry skin really struggles
"This one has an awful smell, almost unbearable for me. The pink one is much better. I love the product it's just the smell of the green one I don't like."
This is a great moisturizer for normal/oily skin. Its super lightweight and smells good! Ive recommended this product to several friends. Its also travel friendly - easy to pick up and go.
This is my favorite moisturizer for my face. I use the one for dry skin. It sinks into my skin leaving it glowy and hydrated and I absolutely love it. I can't get enough. I'm currently on my 3rd jar of it.
"Very refreshing on your skin, wouldn't recommend for people with really dry skin, it gives you moisture but not enough for those dry patches. Perfect for people with oily skin though."
This cream helps to hydrate the face and makes it feel refreshed. The packaging is really nice but inndont like how its smells; its kind of chemically. Ive only bought it once. I find it too watery.
"I love this product so much. If keeps my skin moisturized and refreshed. I leave it in the fridge to keep it cool, and even more refreshing! It is great in the summer."
The cream feels very refreshing when I use it. I like how fresh it smells and leave the face feeling replenished and clean. It's a bit on the pricey side but otherwise worth the price.
This moisturizer is amazing for oily/combo skin. I have been testing out some other moisturizers but thinking Im going to go back to this one as it soaks into my skin so well and really leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.
I would often use this moisturizer as a nice gut cream. It smelled alright and kept my face feeling soft. Saw no results other than soft skin. Smells ok and good consistency to it not too runny or cakey. Overall alright for moisturizing skin..
This gel cream not only face soft and smooth plus it has a drying effect without losing the moisture from the face i would recommend to my friends to use it .
I swear by this cream! My skin is extremely sensitive and dry and usually I have to use a moisturizer from the pharmacy but this one works just as well for me
I use this as a morning moisturizer and it's sensitive enough and light enough to use under makeup. It has a slight fragrant smell but does not bother my allergies/sinuses at all in the morning as I am rather sensitive to smells. I would recommend this product for the quality and price.
In the last year and half this has been my favourite morning cream. The gel is so much more refreshing and has no left over greasy or tacky feeling locations can give. It feels cool and light on the skin doesn't feel heavy. I also find if you have dry patches it doesn't irritate it or try to cake on the the dry skin like creme. Definitely a repurchase always and something I would definitely recommend (especially if you're not a fan of creme texture).
"Not quite a gel, it's definitely more runny than any gel cream that I've used. It's too thin to really make a difference in the hydration of my skin. I'll give it another shot in summer when my skin is a little oilier. Could be a good option for really oily skin, but definitely not designed for normal-to-dry skin."
"This is a must! Favorite skin moisturizer, it makes wonders tp my skin. My skin is super dry and this product helps to keep it super hydrated and soft. I apply it twice a day in the morning before i do my make up and at night before bed. Super affordable as well."
"This one was worse than the other- Dry Skin. It didn't moisturize, it dried my skin out more and made my nose and forehead peel. I was so disappointed with this and the Dry Skin cream. I wish I didn't feel like I completely wasted my money, but I do."
This helped with my dry skin during the summer! It was refreshing to use at night after finishing my skin care routine but I wish it didn't leave a weird film on my face that doesn't go away till I wake up. Would probably purchase again during the summer but not helpful enough for winter dryness!
I liked this product. It made my skin feel tingly. A pretty good value for the money. I have extremely dry skin and it's moisturizing benefits were pretty good. Very gentle on skin and leaves a slightly cooling effect after use. I recommend trying this if you have dry skin
"I bought this product after reading reviews on Ulta and Walmart.com I have very oily skin especially in my T-zone. I was quite skeptical, as with most moisturizers, because I end up breaking out or it leaves my skin extremely oily. I love how it's not creamy. It has a gel consistency. My skin feels hydrated without looking like a greasy mess. It absorbs quickly and I have seen an improvement in my skin. I will be purchasing this again!"
"Love this product. It's so cheap and accessible (you can get it at any local drugstore, such as CVS). It comes in a beautiful glass container that you can reuse afterwards if you're into that kind of thing. The product is also so lightweight, it glides on like water but really adds moisture back into your skin!"
"I have combo skin which is a oily tzone and dry cheeks and I used this light gel in the summer and it did not hydrate my skin very well, I had to use other products to make up for the lack of hydration from this product and I wanted to use more than one product to moisturize my skin in the summer I wouldn't have purchased this moisturizer."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! It has saved my skin winter and summer. I absolutely love the feeling my skin gets even right after I used it. It gets absorbed fast, I don't get oily, leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft to the touch. Has helped me reduce my breakouts."
"This is a great affordable moisturizer that I have used several times and have completely forgotten about. Seeing this product on here made me remember all of the good things about it, and will probably be purchasing it again soon for my husband to use. Does not feel oily on the skin and absorbs very quickly but you can definitely feel the results."
Omg! I love this stuff. I use to use a much more expensive brand that had a similar gel moisturizer like this but paying $30 -$40 for a small jar was becoming to much for me . So when i found this one at walmart i have it a try and fell in love. I have sensitive dry skin most of the year . But when i use this my skin just soaks it up its crazy. No irritation what so ever.
"This is my absolute favourite moisturizer!  I have told lots of friends about this lightweight, cool, and refreshing product and several have made the switch.  My skin is sensitive, and I cannot use anything greasy or heavy. The Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel gives me fabulous hydration and glowing skin"
I had super dry skin so I'm always looking for good creams to use at night. This is the ticket! The moisture rescue and moisture bomb line from garnier are to die for! It doesn't feel heavy at all but moisturizes my skin wonderfully. I put this all over my face at night and wake up with the most hydrated plump face
"I like gel moisturizers because they work better for my skin, but i didnt like this one. The packaging was cute and the actual moisturizer itself wasnt harsh or anything it just didnt do its job. I felt like i had residue on my face, not that it was hydrated. It made my makeup look weird too."
One of the best moisturizers for normal/combo skin its watery but in a good way it is a gel but it's not thick at all it spreads very easily and lasts quite a while even using twice a day for months on end i use it in the mornings before makeup and at night after i wash my face as a night moisturizer i recently got a new garnier moisturizer so now i use this on my facial days and during the summer
"This really was a refreshing product which was a nice surprise! It's a very inexpensive product, so my expectations were not particularly high, but I was actually fairly impressed. It's very clean in scent, it almost reminds me of aloe. The consistency also reminds of aloe gel, and goes on the skin with a cool sensation while moisturizing. I like using it regularly, but not when I wear makeup. My primers and makeup products don't blend well when I use it beforehand, but otherwise, I really liked this gel cream."
"I've always had extremely dry skin to the point it was flaky and gross. I bought the pink one for dry skin and I was amazed at how quickly I noticed a difference. Completely oil free, 0 breakouts and it smells amazing! Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for Dry Skin"
When I opened the box the seal was broken and a good portion of the product was gone. Will return.
"this works fantastic,i love it..it reeally dont leave my skin oily n smells great"
I bought this moisturizer and used it for about 2 weeks before I started having horrible breakouts everywhere. I have NEVER had acne on my forehead before using this product and now it's covered. To this day which is about a month later I'm still trying to get rid of the damage it has done. Probably all due to the fact that the product contains a ton of alcohol.
"I've been looking for a moisturizer that isn't too thick or heavy, and over the years I've gone through many different moisturizers. This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used. It's incredibly lightweight, which leaves my skin always feeling fresh and never oily. After a week of use it has completely remedied my dry skin, and I've always had incredibly dry skin. I love it to death!"
My skin gets unbearably dry in the winter which causes me to break out and I have tried just about every moisturizer there is. My skin also gets oily at times but was still flaky so I didn't know what to do. My friend recommended I try the Moisture Rescue so I bought it the same day and it has been a blessing. My face is even breaking out less. It has kept my face moisturized and it isn't heavy or greasy. I LOVE it.
"I bought some Garnier Moisture Rescue Gel because I had heard it's the greatest all-around face care product for winter time dryness. My skin is super dry, so of course I've tried every product of this nature. Most work well short term, but this gel is the way to go! Now I don't look all shiny and blotchy any more. Just what a beach lovin girl needs. Now I don't stress so badly about being in the sun all day long, and that's huge because that's what brings me so much joy."
"I searched for years to find a moisturizer that wouldn't make my combination skin feel oily or cause my skin to breakout. After trying Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel- Cream one time, I was completely sold! It is everything that Garnier claims it to be; a rescue for the dry parts of my skin, and absolutely refreshing. My skin feels wonderful after every use and has seen significant improvement in quality. I simply can't live without it!"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. During the winter, I get horrible dry spots and have tried several different things to help. Everything felt so heavy or greasy and still didn't work. I started using the gel-cream moisturizer and I love it. It is so light-weight that I didn't think it would work, but it did beautifully! Great moisturizer, no greasiness afterwards, and your skin doesn't have that heavy feeling! Love it!"
"The Moisture Rescue Gel is one of the best products I have ever used. It goes on lightly, moisturizes as well as the more expensive moisturizers, smells fantastic, and costs a lot less that Olay. I love Garnier products and will continue to use the Moisture Rescue line for years to come."
"I started using Garnier Nutritioniste over the last month and it has made a great difference in the appearance of my skin. I had been a faithful user of another brand for many, many years but I now have found my new facial moisturizer. Thank you Garnier!"
"Nice cream, feels refreshing and moisturizing at the same time, fastly absorbed and nice scent but not too strong."
Just finished my first bottle of this and it was so good. I have very dry skin to the point of it flaking off. This makes my face super hydrating
It's super good Then sent was really good and it's very moisturizing but I feel like I still need something more moisturizing
Water based so its super hydrating and lightweight! I went through one jar in less than a month from using it so much!
Good for the money but I need a larger container of it. You know like when you buy in bulk you save?
Smells very good but do not help me with my acne so it is not a good value and i wont buy it again
"Light, quickly absorbs into skin, not greasy. Very good for summer especially."
"at first it was good, but my skin wasnt adapting well to it later on so i stopped using it."
Highly recommend very good product definitely worth it will use it again for sure .....
I HAVE OILY/DRY ACNEGENIC SKIN--THIS PRODUCT IMMEDIATLEY MADE A DIFFERANCE IN THE TEXTURE AND ELIMATED IRRITATION AND SWELLING-I LOVE IT!!
This product made me break out and caused my skin to become super oily. Bring back the Skin Renew Radiance Moisture Cream.
"Love this moisture rescue gel - not only does it help to moisturize the skin, but it is so 'cooling' when applied. It's really great in the summer!"
"Great product. Smells good and keeps your face hydrated. No oily feel, just fresh and breezy feel. Great price, and lasts a long time."
I have oily skin and i can put this on with out feeling greasy. Moisture with out feeling like i have anything on.
"I love this stuff!! I'm very picky when it comes to much face , this is top of the line for a good price!"
I bought this over a year ago and i still have over half a pot left. it really works. it keeps my skin so smooth its unreal.
I use this product under my makeup and it acts as a primer as well. I would definitely buy this again.
I love this gel cream. I find that my skin absorbs gel creams much better than routine creams and lotions.
Leaves hair looking shiny and soft. Detangles hair immediately. Smells great and will make your hair so smooth. Best I have ever used.
Amazing feel and result. My skin particularly around my eyes has shown visible improvement. Great product design as well. Love it!
"i really love this moisturizer it leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards, i definitely recommend it"
i love the texture but its not working on my skin. it is easily absorbed but it also makes my skin dry too fast and it makes my tzone so oily
If we like makeup we know that we must keep our skin very healthy and for that this product is very good
I love the idea of a gel cream. I like this better than the last one I tried by Neutrogena because this does not make my face oily.
This moisturizer feels very cool and refreshing on the face. It made my skin soft. I would recommend this if you have oily skin!
I love this becaus its not a lotion type moisturizer. It works really well with my oily skin because it hydrates with water and light oils just to enough to help my skin produce the correct amount of oils
I like that it made my face feel really refreshed and clean. I was not heavy and oily like others I have tried in the past. My skin felt silky smooth. Very was easy to find and simple directions. I will continue to use this for my skin.
"This stuff is kinda hyped up. It's not the greatest feeling on your skin, and didn't dry fast at all. A teeny bit is all you need otherwise you have to wipe some off. It didn't really help with dry skin prevention from wind."
really like this product. Its extremely refreshing and the gel makes it eaasy to use and spread. It is quite thick but I like that about it. I use it as a night cream
Garnier skinactive moisture rescue refreshing there has been a great product for the year of 2018 it is really good for hydrating the skin on a hot day or just hydrate your skin after a hot bath or shower
"I usually use this to moisture right out the shower. Though it gives me a moisturizing feel, my face doesn't look moisturized, so I have to use another serum, but it's a great product if you're looking for moisture that lasts all day"
"It smells like public bathroom soap, if that makes sense. I really tried liking it, but it did nothing for my skin. So i just apply it on my neck at night just so i can use it up since i bought it. Overall, i just dont think it is worth your money."
Love this moisturizer. It's good for my skin and doesn't cause me any pimples. I like this better than the pink one cause the pink one is sticky compared to this
This is one of the only moisturizers I can find that doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my face. A little goes a very long way so it lasts a long time. It is also very affordable and can be found at multiple stores.
I am very happy with this product. I have oily acne prone skin so a gel moisturizer is a good fit for me. It moisturizes my skin and leaves it matte a day.
I use this every single day as part of my morning routine! I love how it moisturizes right into my skin with no greasy feeling left over. It also has a cooling effect which I love and leaves my skin feeling refreshed!
"Nice, light gel cream. However, it didn't feel very nourishing and the moisture didn't stay for very long. My skin absorbed it in seconds and went back to being dry."
"Really good for dry skin. Used it during winter because my skin always dries out. it‘s a cheap, really good and gentle product! i will definitely buy it again for this winter."
"I have never experienced it, but I know in advance that it is wonderful. I have heard many girls thank it so I wish in my turn to try it and not give it"
"This stuff is great. It is certainly a little heavy, but I like to put it on at night and let it soak in while I sleep and I wake up totally hydrated and moisturized. Great for winter months when your skin starts to dry up more."
Looooove this!! The packaging is very cute and good quality packaging. I love the glass! Such a nice touch. It's very none expensive! Works amazing! Always leaves my skin feeling hydrated but never oily! I would definitely buy it again!
I used this stuff regularly until I found a boots product at target that I liked better. I like that this is a gel and it absorbs quickly. I didn't feel like the moisture was extremely long lasting. Price is decent though.
I have a pretty oily face and this stuff keeps it under control really well! It's light and smells nice too! I've been using it about a year and haven't had any issues with it! Will definitely buy again!
I love this gel. It's refreshing and not heavy or oily like some moisturizers. I use it in the morning and at night. It's a must have for my skincare regimen.
"Very refreshing , love the colour of it and it really makes a difference after just a few uses, the packaging is amazing and simple , this product is very affordable and has a very fresh and nice scent to it, recommend it!"
One of my favorite moisturizers! It is super light and does not leave a heavy residue at all!
does not leave greasy feeling but still moisturizes
I love how light this one is. I dont break out and leaves my dry skin feeling refreshed
The only moisturizer I will use. Makes my skin feel amazing. Been using it for years.
"Does absolutley nothing it says it does, left my face 10x more dry than when I used it. Was said to be good for combination skin but seems to only work on oily skin. Complete waste of money and time."
I have combo skin and have been having a difficult time finding something that won't break me out or leaves my face feeling greasy;but this stuff is a winner for me. I love the smell too... smells like aloe Vera and cucumbers.
"My favorite all time moisturizer! Even when I regularly use retinol creams, I always keep this wonderful moisturizer around. Refreshing, very moisturizing, absolutely not greasy. Doesn't make my skin break out! I just love it!"
"I have super only skin and this is the only moisturizer that makes my skin super hydrated but never oily. Under makeup or alone, it is perfect. Smooths out skin like a primer."
"I have Rosacea, and always skin being troubled. This is the best that is not expensive, but great quality of moisture to my skin. So far, I like it and I recommends to people [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It does contain quite a bit of silicone, which just sits on your skin. It makes it feel softer, but doesn't actually do much besides make the product spread better."
"Overall great product, but I wish it had less dimethicone."
"I love this product but have since replaced it with with the Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream for dry skin. Your products are great, and have always worked well for me. I love that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin."
Love the refreshing feel around the eyes. makes my skin feel less dry. moisturizers the dryness around the eyes which i love. real happy with results.
"Even though most people think of this as a summer moisturizer, I use it all throughout winter too whenever my skin needs an extra boost of moisture. Especially in my apartment it gets so dry with the head on."
Great moisturizer
"This product worked excellent in my hair, kept my hair moisturised and looking shiny and healthy whenever I applied it. Nice packaging and easy to use. A+ product"
"I bought this about a month ago. I was a little hesitant at first because most moisturizers I use cost almost $40 because I have really dry skin and eczema. To my surprise, this moisturizer was incredible and made my skin soft and took away the dryness. It has great coverage so I don't even have to use a lot of it so it lasts for a long time. I would recommend this product over and over."
"I had a chance to try this product, as I won it in a contest. It is extremely moisturizing and feels great on your skin. Especially now in the winter and I assume it would feel great on summer skin also. I use it am & pm, before my moisturizer. It absorbs well into the skin and leaves it feeling clean and refreshed!"
I love this product I thought it would make my skin a little bit oily like any other moisturiser does but it's amazing it totally absorbed in my skin n the feeling is amazing it's cooling n refreshing n super soft I love this I totally say it's worth a try .
"I have combination, sensitive skin. This product went on smooth and light, and didn't leave sticky residue or clog pores. It absorbed quickly and left my skin hydrated without feeling oily. You can definitely use it twice a day during your regular skin care routine."
This is my go to skin moisturizer. It is so refreshing just like it advertises. It's thin but packs a bunch of moisturizing properties my skin glows after using it. I use the green for normal skin in the summer and in the winter I use the pink which is for dry skin for extra moisture!
"I have been using this for about a year, and it my FAVORITE! I have combo skin and this moisturizer sinks in immediately. It's perfect to wear under makeup or alone and leaves my face soft and never oily. Even after trying more expensive moisturizers and I always come back to this one. I've gone through 3-4 jars of this stuff- I don't think I can go without it!"
This product works wonders for me. I am 16 and have oily/combination skin with breakouts. During a period I only used this product and water for for my skincare routine and my face totally cleared up. I have been through about four of these. Amazing! A forever favorite of mine.
This is such a great product. Soaks in immediately and makes my skin feel soft and smooth with out that sticky feeling a lot of lotions leave behind. Definitely my new favorite facial skin care product! Would love to see it come with just a bit of SPF.
"I love love love this face gel-cream. I got it about two weeks ago and I use it every day. My skin was so dry from where I wash it, so I started using this and it cleared my dry skin up. It's so refreshing. It comes in a little jar but a little goes a long way. I have a oily t-zone and its dry every where else. It also cleared up the oily skin. I love it and I will definitely buy again."
"I found a sample I had received and started to use it. You need so little, the scent is awesome, it is light almost feels like water. Anyway, I have very dry skin in the fall and all winter. In my eyebrows, between my eyebrows and my nose. My mom has the same issues. The little I received on the sample card was enough for 3 days. I saw the difference. I went right out and brought the jar. Mom and I are both using it every day and or night."
This is the best moistureizer that I have ever use. Great for dry and aging skin!
My skin is dry and Moisture Rescue makes my face feel soft and moisturized. I love it.
This is a great gel cream I like to use when I get home from a stressful day a work and want to do a nice skincare routine.
"Really liked this brand, I only have bought it once but it does a good job at what it's meant to do. And will definitely be buying again."
"LOVEEE. So moisturizing. I would definitely buy this again. It was weird to use a gel at first, but I loved it. It is a good price as well."
"It was very refreshing & would brighten my face, but it didn't smell that good so i stopped using it"
"I cannot get over the awful smell, and the sticky residue left on my skin even after the product dried."
My favorite lightweight moisturizer. Dupe for Clinique moisture surge. Great price and it's in all the big stores
This is a good light weight moisturizer that is refreshing when applied. The only downside is that it can feel sticky on the face.
I love this gel cream! It feels lightweight and makes the skin smooth and hydrated! I use this in the summer months. Price is good for the quality!
"I really like the formula, I think it is very good option especially in summer. My skin is mixed and this moisture is perfect for me"
"Very good. It really moisturize your face, making your face bloom and gloom. Awesome product! Amazing."
Great product. Feels good and is easy to apply. I recommend to anyone to use this product. Smells good too u like others.
I really enjoy how soft it made my skin feel . It has a nice light scent . The price is great and I would recommend this product to any one ..
AMAZING product for dry skin! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated! I noticed a difference right away!
I love this product. Leaves my skin soft and cares her. Recomended. I love it really. The smell is very good
This is one of my favorite moisturizer. It's very light on the skin. Once it's on you don't feel it. It's oil free. Great for people with acne
"So good for damaging after bleaching your hair , love it ! Is do gentle to my scalp and is so effective"
I like this a lot. It's hard to find but it has a nice texture. It's light enough for my oily sensitive skin. Has a nice fragrance too.
"Has a great scent and went on smoothly, however didn't make my skin feel very moisturized! I probably would not purchase again."
"Really good moisturizer. Used this in the morning, before applying my makeup, and at night. You'll see a difference!"
This is my favorite moisturizer it helps give my skin a natural glowing look that I love makes me look like I'm shining within in.
Wasn't very pleased with this product. But I love that it has an amazing scent. And it's super affordable also.
absolutely great I use it under my makeup and it works great. helps my dry skin dries really quickly isn't gressy.
This gel-cream is wonderful for combination skin like mine. It moisturizes but doesn't feel greasy or heavy!
I really love this product! This is an excellent brand. It gives me a perfect finish!I would reccomend it.
This gel is amazing for oily skin ! It moisturizes perfectly but leaves you feeling matte and flawless. One of the best drug store moisturizers I've ever tried !
I have dry flaky skin around my nose and forehead. I tried this product and right away I noticed my skin felt more moisturized and the flakiness disappeared. I love this product and will continue to use it!
"I bought this moisturizer because I love gel like products for my skin however this one just didn't work for me it left a silicone like texture to my skin that lasts for hours, and my skin still feels dry I wish I could get a refund"
I got this as a sample a long time ago and loved it so much I decided to buy the full size. Its great for sensitive skin and always does its job. My skin gets very dry in the winter but this never fails to help a gal out
The formula is very light and leaves skin feeling fresh and moisturized. Would say is very effective and I dont use it now because I used it for a long time. The packaging is cute and nice.
I really like this. It's moisturizing without making my face feel oily/greasy. This soaks into the skin better. And I'm already oily so this didn't make me feel like I was sweaty. I've used this basically everyday especially in the winter. Def need a new jar soon.
"This is my longtime old faithful affordable moisturizer. I use this in the summer when it's hot. It's a gel so it's light and drys down without tackiness. It doesn't feel heavy later in the sun. I have bought for years, will continue to. The packaging is nice and this lasts forever it feels like. Little goes a long ways!"
"I love this moisturizer! It feels so amazing when you put it on. It is a gel cream so it has a nice consistency, which makes it feel very nice and light on your skin. I like to apply it before I put my makeup on and it allows for a nice finish. This product is great."
"I just finished my ENTIRE container of this. It was very gentle on my skin, however I don't have very sensitive skin either. This moisturizer gave me so much hydration and truly just refreshed my face so much. I'm already onto my next container, i'm in love!!"
"I love this moisturizer!! I put it on before I put my primer on and it makes my skin so glowy. Since it is a gel, it doesn't leave your skin feeling oily and slippery, so your foundation doesn't slide off. I also put on in the morning and night. Worst the price!!Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream"
"I used the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Face Moisturizer SPF15, Fragrance Free before and loved it but could no longer find it in stores. I decided to try this one but it made me itch and then I started getting bumps. I stopped using it after the third days. I found the original one on ebay and bought two."
"I used to buy Clinique Moisture Surge, but the Garnier SkinActive-Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream is a much better product. Skin feels smooth and velvety after just one use. Great for summer or winter skin. Have all of my friends, and their husbands, using this great product."
"I have dry areas on my face which include my forehead, and above my lips. I started using this product about a month ago and the dryness has gone away. I also love that it is not an oily texture and dries right away. It also has a nice smell, although it is a very light fragrance. Totally recommend"
"Love this products because it moisture my skin so well and it soft my skin also. I love the feeling so smooth my skin all day long. I have been use this product for pretty long time it works really great for me, I either use this after shower when my skin is so dry and also Clearasil face and wash, mask. I am in love with Garnier product for a long time and I will stick with this moisture for long period of time."
I have combination skin that's oily in summer and dry in winter. I have been looking for a moisturizer that will work in both winter and summer. I think this is the one! I really like how the gel spreads smoothly on my face. I can apply it without having to rub my face. It's not sticky or thick like a hair gel. I absorbs fast and it feels great afterwards. I just started using this but I am so glad I decided to give it a try.
I've been using the Refreshing Gel-Cream for a week and I love it! I'm on a tight budget so I've been using cheap moisturizers for awhile and my skin was always oily and would break out. I knew I needed some kind of gel. This product makes my skin feel soft and keep it moisturized all day without making it oily. Great and affordable product!
my skin feels so soft and hydrated. i use this before going to sleep and its so relaxing to put on.
It works ok but not a product I would buy again I like to experiment with other products.
Best moisturizer ever! I use this ever morning and night my face so smooth after using this
I love how this moisture rescue refreshing gel cream makes your face feel so soft and clean
Works great if you just need a light moisturizer. Left a bit of a sticky film on my face.
Very refreshing and hydrates really good! I really like this product. It's reasonably priced too!
Garnier moisturizer gel cream is so rich and lightweight. It feels so nice on your skin
"It was ok, felt nice on the skin. little to no results were noted."
Refreshing
I have super oily skin and was a bit worried this would make me even more oily but i was amazed it didnt and it works great under makeup
"If you have oily to combination Skin, is recommend this. It's gel texture is lovely and a good make up base!"
Love the way my skin feels and looks after applying this refreshing moisture. It's light and absorbs quickly
I use this after washing my face at night and it is absolutely great! For those with really dry skin it is well worth it.
I got a sample of this. I need to buy this product now. It really locks in moisture for my skin. Thrilled with this product :-)
This moisturizer is just okay for the price it is not particularly hydrating nor did it make my skin feel super amazing
I've used this product daily and nightly and feel it does help with my dry skin patches on my face I would recommend trying it for sure
I love this product super light weight. And makes your skin feel so fresh and clean. This is a daily in my skin care routine.
"Love this garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue, scent is not so strong and gives you moisturising effect all day long!"
"Its so nice and soo goood , because the color is great, and the price is suitable. In terms of size it fits ."
A very hydrating mask that leaves your hair silky and soft. It helps to restore moisture to dry and damaged hair.
I received a sample of this and was excited to try it. I have to say I was let down. It didn't leave my hair as hydrated and soft as I had excepted it to. It did smell great and I would be willing to try it again.
"I have a very dry skin, and thick creams would just be hard to apply on but this product just makes it a lot easier to put on. It moisturizes and calm the dry skin."
"This item use to my skin healthy, soft n silky ,this product is awesome. I love it. It works amazing for my oily skin. It has a consistency of a gel so it doesn't let your skin grease. I also love the scent"
I loved the lightweight texture and how it sinks right in. I had really dry skin around my nose and mouth from an acne treatment and it was gone in 2 days. It moisturized my skin completely without it being heavy or greasy. I love it!
"This is my absolute favorite moisturizer of all time. It feels light and fresh, but my dry skin is super hydrated. It's not greasy at all, and has never made me break out...even with Georgia summer heat and constant working out!"
"For its price, which is pretty affordable, it really moistures the skin but i don't like it a lot because i prefer a thiker texture. I really recomend it to people who like their moisturize to be really light"
This is an absolute must during the winter. After you wash your face and it's dry you apply this gel cream to avoid that dry stretchy cracking feeling on your face. It feels amazing. No greasy after feeling or look.
This gel cream is amazing!! This makes my skin feel so soft and smooth! Also it hydrates my face so well!! I will be using this over and over again and would HIGHLY recommend this product!
"I have been using this product for about 6 months now after my acne products and I LOVE it. I've been threw about 4 jars now. This is now my holy grail moisturizer for sure, good bye Clinique moisture surge!"
"I already used this cream for a week now. my face feels still dry. Texture is very light. So if your skin is extremely dry, please purchase thicker moisture cream."
"This moisture gel is so refreshing. I even use it on my hands. After looking so dry for so long, they look great now. It is inexpensive and works well."
"This is not a good product for aging, dry skin. I purchased this thinking that it was going to help my dry skin. True, it absorbs quickly, but left my skin feeling dry and tight. Has an extreme odor of alcohol and perfume-not a good combination for dry skin. Did not improve my skin look or feel, absorbed too quickly, and a great waste of my money. This may be one of the worse products for dry skin that I have used, and I have tried a few."
"I cannot believe how bad this smells. Every single time I think maybe I was overreacting and open it, it's so bad I wonder how it's even made or purchased. And the smell lingers on my face!! It smells like rot with a hint of cucumber. Now I can't even stand the smell of good cucumber scents because it reminds me of this!!"
this stuff is great ! i used and i felt and saw results right away
I bought this a month ago and I'm obsessed! It is great for my combo skin.
"Loved it !!,Keeps face feeling super smooth and soft and more than anything super hydrated !!"
it's almost the best one I uesed before
"that's really good product, because ingredients is safe and do his job well, I think that brand is really good"
I love it. It works amazing for my oily skin. It has a consistency of a gel so it doesn't let your skin grease. I also love the scent
I have been using this for years! It is the only moisturizer I use. It feel refreshing and cooling. Love it!
I didn't really like this because of the smell and because I have really sensitive skin and it didn't really go well with it at all
Light formula that is perfect for my oily skin. I use it as a day time moisturizer but I prefer something a little thicker at night.
"After you clean your face this product will finish the process of clean and moisturize, my skin really felt soft!"
Was lackluster for my flaky oily combination skin. Just didn't rescue MY skin with adequate moisture.
its super light and makes your skin super soft. I highly recommend. Its looks like it is not a lot but trust me a little goes a long way!
I uses it to refresh my face from make up and moisturize it it.. Also it make my skin fresh and moisturized.. I like it alot.
Love this product. I use this everyday. Feels and smells amazing on my skin! It is pretty expensive though so use it wisely
I love this cream! It's refreshing and will save your skin life!!!!!! I'm in love and obsessed and Leah's have to get a refill
"Super light, and non sticky daytime moisturizer. Also has a cooling effect. Not recommended for night time use though"
"Omg I love the texture of this product, it smells incredible and I love keeping it in my bag in case my skin gets dry. Such a lifesaver!"
Love this product my face always feels great after I use it! Would totally recommend this to anyone!
"I am an oily skinned girl, so this moisturizer is perfect and doesn't make my skin more oily than it needs to be."
"I've been using this for years. I like everything about it. The texture, the scent, hydrates and feels very refreshing!"
"Don't question it,it's so good then what it said on box. Love the gel not make my skin oil but moisture."
"I love product very much, but I've stopped using it for one very simple reason, no SPF and I don't have money to keep buying different products. There needs to be a version of this with at least an SPF of 30, maybe 20."
The smell is horrid and it's more drying than anything (hello alcohol is like the 2nd ingredient).
Refreshing but didn't feel like I put anything on my skin since it absorbs really fast.
I broke out so much after using this my skin was so dry
Works wonders on my combo skin. Doesn't leave my skin feeling oily like most other moisturizers.
Very light. Not heavy or greasy. Soaks in for soft skin.
This was part of a Christmas gift and the recipient was pleased.
It felt good on my skin but I didnt notice any difference.
It kind of felt like I was rubbing aloe gel on my face but at least it didn't cause me to break out.
"I actually really like this! Nice gel, a little product goes a long way, dries mostly matte, and I am a repeat user. It's very affordable"
May be okay for others but didn't do well with my skin. Made it dry and more wrinkley (if that's possible).
"I love this product, just wish it weren't so pricey."
The Garnier skin active moisture rescuer fastening gel cream is an interesting product to use
"This product evaporates, when left opened--although it is quite refreshing."
I actualy use this product on my foot tattoo because it makes it look fresh and shiny.
