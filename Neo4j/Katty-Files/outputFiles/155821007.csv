2.2,"['1', '1', '4']"
I would give 0 stars if possible. I am a licensed aesthetician and have worked with Image Skin Care for over 7 years. Decided to order this item to check its authenticity since a few clients found it cheaper on the walmart website. But definitely not worth it. The product is fake and it doesnât even match the description. On the website it says âIntense Lightening Serumâ but on the product delivered it says âintense BRIGHTENING serumâ. DO NOT BUY IT! you get what you pay for.
"This is not the real serum, it's very thick and smells horrible."
