"I am a 39 year old man and this product delivers awesome results, if you use it as directed. I still use a moisturizer prior to using this product and let my skin absorb it first (per the directions), then apply the Dermasilk Eye Lift Cream. The direction say one pump is enough for both eyes and it is. The first time I applied the product I found it a bit odd but the second application was smooth and easy as I better understood the product and how it worked."
This really shrinks the eye bags...for most of the day. They changed the packaging...which I do not care for...the old tube was much easier to apply...the new one wastes the product.
"I tried this product in replacement of one that costs twice as much. To my surprise this product works just as well! Helps to reduce the appears of fine lines and wrinkles, even helps reduce big wrinkles under the eyes."
"This product does tighten eye area-temporarily while filling in fine lines. Like other review says, use a small amount, layering thickens this product and you end up with cracking. Does not replace eye cream or eye regimen."
"This product does not perform as promised. After applying, it does make the skin appear more ""taut"", however after makeup goes over it, as soon as one smiles or makes any expression with the eyes, the product ""cracks"" and makes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles much more apparent. I am most dissatisfied and am returning the product."
This burned my under eye and it did not diminish the bags as it should have. I much prefer sudden change under eye Serum
"It's great, but was10.00 at cvs. They no longer carry it it so, screwed"
