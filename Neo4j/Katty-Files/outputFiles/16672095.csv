I DON'T USE IT EVERY DAY. EVERY OTHER DAY. STILL SEE A CHANGE. MY FACE IS SO MUCH SOFTER. I TOUCH IT ALL THE TIME. THE SPOT.S ARE LIGHTING. GOOD STUFF.
"I bought this a couple months ago, used it once, and stopped using it because I thought I had an allergic reaction to it. I later starting using it again and have never gotten so many compliments on my skin! It got rid of so many of my dark acne scars that I was so insecure about, and also evened up my skin tone. It definitely does what it says, and I love how moisturizing it is. I definitely recommend!!!!!"
This has lightened sun damage spots on my face. The price is great!! Buy it!
quick results
It works
"The texture of the Eventone Fade Cream is very thick, smells slightly orange I think is the Vitamin C and the ingredients for even the skin. I believe are the oils but if you wear it on the day time is ""you're going to attract the sun"" I recommend the use under or with a Facial moisturizer with some SPF, or at night. a small amount goes a long way. I loving the results."
This product is working. I start using this product since 11-10-13 And I already see the difference the dark spots start to look lighter
Hands down Best Moisturizer for your lips! My lips used to stay cracked and dry all the time to the point my husband would complain. the more Chapstick I used ( which was constantly) the worse they got. I was out of Chapstick one day and my dad had some of this palmer's in his pocket and gave it to me...I was hooked ever since! I only have to apply it once a day at night before bed and my lips have been soft and smooth ever since. My favorite product in the Palmer's line.
Very bad this is the worst product I bought online these creams don't work
"Im sad because I was expecting good things from this but Im having some kind of reaction to the fade cream, its weird because I never really break out from trying products and this is the first time it happened. Im breaking out all over my fave and I lost my reciept so I dont even think I can return it"
"This is great!! I will be getting this again! I could tell the improment by the 2nd day. At 60 years old and damaged by the sun as well as skin problems I didn't have high hopes. My skin is now,brighter, and lighter, as well as giveing my an even tone. After smoothing it on my face in the A.M., then moisturazer, waiting a bit then my make-up. Palmer's Eventone Fade Cream makes me look younger and that makes me FEEL Younger!!"
"I have been using this fade cream for a few weeks. My dark spots do seem to be getting a bit lighter, but I have not noticed a really dramatic difference. I don't recommend wearing it under foundation, as it tends to flake. It's fine as a night cream."
"Using this product for 1 month did make my freckles and age spot fade. I wish it did not have any fragrance, but the fragrance is not to strong as long as I apply a lite coat. This is the first facial moaturizer I have found that does not have an unbearable fragrance."
I have oily skin and i had troubles with my skin recently ..... which left scaring i wishbone i could show before and after pictures because this product really works not instantly i bought this on Jan 6 and it's Feb 3 and the number one scar i been trying to get rid of if almost gone by the end of February it should be i highly recommend this. Not alone though i used with as a moist rose after using a face wash or mask and after id apply some vitamin e oil or castor oil.
"This face cream offers ample hydration for any skin type. I find it to be a little heavy at times, but it has made a significant improvement in the appearance of my complexion. I also use it on the back of my hands at night for regeneration. I highly recommend it!"
Noticed a change during the first week. Oil would cake up around my nose while using other products. Palmers dried up the oil and softened my skin. I use the cleanser and the fade cream. My face is moisturized without feeling or appearing greasy. What ever you decide to use...please use a a buffer pad to exfoliate and get AMAZING results! Thanks Palmers!
"It's better to use it as a on the spot treatment if you're black because when you apply it to your entire face or body, it tends to lighten up the surface instead of the actual blemish spot."
The cream appears to be working. I am going to give it at leas 90 days to see if it will create a more even tone complexion. My goal is for the cream to lighten the dark areas on my face to blend in with the light areas to create an even skin tone.
Applied on my face on Saturday. Felt a tingly sensation. Figured it was working. But Sunday I broke out in a rash and stopped using. Itchy and red face! Made my face worse! It is now Thursday and still my face has not improved.
"I love the fragrant lemon smell as well as the smooth consistency of the cream which unfortunately the regular Palmers Cocoa Butter fade cream doesn't have. One more thing, it works right away, I'll say within the first two weeks, there is a noticeable difference."
This product seems to be working. My pigmentation appears somewhat lighter each day. I would recommend this product
Best lip balm ever! I've tried other brands and felt they were too oily. This is perfect for my lips! I'll never use anything else again
"I bought this chapstick on a whim a few months ago and I'm never going back. I recommend it to everyone. It works beautifully, its a great price and its got spf."
This cream is just a delight....wow! I use it before I go outside and it works to protect. It feels very good and it is better than make up/foundation for my skin.
"Best lip balm hands down. My daughters and I keep one in our cars, purse, bathroom, nightstand..."
I use it for dark spot on my foot and elbow and it works.
This product made my skin break out. Won't buy this again.
"My forehead broke out, became dry and left black blotches... Don't touch this product if you have sensitive skin!"
"I would recommend this just because of the name Palmer. I like their products. I have not used this long enough to see results, but I sure hope that it works."
just start using the fade cream so im not seeing any difference in my complexion yet but it's easy going on not oily not bad so far so i will still be using it
"the cream is very rich, smells of coconut and seems to be working to light my dark spots gradually. It is one of the more economical fade creams so i will definitely keep trying it."
I've been using Their Fade Cream for years.... and I have no idea what went wrong. The formula is different. The cream is hard coming out of the bottle and smells awful.
I like that it fades dark spots and it has sunscreen in it.... daily moisturizer
