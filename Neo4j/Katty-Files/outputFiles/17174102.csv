"I am over 60, but need a lighter weight moisturizer with tint, for humid summers. Thus far, this product does the trick. I am pleased with the coverage and overall feel of Olay Total Effects 7. A tinted moisturizer works well for my skin, giving it a fresh look vs. a matte finish. I recommend this if you want a product that goes on smoothly, provides some coverage, and feels great on your face."
I received a sample of this product and was unable to find it anywhere. When I found the Olay 7 in one moisturizer with a touch of foundation on the Walmart website I ordered it immediately. This is an excellent product. Use very sparingly as the coverage and benefits are broad. Use in place of your regular foundation - it's that great. The product has a very light and pleasant fragrance and the product lasts all day without feeling greasy or faded. I highly recommend this product and am pleased that I have a source to purchase.
This is the second occasion I purchase this an Olay Total Effects7. I love the look and feeling on my skin. The foundation is very smooth that it vanishes the look of wrinkles around the eyes. And the skin complexion improves on my face.
I am in my 60's and have been using this product for over a year. I love the way it looks and makes my skin feel soft. I never used a lot of makeup and this has just the right amount of tint. This is the only foundation I use. There are so many different colors in foundations and I gave up trying to match my skin color. This is the perfect solution.
I have been looking for a moisturizer tried all the high end.This one is so moisturizing and see results instantly.My skin feels plumped up moisturized and youthful.
I have used this for many years. This provides good coverage as a makeup base for me because it is tinted. Goes on smooth and does not crack. Light weight and stays on all day! #sweepstakes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Total Effects! I was excited when I found this product. Unfortunately, the shade is too light for me. If your skin tone is medium, deep or dark then this is not for you. I recommend this for fair and light tones. Olay, please add more shades for more skin tones."
"I really have not had enough time using this product to really judge it. Product goes on good and really the problem is the tint. I purchased the lightest tint I found. Seems as though the range is too much going from light to medium, so it ended up being to dark for my complexion. I had no issue with moisturizer other than stated."
"I love olay products but was a little disappointed with this one. Not enough moisture for me. I Feel like I'm putting on makeup instead of moisturizer. Will be nice to have on hand when I might need extra coverage, but not good for everyday use. I would recommend for those who do not need as much moisture as I do. And if you like light foundation, it can cut down on time by being a two in one product."
"I purchased this cream because I previously used the olay total effects moisturizer with a ""touch of sun"" which I loved. However, this product was a little too greasy for my oily complexion and the foundation isn't adequate to wear alone. This product would be excellent for someone with dry skin who doesn't require full coverage foundation. For the price though I would recommend the olay total effects moisturizer underneath your favorite foundation."
I'm very happy to have discovered this product. In the past I've used a moisturizer alone without foundation because the foundation would show dry patches in my skin. This product is the only one that solves my problem! Super smooth with UV protection too. I would like it even better if the tint of the foundation was a shade lighter. I need to add another moisturizer to lighten the color.
"I just bought this product on Saturday, used it on Sunday and was amazed at how much better my face looked with the first use! I am now getting the eye cream and night cream. Can't wait to see how my skin looks after several uses. Also having trouble with major acne breakouts so hopefully this helps."
"This item arrived and the seal on the box was open and the inside of the top had the cream all in it. I believe it has been used. I don't drive so I have to wait for a friend to be able to have the time to take me to a store to return it. Is there a way I can return this and receive a new item via mail? This is the on,y reason I am giving this item a poor rating."
"do not order this by mail, the pump does not work, worst buy I have made in years."
"I have used this product for a while now and love it. I couldn't find it anywhere, so I was happy to find it on WalMart's website. WalMart has often come thru when I'm looking for something."
"I love this product, it's great!!! Kill 2 birds with 1 stone, it's awesomeness!!! Love it :)"
Amazing feeling and excellent result after use.
Very good price and produce!!!
I'll never look 18 again but this is easy to use and gives the 'no makeup' look
"I was told Touch of Foundation replaced Touch of Sun, which I loved. I tried Touch of Foundation & was disappointed to say the least. The foundation is too dark for the average woman. It is not as creamy & does not glide on as well as Total Effects with Touch of Sun did, which should not have been discontinued."
"I don't usually review products, but I'm LOVING this stuff! Been using this for about 3 weeks, and the results are amazing! Skin tone is more even, pores are smaller, and my face is so smooth. I was looking for something light for the summer, and this is a perfect alternative to foundation. I've also got sensative skin, but I've had zero issues with this. Will definitely continue using and highly recommend to others looking for light natural coverage and moisture!"
"I LOVE this product! I have never, ever written a review on a beauty product but I feel compelled to let P&G know that they simply MUST continue to produce this stuff. It is the BEST light foundation EVER! I have tried so many other products and nothing compares. Products with sunscreen leave a residue and less than flattering shine all over my face. This stuff makes your skin look healthy, evens out skin tone and feels so light. Thank you P&G!"
"I've been using this for a few years now. Nothing else compares. I've used the ones by Olay with sunscreen in them, but this one is by far the best. I love how my make up goes on over it, leaves my face flawless. Or sometimes I just apply it with some concealer for a fast clean (try, but didn't really try) look. Keeps my face from being dry, yet doesn't let it get oily. Though I love it, but it is sometimes hard to find in stores."
"I've been using this product for a few years with complete satifsaction. Lately the texture of the product is not consistent. One bottle will be of lotion ""weight"" and the next bottle will be so thin it almost runs off my fingers before I can apply it. From past experience, I am disappointed this seems to happen more and more often."
"This has WAY MORE than just a ""touch of foundation""! It's so thick and brown it went on streaky and I came out looking like I had on bad fake tanner stuff. So, I washed it all off and tried to mix it half and half with the un-colored Total Effects moisturizer. But this stuff has so much pigment to it that didn't even work either. This just doesn't work on my fair skin."
I have never found a must have beauty product until this item. It smoothes away blemishes on my skin unlike any foundation. I do not plan to buy a foundation or other facial moisturizer as long as this product is carried. Please make it more readily available and thank you Olay! I have had many compliments on my changed appearance and many women wanting to purchase it immediately
"T E 7-in-1 is the best product ever! Talk about getting your moneys worth! My pores appeared smaller, my skin is lifted more, and I'm moisturized all over- those fine lines are hardly visible! You have to try this- if you only try one product in your life!"
Love it. Have not used any foundation since I found this about 5 years ago. It's very kind to my mature skin.
This is a very nice product. Smooths on evenly . Really helps to even out skin tone. I probably need one that has spf.
Goes on smooth.
Love this product. I use this instead of makeup. Goes on so smooth and seems to cover what it should. I highly recommend this product instead of using a liquid make up that shows your pores a lot. Having a touch of foundation in this is great. Highly recommend you try this product! Well worth the price!
"I've been using this product for years, close to 20. I never liked heavy foundations that cake on, or rub off clothing, which this does not. Unfortunately, I'm having a difficult time finding it in the usual places where I buy it. I'm hoping it's not discontinued!! I would certainly recommend this product."
"I have a light, Caucasian skin tone and this cream is too dark for me.  It has a lot more pigment than I had thought so it alters the colour of my foundation. I'm giving it a 3 because the cream itself is nice, although not as moisturizing as I would have liked. "
"I have been using your products since I was 18 yrs old, I am now 61. I get so many compliments on my skin and I'm told I look like I'm in my 40's. I credit this to your products. I have tried other products, but have never found anything better. I also introduced my daughter to your products and she too is a believer. Just wanted to thank you for your constant improvement on your products. Sincerely Donna"
I went to the Olay for you website. They said i should use Total Effects. Ive been only using it for a couple of weeks now. I can already see a change. I have 2 children in with the pregnancy i got brown spots on my face. With this lotion it is already lighten them up. But if u are fair skin dont use this one. The color of it will go better with medium or tan skin.
"This product has a lot of foundation in it, and it is too dark for my fair skin. It made my complexion look muddy and there was a definite line of demarkation all around my face. When I got outside and looked in my car's mirror, I had to go back inside and wash my face because it looked so ridiculous. I may try it again, thinned out with another moisturizer. But I would rather get my money back!"
"The fine lines around my eyes are hardly noticeable. The color blends well with my fair, freckled skin. I don't wear any other foundation, or powder with this product and my skin absolutely glows! I've been using Olay products for twenty years, since my Grandmother bought me my first moisturizer and SPF. This does not disappoint."
"I have used several other brands of tinted moisturizers but this is the only one that I felt was more of a moisturizer than a foundation. I love the way my skin feels with this on. And the coverage from the touch of moisturizer is just enough. I have acne prone skin and don't like to cake on make up, this gives me a nice base. I have used another well known cosmetic line and none of their tinted moisterizers blended with my skin tone as well as this did."
I just used this product for a week I can see the good result in my skin...
This is the best! I use it as a moisturizer and foundation!
Love this-good scent and really creamy. Good tint so on weekends this is all I use on my face. Not heavy or greasy. Only concern is more comes out on a pump than I really need.
"This makes me glow! I love the tiny hint of color in the moisturizer. The smell is decent, and it blends perfectly. Hint: use a makeup brush for a flawless application."
"Thus product is absolutely amazing!!! I love it so much, I use it all the time. And I love how it's just the perfect amount of foundation. I totally recommend."
"I really liked the idea of this product since it has the total effects benefits and that it has a touch of foundation, but since I have light skin, it is too deep a medium color for me. It also feels thick and not lightweight."
My grandmother always used Oil of Olay and now I use only Olay products. I love the foundation in the moisturizer. I can go out with just the Total Effects Mosturizer and mascara! I am told I look like I'm in my late 20's and I'm 40!
I like using tinted moisturizers. This product offers great and very natural coverage. It moisturizes without feeling heavy or sticky and it lasts all day.
Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging UV Moisturizer plus Touch of Foundation is the best purchase I have ever made for my skin. I won't even try anything else. It makes my skin look and feel amazing!
"I have been using this stuff since I was 18. Years later, I love my skin, and am told time and time again how young I look. This is the only anti-aging/moisturizing cream I have ever used and ever will. Thanks Olay!"
"I purchased Total Effects moisturizer with a touch of foundation with high expectations. My skin is very dry, so I have to keep moisturizer on it all the time. This product just makes my skin feel tight and drawn. I am very disappointed in this product."
"I really despise products that contain nasty smelling sunscreen so I was happy this one didn't include it. The foundation is nice, but it takes a lot of it to even show up. I got the medium and I'm white as a ghost. Any lighter and it wouldn't have worked for me at all. It's also not very moisturizing at all."
I have extremely dry skin and cannot use just any product on my face. With this product I get both moisturizing and make-up in one that lasts all day. I have even had compliments on how good my skin looks while wearing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love my Olay CC Cream -Total Effects Daily Moisturizer + Touch of Foundation. I use it every night before bed and every morning after I wash my face. I love the way it smells and it makes my face look and feel ten years younger! I dont even wear any makeup on top of it because of the touch of foundation. I can just rub it on and go. It even has sunscreen in it so I feel extra protected. I would and do recommend this lotion to everyone I know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a perfect foundation which can be used daily and yet keep the skin healthy and glowing. Acts as a concealer as well. A combination of Daily moisturizer and touch of foundation keeps the skin hydrated whole day and gives a make-up like look. Absolutely love this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used the tint moisturizer for awhile, and it makes such a difference in the dryness and lines on my face.Ive had many questions, especially from my sister wanting to know what I have been using. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product and it is really effective. Even in very harsh weather. I was in India where pollution level is so high but because of this product I was able to maintain my face skin clean and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love knowing that my moisturizer has a little foundation in it so I do not have to apply another foundation. My skin is light and does not have much blemishes so I do not need to use a heavy foundation to cover any areas on my face. The cream is so light I barely feel that I have any cream on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using these products for quite a few years now; cleanser, moisturizer and moisturizer with a touch of foundation plus, occasionally the ""Touch of Sun"" moisturizer. I don't know if they make me LOOK younger but they certainly make me FEEL good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this CC cream for over a year now. I absolutely love the texture of this cream. It is moisturizing enough to work as a moisturizer but also provides the coverage that I like for everyday use. I do not like to apply foundation daily and this CC cream gives me the perfect working balance of correcting my skin and providing just the right amount of coverage. It leave my skin glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVE this product! It provides a nice moisturizer and a wonderful light foundation coverage. I have been using this product ever since turning 50 and I want nothing else!! I am almost 55 and am always complimented on my skin by my dermatologist and friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tried several other brands, but this CC Cream is my favorite. It's so light and creamy. I use it everyday before putting on my foundation. Makes my face feel silky but it's not heavy - almost like it's not there. Wonderful product - use it along with Regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the first time I've tried this product. I buy the 7 in one eye treatment, which I really like and use on my entire face. I thought this would be about the same, but I was completely wrong. This is a creamy foundation that I can't/won't use. I have a different view on what a touch of something is, I guess. I want my money back."
"I'm a huge fan of Olay products and have probably tried just about everything. This is my favorite product. I love that it leaves my skin soft, smooth, minimizes my pores and leaves me with a touch of sun! Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many brands of CC cream and found Olay's Total Effects to be the best. I love the feel of the non greasy moisturizer on my face. It contains accurately labeled foundation color that does not make lines and wrinkles show even more after applying. This is very important at my age. Like all Olay products that I have tried, it gives my face a more radiant look. I highly recommend this CC moisturizing cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Total Effects Daily Moisturizer + Foundation for quite a few years. I like the coverage and moisture it adds to my daily routine. It is a light coverage, but is also a natural look which I strive to achieve. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay is well known for excellent cleansers, treatments and moisturizers. The Total Effects Daily Moisturizer with a touch of color refreshes, protects and smoothes the skin with a bonus of a touch of color. No need to add a foundation. Just grab and go! It's perfect! You will love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just love a product that gives me total protection and works well at making me look younger! When even a doctor can't tell your age, you know that you found a winner! I also like that one product does the job of two. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Goes on nice and smooth and has just the right amount of foundation. I was nervous at first because it looked dark but it blended in perfect and makes my skin feel so soft. I hate the feeling of foundation but this feels nothing like it-just a good lotion. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Total Effects CC Cream: Really moisturizing + foundation for serious confidence in appearance. Even during the warm seasons, I apply with a damp sponge & still get good coverage with this skin smoothing product. Add SPF protection & it is a pretty perfect daily treatment before heading out. If people want even more SPF, I would recommend applying moisturizer + CC Cream but try it the other way first: surprisingly good results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When ever I am not going out or just running errands I love to use this product. I gives you a light coverage and I finish it off with the Cover girl pressed powder, that also contains Olay. It's name is Advanced Radiance. I alternate this product and Regenerest Serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is hard for me to find in the stores! I LOVE it though!!! I don't have to wear foundation. The color matches my skin perfectly and the beauty is that it already contains a sunscreen. I use Olay soap and moisturizer. I always have. This brand and product can be trusted 100%! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for many years , I am 80 years old and people always can't believe my age ..they say ,"" what do you use that your face is so beautiful "" , I always tell them about Olay products . Thank you . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Out of all the CC cream product's i've tried, this so far has the most going for it. It not only made my skin look flawless, but it smoothed out fine lines and wrinkles and just gave me that little glow that i've always searched for. Everyone needs to have this in their arsenol of products used daily. I can't live without this and I hope it is in their permanant line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product daily and it works to keep my skin moisturized, fresh looking without the make up feel or appearance. It is natural as if you were wearing nothing. My only problem is I have a hard time finding the medium tint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like my daily moisturizer plus foundation because it gives an even touch of color to my face. The moisturizer is enough to keep my skin (which is very dry) from needing touch ups during my day. I would recommend the moisturizer and the foundation to anyone who is in need of even skin tone during the day. I use the plain moisturizer at night to give extra hep to my dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love everything about this product except the fact that it only comes in one color. It is way too dark for my fair skin so I have to use the CC and it does not give vthe same amount of coverage or last as long. Please offer this in a lighter shade.
"Good coverage, helps cover some redness and makes my skin feel soft. I have pretty fair skin and find the colour too dark, so I just use less and blend in some additional moisturizer (I use Nivea). Love that it adds some colour and doesn't feel heavy."
"I love this product. Regular foundations on my face feel very heavy. Because this product is a moisturizer with a tint of foundation, it is very refreshing and light on my face. The coverage is perfect for my complexion. My only wish is that Olay does not stop making this product."
"I have extremely sensitive skin and got bad dermatitis/eczema around my eyes from using foundation. This product has been a life saver! I can use it on my skin without reaction, AT ALL. It looks really natural but still blurs imperfections and it feels like there is nothing on my skin at all. Also, I have dry skin an this works great, so moisturising and soothing!"
I like the effects of CC creme on my face plus like the touch of foundation. It's light and looks great on my face. It's just right most days and if I want a different look I use a touch of powder. The foundation is almost invisible. It doesn't look like I painted my face and lets my skin breathe.I have had many compliments as to how good my face looks and how do I look so young. I think it makes my skin look so natural and that's what I like. At my age I don't want to look like I went to the body shop and got a paint job
"I really love this product! It goes on easily and stays put all day. Even though I have dry skin, many of the tinted moisturizers I have tried make my skin feel greasy or oily. This doesn't do that at all. The color seems to work for me....whether my skin tone is a little lighter in the winter or a little bit darker during the summer. I would definitely purchase this Olay product again."
"I just used this kind of Olay just few days ago , The first I put it in my face it was not so appealing beacuse the color of foundation doesnt match with my color of skin, I wish they have more color of foundation available. But when it take a while it works real good after a few hours."
"This was by far one of the best purchases I have made for just me. With 3 kids, work, school and sports, there isn't much time for Mommy Time, so I made a commitment to at least do this at night before bed and what a difference it has made. I used to by the department store Brands like Lancome, but after my husband lost his job, that wasn't an option anymore. I will never buy anything else now. Thank you Olay"
I love Olay products I have been using them for many years. This one is no exception.
Love this product. It helps my skin to be moisturized and at the same time works as a natural looking foundation.
"Thus product is absolutely amazing!!! I love it so much, I use it all the time. And I love how it's just the perfect amount of foundation. I totally recommend."
Love this CC cream......just the right coverage for a mature woman like myself. Put CC cream on and boom! you are done with your moisturerizer and makes up all at once. A real time saver! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This may be overboard but I use the moisturizer with spf 15 then use this total effects plus touch of foundation. It doesn't feel heavy and the color is just right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Use this product daily as a moisturizer and with just enough foundation in it I don't need to use additional foundation. Great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Good at hiding your imperfection/discolorations with the touch of foundation. Moisturizer is OK but wish it was a little more moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for several yardears and it is wonderful! Very moisturizing and has just enough of a tint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Amy I wrong or did Olay take out the sunscreen in the product? They used to print an SPF on the packaging. Sad. I like the color and the feel but am disappointed by the lack of sunscreen.
Have used this since introduced and tried other moisturizers but this is the best. The touch of foundation is great for days you don't want to wear makeup.
"I love the velvety smooth texture, blends beautifully. The coverage is just right. Not a full-coverage look, but great for light coverage. Smooths out fine lines and dry wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
