"I have been using Oil of Olay facial cleanser for at least 10 years. I never have to worry about break outs, or drying out my skin. Love all their products! I don't use anything else."
"My skin has been changing a lot lately (hit 40 and wrinkles really emerged). With combination skin battling both wrinkles and acne...I found most products either stripped my skin too dry or over-moisturized. Saw an ad for the Olay for You website and tried it. It recommended this product, and I couldn't be happier. After just a week of using, my skin is much improved. Now I'm researching all the OTHER Regenerist products I can! I'm so thrilled to finally find something that works so well for my skin type."
"I just tried Regenerist Cleanser and the dead skin cells on my face started to peel off. Within two days I saw a visible difference on my facial skin, the fine lines literally disappeared. My skin is moist and supple with an even tone. I had a bottle of Olay Age Defying anti-wrinkle Daily Moisturizer which for some reason was sitting in my vanity draw unused, so I added that to my routine with the Night of Olay Cream, my skin feels and looks a lot better so I am going to buy the Regenerist line from now on. I give it 5 stars."
My go to cleanser! But seriously get better packaging. I end up with half the stuff on my hands and face when I squeeze the tub. But I LOVE the cleanser!
"I am 42 yrs old and have used Clinique for about 22 yrs. With the economy the way it is I have to save my pennies. I have to say I am so glad I found olay regenerist cleanser. It is wonderful, my skin looks ten times better that it ever did using clinique. Thank you oil of olay. You have helped save money in these trying times."
"I'm reviewing this product purchased at Walmart to enter an Influenster contest. I had this product before and I have to say I like the consistency, the smell and how it cleans BUT I truly miss the beads. I wish they wouldn't have taken that off it. #Influenster #Contest"
"While not as oily as it was when I was younger, my skin is not dry. A lot of age-defying cleansers I've tried were too heavy and left my face feeling greasy, and products for younger skin left it feeling too dry. The Regenerist Daily Regenerating Cleanser is the perfect balance of moisture and cleanser. After washing, my face feels both clean and soft. It's the only facial cleanser I'll buy."
I've used a lot of other face washes and this one is hands down the best. I've used beta-hydroxy products since they started coming out with them. The exfoliating process of the Daily Regenerating Cleanser plus the moisturizing aspects make this my favorite. It must work. I get a lot of compliments about how young I look. I owe it all to Olay.
I am a firm believer that it takes at least a couple of weeks to note any difference with new products so imagine my surprise when after only 4 uses my skin is baby smooth. I used morning and night after use a cleanser. It is non-abrasive and gets the job done. Do yourself a favor and get this!
"I am 73 years old and have bee using this Olay facial cleanser for over 25 years and my skin still looks good. People often don't believe me when I tell them how old I am. Part of that may be good genes, but I am convinced that Olay cleanser and moisturizer have a wonderful effect. Try it. You'll like it."
I loved Olay Regenerist Cream cleanser it really exfoliates great! But it really isn't for dry or sensitive skin!
"Smells amazing, my face feels very clean after using it, and exfoliating. Used other brands, and always come back to this. Little amount goes a long way."
Great product my skin is smoother and more vibrant.
Really like this cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can not say enough great things about this cleanser! The Regenerist Daily Regenerating Cleanser is an amazing product. I have dry skin that gets easily irritated by cleansers, this cream cleanser has left my skin feeling; clean, soft, and exfoliated all in one simple step without drying my skin. It even removes my eye make-up! It seems to also help with blemishes, which is an added benefit. My moisturizer glides on very smooth. So affordable. I can't picture a day in my life without it!"
"I love Olay in general. This Cleanser is by far the best i have ever used, and i have used many ""mall"" cleansers. It exfoliates, which is great for my extremely dry skin. It allows the moisturizer to be a smooth application. I will forever use this product as it helps regenerate my dry flakes, and cleanses soooo well!"
This is the only Olay product I use and I love it. It does an excellent job in cleaning the makeup off and I also use it as a skin exfoliate.
Did not remove long wear make up. Plastic beads painful.
"The old formula was the first cleanser I'd used in years that actually made my skin look and feel better. The new"" deeper cleaning"" formula has caused me to have a slew of break outs."
Don't change it! My skin had to go through a lot to find the right cleanser. I love Olay and I'm writing this review just so they don't discontinue it!
"I recently had a rhinoplasty which left the pores on my nose very large and clogged. I began using Regenerating Cleanser and my pores were not only minimized, but my skin was radiant! This cleanser is awesome!"
I have been using this product once per week at night for about a month. I love how smooth my skin feels after I use this. And I do think it helps the moisturizer work better. However I'm not sure how often this can be used because it manually exfoliates the skin. Can I use this everyday? In the morning and evening? Or would that be overkill? I only gave 4 stars because I have been using another cleanser when I don't use this.
"I was very skeptical when Olay changed the formula. I'd been using it exclusively for a couple of years & absolutely loved it. I have extremely sensitive skin, and it was the only cleanser I could trust to keep my skin clean and pampered at the same time. I tried the new formula and I love it even more than the original! It feels even gentler to my skin, but leaves my face feeling touchably soft and looking amazing. It's my new favorite! Thanks Olay for making a terrific product even better."
long time user of this cleanser. After first use noticed difference. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and used entire thing and feel the same. Skin is left feeling dryer like I get from the pore scrub. This also now leaves micro-beads that get caught up in hairline and neckline even after rinsing over and over. Need to use a towel & magnifying mirror to buff them away. To overcompensate for the dryness from cleanser I'm using more moisturizers. I will not be purchasing again
"I loved the previous formula, it was the first cleanser in years that actually improved tone, texture, and cleared my skin. I loved it. The new formula leaves my face feeling more oily, and I'm suffering break outs again. I still have some of the old formula, and it's a huge difference how my face feels after either product. :("
"i love the whole line of regenerating products. my face never felt cleaner, younger & fresher. i look forward to using the products daily it makes me feel refreshed like i have new skin. PLEASE don't change this line it is the best ever. i highly recommend it."
"This stuff works wonders, it's so creamy and hydrating yet it still exfoilaites just enough. Love it and have recommended it to my sisters and friends. I've been using this for about 4 months now and won't stop- it's the best cleanser out there for dry skin!"
"I purchased and used the thermal microdermal cleanser before I tried this one. This one was very creamy, but unlike the microdermal one, it didn't have the texture or grittiness for exfoliation that I had hoped. I think I would have liked it a more if its texture was just a bit more like a scrub. I haven't noticed much in the ways of detoxifying. I use it in my morning shower and it works well as a cream cleanser, but it is lacking in the exfoliating area."
"I have huge pores on my cheeks I used this product once and saw a difference. It was worth every penny. I can see my pores shrinking with each use. easy to use, very gentle. Skin is left soft and feels clean. I plan to try other products in the future."
I thought this would be a gentle cleanser for aging skin. This is a very gritty exfoliator.
It cleans the skin good. leaves no residue. good product.
I have been using this product for about one year. I like the way my skin feels after I use it. Great product!
This is a wonderful product to put moisture back into dry or aging skin. I am in my 70's and this cream cleanser restores much needed moisture and nutrients my skin needs. Very good product.
"I have dry skin, but once in a while I break out a little and this helps without drying my skin out. Plus it exfoliates gently to help my dry skin not get dull. I use this the most out of all of the Regenerist products!"
I dislike this new formula because it does not clean as well as old formula and I hate the little white beads it leaves on my face no matter how much I rinse. I spend more time picking them off my face in a magnifying mirror than it's worth! I will not buy this anymore unless you bring back the original!
My husband bought this cleanser for me last fall. I have never used it before but needed some cleanser and he came home with this. It is the best cleanser ever!!! I will not use anything else!!!! It does everything it says and so much more. I already look young for my age but this helps me look even younger.Thank you Olay for making an afforadable product that works better than any of the expensive brands.
"this new formula for the regenerist cream cleanser is in no way better than the prior formula...i had used this particular cleanser for many years....i will not purchase this new version again....and, i am just hoping that i will be able to find something similar to what olay regenerist USE to be....it USE to be amazing..."
I agree with many of the recent reviews here....why did you change the formula? it was amazing! it WAS perfect! Now---I actually checked to make sure I didn't buy the wrong product. It just isn't as effective and doesn't have the same feel after use that it used to have. PLEASE bring back the previous formula!!!!! I LOVE the regenerist product line---- so it pains me to write this review. My hope is that you will respond to the consumers and find a way to bring back the product we all LOVED.
"After years of searching for a face cleanser that worked for my skin, I was a loyal and happy user of the original cleanser. It balanced my combination skin perfectly. This new, thin formula makes my face look and feel greasy all day. As another user pointed out, they also took out many of the great ingredients. WHY? Please, please bring the old formula back."
This product is working well with my daily skin routine. I bought this along with the Olay Luminous Cleanse Brightening Cream Cleanser. I use these two together and it works great! I quit using Oil of Olay products for awhile because of the ingredients of parabens. Olay finally removed the paraben that was listed in the old face washes so I have loved this one. Has very nice light scent to it as well.
This is another great cleanser I use in the Olay line. It too has made a difference in my complexion and helped tone down my rosacea and my pores are smaller too. For the price this is a fantastic product and I will continue to use it. It also smells wonderful.
"This new formula removed pro vit B5, vitamin c & e, beta hydroxy and amino peptides. It is thin and no longer creamy. This watered down formula is no longer working for my skin. Why did you change? The old formula worked so well for the price. Oh well. Now I'm returning to Mary Kay Timewise."
"This is the BEST cleanser I have ever used and I have used many that were much more expensive. A very small amount is all I need to melt all my make up off, including eye makeup. It cleaned so well and was super gentle on my sensitive skin. I will be using no other cleanser from now own !!!"
"I'd been suffering with noticeable pores, breakouts and hyper-pigmentation as a result of adult acne. I've tried everything from Proactiv to bar soaps. I started using Olay products, specifically, Olay Regenerist and the rest is history! I've gotten so many compliments in the past month since I've started using it, it's unbelievable! My son even told me that my skin looks smoother and more even! I'm not as apprehensive about going out without makeup, because, my skin is steadily improving."
Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser offers a spa like cleansing treatment. It feels so good on my skin when I'm washing my face. The micro-beads are very stimulating & soothing. It works great with the rotating facial cleansing brush. My skin feels plump & velvety smooth after. There's never any redness or irritation. My 22 year old son actually uses it. I don't bother telling him it's for women. I just buy twice as much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using your products for over 20 years. I love each and everything I use. I use the facial cleanser, night Cream and facial lotion with spf 15 in the morning. I also use Olay soaps and in shower lotion. I would recommend to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Regenerist Serum is the best product ever! It has made my skin so much better! I use it under my foundation everyday and my skin stay hydrated and moisturized all day. It just keeps working all day and I just love it. Also, without the fragrance using this make product makes it a pure joy to use! I would recommend this product to anyone, any age group! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product because it deep cleans with little beads but it's gentle, creamy & easy to use too! I would recommend this product to others who have sensitive skin. Most cleansers irritate my skin but never OLAY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Love the soft cleansing scrubs in this. I have oily/dry skin. It cleans without drying. Takes off all my make-up without leaving anything behind. My husband even uses it in the summer. He works outside and the dirt gets in his pores and causes pimples. This cleans his face much better than soap. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best product I've ever used! I'm 65 years old, and have been using Olay products since my Mother introduced me to them in my 20's. I began using Regenerist products as I aged. The cleanser not only cleanses, but refreshes my skin, and just makes me feel younger! I can't imagine my life without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser is amazing!!!. It removes all your make-up and leaves your face feeling so clean. Not only is it clean, but it is so soft and smooth. I use this cleaner every night followed by Regenerist Serum. My husband loves to run his hands over my face, and I certainly don't mind the extra attention!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this cleanser for several years and I feel it does the best job for the right price. My skin feels clean and smooth. Does not make it red and does a through job cleaning. I use it with the Pro x cleaning brush. What a great combo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Even though I've used Olay for many years, I saw an almost immediate improvement in my skin when I started using the Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser. I tried it because my brother got it free (sale and coupons), but continue to use it because it makes my face feel terrific! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I have been out of my twenties the signs of aging have slowly started to sneak up on me. I received a sample of this in the mail and won't go back to anything else. I can honestly say it has decreased the freckles I've gotten over the years as well as keeping those sneaky crows feet at bay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

With Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser you face feels soft and glows. I get comments all the time on my complexion. This product is easy to use and the cost is reasonable.

I have used this product to cleanse my face for several years. I always get told how much younger I look than I actually am. I tried other products and immediately went back as they don't work as well. I have spent time in the sun as I love to garden and this cleanser is the best ever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am delighted with the Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser. I wash my face twice a day with the cleanser and I am very happy with the results.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream cleanser because it is gentle, but still cleans and exfoliates while providing the anti-aging benefits of Olay Regenerist. I use the cream cleanser on my sensitive skin and have never had any issues. I always follow up with Regenerist serum or moisturizing cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using regenerist regenerating cream cleanser for about 10 years. I enjoy it today as much as I did the very first time. I keep it in my shower and it is a pleasant way to ""wake"" up my skin each morning. It has just enough grit to exfoliate and leaves my face smooth and refreshed. A great way to start the day!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using regenerating cleanser by Olay for about 6 months. My grandmother had used Olay products and my mother uses Olay products. You could say I am a third generation user of Olay! I enjoy the refreshing silkiness to my face when using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser is light with just a slight exfoliating touch. I do not feel like this product is ""tearing"" my skin like some other products. Instead, this product is a gentle cleanser that removes the oil and does not leave an oily residue. My skin feels smooth and I feel refreshed after cleansing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product on and off with the Pore Scrub Cleanser. This particular one i'm using in the winter time because in my opinion it is slightly 'heavier' than the other one.Brilliant results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This had been my favorite cleanser for years, but I stopped buying it when I found out what the plastic beads used for exfoliating were doing to the environment. Now that the polymers have been replaced by silica and mica, to judge from the ingredient list, I am buying it again and glad to find it works just as well with natural exfoliating agents! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way it not only cleanses my face but leaves it with a smooth feeling. The tube is so easy to throw in my suitcase when I go on vacation. I would never leave home without it. No one believes me when I tell them I'm 75 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cleanser works really well for me, along with the rest of the Regenerist line of products. I have 41 year old acne prone skin, with a tendency toward dryness. The cleanser makes my skin feel clean and smooth, but not overly dry and tight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was starting to get fine lines around my mouth and cheeks, so I needed some help to fight off the inevitable. I was so pleased when I discovered Olay's Regenerating Cream Cleanser. Not only does my oily skin feel clean (and not greasy!), but the fine lines have definitely decreased! I've been using this for about 4 months and I will absolutely continue. I also use the Regenerist Regenerating Serum, and this combo really works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for quite some time and found that it keeps up to it's promise of detoxifying and speeding up cell's natural regeneration process. I love the feel of the tiny bead-like texture as it cleanses and exfoliates my skin. The only drawback is that I need to put a lot to be able to attain that cleansing feeling effect.

There are plenty of exfoliating particles performing their magic compared to the very few particles contained in other exfoliating cleansers.

I have found my go to line of products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I simply love Olay Regenerating Cleanser. I have always used Olay products since I was 16 now I'm 55. I used to use the Olay Foaming cleanser but needed something anti-aging so I bought this & I'm so glad I did. It turned the clock back on my skin at least 5 years the first time I used it. I also use the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum & Total Effects CC Cream. I love the way I look now compared to the way it did before I used Regenerist & Total Effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is not harsh and can be used daily. I have very sensitive skin but have not had any bad reactions to this product. It exfoliates my face but does not dry it out at all. This is the first cleanser I have used that doesn't leave my skin dry and red after drying. It has improved the texture and complexion of my face and neck.

I have never looked forward to washing my face before bed. This cleanser is easy to use and makes my face clean and smooth prior to applying the micro-sculpting cream. It is worth taking the extra time to wash and moisturize. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the fresh feeling after washing my face and neck with this product. I feel like it really cleans my skin and pores better than any other product I've used... no greasy feeling, no soapy residue. Nice clean smell... Not perfumey or floral. And the bonus is getting the feel of a gentle face massage every day. I might be the grandma to 9 cuties but my skin will never give that away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using this product for a number of years, and I love the results. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy, but leaves my skin so soft and fresh feeling. I actually had a co-worker tell me, while comparing a picture from almost 20 years ago and the present, that my skin tone was ""magnificent"" and I looked as young now as I did then. Now if that isn't a marvelous recommendation to use a product, I don't know what is! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Regenerist regenerating cream cleanser since it first came out and I can honestly say I can't live without it.

"Considering the history of my face (horrible acne that left scars when I was a teen), it's a miracle that my face is as beautiful as it is! I've received MANY compliments over the last several years. If they don't ask (and they usually do!!) I always tell them ""Nothing but Olay for me!"" I've actually tried the more expensive department store products. They can't compete with my Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Cream Cleanser is perfect for my 64 year old face :) The micro-beads help exfoliate and keep pores clear while the creamy base is very gentle, never leaves my skin feeling tight or sensitive. This is my all-time favorite cleanser and I hope it will always be offered by Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay Regenerist regenerating ream cleanser each morning for about one year now. It always leaves my skin fresh and ready for Olay moisturizer with sunscreen when my face dries.
