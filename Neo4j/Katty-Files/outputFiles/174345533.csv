"I have been using Silkccoat for about 2 years. Having allergies to so many skin products, I was very happy to find this light non-greasy formula caused no breakouts or itching. It stops my winter flaking and is mild enough to use sparingly on my eyelids, though I'm not sure that is recommended. If you have extremely dry skin, you may want to use a heavier night cream and use this as your daily moisturizer."
