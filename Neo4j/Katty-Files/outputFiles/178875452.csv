"Been using this for about 12 years now. It's so soothing and moisturizing on my super sensitive, very dry mature skin. I use on my face and neck. It is a very stripped down (no perfumes etc) but creamy moisturizer without being greasy."
"I have extremely dry skin and most creams feel sticky and horrible or do not work. Jason's feels a bit sticky going on but rapidly begins to feel silky smooth and my skin feels better than it has in years. I like the smell too, which is often a problem for me. I feel like I finally found the cream for me."
"I have used Aloe Vera Moisturizing Cream and Age Renewal Vitamin E 25,000 I.U for years and believe it has made a huge difference in the appearance of having younger looking skin. I am told constantly that I have beautiful skin and that I do not look my age of 63. I have recommended these products to all my friends and family, and have given these products as gifts. A very Happy Swanson customer! Jackie/Phoenix, AZ."
I don't like facial moisturizers that feel greasy or that clog my pores. This one is gentle and very sheer. I wear it under my makeup.
This cream is so smooth. It goes on very smoothly and is not tacky at all. And it has a great soft smell as well. I will buy again soon.
This is a great all-purpose cream. It works well under make-up and under sunscreen. I sometimes layer it with another lotion if my face is dry. It's very versatile and creamy and non-irritating. The scent is very mild and the jar lasts quite a while.
"Five stars because it's a a very effective moisturizer that's also long lasting. One big negative is the strong fragrance. Fortunately, it dissipates after about half an hour. This would be perfect without the overwhelming fragrance. It moisturizes incredibly well and it's excellent value."
"I love JASON products, but for some reason, this creme burns and irritates my skin. Aloe doesn't usually do that to my skin, so I'm not sure what is going on."
I hate the smell smells really really weird the soap as well the Teatree one is way better
"This daily cream smells wonderful, goes on smoothly, and moisturises beautifully. As a daily workhorse it can't be beat, particularly at this price."
"This product used to be a bit lighter and not as thick a cream which I preferred. However, I still love this face cream..."
This is the best moisturizing creme I have ever used. It goes on non greasy and your skin feels soft all day. I highly recommend this product. Especially effective on sun damaged or aging skin.
"This creme has saved my tail and my tattoos! It works great as a moisturizer not only for fresh ink, but also for dry feet. It smells good and has an almost organic smell, but in a good way. Great product! I could use this every day."
"When I found this product online with Swanson's I knew I had to try it. This is a great product, not only do I use it for dry hands, but as facial moisturizer over night! High Quality and Great Value! Will continue to order."
Have been using this product for many years. My husband and I both use it and like the quality and smoothness of the product. The price is excellent.
"The smell is very subtle and incredible. I don't want to say too much for fear the price will go up, but I loved it. Very soothing."
This is a very good feeling moisturizer. It is not greasy. It really leaves my skin feeling smooth.
