this cream is definitely very hydrating and thick. you just need a pea sized amount to cover the entire face. i personally love using this at night since it's so intensely moisturizing. i have congested skin so i'm happy to know that i'm not breaking out with dry skin since this helps minimize my acne and moisturizes it too!
One my favorite products! I highly recommend this skin brightened!
"I have been using Obagi for yrs, I'm 71 and my skin doesn't look it and I think Obagi is the reason"
"I have been using this product for about 6mths its really great and i has dark skin, and it works for me."
DO NOT BUY THIS CLEAR. Obagi makes an excellent CLEAR RX ONLY with Hydroquinone 4%.
