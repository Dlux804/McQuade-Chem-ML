"I have oily to combination skin but I need to hydrate it well during the harsh winters here in Boston. I have been using this for more than 2weeks and have no complaints about it. I apply on cleansed skin and layer it with a moisturizer/sunscreen. Makeup sits like a dream ! Skin feels fresh and hydrated Everytime. The texture is like a serum.You don't need to reapply. A little goes a long way,so I guess I will be good till summer sets in. Works as it claims!"
I'm 28 years old and a mother of three boys under the age of two I know now is the time to really start focusing on skin care I've been using this product for about a month now and I get told every day that my skin looks so flawless and smooth and not stressed I am a huge fan I've even noticed that my blackheads and pores are starting to get smaller [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product, I use it in the morning and at night. I have been using an acne product that works great but makes my skin a little dry so this definitely helps and gives it a very hydrated feeling! Will Most definitely be ordering more and for the price it's definitely worth it! :)"
"I'm so glad I purchased this product. I have oily skin and I was really afraid this would make my skin really dry and yucky, but rest assured my skin has never felt so wonderful. It feels super hydrated and silky almost, I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have more oily skin and most moisturizers make me feel more oily, but this product actually makes my skin feel properly hydrated. Plus it has a really pleasant slightly floral smell. I love putting it on before going to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product. Once I put it on my face, it literally felt like silk. Being a gel, it didn't feel greasy or leave your face feeling sticky. My face never felt more moisturized. Hydra Genius is like a nice big glass of water your face desperately needs to quench its thirst. I'm definitely purchasing this & recommending. Fantastic product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Light weight moisture quickly absorbs. Doesnt pill after make up. I am obsesed with the scent of this! So refreshing and light. Please make this scent into a longer lasting body lotion or spray because I would repurchase for life!
"I bout this product a few months ago and really like using it! It leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated. My only complaint is that it doesn't provide as much of a matte finish as I'd like. But overall, it's a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about a week now. I love the lightweight feel of this product. My skin is usually very oily and this product has made it look very nice and as matte as my skin will get. However, although it does have a ""clean"" scent, it is way too strong of a scent for me and I was not expecting that from this product. The smell of it makes me feel a little light headed and the scent doesn't go away even after it dries."
"I've been using this for about 2 months now... I wanted to give it a fair shot. I like that it feels lightweight on my skin and the fragrance, while unnecessary is pleasant. Too bad it doesnt live up to the mattifying claims. I used this moisturizer today in combination with your Infallible Pro Matte foundation. I'm 4 hours in to my day and I'm already super shiny. Disappointing."
"I received a sample of this product and I was eager to try it as I'm looking for a new daily face product. The feel of the gel is nice and I think it would work well on my normal skin. On the other hand, the smell is just too much. If this was in a non-fragrance version I would give it another try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of this and I love it I used every morning after I woke up and my face just felt so refreshed all I did was apply this to my face and I was on my way to school. I definitely need to buy a bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this! More than I thought I would. It's really soothing and makes my skin super soft! Improves texture so it works well under makeup with a primer and the effects do last. For 72 hrs? Not sure. But for at least 20-- until I washed my face. I think every women should try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thank you L'OREAL for sending me a sample to test out. A little goes a long way--I was able to make 4 uses of the small packet they sent. Overall, I really like the product; my skin feels soft and hydrated instantly. However, the smell was a bit strong for me, but the smell does fade so that's good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product. Granted I only used sample size in the mail but it mattified my face so I can apply makeup much easier. Also, made my face feel nice and soft., Plan on purchasing it once run out of hydro boost moisturizer from a different company. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with the whole Hydra Genius Line! My skin goes from Dry to Normal to Oily all the time. It just depends and is so crazy. I love all these products I just wish they were a little more affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for 2 weeks now and i initially bought it because i was sent a sample and I remember it made my makeup last all day! I decided to purchase it myself and i am getting more benefits out of it than i expected! I never wear a makeup primer but this makes my makeup last longer because my face does not get oily. And get this, because of the aloe vera gel in it, i noticed that my acne scars are slowly losing their redness! IM AMAZED! I am so glad that i found this product!"
"I got the sample from the offers of July just because it's a free sample, but once i tried it i instantly fell in love my skin loves it. I have combo skin and I'm around 18 years old and I instantly saw and felt a difference, my face was matte and felt hydrated. Too bad I can't buy more because I loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this for a few days on it's own and found that it did not have any matifying property as it said it did. It did absorb fairly well but I think my skin might be too oily for it to be used on it's own. I have to mix with a different moisturizer to really see results but when I do mix it HOLY WOW! What drew me to this was the Hydrolaunic Acid in it, my skin LOVES it. I'll use this bottle up but I can find something better elsewhere"
"I requested a sample of the product. I used it this morning. The product was a gel and cool. It felt smooth and cool on my face and neck. The product was not greasy, it was easy to blend into skin. It was not tightening to the skin, but left my skin feeling hydrated. I cannot wait to purchase the product."
This product is amazing!! I love that it hydrates your skin without leaving your skin feeling greasy afterwards. I recently was outside and used this product not thinking of my face being slightly burnt and it helped cool my face from my sun burn. I love this stuff. I'll be buying it again after I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Honestly, no better then any other moisturizer I've used. For something made to help with oily skin, I found that my skin was either even MORE oily the next day or completely dried out. I never felt like it was doing anything and my skin certainly didn't feel ""hydrated"" at any point. Not worth it in my opinion. I'd just rather stick to regular lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i bought this about a month ago and it's almost half way gone!! i really recommend this product! before i used it i used the clean and clear dual action moisturizer and i never feel like it did anything and it seemed to brake me out. before i bought this product my skin was very dry and had patches of dry spots that was making my foundation look funny because it wouldn't stick, after using this for about 1-2 weeks all my dry spots were gonna and my face is very very smooth! highly recommend!!"
"Having oily/combination skin I would struggle to find something that would work and wouldn't make matters worse. After trying this the first time, I was hooked. The formula quickly absorbed into my skin leaving it smooth and not sticky. My face wouldn't be an oily mess at the end of the day. I'm definitely going to continue to get this from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly think I found my new favorite moisturizer. The bottle and feel of the product itself seems more expensive than it is. It looks beautiful. The product itself is super light feeling and goes into my skin really well. It doesn't make my skin feel tight, or dry due to it being mattifying. It feels comfortable all day long. My makeup (powder foundstion) looks good over it. I really enjoy thins product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product. It really kept my face feeling hydrated and I didn't feel like I had put anything on my face. It kept my face feeling hydrated my entire shift which is 13-16 hrs at a time. I also break out easily and this did not break my face out at all. The only complaint I have is that it felt sticky when applying it due to the aloe but it did not stay sticky feeling after drying/soaking in. I also let my mother use it and she loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall I am pretty happy with this product. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and plump. After just a couple uses, I noticed it gave my skin a very nice glow and left my face feeling refreshed. If you are looking for a new moisturizer to use this summer, this is the perfect moisturizer for you. Although, this might not be moisturizing enough for the winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product looks like an expensive moisturizer without the overinflated price tag. It's in a smooth blue glass dispenser that's very minimalist. It has a lovely cologne type smell; it made me think of when I get perfume samples in the mail and the smell kind of just blends together. It has a very smooth, not too thick, not too thin feel and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. All in all, I'm very pleased with this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Normal/Oily Skin moisturizer! The smell is awesome! It makes my skin so soft with out making it oily. I love how it is light weight, and you can not even tell it's on. I will most definitely be purchasing it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how the product absorbs so quickly and is very lightweight.I only need 1 pump to cover my entire face. This bottle is going to last forever. Definitely going to last a long time. The only thing I don't like is the fragrance. I wish they would make a flagrance-free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ok i have no word to describe this word ..this is amanzing ...i never ever expect fron this product ..i just randmoly picked up this product.whdn i try ..no oil at all . But m just worried that my skin wont get dry ...? Like i there is oil on my face . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have EXTREMELY oily skin, when I use this product it makes my makeup look fresh with less oil, you can dramatically see the difference. To the woman who complained about the drying of her skin .... you OBVIOUSLY picked the wrong type, I WISH it dried my skin, never the less it has helped tremendously"
"I picked up a bottle while walking through my local Walmart, I had never heard of this moisturizer, figured it was new and decided to try. I was pleasantly surprised first of all by the price. It's lightweight, absorbes fast, and keeps my face moisturized for the entire day without looking or feeling greasy. My skin definitely looks healthier. I will continue to purchase, I love it!!"
"The L'Oréal Hydra Genius left my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Normally after my face wash my skin feels tight and dry but after this that dry feeling in my skin has been no more. My fiancée even asked me one day after washing my face ""Honey, do you have on makeup?"" I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product - I use it every night and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated all night. It's been so great for my dry skin and does a good of a job as more high-end skin creams. Can see a noticeable difference in the skin texture! the scent is also amazing! The only thing to note is that sometimes i can still feel the cream on my face and it takes a little while to soak in, otherwise it's a new favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The fragrance on this Hydra Genius Moisturizer is light. It glides on silky smooth and even though I have oily skin my skin definitely doesn't feel greasy. It has a matte finish to it. My skin has been tingling a bit since I put it on. Not sure if that is the anti aging properties working or what . I would definitely recommend this to a friend that doesn't want a greasy moisturizer but does want but does want one that refreshes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer gave my skin a matte finish. It doesn't feel like a heavy creamy product. It is a light gel consistency. My face would feel hydrated in the morning after I moisturized at night, but did not feel greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a great moisturizer. I used it day and night the first 2 days but then I reduced it to just night time. I reduced it because It was affecting my makeup application leaving my face a bit too dewy. It's a great size, it will last me a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Recently I tried the L'Oréal Hydra Genius product and I fell in love. My skin is always super oily but I hate not moisturizing, so this product was perfect! It gave me moisture without making my skin greasy or shiny and it was easy to apply, I use it every day and my skin looks amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Oily skin is tough in the summer. It is hard to find a product that is moisturizing but is not harsh on the skin under the summer sun. I was pleased that the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care applies in a way that feels very light on my skin. My skin felt moisturized all day long and I never felt any harsh effects from the sun. It's really refreshing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think Hydra Genius is amazing. I use it twice a day after I wash my face, and it's helped my face so much. I've only used this for about a week and I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite beauty items. It feels incredibly light. Not at all heave, which is a huge plus for me. I use it all the time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is so light and has a fresh scent. It applies easily and a little pump goes a long way! It makes my skin feel smooth but not heavy which is exactly what I need when it's already a bit oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using another product for a while and it left my skin oily. It resulted in breakouts. When I received the L'oreal Hyrda Genius product, I was really impressed! It's a beautiful nice sized bottle. There seems to be a slight perfume smell that lingers for awhile. I tried it on my face and it does have a matte feel to it as well. I can see myself using this more and more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and I was very surprised by its performance! I have very oily skin and I have always steered clear of moisturizers because they tend to make my face more oily. This one doesn't. It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated and doesn't make my t zone more oily. I would recommend this to anyone with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After applying the new L'Oreal Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care, I was shocked at how smooth and soft my face felt! The moment I squeezed it into my hands, I noticed it was different than any moisturizer I had ever used before. The way it glides onto my face is unparalleled and I love the light scent it leaves. Just applying it made me feel fresh and clean, and who doesn't like that?! I'll definitely be looking into buying this product more and love the way it makes me feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before trying this product, I had never heard of it but now I think it'll become my go-to face moisturizer. As a woman with very sensitive skin, the ingredients in face lotions are important to me. The aloe and hyaluronic acid are easy on my skin leaving it feeling soft and refreshed. The lotion is light and soaks in quickly so I can get started on my makeup almost immediately after. The smell is great too!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is WONDERFUL! It hydrates my skin for HOURS! I shower at night, and then put this cream on. It smells great, and leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft! Its not oily and it absorbs nicely. No grease!! Love this product! Will buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product, this product is amazing so far. It's refreshing and my face looks and feels really soft and smooth. Before trying this product, I never considered L'Oréal as a skin care brand to pick, but now this moisturiser changed my mind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great Product; a lot goes a long ways!! Makes your face feel smooth and fresh afterwards. Haven't noticed a change in wrinkles or lines, but have noticed a difference in the smoothness. I used it every night after my shower and still have quite a bit left, you only need a small amount. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm really picky when it comes to facial moisturizers, I really hate the greasy feeling so many leave behind. I didn't have that issue at all with this one! It made my skin feel softer and moisturized with no leftover greasiness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really sensitive skin, but also really oily skin, so it can be hard to find a product that's moisturizing but won't leave me with a breakout or rash. This one is really great! Nice, light moisturizing and so far no sign of irritation or breakouts. I'd recommend this as a daily moisturizer to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Hydra Genius Daily Liquid is perfect if you are looking for a moisturizing product that smells great, and absorbs into the skin very quickly. After using it, my skin was incredibly soft. My skin did not get greasy or shiny after using it either. I recommend this product to anyone with normal/oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care! My face is very sensitive and subject to frequent oiliness. I have used this product every day for the past 3 weeks, and it not only feels smooth and clean on my face, but it helps my face stay properly hydrated without feeling oily or greasy. My skin looks smooth and healthy! I will definitely continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only used this product a total of 3 times, even though I've had it for a couple of weeks. I am still using another skin regime but I wanted to see how this would make my skin feel during the day. I have to say, it didn't leave my skin oily at all. That's a huge plus for me because I hate the feeling of anything lingering on my skin. I will definitely continue to use this product. The true test will be how it works for me during the hot, summer months! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combination skin with an oily T-zone and dryness on my cheeks. It is hard to find a good moisturizer that gives me a nice balance of moisture. Most of the time, it is too oily. I would be giving Hydra Genius Normal/oily skin moisturizer more stars because it does seem to quench some of the dryness, but unfortunately, it causes my skin to become oily after a few hours. I want to like this, but long term it doesn't work with my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The lotion feels more like a gel serum, it goes on feeling thick with thorough coverage, and quickly dries feeling light and refreshing. The smell is very subtle and fresh, it's a nice balance and feels good. I have an oily t-zone, so I wasn't sure if this was the right brand/type for my skin, but it seems to be just perfect. I would recommend trying for similar skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Normal/Oily Skin I can say it's the best moisturizer out there. It doesn't leave your face feeling oily or slick. With in a few days you can see results. My soon looked brighter and healthier. It's so simple to use just apply morning and night after you wash your face. Once you try it you will never buy anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just got this product in the mail today. But I can tell already I'm going to love this product and I'll definitely recommend this to friends and family . I applied this product today in the morning before going to work, I just got back home at 6pm and my face feels fresh and clean and not oily . Usually I'll be oily by this time . My skin feels hydrated . I also got asked today what I was wearing under my makeup because my skin had a healthy glow . I'll continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Hydra Genius Daily liquid care for normal to oily skin twice a day as recommended. My skin is falls in the middle of normal but occasionally oily. The first two or three days I found my skin felt amazing. On the fifth day it seems like using twice a day was too much and my face broke out in small white heads. I have since cut back to once a day to help clear up my skin. It's a great product I will continue to use, just once a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this to moisturize my skin and reduce oil. I like how light it was and how quickly it absorbed into my skin. It makes your skin soft without grease. I love how it is in a beautiful glass bottle. Two pumps covered my face and neck. Also this product lasts a long time and worth it. Would recommend this product!
"I'm so glad I was given the opportunity to try out this lotion. At first I was a little nervous, because I have sensitive skin. But everything turned out great! I didn't get any redness or skin irritation from this. My face feels nice and smooth and healthy after using it. Usually I also worry about an oily look, but this was no problem here. Overall, this product works excellently and I will definitely use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love everything about the L'Oréal Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care. The formula isn't too greasy like a lot of the other brands. The scent is amazing and it makes my face feel so good. I use it at night when I get out of the shower and I use in the morning before I put my makeup on in the morning. The packaging is also so cute! Like I said I love everything about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this sporadically, I admit, but I like how it feels! The smell is clean and the lotion soaks in almost immediately and leaves my skin with a matte, fresh feel. My skin doesn't feel oily after using it, which I love. It has also helped improve my skin tone and evened it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't love face lotions because they are thick and make me sweat, so I didn't have high hopes. However, the hydra genius daily liquid care moisturizer is light enough and feels super hydrating. I also love the smell! It reminds me of happy memories from my childhood. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using my Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for Normal to Oily Skin daily now and my skin is feeling nice and smooth. I find the fragrance pleasant and the product works into my skin without leaving it sticky or oily feeling. I did break out a little in places I don't normally on my face, but it has been pretty hot lately in our area. I'm hoping this was a result of the weather. I'll continue using this to hydrate my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using a much more expensive moisturizer for over a year and within a few days of trying this one, I've noticed a difference in the softness of my skin. I love that it's matte and leaves my skin moisturized without feeling oily. It's going to become my new daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. It came in a stylish glass bottle with easy pump dispenser. It is light weight, not greasy, and has a pleasant light scent. I love how it soaks in quickly and mositurizes my skin so well. My skin feels good at the end of the day when I take off makeup thanks to this hydrating product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always had issues with finding a product that worked well with my skin issues.....and this product has blown all the other ones that I have tried in the past out of the water! I have recommended this product to any one that I have talked with and have noticed a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that this moisturizer is good! I got the one for oily skin because I do really have extreme oily skin. The moisturizer is really light weight but really watery I kind of don't like that but overall I think it does moisturize well. It says it leaves skin matte but I see no difference. I would recommend it though since it leaves skin hydrated and soft and it smells amazing not too strong of a smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this product not thinking that it would really work or would be too think but I am happy to say that this has not broken me out and has helped release dry skin from the change in weather. It also is not too heavy and you can use it before applying makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thoroughly enjoyed this L'oréal moisturizer, because it is not oily and makes my face feel refreshed. The scent is very light and not perfume-y. The L'oréal Hydragenius absorbs into my face immediately and does not leave a shiny look, but a sheen of glow. I like it and have purchased another bottle on my own. I would definitely recommend this Hydragenius for anyone looking for a pumping and hydrating moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is great it makes me feel moisturized without being too oily. It has a really nice fragrance as well. The packaging was also very appealing it looks like a fancy product that is really good for my skin. The only downfall about this product is that I break out while using it. I will continue to try to use this product with different cleansers to see if I get better results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The gel consistency and quick absorbing formula is a pleasure to use and the product wears well under makeup and provides instant and visible hydration directly after application. But the fragrance and alcohol is probably doing more bad than good for your skin. I wish L'Oreal considered that when creating this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive only used it for a small amount of time but i love using it so far. It really helps with the oily skin as far as i know and i can't wait to keep using it. Its a great product and i cant wait to continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This hydrating moisturizer is amazing. It goes on cool and wet but it's absorbed very quickly and leaves a smooth velvety feel to your skin. I have combination skin and this has been perfect for both my super dry cheeks and my oily nose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a great moisturizer that can be used before makeup as well as instead of a night cream. What I love about it the most is that it really kept my skin hydrated, I didn't have any dry patches and the makeup sat very well on this. It is not greasy at all and once I put it on, I'm quite matte. However, it doesn't keep my skin completely matte especially in the hot weather. The smell is heavenly even though it's quite strong at first. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product. My oily but sensitive skin has a particularly difficult time in the summer. But this product really helped moisturize and mattify even during hot and humid summer afternoons. Obviously it didn't stop the sweating, but my makeup didn't separate nearly as badly as with a cream based cleanser. My only issue is the size/ weight of the dispenser. it's pretty heavy and was difficult to pack for traveling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm using Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for Normal/Oily Skin, and so far so good! It's like a thick serum, goes on thick, but absorbs quickly. Strong smell, but pleasant. I'll continue tracking and monitoring results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this moisturizer before applying my makeup and it goes on so smoothly! Its texture is fantastic and it glides on your skin. A little bit goes a long way and it feels so refreshing on the face, I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried Hydra Genius now for two weeks and I love it! It feels very refreshing when putting on and it dries/is absorbed in less than a minute! So you can keep with your beauty routine without a hitch or go to bed without worrying about the pillow shams. During the day my skin feels fresh, even with makeup.

One of the restaurant moisturizers I've ever used I have dry skin and it's so lightweight you only need a tiny bit and it goes a long way it's so soft and soothing it feels good on the skin I've even used it on my elbows and a few other places because it is an amazing product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surprised with this product. After I put it on my face, it felt very nice and a little minty which was refreshing. I like how it quickly dissolved into my skin. The only thing I didn't like is the smell but I could live with that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer made my skin feeling hydrated and plump by the end of week two! My skin is normally so so oily but after using this product I feel a difference in the way it feels and I see a difference with the texture. It's a must try!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is quite interesting. It's water based and not very thick. It left my skin feeling moisturized and it didn't bother my skin, since it is very sensitive and prone to break outs. It even works well under my makeup. The smell is nice, but I feel like its a tad too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin absorbed the product very well. I felt it made my skin more hydrated and soft. I really liked the texture of the product. It looks like water that breaks down on the skin. Packaging super easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! It looks refreshing and goes on so smooth! Absorbs quickly too! I love the water like color of the bottle. There is no film left behind. I have not broken out from it and my skin is never too dry or oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Hydra Genius is pretty amazing. I have been using it for only five days and my face is super smooth. I have fairly oily skin and I just had a baby so my skin has been a little wonky lately and I have tried several cleansers and moisturizers but they weren't resolving the oily issue. But this is really making my face feel very fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best hydrating face cream I've ever used. It smells so unbelievably good and goes on leaving my skin so soft. I used it for a week after I got sunburnt on my face. It softened up my skin like no other. I will for sure be buying this product religiously [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far this product is great I've only been using it for two days now. I'm using the formula for normal to oily skin. It goes on silky, a little bit goes a long way and it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Only giving it four stars for now since I do need to give it more time. I have combination skin and so far this product seems to be nice and light, moisturizing, and mattifying where I need it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Usually, i can't wear a moisturizer during the day because i wear makeup and about an hour after i put it on, i have a ""shine"" on my face, that a diamond couldn't compete with. I can't stand it, and I spend the rest of my day randomly sneaking off to blot my super oily skin. But this product is way different! So far, it's made a huge difference. My skin feels like it's got a healthy moisture in it, but doesn't make me look like a greased pig. I hope that it continues to do this amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has left my skin feeling soft but not oily, which is huge for me. It feels light, and I don't feel like I have a greasy lotion on my face. After application I didn't feel like I needed more ten minutes later. Very satisfied with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a free sample and I absolutely love it! It smells wonderful! It controls an balances my oily skin very well! And it moisturizes great too! I definitely recommend this it has worked miracles for my skin! My faces looks an feels fabulous! This Hydra Genius is fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the smell and consistency of this product. For dry skin it would be really helpful, but I have sensitive combination skin and live in Florida. It was better for nighttime use - during the day it made my skin oily. I'll try it again in the winter when I need more moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really enjoyed using this hydration face cream. It is super light and refreshing and doesn't feel like a cream at all. It reminds me of the hydration masks that have to be worn for 15-30 minutes, so it's really nice to be able to apply and not have to use a mask. My face feels smooth and leaves a matte look, which is nice to have for normally oily skin. I would definitely continue to purchase and use Hydra Genius for the refreshing feeling it leaves on my face on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is slightly oily and the humidity in Florida makes it worse. I've used other lotions, like Clinique, but it made me break out. This lotion feels more like a jell and it feels very light on the skin. I actually look forward to putting it on because between the amazing smell(which is hard to explain) and texture, my skin is thankful. It soaks in quickly and has yet to cause a single blemish. I would definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It is a very light feel. I have sensitive skin especially when it comes to face creams. This is wonderful...I never broke out. This is going to be part of my new beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really loved this moisturizer! I've tried many different brands but this one is my favorite! It left my skin feeling soft and there was no oily feeling at all! It also has a beautiful scent that lasts a while. Definitely a big fan of this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Let's start with the bottle. When I got this product in the mail, I was impressed by the weight of the package! I could tell it was not some cheap junk! Got it out of the package, and OMG this bottle is gorgeous. So pretty. I started using the product twice a day when my face was clean. It has a really nice smell and it is pretty light but makes my skin feel hydrated. It's a great daily product when you need to use something quick and efficient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a great moisturizer when it's hot outside. It has a very light texture that feels like thick water and doesn't make you feel like you're clogging up your pores. I also feel like you can use it under foundation without worrying about piling. I also like that you get a good amount of product in the package. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product, it is hydrating and makes my face feel good. It's not too heavy so you don't feel it on your skin. I gave it a 4 instead of 5 because it did make me get a couple bumps..could just be because I have sensitive skin though? They should make one for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Moisturizer seems to work well (lightweight, doesn't seem to irritate my sensitive skin), but I'm not loving the excessive amounts of alcohol in the product. Also, the scent is fairly strong; I tend to prefer unscented products for my sensitive face. Lastly, I look for cruelty-free products, and I'm seeing conflicting information as to whether or not L'Oréal is a cruelty-free brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, I love the packaging. The product is very lightweight and moisturizing. The only negative comment I have is I did not care for the smell of it. It's not terrible, it could just be better. Ultimately, I would buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I was thinking that it would feel almost like putting lotion on my skin with a residual over feel. Too my surprise it was not only refreshing, but felt just like putting lotion on your face with no residue afterwards! I love using it and will be purchasing it in the future when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This left my face feeling refreshed and hydrated. It was not heavy or sticky. After a few hours my face wasn't greasy. One pump dispensed the perfect amount for me. I also love that it contains aloe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using my Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for about a week now, in the mornings it leaves my skin moisturized under my makeup. At nights I wash my face from the all day impurities and use my Liquid Care. I feel refreshed and clean. The Hydra Genius is very light, so you don't feel it heavy in your skin. It's cool to the touch of the skin, leaving you feeling smooth and cool. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is definitely worth trying. It did in fact leave a mattifying effect but it did not last long. My dry spots did not feel as moisturizers as with other products but it was a good idea and worked pretty well for my normal/oily spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm usually not a fan of moisturizers. I have oily skin and a lot of times they just feel heavy and greasy, but the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care is nothing like what I expected. It feels so light weight and smooth on my skin. I've noticed a difference in my skin especially around my eyes and where my laugh lines are. It seems like the skin is fuller and smoother. I'll be buying this once I use my bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Hydra genius daily liquid care for oily skin. I have used it for about 48 hours now and I see improvement in my skin. It smells amazing. Love how my skin feels after putting it on. I recommend this to buy and have told my friends about this product. A plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this stuff is GREAT!!!!! I have used this product for a few days and I can truly see a big difference in my face, Seems like it is a lot smoother than it has been and a lot less oily than it was prior to trying to the product. I wasn't sure about the product at first because the commercial made it seem like it was too good to be true but in this case, it was a very true commercial and feeling and seeing is believing. This product will remain in my skin regimen as long as it is made. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oréal Paris hydra genius for normal/oily moisturizer was absolutely amazing. Have to admit wasn't expecting a scent to it but I don't mind it. Now the moisturizer had an almost like water kind of feel and I really liked that about it, it absorbed quickly into my skin without a sticky feel to it. It leaves skin refreshed, moisturized and with such a healthy glow! Really recommend ! I love it ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There are a lot of fragrances and irritants in this lotion, so I was too scared to use it on my face--I ended up using this as a fancy foot moisturizer instead. The packaging is very luxurious, and the lotion feels very watery and silky, which is nice, but it's just such a shame that my breakout-prone face can't use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff is amazing! Normally moisturizers make my skin extra oily but this one doesn't. A little bit goes a long way too. I have such dry skin in between my eyebrows that flakes really bad. That has completely gone away since using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is fantastic and I am so happy I had the chance to try it! It blends in smooth and easily and leaves my face feeling so fresh and soft. Even if I miss an application and only use it once in a day, my face is still feeling awesome until the next use! I was also surprised at what a large container it came in. It should last quite a while before I need to re-buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product for a month now and I have been using it daily. I have seen a dramatic change in my skin. I have a little bit of combination skin and in my dry spots, it has gotten so moisturized and it looks so hydrated and bright. As for my oil areas, I used to blot my face every few hours at work but now, I can go a full day without blotting my face. This product truly hydrates your face without making it oily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Hydra Genius is phenomenal! It's really lightweight, and it goes on a lot like a makeup primer. The scent is delicious, sort of perfume-like, in a good way. It spreads nicely and isn't greasy, and it moisturizes thoroughly and doesn't feel heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer works wonders! My skin felt amazing after the first use and keeps getting better and better every time I use it. The product is true to its word and dries with a matte finish making my face look and feel amazing. The box is attractive and has all the information you need to see if it's a good fit for you. I love how subtle the scent is and that it isn't greasy when applying to your skin. Also I enjoy how a little bit of product goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm absolutely in love! I have never used a moisturizer that was so gentle on the skin. I loved that it was matte and kept my skin plump all day. It was a quite surprising welcome from all the creams I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love it, no other product works better than this. I have such oily skin and after I clean my face and use Loreal Hydra Genius it doesn't leave my face oily or greasy or sticky like other products do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed trying this product! It is extremely moisturizing without making your skin feel heavy or clogging your pores. I was even able to talk my husband into trying it. He now keeps the bottle beside the bed as part of a new night time skin routine :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very oily skin so I'm always concerned about trying different moisturizers. I decided to try this after seeing it's a gel formula made specifically for oily skin. It comes in a nice glass bottle and you only need two pumps to sufficiently cover your entire face. The gel feels cool to the skin and blends easily. It makes my skin feel matte and controls oil really well. I really like it and will definitely repurchase. The smell is a bit strong at first but it doesn't linger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The next morning after I wash my face, especially after exfoliating, My face is usually really oily throughout the day. But after using this product I have noticed that my oil level is not nearly as bad as when I was not using this product. I have been using this product for 2-3 weeks now. This has really helped me to control my oil a lot better and I will continue to use the product and see if I get better results over an extended period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product!! My face is extremely sensitive and I break out very easily, but I don't break out at all with this and my face is left feeling moisturized and very soft! I also love the smell it's a light clean scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is super oily and in the hot Colorado sun my skin is even more shiny than it usually is. This product absorbed into my skin very nicely and didn't leave any weird residue. I would highly recommend it to anyone with normal to oily skin. Plus the product comes in a large size and is very affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The last few months I have had excessively oily skin no matter what I tried. I have used the Hydra Genuis for normal/oily skin once and I can already tell a difference!! My face doesn't feel near as heavy or gross as it usually does - even after spending hours in the Vegas heat this morning! The size of the bottle is great too! I can't wait to keep trying it to see if I can get even more improvement! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product smells really good! It feels so amazing after you clean your face and put this on! I can feel it moisturizing my skin as it sits in! It's not oily at all! I would definitely start buying this as for my normal skin care regiment!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that Hydra genius normal to oily skin is a good product. It has kept my face from being oily without over drying my skin out. It has also not broken my face out which is something I do worry about as I have breakout prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The hydra genius smells amazing. It feels nice and light on my skin. My skin felt very soft immediately after applying. This works perfectly under makeup as well which I love about it. My skin looked matte even in the humidity. I recommend his for anyone with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product comes in a chic bottle, has a pleasantly light floral scent, and (most importantly) leaves skin feeling refreshed all day long! I didn't have the highest hopes for this product, but it absolutely proved me wrong. It leaves my face looking matte all day long, no matter the temperature. I haven't even had to use a primer or setting spray! This is such a great moisturizer!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer felt like I gave my face a glass of water. The product comes out kind of like a gel feeling. It is matte and left no oil on my face, which is what I was hoping for. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin and left it feeling very, very soft. The smell also is great to me. The bottle is a sturdy glass and even though it's simple, it's so pretty!

I am in love with this product. I love how it goes on smooth and isn't oily or sticky. It made my face look healthy and smooth. My skin soaked it in quickly. I also love the stylish bottle.

I used the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Normal/oily skin today for the first time. I was rather impressed. First off the smell is very pleasant and appealing. It is very lightweight when applied. My skin feels smooth and fresh. I used it once so far but I like it and I will continue using it twice daily as recommended. Thank you for coming up with such a nice new product. I can't wait to see the results!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is great! My face gets very oily almost immediately after washing and this is the first moisturizer I've ever used on my face that doesn't make that worse. This stuff smells so good and just glides on my skin. It took away the oily look immediately. I was also impressed with the size of the bottle, I'll be able to use this moisturizer for a very long time. I am very impressed and so exited to keep using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I just received this product and I was pleasantly surprised. The bottle is gorgeous, a glass blue ombre color. It has a pump that doesnt dispurse too much product, its just the right amount. Id have to say my favorite thing about the product is the smell. Its a very refreshing, beach like scent that i love. It moisturizes really well and leaves a matte like feel to your face. Also acts as a nice primer too. I really love this product and I am so happy I got it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been really loving the hydra genius. It is so lightweight, soaks in quickly and works well under my makeup. I also put it on before I put on my moisturizer before bed. I find that it gets rid of the dry spots on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"My skin has seriously never looked more radiant since I have been using this product. I have always been a really big fan of products by Loreal, but this one is out of this world. My skin looks so fresh and glowing, I am definitely going to be a big user of this product for life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unique formula! Most mosturizers come in a cream formula; whereas this product was a gel. I felt like this product took awhile to soak into my skin, leaving a tacky feeling for several minutes. I did not notice that my face seemed extra oily or shiny when using this product, which typically happens when I use moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Everyone says even those of use ""oily"" girls need to moisturize, even though our skin doesn't feel dry. I have never been one to use a moisturizer, as I'm an ""oily"" girl. I began using this product to see if I would notice a difference in my skin and within a couple uses my skin looked fresher and more vibrant. In addition, it was not oily as I have felt like with other moisturizing products. It actually helps to provide a more matte finish to my skin. Highly recommend this product.

"I've been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and it has seriously become my favorite of all time! It is so lightweight so you don't get that greasy feel and moisturizes so well.

I am hooked on hydra genius daily liquid care. It is so light. I have used it now for a week and it leaves my skin refreshed and hydrated without feeling oily or with a residue. It took about 5 minutes to completely soak in. I have been using it after washing my face. It was exactly what my face was missing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"it is a great product, feels very refreshing when i put it on. in terms of skin difference? I havent noticed a lot yet, I have been only testing it for a week now. I do like using it after i clean my face though, its a thin consistency so it glides on almost like water on the face. The size of the product is great, i was actually very surprised, the bottle is very great in size. All in all,I would definitely recommend, not sure exactly the kind of results i was expecting but yeah, thats my experience! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I really like this product. It is very lightweight yet hydrating. I also like how it dries matte. The only thing I don't like about the product is the smell. It doesn't smell bad, I just prefer fragrance free products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Okay, so I tried this product as soon as I got it and no lie, this stuff works so amazing. I have really oily skin and this product works for my type of skin and dries matte. My skin doesn't get oily throughout the day either. I was that person that tried everything to moisturize my skin and all they've done was made my face even oilier. This product is soooo good, I recommend this to anyone who has oily skin. You're welcome in advance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product twice a day once in the morning once at night. My oil has been controlled throughout the day. I never have to reapply the product. My skin feels moisturized throughout the whole entire day. My face feels softer too! No other product has lived up to its name like this one! The product is heavy the bottle is made out of glass personally I prefer this feature of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really in need of a good moisturizer, the New England winter has taken a toll on my skin. This product first of all, smells so good! I absolutely love the smell, it's light and not too strong of a smell which is important to me. The product itself is very light and glides on smoothly. It instantly made my skin feel great. I've been using it in the morning and before bed. I can tell it makes my skin brighter during the day too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this last week and I'm so glad I did. I use it every morning and night after washing my face. Immediately after applying, I noticed a huge difference. My face was way smoother and less oily. I can tell it absorbed excess sebum. Provides all day moisture. Very luxe packaging. Glass bottle with pump and cap."
"I was very exciting to try this product because it has water as an ingrediente and just like I thought it's amazing, it keeps my face so moisturizer and fresh, plus it gets well with my oily skin. I put the cream before my make up and looks beautiful, I recommend this product so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this moisturizer! You only have to use a small amount and it feels like you are splashing water on your face. It is so refreshing and makes my skin feel baby soft. Works very well for my oily skin. Even the smell of this product is amazing. Definitely recommending to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product! I have very sensitive skin and I assumed it would irritate my face or make me break out in hives. It did neither. It has a very clean smell and my face feels smooth. Works great for dry skin especially in the cold winter weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this a few months ago. I keep giving it a chance hoping its not the culprit to me breaking out, unfortunately it is though. I love the idea of the product. It goes on great, not greasy, no residue, love the smell. But everytime i use it for a few days i start to get clogged pores on my chin and i breakout. I really like the product but sadly cant use any more of it."
"I purchased this to replace another lightweight hyalaurnic gel moisturizer - it works great! Although I'm old (60), I still have slightly oily skin and this is the perfect lightweight product. I live in a very dry climate - Las Vegas - but this is just enough for my aging skin. It even minimizes the lines between my brows. Great purchase and value."
"The formula has changed recently. I started using this product a couple of years ago, and it was great for my sensitive oily acne prone skin. Now, it's breaking me out. I tested it by stopping use and then starting again. Each time it broke me out. I wish they had left well enough alone, because I used to really like this product. It was great worn alone or under primer and makeup."
"Very light weight. Not greasy nor does it leave a residue. I have acne prone skin and use a retanoid sometimes and this helps with the excess drying. Perfect for summer and winter weather. I greatly recommend this because of the weightlessness and also for its fast absorption into the skin. A little goes a long way, so it is worth the money.

"I've been using this for a week and love it. Wonderful scent, great feel on skin. I follow up with a second moisturizer at night and a primer in morning before makeup."

I had bought this 2weeks ago. I love the fact it was a gel. But sadly the smell was way to strong and made me sneeze. A lot. I wish they had made a scent free or a lighter scent. But it did make my skin soft and it did dry fast. That's a plus!!!!

I really liked this product. It felt extremely soft on the skin and soaked well into it. It kept my skin feeling moisturized all day long. It also felt really nice under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It great! Nice and smooth! I really liked it and enjoyed it. I only use it once a week since I don't need that much moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This works really best for me ,not only it absorbs oil better ,at the same time hydrates my skin. Since I have a combination skin and in summers it is mostly oily, so far I am liking Hydra Genius. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great, lightweight moisturizing product. I've been using it for a few days and it hydrates well and hasn't caused any breakouts. Thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love love love the feel of this moisturizer! It keeps my skin hydrated most of the day and I don't have to reapply. My only issue is the scent. I wish it smelled a little better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is a step above the rest! My face feels so refreshed. I love the matte effect no oily skin from sun up to sundown. I've even used it as a primer for my makeup and it works wonders! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Easy to apply. Instantly reduced the shine from excess oils on ky skin. Felt like i was locking in moisture for my face. I love this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample of this in the mail and went and bought it the day I tried it. This is my new go to moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The smell was lovely! I'm usually very picky on what goes on my face but I went ahead and tried this out anyways. It's quite wonderful! I wish it would last longer though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked that this moisturizer felt light and fresh on my face. I have not had any issues so far and it has not made my makeup wear any differently so that is great. I also liked the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a sample of this in a magazine, and I loved it. I have a mild amount of acne probably because of excess oil on my skin and this thing helps with oil and with calming down my acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This hydra genius daily careis amazing produc for me it hepl me a lot It works great i fells my skin more hidrated and fresh since firts use .honestly my favorite now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is really great! I love how it makes my skin feel really smooth. I have this one as well as the one for normal to dry skin. For some reason, this one is more clear."
"I started using this product a while ago without knowing it was for normal/ oily and I have combination . I love it . It's one of the best liquid care I have tried in a long time . It's not caky, sticky . It disappears leaving the skin glowing ."
It feels great on your skin. It stops my skin from looking oily by the end of the day. It contains the same active ingredient as the Neutrogena for half the cost. It is also very lightly scented which I appreciate.
"I've been using this for a few weeks now and not only does it moisturize my face without making me oily, but it's made my pores appear smaller as well. My skin texture overall has really improved and still no signs of any breakouts. My oil production is noticeably less as well. Also I'm pretty happy about the small amount of product you need to do the job. The smell was a little strong for me at first but I'm used to it now. And it sinks in snd drys so fast the smell is gone quickly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is a must if you have oily skin. It's very lightweight and absorbs into my skin very quickly. Almost instantly after I use it, I can apply makeup. It almost acts as a primer because of the matte effect on the skin. My face didn't seem as oily throughout the day as it normally does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best product I have ever tried. I have dry/oily skin and this product keeps my face hydrated all day. It keeps my face from being oily but doesn't dry my skin out . It has a wonderful smell. My husband thought I was wearing a perfume. I use this as my primer before I put on my makeup. A little goes a long way. I have been using this for 2 weeks and I haven't even put a dent in the bottle. After I finish with this bottle I am defiantly going to buy another bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care is a great product for anyone no matter the age. I personally am in my 30s and tried the product for normal/oily skin. I am absolutely pleased with the way my skin feels... refreshed. This is light weight and super hydrating, and the packaging is an added bonus. I never felt like my pores were being clogged or my skin was drying out. Totally recommend to anyone out there! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this every morning and night and before I put on makeup and not only does it keep my makeup in place longer, it leaves my skin feeling amazing, refreshed, and even my acne has gotten better!! It smells like heaven too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had been looking for a new moisturizer that works well and doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or oily. I was amazingly surprised how great this serum really is. I use it twice a day and absolutely love it. It drys super fast and my skin feels soft and smooth. I have been using it on my neck as well and same soft and smooth feeling. All you need is 1-2 pumps in the morning and evening. I can't wait to continue to see the results in about 30 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always used an oil based moisturizer prior to trialing the hydra genius liquid care. I will now be only using this product. It is light, has a refreshing scent and leaves my skin with a matte finish unlike my oil based moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for several weeks and am quite pleased with the results. My skin is smoother and less oily throughout the day. The smell is mild and pleasant not overwhelming at all. The product dries quickly once applied and doesn't leave any sticky residue, this is a big plus for me. I definitely will use this product long term and recommend it to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, its summer time, and part of the hardest dilemma is staying moisturized without clogging your pores and looking oily. Hydra Genius is a great product! It says that it goes on matte - and it actually does! I have used it twice per day, day/night after washing my face - and it works! The formula is extremely light- and goes well under makeup. Would definitely like to try other products in the line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really sensitive skin and I didn't have any issues with this product. I also found that it really made my skin less oily looking in the afternoon. This was a major bonus for me because I was using an oil blotting sheet each day to keep my skin looking normal. With this, I don't have to. So that's great! And I didn't break out or experience any sensitivity. Great product that I will continue to use and hope to see real benefits from! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little leery about this product because I have super oily skin and I was afraid it would leave my skin shinny and even more oily. But, after the first try, I was in love! It leaves my face feeling refreshed and it isn't heavy like other products. I will definitely purchase this product again, well worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer! First off the bottle it comes in looks super fancy and high end. The pump mechanism works really smoothly and dispenses just the right amount of moisturizer. It goes on really smoothly and absorbs right away. It feels nice and light- not greasy and heavy like some moisturizers. I have pretty oily skin and it does not exacerbate that at all. I also love the way it smells- I think it smells like perfume which is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this product a few months ago and have been using it every day since then. I have seen no difference in my skin since using it. I think it hydrates a little bit so I would say it is an average product. For me there is nothing special about this product. I would not buy it again because any other product can produce the same if not better results than this product.
"Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care has a nice scent (but not too strong, for us with allergies) and made my skin feel so smooth and soft to the touch. It isn't sudsy like normal facial cleansers. The aloe provides that silkiness that I love. I absolutely love it and will use it everyday now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product! It keeps my skin hydrated but not oily. I have part dry/part oily skin. The dry part stays moisturized and the oily part actually is less oily. My skin looks less red and blotchy and more neutral overall coloring now. The smell isn't horrible, but it isn't the best in my opinion. And it doesn't have SPF like my old lotion, so it isn't preferable. I took 2 stars off for the two negative mentions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried the hydra genius for oily skin and was underwhelmed with this product. The product claims to reduce shine and with a matte finish make skin appear to be less oily. I did not see these results with the product. My skin is not dry so I can not speak to the moisturizing benefits. The product smells like chemicals which is not really pleasant. My results did not match the claims from the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. The smell is amazing and the liquid is not sticky when you apply it. It's very light weight. It goes on smooth and my skin feels really smooth, I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and I didn't have any problems with this product. My acne scars aren't as noticeable anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The name of this product was enough for me to want to try it! I was pleasantly surprised when I first put it on my face. It was like no other moisturizer I had before. It definitely went on with a wet feeling, but once my skin soaked it all in, I was left with the smooth feeling I love for my face! It also seemed to control my oily face, which is a major plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Hydra Genius Daily liquid care for about a week now and have had no adverse reactions to it, nor is it greasy like some moisturizers tend to be. In fact within minutes of applying my face feels hydrated but dry to the touch. I'm really enjoying this product so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! It has its pros and cons, but overall, it is AWESOME!!!! It left my skin feeling so smooth and moisturized. I used it after I had a bad break out and the next day, my skin was smooth and clear and felt sooooo great!!!! I highly recommend this product. It revived my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Is fantastic! It is the best moisturizer I have tried. It makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. It is not sticky or oily feeling, and doesn't leave a residue on my skin at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm just using this at night but have seen a difference in my skin. When you first put it on it does seem sticky but once it dries it feel smooth. I have oily skin and it seems to keep my skin matte during the day . So far I am liking this product :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this Hydra Genius Daily Liquid care! I look forward to putting it on every night and morning after I wash my face. It is a clear serum that goes on smooth without any stickiness (which is great because I hate when my face feels weighted down!) and it smells amazing: like a high-end perfume or cologne. I feel so fresh and rejuvenated after I use it. I feel like I'm making a difference for my skin. Healthy skin is happy skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a big fan of this product! Pros: it's lightweight, not sticky, smells really nice, and soaks into my skin quickly. I'm sometimes bad at keeping up with a good skincare routine but since receiving this product I've been keeping up and it really adds a nice last step of moisture to my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in day 14 of testing out this product. So far I'm pleased. I use as directed. Once in the morning after washing my face and repeating this process in the evening. I like how lightness of the liquid. One pump is all I need to cover my face. I noticed the difference in my completion. The only thing I would change is the smell. It smells like aqua. It isn't a terrible smell, but not my taste. Overall I'm happy with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the light scent. The bottle looks high end . I just relocated to Florida which leaves my skin overly oil so the matte finish to this is perfect before I apply makeup or if you feel a breakout coming but still need your moisture. I'm really enjoying this product ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Honestly, one of the best moisturizers I've ever used. Great smell, leaves my skin feeling light and fresh. No heavy feeling like I've had with moisturizers before. I use it twice a day, morning and night, and I can really tell a difference in my face and neck. Bit only does it work great, but you get so much in a bottle. I only use a small amount at a time, so I predict it will last for a long time! Very happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this stuff. It is really moisturizing, but does not make more oily skin any greasier. It penetrates as soon as you put it on very quickly and does not get greasier as the day goes by. My skin felt supple and hydrated after one night of use. I highly recommend for anyone who wants a daily moisturizer, but may worry about a heavy cream or something that makes their skin greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Hydra Genius is light, cool and doesn't feel sticky when applied to the skin. True to its name, it feels like water going on and makes my skin feel soft, smooth and hydrated. My only concern is that it is intended for day and night use but doesn't contain SPF, which is what I usually look for in a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Immediately after using this product, my skin was very noticeably soft and smooth. Absorbed within seconds to minutes. I can tell it absorbs excess sebum. Not greasy at all. Very cooling and refreshing as well. Luxe packaging with a nice glass bottle and pump. Not watery, more like a gel moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the Hydra Genius for oily skin and it has worked wonders. This product is AMAZING! So gentle on my sensitive skin, it leaves my face and hands feeling sooooo soft! And it smells amazing to boot - I can't stop smelling my hands after applying. I can honestly say that the L'Oréal Hydra Genius and my daily astringent has gotten rid of my adult acne. I can't recommend this enough! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very oily skin, mostly in my T zone so I am always skeptical about using new moisturing creams on my face. I was so thoroughly impressed that by the end of the day my skin didn't look oily at all!!! Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Hydra Genius did exactly what it was suppose to do. I used it for over a week and my skin is much smoother and healthier. This product has a great smell and has a silk based texture that's very thin. I would recommend this product for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoy using Hydra Genius Liquid Care on a daily basis. All you need is a pump or two to cover your face and neck completely. Instructions say to use it twice a day, but since I have extremely oily skin, I've only been using it at night. After application, my skin feels soft and moisturized and that feeling lasts all day. As a bonus, the serum smells really good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Before I get this product I want to know if will make my face look oily or wet. I think this creme it's perfect because don't make your face oily. I love it because your face it's hydrating and don't look oily. These product can be used in the day and nigth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first received this product, my intital reaction was ""this won't work just like the rest of them"". But me to me tell you that I was surely mistaken! I have been using the product steadily for over two weeks now and I am noticing a drastic improvement with my skin. My skin tone is brighter and more even, hydrated, and just had this radiance like never before. This really is one of the very few products that I will recommend to everyone I know!

"WOW! I am so impressed with the quality of my L'Oréal Hydra Genius Daily skincare, my face ALWAYS dries out a few hours after I wash it no matter what cleanser or moisturizer I use the is always an issue with dry skin or overly greasy creams leaving my skin heavy... this product did neither of these, it left my face soft and moisturized without being weighed down and oily... so happy I've found my forever moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For starters, I have bad oily skin so it's hard to find a product that'll moisturize my face just the right amount especially when it gets dry. It's either too dry or too oily. No in between! But after just 3 uses of the hydra genius daily liquid care I outta say I'm quite impress! My skin feels smooth without the excessive oily feeling, it feels amazingly refreshing and I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ultra lightweight silky smoothness that just glides over the face perfectly! It doesn't even feel like you have anything on. The best is one pump and it covers your entire face so the bottle will last! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this. I have never found anything to take away the extra oil I have on my face. After using this a a couple times my make up looks better for longer than ever. I don't have that shiny look to my face. It leaves your face feeling hydrated and fresh without a slick feel like other moisturizers ive tried. I definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is so oily and greasy but after using L'OREAL HYDRA GENIUS my skin looks and feels so smooth, hydrated and so light weight and best of all my skin has this matte look to it, good bye shiny face am not going to miss you. The only bad thing is that it doesnt contain any spf but other than that i love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very oily skin, and my skin gets very tight after washing it. As soon as I pumped out the gel I knew it was going to be amazing. The smell is wonderful, and how it glides on like silk is perfect. It instantly takes away the tightness, and doesn't leave an oily residue like most moisturizers. My skin is smooth, and matte! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer! I have true combo skin and my skin leans more towards the oily side, but will dry out very quickly if a product is TOO matte or ""oil control"". This moisturizer was a perfect balance and didn't mattify my skin too much. This product is so lightweight, it honestly doesn't feel or look like a lotion. It has a very clean smell, which I like, but if you're sensitive to smells, I would be cautious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Oh my goodness I just got the hydra genius in the mail as soon as I seen it I decided to use it and omg my skin is so soft and hydrated I just absolutely love it now I know what face wash brand to get next time I tend to buy one [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've used this product this morning after cleansing. I really like the smell and thickness. It's almost like a serum. I think it's best feature is the fact that it has a matte finish. Great to rid shine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Generaly with oily skin moisturizing after cleansing is just something that alot of us avoid, but with this moisturizer its all good! It moisturizes and mattifies so my skin looks lovely and youthful, without the shine amd best of all,it lasts all day most of the time. I could not be more pleased with this product!"
"I love the feeling of this lightweight cream. Unlike other creams that are so heavy and oily, once thia cream dries, you can barely tell you have anything on your face! It brings a glow to your face and you don't need tof use much of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal hydra genius is fantastic! I usually have dry patches of skin on my face, but after just a week they were gone. I did notice that my T zone was a little more shiny looking than normal, but it is worth it to not have the dry skin anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think all in all it's a great product! I've had some recent break outs so it's a little hard to tell if it's from the product or just my bad diet over the holidays. But, I do love how weightless it is and still keeps me hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was great at moisturizing and kept my skin matte post-application. My skin absorbed it quickly so it didn't feel like I had a heavy moisturizer sitting on top of my skin. The product packaging was aesthetically pleasing, however, my only complaint is that it's difficult to control how much product is being pumped out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really have enjoyed this product, it provides long lasting moisture without making my oily skin more oiler! I love the gel like texture and the hydrating ingredients this moisturizer provides! I will probably be purchasing other products from this line and this may possibly be replacing my high end products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using thus product about 2 weeks ago and I must say I'm really impressed with the results so far. I have extremely oily skin and this product really reduced the oiliness. My face is so supple and clear. I give this product a thumbs up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love love due it . My skin was dry itchy but oily still. The skin around my cheeks is very sensitive and due to the sun and heat here in Texas it keeps my skin itchy. My very first application of the product was awesome! My skin felt revived but not oily . And that feeling lasted all day . The liquid is so smooth and perfect feeling you just want to keep putting it on over and over you can't wait to use it again. For me this is a product that I will continue to use!

i tried L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for normal/ oily skin and i can say i love it . i apply it every morning before applying my make up and after a week or so i felt my skin became firmer and more youthful. and i also apply it in the evening before going to bed. i recommend it because i feel like it transformed my skin.

"First of all, the packaging is lovely, I like the sleek blue clear bottle. The moisturizer has a great fresh scent and feels very light on the skin. A little bit goes a long way. I've been using it in the morning and evening and while my face feels oily by the end of the day (Florida heat and humidity don't help), in the morning my face is much less oily than before. I look forward to seeing results long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Firstly, I'd like to state how much I adore the fragrance of the product. It reminds me a lot of a perfume I own. I tried the product for about a week now. I have not noticed any reduction of oil on the skin. I've actually noticed a significant increase in oil production when using the product. My face feels sticky and greasy. I love the gel texture and how light the product feels upon application. However, I'm disappointed because I expected this product to control the oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great moisturizer for dry skin! I have combination skin and also sensitive skin. I can be hard to find a moisturizer that works for both. I have been using this product for less than a week and have noticed a difference. My dry skin is no longer dry and my oily skin isn't as oily. My face has not shown any signs of sensitivity. This is awesome!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It has been less than a week since I have started using this twice a day!!! Morning and evening. My skin looks and feels amazing!!! Definatly part of my daily skincare regimen #loreal #hydragenius #skinhydration [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combination skin with an oily T-zone. This product keeps the shine away from my face without making my skin feel tight. I tried it without using my toner and it kept my skin hydrated and shine-free, but not as smooth as I like. I started using my toner before applying Hydra Genius and my skin was so smooth I couldn't stop touching my face! It works very well under sunscreen too - big plus for the summers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have oily and sensative skin so I was nervous to try such a hydrating product. I absolutely love it!!! It is the perfect gel-like consistency that provides a smooth, refreshing coverage. You can feel the hydration the second it touches your skin. Leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing. Smells better than imaginable, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is normally a combo of oily with dry patches. So, I'm always looking for a product that quenched my face with out leaving it greasy feeling. L'oreal's Hydra Genius is it! I feel like I just gave my face a drink of water. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I actually like the hydra genius, but i have acne prone skin so im very lery on products i use! And to my suprise it didnt make me break out, thank goodness because the product ususually use is well over double the price! I would recommend this product 100% it will be my new go to! I have told so many people at work about this with working with oil. Also have already bought my mother and sister one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. It did not leave my face feeling greasy or too wet. I used about 3 pumps of the product and my skin absorbed it really well. The smell was just a little strong for my personal taste, but it only smelled of aloe so it wasn't too bothersome. The next day, my skin still feels soft and moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am super picky about products, if I start to breakout or my face changes (in a negative manor) I get rid of it. This stuff smells great, HUGE bottle for the price which is a Pro. It is a true gel, kind of matte like, and makes your face So soft! I would definitely purchase. Have already recommended to friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was easy to apply and felt good putting it on. So I tend to have oily skin. I found that this worked great for the first few hours, but then, after just a few hours, I was quite oily again. I do not think that I would use this on a regular basis as I was not happy with the long term effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
loreal hydra genius is sich a great product! first thing i noticed is the packaging...beautiful and simple! the bottle itself is heavy duty with a pump nozzle..love it! the smell is delicious and refreshing! i have been using this morning and night after washing face.

"I tried Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for normal/oily skin. I have been using it for about a week. I first tried this at night and I could tell a difference the next morning. My skin was very soft and very smooth. There is no odor and no irritation. The one problem I have with it is that it takes a while to absorb so I am not able to wear it under my makeup, however, it makes for a great nighttime cleanser. I plan to keep using this and recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I immediately felt smoother, refreshed skin. After a couple days of using I really like this product and will continue to use it. I don't feel oily or dry. My face feels great! I only wish it had a sunscreen component in it for my daily morning treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is amazing. Feels amazing and I felt refreshed when I used it. It really hydrated my skin, but not too much! I used it every morning and night. My nose doesn't feel dried out anymore which was the worst spot on my face. But didn't over hydrate the rest of my face where it was oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live in Florida and have semi oily skin, so it's been hard for me to commit to a a daily moisturizer (even though I know I'm supposed to use one!). Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care fits the bill though! It's super lightweight and feels great on my face - not too heavy or greasy; just enough to let me know it's there doing its job. It's perfect under makeup and as part of my nighttime skincare ritual! The fact that it comes in such a pretty blue bottle is an added bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal's Hydra Genius moisturizer for normal/oily skin is just amazing. I was worried it would be too thick, but it is very light weight and honestly smells amazing. I love the fact that it is entirely oil free and my face feels so smoothe after using it. It goes on so nice. I will definitely be using this every single day as my new moisturizer. I'm in LOVE with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer smells great and feels great as it is going on. It also leaves your skin feeling hydrated without feeling too heavy or greasy. I really liked this lotion because it's soft on your skin and it dries matte. I hate when lotions are shiny, oily, or greasy, and this is none of that! If you are looking for a great daily moisturizer with a good price tag, look no further than this hydra genius liquid care! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just tried Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for normal to oily skin and loved everything about it. I really like the smell which is like perfume. My skin felt softer and it did a really great job at moisturizing without making it feel oily or leaving a shine. I like the packaging as well which is a nice glass bottle not plastic. The formula looks thick but as soon as you start putting it on it feels more watery and it didn't take long for it to work. From my experience a little bit goes a long way.

"I've been using the product for about a week now. So far, so good. Because I have oily skin, I am usually wary of moisturizing products in the summer, but this product is light and absorbs quickly. My skin feels really smooth. The product smells great, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this Hydra Genius Liquid Care for Normal/oily skin. The 1st thing I noticed when I opened it is that it smells so good. Pumped some on my hands & put it on my face & oh man it felt wonderful on my skin. It is not greasy like some products I have tried. I will definitely be purchasing & using more of this product. I also love the packaging & do not have any cons about it. I give this an A++++ rating! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The fragrance is wonderful, not overpowering a fresh. I have been using this each morning before my BB cream. It has definitely reduced the shine in my t zone and keeps me looking fresh through the day. It also allows my BB cream to glide on smoother for a more even finish. I haven't even been using primer now that I have this. I do prefer a heavier cream at night, so I have been primarily using in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a hard time finding products that work well to moisturize my face without adding extra oil and grease throughout the day. So far, my experience has been awesome and it goes on extremely smooth and leaves no sticky residue! Definitely great to put on before your make up as it doesn't build up on your face and leaves it refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really liked this Hydra liquid care product it feels soft and it does feel like your skin is hydrated all day. It makes your skin look smooth. Goes on great with a gel like feel which its easy to use and its not runny. Also,has a good smell to it and comes in a glass container. Would really recommend to have a hydrating skin.

"I was so afraid this was going to make my skin worse because I have really oily skin and usually moisturizing products make my skin oily and I don't use them. This Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for Normal/oily skin did not make my skin worse, in fact, it made it LESS oily and feel really good! I'm so happy I finally found a moisturizing product I can use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I just got the hydra genius normal/oily skin and I typically have to keep re applying lotions or moisturizers and so far this has lasted for hours! Does exactly what it says it will do and so far my fave hasn't gotten greasy yet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this product. It made my skin feel so soft and fresh I know for sure I will be purchasing more in the future. I love the bottle it came in and love how it's for both night and day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far I have been using L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid care for oily skin for almost a week now. To me this product has done nothing for my skin and I do not see any improvement whatsoever. It is like the other products from different companies that I had tried in the past. It does not work for me at all. But I must say that I like the packaging of the product such as the bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far I really like this product! I received it for free to try, and even though I've only used it a handful of times, it feels so good on my super dry spots and doesn't make my oily spots more shiny. It's super moisturizing and not overly thick like most moisturizers I've used. My skin practically eats it up...and it hasn't broken out! The only thing I didn't like about this was the overly strong scent, but that doesn't make it a deal breaker. Also, it didn't last 72 hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't stop raving to everyone about this product! I've just about gave up on every moisturizer as my skin felt greasy, oily, and then eventually would brakeout. With the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care, my skin instantly looked brighter, smoother, and healthier. The lightweight formula was easily absorbed by my skin, and left it feeling refreshed. Plus, the bottle is aesthetically pleasing and one pump goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I at first glance it is beautiful with its glass bottle. I first opened a little sad because it wasn't fragrance free but was relieved at the soft smell. These harsh winter months kill my skin and I have a hard time with my face I don't like heavy stuff on my face. This product went on a little heavy but as it dried it left a soft cooling feeling that was relaxing. I am glad to add this to my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely blown away by this product! LOREAL HYDRA GENIUS is well...genius! It's super light after applied and it just takes a tiny bit for full face coverage. It smells great and leaves my face feeling rejuvenated, best part about my night time routine! A must have [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think this was a good product but I think I need something that is more tuned in for my skin. My skin is so strange and complicated that it's hard to find what works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Absorbs quickly and dries to a nice matte finish. The smell is a little overpowering but it dissipates quickly. Perfect for under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Good
"I love the product! Great silky finish for a lightweight moisturizer. I bought the normal-oily and feel like it is a bit too mattefying. My issue is the T zone is oily but next time I think I need to try the other one since this one gives me that dry pulling feel after an hour or so. Having said that, I don't feel as if it gives the hours of moisture they claim. Still a pretty good product for young 20s skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this product smells. It's so natural and light. It also feels great on my skin - doesn't clog my pores or feel heavy. It looks great underneath makeup as well. Keeps me moisturized without making me oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been meaning to find a moisturizer for my skin type instead of just using what I have on hand so this came at the perfect time. It feels so watery and refreshing on my skin yet doesn't add more oil to my oily skin. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Hydra genius daily liquid care moisturiser smells amazing. It has a really fresh scent and is light weight as well. It leaves a bit of a sticky feeling but when it fully dries it disappears. I've been using it for a little over 2 weeks now and I have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin does look softer and hydrated. I use it before I apply my primer and foundation and it's made my makeup apply smoother. So far I'm loving it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is in my top five most favorites. It was lightweight and left my skin feeling silky and smooth. I didn't break out after using this product like some have done to me in the past. The bottle is pretty and big so you'll be using this for a quite a while. Saves money. This moisturizer always has a very nice scent. It's kind of a musky smell like men's cologne and I literally smelled it all day. Definitely worth the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care. It makes my skin moisturizer without a greasy feeling. I have not had any breakouts since I have started using this product. My skin feel so silky smooth after application. I like that it pairs well with makeup. This is a great product for Morning and evening hydration for your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm used to seeing cream moisturizer, but this is more like a gel. It goes on easily and absorbs pretty quickly. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all, but I do feel moisturized all day! It makes my skin feel really nice. I don't like the smell, but it's not a very strong smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this daily on my skin after cleansing and it has left my skin looking great and feeling much smoother. It's very easy to apply, I only need to put a small amount on my finger that I'm able to use to cover my whole face with. What I liked the most about this is that it works well on my oily skin and doesn't leave it feeling more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I purchased this after receiving a sample months ago and had high hopes of finding a perfect moisturizer. The sample felt great on my skin and I wanted to try it out. However, after buying the full size and applying at night, I woke up with my t-zone oily and shiny. I tried using a smaller amount but experienced the same results during the day/night. It did feel nice against my skin, but it also felt as though it was just sitting there and not being absorbed instantly."
"I have super oily skin and almost every moisturizer looks matte when I first put it on, then an hour later, I'm a greaseball and if I don't put on any product it dries out my face and makes it even oilier. I tried this product and my face was smooth, moisturized, and matte ALL DAY. This was amazing. I highly recommend this for everyone struggling with super oily, acne prone skin. It helps control oil and the aloe soothes inflammation of pores. Super impressed!"
I got this product as a sample and it was really good. I have acne prone sensitive skin and it did not burn or cause more break outs on me. It basically felt like you were applying water to your face and it gave me a matte finish. It also smelled great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I really dig this product. First, I like the dispenser, it's not a pot where I have to dip my finger into & potentially contaminate. Second, I like the lightness. It's like a water-gel consistency. It feels SO nice on the skin, especially during the summer. Super refreshing. Third, the smell is nice. Nothing too harsh or floral or offensive. Last, I like that it makes my skin feel hydrated but doesn't make it too oily/slick looking. Very solid product, if looking for an affordable moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff is amazing. I always thought every moisturizer worked the same on my oily skin until i tried this one. It hydrates my skin while helping control my oil. I also noticed that its help made my skin softer and i love the gel like texture. Its a super light weight everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer! It smells amazing and doesn't leave any sticky or greasy residues. You only need to use a little bit to get a lot of coverage, so one bottle will probably last a while, and I love the look of the bottle as well! I have naturally oily skin and this product reduces shine and leaves my face looking great! I'd definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is great my only issue was my forehead and temple area was much more oily than before using this. That is my most problem area. Otherwise i love it. It makes your face feel so hydrated and soft. There is no greasy or sticky after feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Some moisturizers for oily skin make my skin feel tight. Those same moisturizers also feel like they're sitting on top of my skin instead of sinking into it. Not this one. The L'Oreal Hydra Genius for Normal/Oily skin takes away the shine while moisturizing well. It also feels like it sinks into my skin, actually providing moisture. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Haven't been using this for long but the results from my face are so great that I will buy this product after I use up the one I have which was given to me for review purposes the product is watery gel like and doesn't feel sticky at all on face it smells a lot like aloe which is actuall kinda relaxing to me this product has been leaving my face with this natural glow while keeping it moisturized definitely loved this item and recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really liked the Hydra Genius moisturizer because of how light it felt on my skin. I put a generous amount of it all over my face and within minutes I felt like it seeped into skin . It gave me the hydration I needed without feeling heavy or greasy. I walked about a mile to work in 90 degree temperature and even after I got to work my face wasn't oily or sticky from the moisturizer. I think this moisturizer was perfect for my combination skin.

"Wasn't the best but wasn't bad at all. No break outs, went on smoothly, smells beautiful, refreshing...My skin DRANK IT UP! Absorbed every bit. Skin felt soft but dry & matte. I preferably like more of a moisturized feel. Paired well with my usual makeup routine! Just didn't like the finish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care made my skin so soft and moisturized without making it oily! I love how fast it dries so I don't have to wait to put on makeup afterwards. It gives my face a matte complexion keeping oil away all day. The bottle also lasts a while because it only takes one pump to cover your whole face. I would definitely recommend and will be buying when my bottle is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am usually very weary of new moisturizers because my skin does get oily very easily. But this product has the perfect formula. It skins into the skin relatively fast and when I wake up my skin just looks healthy like it's glowing from within. I don't think I'll be able to live without this now!

"So far I love it!! I just got it in the mail 3 days ago and have used it the past two days. Smells fresh. It applies like a gel substance. Doesn't immediately dry, takes a while to seep into the skin. I will write another review in a week [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

And a little of this product makes you feel really amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product. moisturizers usually leave me oily but this one did not. my skin texture is improving, only after one week of use. the products smell is the only thing off putting, its not a bad smell its just a little strong for me I prefer moisturizers be sent-less because it goes on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The consistency is light and water like perfect for oily skin. It is absorbed by your skin almost instantly and it helped my skin bombs reduce significantly. There is no oily or sticky residue what so ever. Will repurchase for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this moisturizer. Lightweight and no greasy feel. Absorbs into the skin quickly. Reminds me of moisture rescue gel by garnier. my skin did not feel tight or dry after using nor did my acne flare up. Only thing that is missing from the moisturizer is an SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Before trying this product, I was totally hesitant because I have literally tried every product out there for oily skin, and NOTHING helped to subdue it. Just within 3 days of using this product every morning and night, my skin feels completely different! My skin for once isn't oily! I can go all day without having to use oil blotching pads. Not to mention, this product doesn't smell like chemicals and actually smells clean! Thank you L'Oréal for this amazing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is so silky smooth on my skin! As soon as put it on my face doesn't feel tight or too oily, the texture is just right! It wasn't too heavy like most moisturizers nor was it to watery for me to pack it onto my face. I applied it at night after taking my makeup off & the morning before putting makeup on & i was able to apply my makeup evenly! I highly recommend this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, I decided to try Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for Normal/Oily Skin the other day. I have used it morning and evening everyday since. It has definitely exceeded expectations! I was worried my skin was going to appear oily after application. Boy was I wrong! My skin is soft, matte, bright. I apply on my face, neck, and hands, but wish I could use it ALL over. The smell is lovely, and makes me want to keep applying just to get another sniff. Definitely worth a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am always on the look out for a great face mosturizer and this one has won me over! The bottle itself is so appealing and makes me think I am using some super fancy product. A lot of times after washing my face, it can feel dry in places. Only a couple pumps will do and after applying it, it left my skin feeling brand new again. It doesn't leave behind a residue, and soaked directly into my skin almost right after applying it. The smell is fantastic as well! I love this face product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am already in love with this moisturizer, it takes very little to make your face feel amazingly soft. my face is usually feels dry and like it ready to Crack after I wash it and with this moisturizer it feels so smooth and I really helps to keep your my oil under control threw out the day! I couldn't say enough enough good things about the product it will definitely be part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I like it. The texture and smell are refreshing. Smell is a big part of my decision making when I buy facial products as I have a quite sensitive nose. But this one passed my nose test! Can't wait to try everyday to see its effect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I would definitely buy this for my skin. It left my face feeling amazing and soft and hydrated.

"Right off the bat it left my skin very smooth. It smells very good. The consistently waant too thick, and it delt cooling on the skin. There really wasn't anything i didn't like about it. I think it did what it claimed to do. Ivgot the one for oily skin because my skin is tipically very oily. Any this made me very matte, yet a beautiful satin finish. I really enjoy this!

"I was sceptical of this product at first, i have tried a lot of moisturizers and most make me break out or leave my skin feeling oily.

"I bought this about 1 month ago and I am so grateful I did ! I really needed severe hydration and when I tested it on my hand I knew I was going to buy it. It goes on so smoothly, no greasy feeling, no feeling of a lot of product on.. I wear it under my makeup and it feels like I have nothing on. It is light and airy, with a hint of fragrance. that just smells delicious. I have more oily skin and its a perfect balance."
"I think this would well be worth the price tag in stores. After the first use my skin felt softer, smoother and awake. In the morning it is like a little cup of coffee for my skin. I get hormonal acne and stress acne, the added hydration has cut back on that. I love the scent. It is very very light and clean. The texture is slippery but spreads lightly, the last thing i want is a thick cream on my face. I eapecially liked i wasnt allergic to it, many products give me hives [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very oily skin so I was skeptical about it being hydrating yet mattifying. I absolutely love this stuff. It doesn't make me oily at all.

"I tried the Hydra Genius daily liquid care normal to oily skin. This product really impressed me. Instantly my face look with a matte finish. The excess shine on my face was reduced.

I opened up this box thinking that it was going to smell and feel like most products (funky and gritty).It made my face feel soooooo smooth and full of moisture somewhat like a watery lotion. Which means won't make you face feel like you put a paste on that leaves a dry crust left on your face. Plus it smells good!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
super drying from the alcohol. why is it in there . it ruined it
You will love this stuff Mousturizes without making skin feel oily
"I love the way this rubs into the skin, absorbs quickly, and feels silky smooth"
It was so light and didn't leave anything behind. My skin was perfect all day.
I really wanted something light and I live that it has aloe vera in it.
I just use today and I feel so better for my skin I feel hydrated
This product does an amazing job hydrating my face! I was so surprised that by the time it actually made my face more matte.
"Bought this a few months ago. My skin is dry, but also oily. I have that oily T-Zone thing going on. This product gives my skin a healthy glow. It's like my skin can breathe. I try to use this product every morning and night."

"After I tried this, I quickly dumped my old brand. Sonce they work equally well. Only difference is my old brand was more expensive. So Im really glad Loreal came up with this product. Love it."
"It works pretty nicely for oilier skin, but why is there a paraben in this formula and not the others? Please remove the parabens they aren't helping my skin."
I got this as a free sample from L'oreal.It went on smooth and is light enough for me.Although i should have had them send me a sample of the normal/dry skin liquid. My skin is oily cause its dry.Like it lots and will recommend to my friends.Next i'm trying their clay masks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Are usually only use expensive department store level products but I decided to take a chance on this and I am very happy so far. My skin stays moisturized without being greasy and I have not had any breakouts after you think it for a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is one of the best facial product I have used. It did everything it said it would. The only thing that I did not like was it was in a glass bottle, because my son threw it after his bath one night and broke it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love moisturizers! And This one is one of my favorites now! I love that it's more like a gel. The only thing I don't not like is that sometimes my skin feels sticky. I've learned that you kinda have to rub it in completely. So over all I'm still trying to work with the texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The daily liquid is very easy to use. I have to apply it for more than a week now. First, it smell so good and very easy to apply on my face. It isn't oily and my face absorbs very fast and I don't feel dry afterward. When I woke up in the morning, my skin still looks good and moisture. I don't expect this product with shrink my pores or improve my skin tones. As the moisturizer it does its purpose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product is great, but I'd like to use it more. It will take a while to complete the bottle! I have always loved loreal products and I love the way this makes my skin feel. Smooth and silky! I have combination skin (more oily than normal) and this makes my face look like I don't have an oil problem! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'OREAL Hydra Genius for normal/oily skin worked wonders on my skin! I started noticing a difference by the second time of use which left my skin very smooth and not oily. Yay! I totally recommend this to those who have very oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Goes on smoothly the feels very light but I am beyond impressed with it's moisturizing! We've had some brutally cold weather and this has helped with my chapped cheeks IMMENSELY. I have very sensitive skin, every moisturizer I try breaks me out. I was pleasantly surprised that this didn't!! Would definitely get this product again.

"I got my box this afternoon so I tried it out for the first time tonight and this stuff is literally a drink of water for your skin! It feels so good on your face! Not greasy or oily at all! The ONLY bad thing I could even think of is the smell. It's not bad, but it's not refreshing either. It's doesn't matter to me though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found this product because I wanted a moisturizer with hyaloraulic acid in it. It's supposed to be the best new age ingredient in anti aging n moisture products. I use this after my clay to mouse wash. Has worked fast I also let my teenager use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Purchased this item at Wal-Mart.2 min after applying this product to my face I could feel how tight and dry my skin felt so I put a little more, 20 min later I applied my makeup, as I was putting on my foundation I notice dry patches on my face and I did not have this problem before but I was in a rush for work and didn't have time to remove. my skin felt so dry and looked so flakey/cakey."
"I always have a hard time finding a moisturizer I like because I have fairly oily skin. Even moisturizers formulated for oily skin make me feel greasy and unpleasant. This moisturizer absorbed quickly and made my skin feel plump and hydrated, but dry and smooth to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed using this product as it is tailored for people with my skin type. Oily. I really did like the way my face felt after I put on this product because it didn't feel dry or oily. It's not extremely creamy and moisturizes my skin very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have an oily T-Zone and was really excited to try Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for normal to oily skin. This moisturizer goes on light and soaks into my skin quickly. It doesn't leave my face feeling oily or looking shiny, and it's great under makeup! The bottle itself is also classy and it feels like a more premium product for a non-premium price! Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow! This product is amazing!!!!! It's like giving thirsty skin a big glass of water. Feels fresh and moist, but not wet, and not greasy or oily either. I replaced my moisturizer with this. My combination skin can't always take moisturizers is to greasiness, heaviness or thickness. This formula is so light and thin it is bound to be healthy for you. I'm so glad I got to test it out!

"I suffer from extremely oily skin and this product almost immediately mystified my skin. It has a really smooth, almost silicone feel finish, that works great under my liquid foundation. I would have preferred that there was no fragrance since I have sensitive skin, but luckily I didn't have a reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It took me awhile to review this because I wanted to share an honest review that I don't think you get if you use a product for a short period of time. I started using the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for normal to oily skin from L'Oréal the night I received it. After using it now for a month, I have to say my skin has never felt more soft. I don't have the dry skin patches like I had in the past. Gone are the days of my skin looking dull. Now it's fresh and glowing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been trying out this product for a little 2 weeks now and my skin never looked better. I have a very sensitive skin but Hydra Genius Liquid Care gave me no problems whatsoever. My skin feels so much smoother and fresh. People had mentioned how my skin looks healthy. I love that it feels very light and not sticky on my face. This product has become my facial regimen and I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Well surprisingly I kind of liked this product! The packaging was gorgeous. I loved the smell and the feel as I spread it on the skin. I only noticed a slight difference in my skin unfortunately. And I did have some slight irritation in the beginning, but it actually went away after the 3rd use. I would recommend this for other people with oily skin because it didn't leave my skin feeling even more oily or as if I had a heavy film. It was light and dried quickly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product absorbs very fast & doesn't leave a greasy feel. I feel like a bottle this size will last a long time. I have sensitive skin, & this product does not irritate it at all. The scent is a little strong for me but other then that, it's great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It could not arrived in a better time,the winter here in massachussets is brutal and my skin was needing some good hydration. It's refreshing and at the same time keeps my skin mostorized through the day! Love it,even my husband is using it now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Will be purchasing it in the future! It is very soft and easy to apply as well as very light weight, didn't interfere with my makeup application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved this product for the most part! Smelled amazing went on smooth! The only thing that I didn't like is that my face felt pretty oily after applying it, i thought maybe once my skin got used to a new product it would stop, but it didn't and its a hard feeling to get used to. I didnt notice any breakouts from this product which was really nice since my skin is extremely sensitive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is absolutely amazing!! I absolutely love how the bottle looks firstly. As soon as I put it on I love the smell of it. It's light and cool and I love how it feels on my skin. I wear glasses and most lotions are heavy and my glasses slide off. Not with this product and I love it for that! I will definitely be buying this product for now on! I can't talk about it enough. I even have my sister in it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the texture of this formula. It's very light weight and goes on super smooth. The smell is fabulous. It's not strong at all, but has a sort of expensive smell to it. I like it! I've been using this every morning and evening after I wash my face for about a week now, and I can already tell the difference. My skin feels smoother and more refreshed. Hydrated for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer has been the best that I have found/used! It did not make my skin feel or look oily. After multiple uses my skin looked less shiny and more mattified, it also had a smoother feel and look. The moisturizer has a very pleasant and clean smell, the feel of it is very light and a little bit of this product goes a long way! It also didn't clog my pores or aggravate my sensitive skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has been great! It's so dry here right now, and using this product daily has kept the red, dry patches at bay. It goes on so smooth and dries quickly. I will definitely buy more after this bottle runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First impression, I am so glad that this product was sent to me. I love the oily complexion option. Sometimes my skin is both dry and oily. I normally use a night cream to help prevent some future wrinkles. I have changed my routine to this product every night and morning on clean skin. It feels great going on. It really gives my skin a super soft and smooth finish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing. My skin has done a complete 180 after using this product for two weeks. Even though it is not advertised to, it has cleared up my acne. I use it every day, first thing in the morning, and after I take off my make up at night. My skin is not only GLOWING, but so smooth, and fresh. This product does not leave a greasy feeling, but a cool, fresh from the spa softness. I can not express how much I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a week now and I can tell that the product feels light and and gets dry or absorbed by the skin really quickly and leaves the face with a fresh feeling, matte and good looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love Hydra Genius! I was afraid it would be too heavy on my skin, which is usually pretty oily, but it goes on so smooth and makes my skin feel moisturized but not greasy when it soaks in. I love the smell of it, and how the bottle looks more like a nice bottle of perfume than a bottle of moisturizer. It's been so nice to try during the dry winter months when my skin can go from oily to dry and flaky without a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start by saying the smell is amazing!!!! I've been using it for about a week now and I feel like my skin has approved quite a bit..and my brother has been using it he's hooked ☺and that's what I like most about this product the smell is very unisex and I think that's a big deal being that it is very fragrant and the matte finish has the face feeling smooth and non oily all day...the only problem I have is i never want it to run out!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"This is an amazing product! I've always had trouble finding moisturizers for my skin type as it's ""normal"" and gets oily later in the day.

I love this product! In the winter my face needs added moisture and after washing my face I applied the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care and my face felt instantly refreshed!

"It's great for people with oily skin, when I first saw it i didn't think it would moisturize my face but it did! It's like a gel consistency and it feels cool on your face.

I think this is an okay product. It did make my skin softer but the fragrance bothers me. I don't like feeling like I have perfume on my face. Also I got tiny little bumps around my ears and the side of my face after using this. Not to happy at the moment with how my skin reacted. Hopefully.it works better for someone else. The texture is similar to water so it's not to thick. Maybe it was the fragrance I had a reaction to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care by L'Oreal yesterday so after work I washed my face and used it. I love it, it goes on beautifully, smooth and not oily at all. Also when I put on it dried right away. I also used it today in the morning and my face does not feel oily and it feels refreshed and hydrated. I give it thumps up :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the normal/oily skin version of the product for 72 hours. I tried this version of the product because I have more oily skin than dry; however, the oily skin version didn't really help the dry skin parts of my face. I just wonder if I had tried the dry skin version if it would've helped combination skin better. It was a great product that provided nice moisture for my skin, but needs more experimenting for combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Amazing for oily skin!!! It never broke me out. Love this product. Will buy it over and over again.
I have oily skin and it's honestly perfect for my skin type
I bought this a couple of months ago and I am glad I did.. it makes my skin really hydrated. I don't feel it getting dry throughout the day.

"I was excited to try this product out, as I am pretty picky about moisturizers and am always trying new ones. Pros: lightweight, made my skin feel smooth, felt like it was really moisturizing my skin and it didn't break out my super sensitive skin! Cons: the smell was pretty strong and perfume-y, it made me feel a little greasy when I used it in the morning, didn't wear well under makeup. My conclusion is that it's a good moisturizer - not bad, but not life-changing either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product, it works so much better than lotion, which left my skin shiny and sticky. This made my face feel smooth and look clean. It kept away my dry skin but also controlled my oily skin. I used it after I showered in the morning and before I went to bed after I washed my face. I recommend it to anyone who's having trouble finding a good moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love the light and moisturizing feeling, and that a little bit goes a long way. The scent I am still torn on. I feel like it is too perfumey. I prefer my face products to have a scent but one that isn't like perfume. I prefer a more spa-like or aromatherapy scent. The scent isnt bad but I dont love it either. Its close to being perfect.

"Not only do I put this on my face, but I also use it on my neck and 'dec' area. I like this so much that I have two unused one in my beauty stock!"

I got this product about two weeks ago and could not ask for anything better. Love this product works wonders

The first lotion I've used on my face that doesn't leave an oily feel
This one of the best face lotion I've used!!! My make up looks flawless!!!!
It's great for non-greasy moisturizing and mixing well with other skin care products.
