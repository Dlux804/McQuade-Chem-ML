Excellent product! My skin is so soft and It smells amazing.
I love it! It's a very good vitamin c lots of moisturer. My pores are more smaller and the oil in my skin is less and of course the few spots I have it are more lighter.
"Easy to order, good price and excellent service."
I really love it. It works for my face definitely I will buy again.
"The texture of the skin looks moist and shiny, I love it"
I have been using this for years and love it. I put it on after cleansing and before Peter Thomas Roth's CC cream. It's never greasy and absorbs very quickly. I highly recommend it!
