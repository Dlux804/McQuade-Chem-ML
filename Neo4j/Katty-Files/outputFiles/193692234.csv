Love the way it feels on my face. I have used other retinal products and this one is by far my favorite.
I have been using tree of life beauty products for 6 months now and I absolutely love them. The fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable and my forehead lines are smoother. This retinol serum along with the other serums have really worked wonders for my skin. You can't beat the price either! Thanks Tree of Life!
"I've been using a variety of products to help maintain a youthful face. It seems ever since I added the retinol to my skin care regimen, my face seems a little smoother."
"This serum is just as good as my other retinol serum priced at 3x the price. It does have retinol, which often causes skin to dry out, so I put a moisturizer on after using it, but yes... this retinol cream is the best anti aging serum I've used. Thanks for the amazing product. I'm sold for life."
"I have just started using the product and will update my review in a few weeks. First off, I can't believe that a retinol serum is available at this price! I have super sensitive skin, and this serum did not leave any tingling sensation on my face at all! Once applied, my skin looks smoother and hydrated. Will continue using it to find out if it's effective in reducing my acne scars."
I was going to have my doctor order me some retinol for my skin. I tried this instead and I am happy I did my skin looks great and people can't believe my age. The price is great too a plus!
"I've had some recent breakout issues, and within a couple of days of trying the Retinol Serum, my face has shown a lot of improvement. I think the price is awesome for the amount and quality of product you get, too."
You also will be impressed with their service! I received my products so quickly! I will definitely be ordering more from this site. They are sending me a free Retinol Serum as well. Love the Tree of Life products and you will too!
"I have only been using this for a few days, so that's why I have it 4 stars. It feels very nice going on and is not oily. I am hoping to see results shortly and will update my review later."
"I like the texture and feel; have not been using long enough to see visible results. No irritation so far, as I have had in the past with other retinoids."
I've only had this a few days but so far I'm happy. I really like that it's not oily feeling. I put this on then my face lotion and My skin seems fine using it. Usually I can be sensitive to new products and dry out easily.
The serum seems good. I've only used it once but there is a slight difference on the side of my face I tried it on last night. The customer service has been good. Seems like a nice company to do business with. The price is the best part!
"I smoked for years, and have deep wrinkle lines. I have been useing the Tree of Life Retinol Serum for only 3 days. I have already noticed my wrinkles disappearing. Very happy!!"
"Tree if Life Retinol serum is the good stuff! I saw immediate results, after the first use. My skin appeared smoother with a more even tone. Very pleased with this product."
"I have been using it for a couple of days and I like it. I have been using it for dark circles under my eyes. The customer service is great, very friendly, and the product is very affordable."
"this retinal serum is the bomb, ive been using it only for 1 week and I can already see a difference in my wrinkles and skin tone, I will definitely be reordering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! think ill try the duo next!!!!"
"The nice packaging, the quick delivery and especially the results of the product. I am using it on my hands which always look really weathered and I'm already noticing Improvement"
I rate this product a 4 out of 5 so far. I cannot give it a 5 yet because I have only been using it for a week. So far I love it! I can feel a difference in my skin already. Right after you apply the serum your skin feels softer and really smooth. I would buy again.
The product is fantastic with a beautiful packaging and wonderful customer support.
It makes mu skin feel so good in the morning. Really happy
I haven't had the product long enough to give a fair rating.
It works very instantly and you feel very well after the first use
"Not at all greasy, so smooth and soft going on. I have just used it a few times as I just received it. So far, so good!"
Its only been a couple of days i do see some diffrence cant wait until its been a month or to thanks so much
I like the dropper method better than pump. I like the smell and texture of the product.
I've just started the serum regime t but I can definitely see a difference. I'll be buying another bottle soon.
Wish I would of had this sooner-I am 62 and this has evened my skin tone-tighten my face-look younger-Thanks
The price is fantastic. So is the service. And I buy the retinol serum and hyaluronic acid on a regular basis.
"Since I have just started using it, I can not rate it further yet. The price is nice and the feel is great so far; not too drying. Thank you"
I love the way it feels and absorbs into my skin. My usual face cream goes right over it and there's no film!
I've only been using this product for 3 days but I love the way it makes my skin feel it goes on nice and Light and my skin looks much better in the morning I'm sure it's going to take longer then three days to see the full effects
This stuff works really well! Its silky smooth and light- unlike anti-aging creams. I have noticed a big difference in my skin already. I will Definitely buy this again!
"It's easy to apply. I know how important Retinol is for aging skin, so I am really happy that I can afford to use this since your price is really good. I also love the fact that it's 72% organic."
"Made my face feel smooth, I like the product very much."
A very good professional product of very good quality. A must try and have.
"The quality is definitely first class and at a very reasonable price, so far so good."
"I agree with Emily's review. This stuff is awesome, but, as with all serums, it's meant to be used under a moisturizer. And, because it's clinical strength retinol, it does tend to dry the skin out--that's why you need to be sure you add moisturizer. I've been using Tree of Life Beauty products for several years and, not only are they some of the best on the market with the exact same ingredients as a lot of higher priced anti-aging products, but their customer service is off the charts good. Highly recommend."
My skin looks visibly smoother and plumper with a glow.
"I like the texture and how my skin looks and feels, after I apply the serum."
Love it! Feels so good on my face..Very smooth and soft.
I love that it's almost all organic and that it's a great price
It's very light and easy to absorb. And then I can use my own moisturizer after and I LOVE THAT!!
I only been using product for a few weeks but it seems to be working.
"My skin really looks great after using this serum. The texture ia better, and less dry."
"So smooth, feels light going on with my moisturizer"
First day I used it it seemed to help my skin clear up a bit
I use this twice a day-with a moisturizer in the morning and a facial oil at night. I ha e seen an improvement in my 60 year old skin.
Serum is great for minimizing fine wrinkles. Just wish it was a bit thicker so it doesn't run when applying.
"So far the serum is light, not sticky. My skin feels really soft and pliable. I actually recently received compliments on my skin."
I am so pleased with the results of using this product. Within a week I saw a remarkable difference in the fine lines around my mouth and eyes.
I just ordered Tree of Life Retinol Serum and love it. Be sure to moisturize after use as it will dry you out a bit but you will definitely see results. I have used Tree of Life beauty products in the past and none of their products have let me down.
I like product it feels nice once applied to face.
I bought this because it looks like the best deal for a serious retinol serum that I've seen yet.
I've not used it long enough to determine just how much it is helping my skin.
I like it ..happy i purchased..Good price and quality
very easy to absorb. I have only used it for 2 days so i am not able to see the result.
"This is an amazing product that make my face solf. I also apply this serum on my hair, and my elbow. The price is great as well as fast shipping. I will recommend to my friends and family."
I wear daily under my makeup. After around 30 days of using..inoticed my sagging skin was lifted plumper just overall looked healthier. Really works if u stick with it. Fast shipping friendly r
"No stars would be better. This stuff is useless. It is very drying, which makes my skin seem to have more wrinkles than before. Waste of money. I'll go back to natural coconut oil and shea butter with no chemicals and a soothing, moisturizing effect."
"Chose Tree of Life product as it had good reviews, organic + made in USA... I'm new to Retinol but looking forward to the results"
this is my 2nd purchase. i really like this serum. i use at night.
Haven't had it long enough to tell yet. Do love the texture and the way it goes on.
I just started using the product and am already seeing smoother skin.
"Shipment came fast, and the product offers noticeable results."
