"I've been using this product for years now. I was so sad when i couldnt find it in any store. Please, dont discontinue it. I receive many compliments of my skin and asking me what i'm using. Your product really works for me, I'm so confident going out without makeup."
Please do not discontinue! I can't find this in the stores any more and it has changed my life! I love this formula. I have dark spots all over my face since my pregnancy and this has made them almost disappear. I had tried all types of formulas for years and nothing worked except this. Please keep around!
"Hello . My name is Fran. I am 33 years old and have 4 children. I've been using the product for 2 months and I love the texture of it. leaves the skin well moisturized and radiant, but it did not soften my spine spots that I have, so I do not think it fully complies with what was described on the packaging, because it was for this reason that I bought it."
"I have been using this product daily for several years and also tried other more expensive creams claiming to do the same thing. I wear it every day and have no new brown spots, old ones are not gone completely but they are smaller and less noticeable. People say my skin looks great."
I've used this day cream for a couple years and when I see it on sale I stock up. Well to my surprise it's changed!!! It's oily now and doesn't have any scent at all. It used to have a pleasant scent and it was light and left my skin looking radiant. Now it's thick and oily and non scented. It's as if it's just sun screen! Now I have 6+ jars of this sunscreen. I want the original formula back. Why doesn't it say the formula changed. A warning would have been appreciated.
I bought this product because it said was a dark spot corrector and would see results in four weeks. It has been 6 and have seen no changes and I have been very faithful. It was expensive and claims are not correct. I love other Loreal products so was surprised and disappointed in this one.
"I love using LOreal products all the time. Recently I want to working on the dark spots on my both sides of face. So I am trying both dark spots corrector serum and day cream. The serum is fine, but the day cream with spf30 always balling off my skin no matter how I put on my face. Could you help me solve this problem? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this religiously for 6 weeks, didn't miss a day. Nothing has changed, not even a tiny bit. My darkspot looks exactly the same. Checked the ingredient and couldn't tell it apart from regular sunscreen. I can find some better sunscreen with higher SPF for much cheaper."
"I recently had cataract surgery and boy, when I looked in the mirror, I saw uneven skin tone and dark spots I had not noticed before. I had seen your advertisement and immediately went out and bought it. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and some of the dark spots have vanished, others have lightened and my skin tone has improved. My husband has even commented on my skin and how it glows. I will not run out of this product. I am so happy. I would highly recommend this product."
"The smell is stifling, I walk around smelling Ajax all day. I feel like a should clean the bathroom with it (only because of the smell). I don't really like the way it makes my face feel. It said give it 4 weeks I did, dark spot was still there. I did buy the RoseyTone also, I'll see how that works. Will not buy again."
"I've been using this product for years and it absolutely works but I'm having a hard time finding it on store shelves. I usually buy on sale, would like to stock up before it's gone, unless there is a replacement product?"
"I am using Youth code from 2013 but this is the worst I bought it seems . I used to by Youth code from India with black cap , that used to be perfect , but this is more greasy , not sure how I will get replacement for same."
I received this product sample as Free from Smiley.I have been using this for more that 2 weeks and it has some postive effects on my face.I am glad that i found this product.
"I've been using this product for close to 5 years and suddenly it's disappeared, no there cream is giving me the same effect. Please tell me how can I buy it and why did you discontinue it ?"
I have been using Loreal youth code from past 5 years .. It's an amazing skin care .. I am sad that this has been discontinued in India now . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product actually began to work almost immediately. It's rich so a little goes a long way, evens out the skintone, and it has an SPF of 30. What more can you ask for?"
makes my skin look and feel great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Excellent quality. This is my youth code. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use it every day. It works great keeping skin soft, even in the winter."
"I have severe dark spots so I thought I would give the Dark Spot SPF 30 Day Cream and the serum a try. I loved the serum! It showed results in just a week. I've been using it for a few weeks now and there's a noticeable difference. The day cream... not so much. I looks nice going on. Makes my skin glowy looking. However, as soon as it starts to dry, it just flakes off! It also makes my makeup flake and look terrible as well. Will keep using the serum, but won't be buying the day cream again."
"This facial creame is magic. It is lightweight, and while it feels oily on your fingers, it does not clog pores. Has a slight fragrance that I do not find highyl appealing, but goes away after 15 minutes. I have noticed my dark spots fading and my tone evening out, I use both the facial creame and Dark Spot Correcting Serum. Love them both!!!"
"This does not work and is just basically just a glorified Sunscreen. It doesn't make dark spots go away, don't waste your money. Just buy sunscreen."
"I bought this product only to find out that is expensive, greasy, and does not work, will never buy any of these products again, very disappointed."
"This right here, my friends, is an amazing product! I use it with the serum and it works wonders! Must buy, you will be amazed!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3"
I prefer this over the other day cream because this one is in a jar. I have yet to see any changes but it gives me a slight glow.
Love this rich cream for my ultra dry fall and winter skin. Please don't change or discontinue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It does absolutely nothing against dark spots its just like a cheap sunblock never gonna buy again !
"The product kind of works, but promises more than it can deliver."
This is nothing but a sunless tanner. The reason why the spots seem to fade is because the skin overall is getting slightly darker. Research the ingredients individually and all together.
"I've been using the dark spot corrector for 2 months and I'm not impressed. It doesn't penatrate into the skin and a couple of hours later you see it ""rolling"" off your face. I've also haven't noticed any difference in the large age spot I've been using it on."
I couldn't stand the smell on my face for more than 5 minutes and I had to wash it off. I am taking it back today. I found the the scent to be not just bad but offensive. No way I could smell this stuff all day. It gets one star because the program doesn't recognize zero stars!
"At 64 my skin is slowly changing and decided to try this. It works great...use it along with the moisturizer because of the 30 SPF. However, the dark spots still remain. I would call myself a ""Youth Code"" chick because products please me. Anyone know of a good primer? Have tried the Age Perfect but don't like it...makes my face feel ""stiff."""
"I've been using this product for about a month now and it has done very little to improve the appearance of my dark spots. However, it has noticably reduced the appearance of my under-eye circles and some small visible veins on my face. I was curious about this unexpected benefit, so tried it on a bruise on my knee (the result of an accident, and very ugly). The appearance improved rapidly and, although the spot is still tender to the touch, the bruise is gone - in 9 days. Remarkable."
I use this in conjunction with the dark spot corrector. I'm so satisfied. Couldn't ask for anything more. I live in Florida so SPF 30 is NEEDED. This really works in correcting my skin tone too. I pick at my face very badly. This has fixed my tone and prevented my very frequent pimples.
I love the subtle shimmery effect this has on my skin. It smells great and feels great.
My dark spots are much lighter and some have completely disappeared. My face feels soft and bright.
"It's amazing,smooth non greasy cream.Love it!"
I bought this on a whim and have been using it for a month now. And it works!! I had two dark (age) spots on my face that I was concentrating on and now you can hardly see where they were. Great Product that does what it says it will do!
The first cream I have found that gives me the moisture I want without breaking out my skin! Haven't seen the lightening of spots quite yet but love the way it feels!
I have acne scars on my chin that were bothersome. I've been using the dark spot cream for about a month and my scars are nowhere as noticable as they were before i started using the cream.
"Been using it for years. I am 71 years old and my friends compliment my complexion. Greatly eliminates, soften or reduces dark spots."
Got it for mom as sun screen since she was traveling but she was amazed that it helped her lighten her dark spots and asked me order one more for her and myself
This is sunscreen to be used with the youth code serum darkspot corrector. I have been using this with the darkspot corrector for about one week. I'm hoping that I can see an improvement.
"I just recently purchased the product; tried it once and then tossed it. It is so greasy that I felt like I was suffocating. I don't use foundations, just a moisturizer. That said, even hours later my face still felt greasy and was shiny. I have never used L'Oreal products in the past and will certainly never try any again. A tub of lard couldn't feel any greasier than this stuff."
"Having high hopes for this product, I am disappointed with it after using it for 7-8months. I haven't seen much change in my dark spots. The smell isn't all that pleasant either. It smells like athletic sunblock. Only reason I'm still using it is because it has an SPF of 30. At least its doing something for me...if not what it was intended to do."
This cream makes me look young. Therr is no other like this. Makes me glow.
"I used day and night products for almost 12 weeks, and my skin continue the same."
I like it
my eyes got irritated by this. It gives burning sensation and eyes became red.
