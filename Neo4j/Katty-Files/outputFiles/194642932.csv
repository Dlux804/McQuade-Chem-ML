"My skin improvement after one week of use is amazing. Eminence is rich yet it is non-greasy, goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I believe the (very subtle) green tint evens out my reddish tone complexion. I have combination oily/dry skin and I'm using it under my foundation. I'm very happy with this product and its results."
"I first tried this moisturizer at a salon and wasn't sure if it was the facial that was making my skin look fresh and smooth, or the lotion. I bought the moisturizer and have continued to use it, religiously. It makes my skin soft, balanced in skin tone, and shine free. I'm truly happy with it. And I paid $20.00 less for it on this set than at the salon!"
Great moisturizer with SPF. It does it not leave my skin oily.
It accomplishes just what is promised by eminence.
Organic and great for sensitive skin. My husband swears by it and he's got great skin!
