"I love the ease of pulling out one of the cloths and just wetting and washing. Great foamy suds, exfoliates and cleans without drying your face! Just rinse out the suds when done washing, I use the same cloth to rinse my face. I wish they weren't so expensive though, but I do love the convience!"
"I have been using the Olay 4 in 1 daily face cleansing cloths ever since they came out, many, many years. Love the product and even though I am 59 yrs old people think I am 15 yrs younger. Have sensitive skin and these do not irritate my skin, remove makeup extremely well, and love the rich cleansing lather."
"I like these cloths much better than premoistened cloths. I like the way they suds up &, can be rinsed out to wash off the soap."
"These are the best for removing makeup. They clean and rinse all in one cloth. Leave my sensitive skin feeling clean,soft and smooth. Just wish shipping and handling was a little less."
"This is a refill, so cloths come in a package that cannot be resealed. Smell is great and makes washing face in the morning very easy. Face feels refreshed and clean when done. I have sensitive skin, so it was a little drying, but nothing a daily moisturizer cannot take care of. Will buy again."
"Love these! I've been using them for years and they do a great job. I only use them at night when I shower. They take the makeup right off and don't really dry my skin out. I have oily combo skin and these do dry me out a bit (like most if not all cleansers out there) but I put creams and serums on my face anyway so I really don't care. I LOVE they are scent free, which is what usually causes my skin to misbehave and break out. Great product. Wish they were cheaper but...."
Have already used this product and others com back to this one all the time
"Olay 4 in 1 daily Facial Cloths, Sensitive, 33 Ct does not come in 3 pack. One pack has 33 cloths. One pack for price listed. The pull down tab is not clear."
I expected a cloth perhaps damp with some type lotion or cleanser for the price. All it is a rough piece of cloth -dry- with instructions on wetting. Will not repurchase.
Olay face wash cloths worked for my oily skin without leaving it dry.
Cleans so well and doesn't burn your eyes. Great Product.
"I have very sensitive skin, and yet makeup will not all come off with soap, I have used these for years and they take off even Colorstay products, which can be difficult to fully remove. It leaves your face feeling softer after use as well, so it's not just removing makeup, but exfoliating to an extent as well."
"I ordered Olay 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cloths Sensitive - 33 CT. Walmart sustituted Gentle. The packaging on the Gentle box states that it is fragrance free, however, there is a scent. This also happened to me on Amazon. Basically, the item pictured and described as Sensitive is not what you will receive. It appears that the Olay 4-in-1 Daily Facial Cloths Sensitive - 33 CT product has been discontinued as it is not listed on the Olay site. That is unfortunate, as it is a good product."
I am 51 yrs young and I've been using Oil of Olay products since I was 20 and I don't look a day over 25!
"I have acne prone skin and have tried a many a makeup removers and wipes but this is by far the best thing i have tried. They are effective, quick , and gentle on my skin. They don't break me out or irritate my skin. And will absolutely buy again!"
Easy to use cleans well without drying your skin. Removes makeup easily.
"They are so convenient, especially for travel. They leave my skin feeling so soft! Love them!"
Easy to use very convienent doesn't leave skin feeling dry after use
"I've been using these daily facial cloths for years and I can't live without them. The lather is thick and creamy and leaves your face feeling soft, never dry. They're light and easy to pack when travelling. The Gentle Clean type are unscented and good for sensitive skin."
I was excited to try this product as I had heard good things from others. I am please to say they were right. I love these facial wipes. I have been using these for about a week now and I've noticed my face has cleared up almost completely. I also love the way is makes my face feel smooth and not so dry throughout the day. I will continue to buy these wipes from now on.
"These cloths clean my sensitive skin very well and leave my skin feeling clean, soft and not irritated as so many other products do. I will continue to purchase these daily facial cloths as I am very pleased with the way they make my face feel. Thank you for a good product!"
I don't have alot of time in the am to contribute to following steps in washing my face. I do that before bed. But to wash all the products I used before bed off in the morning I grab one of these towelettes as I step into the shower. Once you wet the cloth there is enough soap to lather up your face and neck making sure you get enough of the area clean. Then rinse the cloth to help clear your face of the soap. Viola! Im writing this review to enter into a contest @influenster #contest.
For years I've been a die hard fan of neutrogena makeup wipes to remove makeup. However on a recent road trip I decided to give these a try. They remove makeup just as well but leave the skin feeling really fresh. I just wish they were a little less expensive. (I paid for these with my own money but my review is for a contest) #contest @influenster
"I used to use Noxema as a cleanser, but than I switched to Olay cloths. I have used an Olay moisturizer for over 20 yrs & decided I should use an Olay moisturizer. I love these cloths, because I can take them on the go. I also cut the cloths in fours to save money & not so much waste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These cloths are very soft to the touch and lather up nicely. They are perfect for removing makeup and save your wash cloths from stains and wear and tear. They are great for travel as you don't have to worry about liquid restrictions at security checks. They are also great to have in your purse for a midday freshening.

This is the best cleanser cloth that is out there for sensitive skin. I have been using this product for over 15 years and would never use anything else. It cleanses my skin and also hydrates it. Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Oil of Olay products since I was 19. I find the cleansing cloths are an all in one cleanser and toner. I am 65 years old and I find keeping my skin looking its best important at any age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the clean feeling these wonderful cloths provide. They not only remove all traces of makeup but leave my skin feeling clean, smooth and refreshed. I love the convenience they provide for airplane travel so you don't have to worry about packing small liquid face wash in your carry on bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried these not to long ago. I had been on a search for awhile but my skin is very funny. These cloths worked great. My face didn't break out afterwards and it was left feeling smooth and silky. A must have for your beauty regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Take one or two of these dry, pre-soaped cloths and face cream/body lotion for a sink bath anywhere. I have used them after biking. All you need is cold water. Also take them when staying with friends/relatives so you don't wreck their washcloths with mascara"
"I like these face cloths, I find especially useful traveling as they are not a liquid, lightweight, take up no room as I only take the number needed and I dispose in trash when used. BUT, for everyday I found that my Chanel foaming cleanser is actually cheaper to use. Even though it cost $45 to purchase, it way out last $45 worth of these Olay cloths and far exceeds the quality."
I love these cloths & haven't used anything else in quite a few years. The Sensitive Skin cloths leave my face feeling soft with no greasy feeling. I've tried other brands but none of them clean as thoroughly & gently as Olay's cloths. I feel it's the best product & value on the market.
"I have sensitive skin that is still acne-prone despite being nearly 30 and have gotten my first fine lines. If I'm not cautious with skin care and makeup products, I will break out easily. I have an oily T-zone and dry, flaky areas around my mouth, cheeks, and under brows. What I like about these cloths are: there is nothing irritating and they don't burn, they exfoliate gently but thoroughly and remove all makeup and dry flakes, and they don't cause acne breakouts. They don't leave skin feeling tight or oily. I will repurchase these."
I've been using Oil of Olay for years but am now having trouble finding the face cloths I've been using. I like the normal to dry - they clean my skin but don't leave it dry at all. I'm 66 and I get compliments on my skin all the time and I give Olay all the credit.
"These are phenomenal! They are deep cleansing and yet gentle. Not only do they remove all make-up (from the lightest to heaviest applications), but they give your skin just enough exfoliating action to reveal a bright and healthy complexion. I cut mine in half so one pack lasts me about 2 months - very affordable! This is a staple in my skin care regime throughout the year!"
i use several of your products but i'm only reviewing the sensitive skin washing clothes. i travel with these and use them daily. i have very sensitive skin and have a lot of trouble with most cleansers and make-up products. your products do not bother my sensitive skin and makes it glow even at my age. each time you come out with a new product i look forward to trying them.
"I believe is one of the best products to clean your face ! I use it every night and it removes all make up no matter how much I have put on my face, I absolutely will buy it again."
"i was so excited to finally find a refill of my Olay makeup remover. However, i was extremely disappointed with the quality of the wipes now. too many holes and mot enough wipe I wish I had known the quality had dropped so much"
I've tried other facial wipes and these are the best. I just love the way my skin feels after I use the wipes. I don't really use a lot of makeup but they remove makeup very well. Thank you for another amazing Olay product!!
"I loved the wipes labeled gentle. I have very sensitive skin and they were wonderful. When I mail ordered more, I got the gentle sensitive version. I don't know if they are exactly the same. But, so far they have been as kind to my skin."
This is by far the best facial wash cloth. The cloth is the right size. The dry cloths are convenient and lathers very well. Leaving your face feeling fresh and clean.
"I have been looking for a good cleansing routine, My face tends to breakout with nearly anything. I love these and they leave my face feeling so fresh and clean!"
I have oily/combo skin and I absolutely love these! Just a little water and a whole lot of suds. My face feels so clean afterwards! They are a little pricey but def worth it.
"I've been using this product for trips, i need not to worry when I take the whole box it does not weigh more than 3 oz. My face feels so smooth and refreshed everytime I use this product."
"When I'm tired and just want to get into my bed, these cloths have made the difference between sleeping with my makeup on - or doing what's right! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I like about this product is that it goes on so easy. It is cool and refreshing to the face. Leave your skin feeling soft, moisturized and clean. Would recommend to all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these cloths because they are not only great at cleansing my face, they are also perfect for travel. I don't have to worry about a leaking or broken bottle of cleanser in my luggage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best product I have found for extremely sensitive skin. Cleans well and with no burning or irritation. Also works great to remove eye make-up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love how they make my skin feel. Refreshing. They are convenient to pack in my bag when going on a trip. No worries about spills or leaks in my luggage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using these cloths for many years and I don't use soap on my face at all. There are many times that I've been told that I certainly don't look my age which is 70. Thanks, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These cleansing cloths are great! I have been using them since they first came out. Always great results and leave my skin soft and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is super sensitive, and this wipe took off all of my makeup with one wipe with no irritation. It even took off my pencil eyeliner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wouldn't travel without my Olay facial cloths. So easy for camping or anywhere you travel. One less liquid to worry about and they leave my face feeling clean and refreshed! Love them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love these cloths. They allow me to get all the day washed off and my skin feels smooth and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great for every day uses without drying out my skin. I absolutely love that I can use this quick without much hassle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cloths are great. You use once and throw away. Skin specialists say you should never use a washcloth more than once. I don't want to do more laundry so these facial cloths are just the ticket. I love that they are fragrance free too.
Awesome! I needed to find cleaner that removed makeup and this does the job! Skin doesn't feel dry and it isn't red and irritated. Feels soft and refreshed. LOVE LOVE LOVE
i use these everyday. my skin has never looked or felt as good as it does since i have been using these daily cloths. i am 62 and look a lot younger thanks to these cloths.
I love these Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths. I use the sensitive skin formula. They are textured and super easy to use. They remove my make up easily and does not feel like there is any residual make up left on my face.
"I love these, they are perfect for a post work relax time. Helps clear pores and excess oils."
I use the cloths ever night. It keeps my skin very clear and moist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love the ease of washing my face 2x a day does a great job of cleaning the face and pores [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
