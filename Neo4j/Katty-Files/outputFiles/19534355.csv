"Olay's Daily Cleansing Cloths are an amazing product. You start by adding water to the cloth to activate the cleansing lather. There is an amazing amount of lather and bubbles. It removed all of my makeup including my waterproof mascara. When finished removing make up, simply rinse the cloth and use it to remove the cleaner from your face and neck. Olay Cleansing cloths leave your skin glowing, clean and hydrated after use. I highly recommend them."
I purchased this about 3 weeks ago and with my sentive skin I wasn't sure I'd be able to use it. To my surprise it cleaned my face without any burning or sting . My face felt amazing after using the Olay Facial clothes. I've had no allergic reaction at all and my face feels fresh and clean.
I love these cloths. They are difficult to find in drugstores. This style is dry and easier to take along when I travel as opposed to the facial cloths that are dampened with a cleansing agent. They smell lovely and clean well. Walmart offers them at the best price.
Excellent
I purchased these based on the reviews and the face that they have grape seed in them.I have been using them for just over a week twice a day.I can notice a difference in my face already. Better texture and I now have a glow back to my skin! Thank you Olay for these fabulous cloths. I will be purchasing again.
I got a sample of these in my Summer Beauty Box and I really liked it. I am going to get a box the next time I am in WM and see if they work out long term. I use products like these to remove as much makeup as I can before I use a cleansing balm + foaming cleanser.
These are not my favorite. They lather up so much and leave so much cleanser on my face that I feel like I have to go back and rinse that off. They're nice in a pinch and would probably be good for travel but I'm not a fan and definitely won't be using them regularly.
"I have been using these cloths for quite sometime, but with my most recent purchase, the cloth is coarse compared to the previous ones. I have seen reviews complaining about this issue as well. I will still use the product, but am not happy with the change in quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have used the Olay facial cloths for years and always feel like it leaves my skin smooth and clean. Wouldn't use any other brand.
"I love that this starts dry and once you get it wet, it lathers but has a scrubby side to get my eyeliner off! Used this on my trip to Oklahoma and I was so glad it worked! Didn't have to pack a bottle that could explode in my suitcase!"
These are the best for traveling! Since they come dry and you have to add water it's easy to grab a few to keep handy in your purse. They are gentle on your skin and are great in removing all kinds of makeup.
Wife & I use this product every night before bed time and have for years. Great product. Order got here in two days and well packaged. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The facial cloths do a great job of removing my makeup and cleaning my face. I don't have to buy a separate eye makeup remover because, it even removes my mascara."
"I have used Olay facial cloths for years. This is the first time I have purchased them on line. My order came 3 days before it was scheduled, so I was happy. I will order online again."
These are my favorites!!!! I love antioxidants. I love that these are dry so they travel very well. When you are packing for a couple of weeks and having to haul your stuff around every little bit helps. These are a tiny bit lighter than the hydrated wipes.
"The best ! i take them on vacation, with the built in soap on the washcloth i can easly wash my face anytime. ( i brought them to Italy, France etc ) how handy after a long plane ride to freshonn up so easliy before i land. ( i just put some in a little baggie ) cant live with out these, i use them everynight."
So I was sent a sample of these and a two other products to try. I was big on using these types of products. But these wipes have changed my mind on them. I like that it came out dry and then it was went was able to lather it up. I felt there was enough product to make my face feel fresh and clean. It was also super easy to rinse off my face. I plan on buying these to use as part of my new daily routine.
Does not dry out my skin
"This is my tried and true go-to face wash. This is the only one that keeps my dry skin and acne in check. The fact that Olay has made these so affordable, and in refill form, is the icing on the cake."
"I recieved this in a walamrt beauty box and was really impressed with it! I love how easy it is, you just add water to cloth and it removes all makeup and dirt from face and makes your face feel super clean, smooth and radiant! Plan on purchasing!"
"As an RVer, I love facial cloths activated by water. They store well and won't dry out. Also one cloth can handle an entire shower for me, so I don't need to lug soap and washcloth with me to the campground showers. Very convenient, and the Olay is nice for my skin, too."
"I love how cloth lathered up well, made my skin so soft and my face felt extra clean. It would have been nice to get one then one cloth to sample so I could see how well thry work using more then one day in a row. Thank you would love to sample more play products."
I received this as a sample in my Walmart beauty box subscription. Would highoh recommend. All in one. Very durable cloth. The cloth suds up very well. 66 cloths for the price is petty amazing because I think somewhere else was charging $2.50 for just the sample one. Great deal and great product.
"Love, love, love these because they are filled with mild soap that makes suds with a small amount of warm water. The cloths are large enough to do the job. I rinse them out when I'm finished cleaning off make-up and use them to wipe away the soap and just finish the job! Great product at a reasonable price for what you get."
"I liked that they were very large. This enables me to use it on my entire face and wipe off every bit of everything. It was moist enough but not too moist. I am not sure I would buy this again due to the economical factor of using throw away wipes, but if I needed to have something on hand like this I would think of this brand first."
"The Olay cleansing cloth was really a good cleanser. It wasn't harsh on my skin. It smelled good. And, most importantly, it really cleaned my skin, even my pores. It was a little difficult to get the cloth to foam up, but once I did, I had no other problems. I'd recommend this product highly."
"The Olay Hydrating Wipe is a great daily freshener and makeup remover. I really like that your makeup stays on the cloth and doesn't stain my favorite clothes at home. They are also great to remove all of my makeup, even my mascara. These wipes are great for my skin as well, leaving my face soft and moisturized."
I recieved this as a sample but I really liked it. It was super easy to use. It lathered up extremely well. There was tons of product in the rag so there was loads of bubbles an cleaner to get the job done. My face felt pretty clean after using it. I was satisfied.
"Amazing smell and quality! They last a really long time. They got the job done with no need for harsh rubbing or scrubbing. Makeup comes right off and it doesnt sting at all near the eyes. Very effective, and I continue to purchase it. Definitely reccomend."
"These are great wipes to bring when traveling or if you want a break from the liquid product. I will say that my favorite wipes are actually the Shea butter wipes, while my mom uses the original hydration wipes. No shade to this - they're wonderful! Just make sure that you would benefit from this type first."
"I received samples of Olay Daily Facial Cleansing Clothes from Olay's website and in my Walmart Winter Beauty Box. Both samples that I received were completely dry. I have purchased wipes similar to these and they are almost too wet, drippy. But these were dusty dry. Cue the tumbleweed. These are my own opinions."
"I used the Olay Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing Cloths w/ Grapeseed Extract, Makeup Remover, and it wasn't the best facial wash I've used. After wetting the cloth and removing the makeup, the cloth was a bit harsh but it did scrub well. But the actual facial wash that was in the cloth wasn't that good in my opinion. It did what it needed to do but with time and effort needed. I would recommend for someone who already uses a cloth product to give it a try."
"Ir removed all makeup even stubborn mascara! I loved how the wipes were not too small, large enough for your whole face and then some. Also, it did not leave my face feeling tight or dry afterward and at my age, that is important. I would recommend it and I will buy it. Just wish it was a little less expensive."
"When you are using this to clean your face, take off your makeup, it feels very nice. About 5 minutes after rinsing this off my face (I rinsed 2x) my face felt completely stripped of natural oils and tighter than tight and uncomfortable. I ended up putting a pretty large amount of a serum on my face so I could go to bed and be comfortable."
The Olay Daily Facial cleansing cloths are really good. I love how they are textured it feels like they are really getting the job done. I was able to remove all my makeup with one cloth and it left my face feeling fresh and clean. Most makeup removing cloths irritate my skin but this didn't. I was very impressed with this.
"I haven't used a facial cleansing wipe in years and this sample got me back to purchasing. I love how I can use the wipe to soap up and wash, then rinse the soap out to use the wipe to rinse. I've already pirchased 2 boxes since getting the sample in my Walmart Beauty Box."
"I don't know if mine was defective, but it didn't get very sudsy when I added water and lathered it up, so I couldn't clean my whole face with it. It smells really good and I'll probably buy a pack to try them out again. They seem like I could fall in love with them if they had more product on them."
"I've bought many brands of cleansing cloths over the years, but this one seems to have a little something extra. Maybe it's the Grape seed extract, or the extra moisturizers that Olay puts in their stuff, but whatever it is, it makes the lather very soft, creamy and fluffy. I loved my sample so much that I bought some. Occasionally I lather my face up and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing and it leaves my face very soft and smooth."
I recently went on a weekend trip and packed my usual double cleanse products along with one of the Olay Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing Cloths w/ Grapeseed Extract. I had never tried them before and one evening I was far too tired to go through my usual skin care steps. One cloth removed an entire face of makeup (and I wear a lot of makeup!) without leaving my skin stripped. I look forward to purchasing these for upcoming trips!
"I have been using the Olay daily facial cloths for years. They are the best for removing makeup with ease, even waterproof mascara. I usually go in with another cleanser after just to make sure I didn't miss anything but the cloths do a good job on it's own."
"I really loved how well this lathered up. It did an amazing job of removing my make up.The cloths were very sturdy and did not fall apart. My face felt wonderfully clean. However, my face did not feel moisturized. I use an Olay face wash that works in conjunction with my moisturizer. I want the same properties in my face wash that these clothes did not provide. I would defiantly use this for traveling! However, I will stick to my regular Olay face wash and moisturizer for everyday use."
I like Olay products and do use some but this towlett all in one cleaner I saw no difference than just using a already wet cloth. This product might be good for traveling so a person does not have to lug around bottles. But just for everyday use I personally would not purchase them. I felt like I had to rinse my face several times to get the yuk feeling off. I had no irritation.
"I had high hopes for this product because I really like the idea of having a cleansing cloth that I can wet and use and rinse and then throw away. I was not impressed with this product, however. I found the scent offputting. There was too much cleanser to rinse easily. It did not feel good against my skin. I am really surprised because I normally love Olay products."
"Now this cleansing cloth works great. I was blown away by the amount of suds that came out when I got it wet. It left my face so soft and moisturized and completely removed my makeup. The scent is nice a soft and I'm not a fan of scented cleansers, this one is nice. I just have to get more of them."
I bought some of these before but must not have been same thing. In fact I still have some and they look the same. I love them for traveling. Like to visit someone or camping. I hate having makeup on and getting it on their wash clothes. Hotels too. And these don't dry out my skin like most do.
"I received this in my Beauty Box subscription. Easy to use, wonderful smell, feels great on my skin. Definitely does what it says. Removes make up, has very light exfoliating properties so you're not just wiping cleanser on and off of your face. Great value for the price!"
First time to ever use this product and it blew my mind how well it removed my makeup. This was all day makeup plus touch ups before dinner! Even my mascara came off easily. This has lather for days and didn't irritate my skin. Love it!
The only thing I would change is make the cloth a little bigger.
"Easy to use when plenty of water is available. Lots of sudds and soothing. For me a good alternative when traveling or after the gym. Left my skin feeling fresher and cleaner, though not dry, than the usual wipes I would use after a work-out. I have mature, formerly oily skin that now tends to lean to the drier side in cooler temps."
"I'm always excited to see products that I love show up in my beauty box, and this is one of those items. They are great for my skin; they leave it feeling and smelling amazing. I've tried other cleansing wipes including expensive ones, but like all of Olay's products, I find they work better than those five to ten times more expensive."
Olay Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing Cloths are great for travel or on-the-go because they are dry and you add water and lather when needed. It's nice to not use the hotel washrag or carry around wet items in a gym bag or tote. There are some times when you just need to wash your face with soap and water without making a huge mess and laundry and this does the job!
This seems like a no brainer. I've used other national brands of this type.
"And liked them a lot. This particular product kept rolling into a ball in my hand, instead of smoothing over my skin. I would never buy this, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
"I loved the idea of dry wipes that can work as facewash - it is one less bottle you need to bring when flying with only cabin bag. The wipe was gentle, foaming and cleansing, it is basically a facewash in dry form. It also did not break me out, as my skin is sensitive and tends to break out from lots of stuff."
"I won't use it everyday, but definitely will keep some with me."
"The material used to make the Olay Daily Facials daily hydrating cloth is just right to remove all the day's grime and hydrate your skin at the same time.Now that is fantastic,and so easy to use! They are good for a wake up wash in the morning,an afternoon refreshing and an evening deep clean.With these clothes you do not have to worry about over washing nor drying out your skin as most soaps will do.Go ahead,give them a try!"
"I absolutely love these for the days where I want to wear foundation, translucent powder, blush, highlighter, eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, etc. These get off all of my make up without having to use anything else. They are gentle on my sensitive skin and super easy to use."
I used to use the ones for infants when my son was a baby and now they come out with these and I love them too.
Easy to use doesn't make a mess and takes off all my makeup without drying out my skin or making it feel tight. My only complaint is that they are expensive.
I love these facial wipes it cleans my face well and get off all my make up but my face is still moisturized and soft after
Love this product! Makes my face feel tingly and super clean after using. Provides substantial soap in each towlette.
I have been using these wipes for years and have not found any other product that works for me. Whoever the person was in the reviews that said they were completely dry wipes.... you clearly don't understand how to use this product. SMH
I am so glad that only sent me a sample of this it really is the best very good at removing makeup moisturizing my skin and cleansing. I would recommend this product
Very nice to wash face when you are in a hurry or dont want to get out a bunch of other soaps or cleansers. Very nice lather and cloth is durable not cheap and unlikely to fall apart.
This stuff cleans so nicely no matter how soft it feels. What I mean is for the nice soft texture you would think it doesn't clean as much as an exfoliating face wipe but it does and even with a softer texture!
The best cleanser cloth to remove make-up and grime. My husband also uses on his face in the shower. Love Olay Mist for face and OLay Regenerist. Great products.
"These wipes are amazing! I tried them from a sample box and fell in love immediately. All you do is add water and, BAM, SUPER SUDS! They leave my skin feeling smooth, and clean. Buy these!"
"I love these! They clean, exfoliate, tone and moisturize while also gently removing makeup. I would recommend this product because it performs as promised."
"I loved this sample. As a woman who wears makeup I need to remove it and these are soft, remove all left over traces and I have purchased these for myself and my daughters. great product."
"Probably the easiest face wash cloth ever....I use the scrubby side to get rid of my makeup, rinse my face, then use the smooth side to cleanse my face. Works really well and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin!"
Olay Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing is my new facial wash cloths. I have been using an off brand that sting my eyes. But not Olay cleaning cloths. Love the clean smell also!
"The Olay Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing Cloths were wonderful. You just add a little water and the cloths got sudsy quickly. They cleaned my face well and my skin felt soft, not dry, afterward. I'd recommend this product to anyone."
"I received a sample of Olay Daily Facials in my Walmart winter beauty box. This cloth is easy to use, doesn't irritate my already problematic skin, and leaves my skin feeling clean, and soft."
"This is a wonderful product. My face has never looked so consistently clear. As I have been approaching 50 years old I have been prone to cystic acne, but since I started using these my skin has become softer, smoother and clearer."
"I travel often and can't use any type of liquid remover, but these wipes are just what you need if you are always on the go. They aren't greasy, just wet enough to get the job done. No odors, if in a hurry, you don't even need to rinse after use."
Love This cleansing clothes just put water on them and they make and amazing job are supper gentle whit the skin and in a very affordable price . They clean all of the makeup live a nice and smudge skin
"It really worked on removing make up and mascara. Mascara is the hardest, but it came right off. Easy to use, no perfumes. Made my face feel smooth, clean and fresh"
"I loved this product. Not only did it hydrate my dry skin, it removed my make up with ease. It left my skin feeling great. This was my first time trying a product with Grapeseed Extract. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
Hands down for olay I love a lot of their products and this one is one of them . it hydrates while cleaning nice packaging as well. It totally meet my expectations.
These wipes really surprised me. They were very compact but delivered amazing results. My face feels super clean after using these. Plus they completely remove all of my make-up. I willill be buying a lot of these.
I love these wipes. They are so easy to use and leave your face fresh. These face wipes do not dry out your skin and leaves it feeling clean. You can throw these in your bag and go.
"I use oil of Olay as steps and I found this very good to use as a first step for removing makeup, I will be purchasing this product and using it my first step to remove my makeup."
I received the Olay cleansing cloth sample in my Walmart box. I love a cleansing cloth to get rid of makeup and dirt from the face. The grape seed extract makes the face feel soft and clean.
"This product is easy to use and saves steps in your morning routine, if you are short on time. I like that this product offers cleansing and exfoliating properties in one step."
"These Olay Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths are amazing! They remove all my makeup, including stubborn eyeliner and mascara. It leaves my skin soft and feeling moisturized!"
"This product is awesome! I have oily, easily irritated skin. This didn't leave any excess oil or residue. My skin was very soft and refreshed. The fact that it can be used every day is a plus."
"I tucked this Olay cleansing cloth into my gym cloth and Loved the way it made my face feel afterwards. I love the all in one product that this cloth provides, so simple."
I like these they make washing off your make up easy but I generally do that at home and don't feel the need to spend money on cloths that you throw away but they're great for traveling
These cloths claim to remove all make up including mascara and it did not remove my makeup very well and dried my skin out. I'm glad I received a sample of this rather than purchasing an entire box. Will not be buying this product.
These are worth the money if you don't really want to deal with a bottle of liquid. You'll never spill this product which is pretty awesome. But I feel like it's too pricey. For me at least.
"I got a sample of these cleansing cloth in my most recent Walmart Beauty Box and I love it, I will definitely buy more. It is the perfect solution for cleaning your face, pretty much a one-step thing, super easy to use."
This product is amazing. I was able to take it on a trip recently. It's going to be awesome for trips instead of the wet ones. I travel a lot and it will work great.
"I normally do not use make up wipes but I like these because they are sturdy and when I travel, they have enough moisture and do not leave skin feeling rough or dry. Summer time, they are to heavy for me so it depends on your skin type."
These cloths are super handy to have and work great. After removing makeup with them I used a toner and did not get any more dirt off my face. Will be purchasing these.
"I received a sample of the Olay Daily Facials in my Beauty Box. I loved what a great job it did in removing all of my makeup! My skin didn't feel dry afterward, just clean."
"This little towelet was very easy to use. It was nice because the facial cleaner was already in it. All i had to do is add water. It removed my make with easy. It didn't dry out my face, which is nice. It will be great for traveling."
And the I was trying to getting off my my yak facemakeup and then it's was actually work for me but of course the eye lashes it kinda hard to remove but I was still give this item bug thumb up for it
I liked very much all the products that came in the box but I would like them to add more makeup products. Because I am a makeup artist and I would like to experience as products.
"I love how it took my make-up off so easily, without harding rubbing!! The smell is mild. I would recommend it to anyone who want a fresh clean face and no residue."
I feel like it made my skin look amazing after the shower. It was soft and moisturized and looked glowy. I actually got 2 uses out of the cloth. Lots of suds.
"I have used these for years. I have sensitive skin and the ones for that skin type are wonderful. Easy to use, your face feels clean, and after rinsing well, you face is ready for your favorite moisturizer for nighttime."
"These are now a daily part of my facial routine. The ease of use is spectacular.. just wet, wash and rinse the cloth then use the same to rinse your face. It really is a miracle. My face is so soft now .. no more dry skin for me."
I liked the fact that the clothes are dry and that you can wet them from any source of water. They would be good for camping and traveling. I would highly recommend these to anyone
It's and ok product but you have to wet it and then lather it up. I feel you could probably get better use of buying a bottle of skin cleanser. I guess it could be good if your on the go or travel a lot.
"I loves these cloths, I use one every evening to cleanse my face. They are especially great when traveling, as they are easy to stick in a bag or purse and are very light."
Expensive. Not for use with my overly dry skin. No hydrating feel at all. I was surprised as Olay is a very good brand. Didn't remove my make-up just streaks. tugged on my dry skin. I didn't find anything special just disappointing.
This was different than other cleansing cloths I have used in the past and I was pleasantly surprised . I really liked it and it left my skin feeling clean and soft. easy to travel with and use on the go. I will be buying this product!
I wouldn't buy this product in the store. It was actually too small to completely remove all my makeup (face and eye) and I actually had to use the product I normally use (baby wipe) as a follow-up to finish taking off all my makeup.
The Olay daily facial hydrating cleansing cloths clean and rinse well. I would recommend them to others. The only thing I would change is to make them thicker.
"Have not tried products yet. Not too keen on samples that come in paper pkgs. Make a mess, typically and sometimes hard to open. I do like the wet skin creme that came in a resealable tube! Would recommend the product I tried to a friend."
The cloth removed even waterproof mascara. It had a very nice scent and did not leave a noticeable residue on my skin. Overall a good product but not very hydrating. Left my face a bit dry and definitely needing moisturizer after use.
"This not only helped clean the makeup off of my face, it made my skin soft. I have been able to reuse the cloth with other cleansers as well. I love that it didn't make a huge, wet mess based on the size of the cloth."
I Love this brand and didn't put it pass them to have made an excellent makeup remover wipe. And the fact that it's not wet from the get go makes it a perfect travel wipe without fearing the mess of a wet wipe in the makeup bag. Highly recommend!
Got a sample & when I first opened was really confused pulling out a dry face wipe. After reading the instructions wet the wipe and it was amazing!! It took all my makeup off & no need to use any other cleaners like some face wipes.
"I liked this product! Olay Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing Cloths. They are great for travel, but best of all, they take the makeup off, and don't leave my face feeling so dried out!"
"The Olay Daily Facial Cleansing Cloth removes your facial makeup off with one swipe. The grapeseed extract leaves you with a tightened feeling, and smells great."
"I use this for my make up remover and it was wonderful, it made my face feel so soft and got all the make up off, and got all the dry skin off my face and it was very gentle on my face"
"The were quite easy to use and left your skin feeling clean and nourished. Just take the cloths out of the package wet and use. I personally liked that the cloth multitasks. cleans, hydrates and is great for your skin. Definitely recommended."
#WalmartBeautyBox These wipes are great. You wet them then wash your face. You rinse the wipe and use it to wipe off the cleanser. Its like two wipes in one.
I really like the convenience of these but the cloth has a odd texture that I just didn't like on my skin.
"All in all not enough of deterrent to give it a unfair review. Try it for yourself,definitely great for traveling."
I have used facial cleansers before and not felt like I got all the makeup completely off. Olay daily facial hydrating cleansing cloths get the makeup off in one swipe and leave your face feeling hydrated and clean.
"I really like these wipes. They clean my face very nicely, plenty of product on the wipe once you wet it and they left my skin feeling clean but not tight and dry."
I have used many different facial wipes and I must say these are at the top of the list. They removed all of my makeup and are very moisturizing with a nice scent
I loved the Olay Daily Facial Cleansing cloth. It was easy to use and it left my skin so clean and soft. I would recommend this product to others and I intend to buy it for myself.
You cannot go wrong with a product to buy Olay you just put a little water on this wipe and wash your face with it it leaves you feeling clean and moisturize like you have just put moisturizing cream on your face
I found this product to remove most of my makeup. I still had a difficult time getting my mascara to be totally removed; that is the reason for the four stars.
"This Olay cleansing cloth takes makeup off better than my other face cleansing cloths. I can tell afterwards when I used my toner, the cotton ball was makeup free after this Olay cleansing cloth usage."
I like to use the ready make-up removal pads and have v
"bought a lot of different ones but this is so nice, no stinging or burning and lovely soft scent and soft skin!"
"These wipes were wonderful. They are easy to use - just wet and go. They took off all of my eye makeup, cleaned my face well and left me feeling soft and clean. They also smell lovely."
All you do is wet the cloth and it foams up to clean your face. Removes make up quickly and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft. I've already bought more.
The cloth removed even waterproof mascara. It had a very nice scent and did not leave a noticeable residue on my skin. Overall a good product but not very hydrating. Left my face a bit dry and definitely needing moisturizer after use.

i know we're supposed to wash our face before bed but do i want to do it? no. why? because i'm lazy. this cleansing cloth makes washing my face easy. it cleans and gently exfoliates so i can go to bed with a clean face.
This Olay cloth even took waterproof mascara off! It was easy to use- just a little water and it lathered up. It left my face soft and cleansed really well.
"Greeetings I only had one cloth to use for 1 cleansing but I thought this left my face feeling clean, hydrated and smooth I will purchase this sometime in future"
"I can't express how much I love these facial cloths! I have combination normal/oily skin with large pores and these work so great for balancing my skin. Fine lines are less noticable and my pores are less visible. I love how they lightly exfoliate my skin. I use them every night and love how refreshed and smooth my skin feels. Give them a try, you'll LOVE them!"
"I received sample from Olay and this is amazing. Sample is small dry wipe and you just make it wet and lather it to get it bubbly and oh my!!! Removed all my make up and left my face so nice and comfortable, Clean just perfect! What a smart idea! The only thing is that I don't like products that make a lot of trash, and this would be one of them, but I am so glad I got to dry it, if they make just powder cleanser that would be perfect!"
These are by far the smartest invention ever I like to stock up on make up wise because I use them daily and I always seem to notice that they dry out before you can even use them which really sucks because make up wipes are not cheap so these are so smart that you have to wipe them to use so that way they dont dry out amazing concept and I highly recommend theseOLAY Daily Facial Hydrating Cleansing Cloths W Grapeseed Extract Makeup Remover
I prefer these over make up wipes any day the box may be small but its loaded with plenty of cloths. All you have to do is add water and boom the magic begins. I got a sample in a bag from the hospital after having my daughter and havent stopped using them since I immediately bought a box of my own
"This product was great, it easily removed my makeup, it didn't take much to remove all of my makeup either. After removing my making my skin was left to feel very hydrated. It was mostly soft but felt slightly harsh when actually removing my makeup, however it was good value for money."
"Olay products are some of the best, especially these facial clothes"
These do the job and are less expensive than my old brand.
I love this product! It left my skin clean and hydrated. I will definitely be buying this again!
"Have always loved these. Feel nice, get all make up off easily."
"I love how these clean your face, leaving it feeling refreshed and smooth."

Olay daily facials cloth ladders well it did a great job removing my mascara and makeup it also leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth

"This is the best way to keep dryness away, especially in the winter. I tried everything and this was my saving grace. No complaints whatsoever."
"The cleansing cloths worked just fine, but I would probably use them in my travel bag, not for daily use. I'm an old penny-pincher though."

This takes off my makeup and is gentle on my super sensitive skin. I will be purchasing this now that my same is out.
I got this product as a sample through my Walmart beauty box and lived it. I took my makeup off so easily . Left my face feeling clean and fresh.
I thought this was disappointing. It did not remove makeup as well as the store brand wipes I usually use.
"it was definitely a good cleanser, although i did feel a bit of a tingle, not sure i would use them every day but it is a good product"
olay is a good brand but the cloth after getting wet was to thin and tore but left the skin clean and soft
"They were easy to use, cloth stayed intact. Soaped up well. Made my face squeaky clean. I really like the product will buy in the future."
"this is good for cleaning your makeup off first, but i always use a washcloth with warm water afterward."

"I used this for the first time yesterday morning, and my skin is still soft the next afternoon. Will be buying this again!!"
I tried something like this along time ago and loved it! Easy to use and will definitely purchase in the future!

I have been using these facial cloths since they were born!! I absolutely love them and will use them for the rest of my life!!!
"different kind of cleanser, I don't think I would purchase, but would work well for people who prefer a dry cloth to clean your face."
"The. Cleansing clothes. They left my skin feeling soft and clean, also removing the makeup completely. I would recommend buying this product."
"I've used these before, so I was excited to get one in my beauty box. Work well and are really easy to use."
"The wipes are convenient. I usually use them at work, especially during the summer. They foam up nicely. They are gentle, but definitely get out the dirt and oil."
Wipe soaps up very nicely and I did like the way my skin felt after using the cloth. It did not remove my mascara. Did use all over face and eyes. I may purchase and use for traveling.
Absolutely love these little babies. the smell of the product itself is amazing and it actually works really well to remove makeup and moisturizer at the same time.

"Used to take off my make up and worked pretty good to remove my mascara. Suds up very well. Felt pretty nice on my skin, but was a little rough on my cheeks."
The best make up remover. it does not dry my face out after I am done using it. I would recommend it to anyone. I have no make up on y face when I am done.
"Very effective. It is easy to travel with, since it's not messy. Definitely easy to use. Better than I expected. The best part is that you don't have to worry about it drying out. Very affordable. Can't go wrong with extra cloths in the container."
I thought these cloths would be a little difficult to use but it's not. It creates a great foam that makes you face feel super clean without stripping the oil from your face. I really like this for when have to travel.
"I use these cleansing cloths because they not only remove makeup, but they exfoliate, toner, cleanses and hydrated your face. They're smooth and not harsh on the skin. I recommend this product."
Love love love these wipes. Just get them wet and wash your face. Best makeup and skin cleaning wipes ever. This will be a beauty staple in my skin care routine.
Cleans well
love it
Great product.
"I have used these cleansing cloths since they came out. Yes, I have tried others either because they where cheaper or I had a coupon and I always ended up being sorry. I always end up going back to Olay. These cloths take off my makeup and the grime of daily living without taking my skin with it and that is very important to me especially since I am no longer a spring-chicken. After use, my skin is clean and soft. I highly recommend them"
This was very useful when I was traveling and I liked that it was easy to use.

I enjoy the feel of them and the moisture they bring to my skin.
I loved this facial cloth it makes your skin feel clean.
Great for removing makeup and making your skin feel fresh!!

I like these. Although they can be expensive and you can't recyle them.
I love Olay anyways! I use these every night to take off my makeup!

They are great.. Just put under water and become soapy washcloth.
There's nothing special about this cloth. Not satisfied with the results
Will definitely purchase these!!! So easy and clean very well!
I absolutely loved how this product washed away all of my eye make up.
Thought that this would help the dry skin on my forehead but it's just like other skin products. But cleans very nice
This predicts smells great and gently removes all makeup and impurities. It does not irritate sensitive skin.
It has a scent I dont enjoy and doesn't irritate sensitive skin but will continue to use an alternative. Just personal preference.
Very good product. It didnt dry out my skin. Left it feeling clean and smelling good. Great for every day use.
I use this every night to clean my face and it is so good. It is a little pricey but it is worth it.
"This is the perfect type of makeup wipe! Not only does it smell good, but it also takes off all makeup while refreshing your face! Very effective!"
These are the great. Been using these for 6 months and I'm so in love with them. Price on these are great.
Really love the product very soothing and refreshing results are great skin feels really nice after use..
This is the only brand facial wipes that I have been able to use without breaking out. It's so nice take all my make up off with one step
"I love these cloths. I used them every night to remove any makeup that is on my face. They work so well and really take it all off. Once when we had a power loss from a Hurricane, I used them for my showers at the YMCA... Good product"
"I love love love these cant say enough about them. Perfect for my sensitive skin. Can't go with them , perfect makeup remover. I love all Olay products!"
I have been using the Normal-Dry Daily Facial Cleansing Cloths since the mid 90's. This is truly a fantastic product that I live by. I constantly get compliments on my skin...how young I look. A die hard fan of these!
"Have used these cleansing cloths/tissues for years and loved them. Couldn't find them for a few months but then found some and bought 6 months worth. I am unhappy with the new product! The smell is horrible, like a chemical smell. Almost bug spray. And do not like the new look or feel. I use these every day. Not as user friendly with rougher side. Don't like on my face. Please put back the way they were. Or exchange the ones I have for the old ones!"
"I've never seen these clothes until now (found out about them through the snapchat advertisements. I like that these are dry clothes that are activated by water as I tend to find the pre-wet wipes arnt as effective in cleaning skin. These however remove every trace of makeup and ever eye makeup, afterwards my skin texture looks and feels amazing. They also smell wonderful but not overwhelming. I will definitely be repurchasing these cloths!"
I use these dry cloths every day to remove makeup and cleanse my face. I especially like to take them when traveling since they're so easy to pack and use when away from home. It makes me feel like I'm getting everything off my face without stripping my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always been one to use Oil of Olay products since I was 18years old. During this time there was only the moisturizing lotion. I am happy to say that I enjoy the array of products, especially this one. It is a part of my daily morning facial care. These towelettes give enough product and exfoliating feel that I need for my skin. My skin is left feeling soft and looks youthful. My Husband always complements me on how beautiful my skin looks. Thank Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing. It cleanses deeply, yet somehow leaves the skin balanced. I, at 40 something use it, but also my teen. We both are free of skin issues. I sometimes use a light Olay moisturizer after this. I highly recommend it for Black skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always had problems achieving a clean feeling because I have always had very oily skin. 4-In-1 Daily Facial Cloths Combination/Oily is the only product I have used that makes me feel fresh and clean. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I hav been using the 4-in1 Daily Facial Cloths for years now and I love them! I tell everyone I know how great these work and how easy they are to use. They are great to bring with when you travel. I even have my daughter using them now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love these cloths, especially when traveling. The combination of gentle cleansing and exfoliation gives my skin a lovely glow. I use this product in combination with Regenerist micro-sculpting cream and serum and Total Effects moisturizer with SPF 30 with great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I travel just about every week and this is a must have in my luggage. I don't have to worry about placing this in my quart size bag and out of all the facial cloths I've tried this removes the most stubborn makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love, Love, Love the Olay cleansing cloths. I have been using them for as long as I can remember. The cloths not only clean my face but remove eye makeup including mascara with ease. I use them Dalit and always have compliments on my completion . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Olay Daily Facial Cloths on and off for a few years and it cleans very well, even eye makeup. It does dry my skin a little afterwards, but it's nothing a simple moisturizer can't handle. The cloths are big, and I feel like it's such a waste to use the entire one to clean my face, so I usually cut it in half and it does the job just fine. It's great and convenient for travel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using these Facial Cloths for years and love them! They always leave my skin so clean and fresh and my breakouts (unfortunately I STILL get them) have really been minimized since I started using them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the absolute best when it comes to taking off all make-up. Including eye-make-up, everything else I've used just really made my make-up flow allover the place instead of removing it/cleaning it. It even gets rid of the grime and I find it a very gentle exfoliate. I've tried almost everything. I have even gotten store brands and bargain brands and they dont even come close to the real thing."
I wear sweat proof make up and could never find a product that could take all of it off. I would find makeup on my cotton swab when I used my toner and occasionally have breakouts from left over makeup. No more mascara rings under my eyes the next morning! Smoother skin and fewer blackheads after 2 weeks!
"These cloths leave my face feeling clean and hydrated, never tight or dried out. I spend a lot of the year camping. They are so convenient to use--just add water, cleanse your face, and throw away. I have used these for several years and now I am having trouble finding them. Please do not discontinue this product. [The cloths leave your skin feeling nicer than the towelettes.]"
I have been using Olay Daily Facials for as long as I can remember. It is the only facial cleanser I will use.I use them morning and night and my face doesn't feel clean without them. When I was younger I used the combination formula but now that I am over 50 I have switched to the normal to dry skin formula. I will continue to use this product forever!
Absolutely love this product! I have slightly sensitive combination skin and this feels great! My face feels refreshed after using them. This is a MUST HAVE with your daily facial cleansing routine. I can't live without it! It leaves my face feeling well hydrated and moisturized. Almost like spending a day at a spa! Buy this and your bringing the spa to your own home. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to pamper themselves. Its great! I could go on and on about this wonderful facial cleanser.
I was hesitant to use this product at first as I had tried other brands that left my skin so oily that my face started breaking out! No problem with breakouts with this product. My skin is healthy and beautiful. The cleanser is not harsh and leves my skin feeling fresh and looking great. I highly recommend this product...you won't be dissatisfied!
Being a new mom I don't have a lot of time to put into my skin care regime anymore. I found these cloths and now at night I can remove makup to have a freshly washed face feel and I don't even need lotion! I love them and don't know what I would do without them!!
"My girlfriends and I use Olay Daily Facials to clean up after our long training runs for a marathon. We pack them in a cooler so they are refreshing cold. Not only do the facials clean extremely well, they also have such a fresh, delicate scent that you want to bury your face into the cloth and stay there for awhile. I'm a long-time user of Olay products because they are the only over-the-counter products that truly work for me."
"Everything concerning Olay product just the best ever since from childhood, good value"
I like it I dnt wear makeup but I like to use it makes my skin feel soft and it smells good
I love the dry to wet face towels they are great for travel!
I have used this product for several years and would not use anything else to wash my face. It is a great product.
This product is very soothing to sun dried and irritated skin. It makes your skin very smooth and silky. Living in Florida is very hard on skin.
"I loved these towelettes- they do a great job, mild but clean my skin thoroughly. Plus they're great for traveling. No danger of leaks and very light. I pack a few in a small ziplock and voilá."
"Removes all the dirt and make-up but leaves your face soft and hydrated...not tight and shiny like my old product. I cut the cloth in half, which is more than adequate for cleaning your face and it doubles your usage!"
I have used these little cloths for years and absolutely love them. The texture of the cloth gently exfoliates and the nice smelling lather cleans and leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh. I hope this product is available for years to come!
I'm absolutely in love with this product! It smells and feels great. It leaves my skin feeling so clean. It's a great value for the money. I love how it foams and the cloth exfoliates my skin.
"I use these every night and have for the last 5 years. it make washing your face a breeze and it leaves your skin clean & soft. Love, love, love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Quick, convenient and best of all, they work! Even tough to remove waterproof eye make up comes right off. Leaves skin feeling fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I travel a lot. These cloths are very convenient! And when traveling in places where humidity is high, ordinary wash cloths often mildew. These are always fresh!"
"OLAY Daily Facials do an excellent job of removing make-up. My skin stays soft and moist. The make-up I use, ruined my new washcloths. The washcloths turned orange! Using OLAY Daily Facial Cloths will keep your regular washcloths clean."
"I have been using these facial cloths for a couple years now they seem to have changed them in the past year, I dont know if its me but they dont lather as nicely maybe I have been getting bad batches I think I will try the regenerist line."
No one can believe how soft and smooth my skin is at my age- 62. I use the daily facial cleansing cloths in the shower for my face and my skin is clean and never dry. I never use any other cleanser on it.
"This product is so convenient, I just wish more stores carried the refill packs (so I didn't have to buy the container again)! Whenever I forget to buy more, I dread having to wash my face with soap. Great product!!"
previously I used makeup remover then washed my face and toner and moisterizer - Now its all in one simple little cloth - A little moisterizer and I'm done - less than 5 minutes and it takes all your eye makeup off in a flash - love these cloths!!
"Before these cloths, I was using a wash cloth and soap. Now I won't use anything else but Olay's Facial cloths for cleaning my face. They make my skin feel fresh and ready for my next step.... Olay regenerist daily moisterizer."
"I usually only use high end skin care, but I ran out of my normal $40 wipes and tried these in a pinch. I love them! These remove my waterproof mascara and other makeup in seconds and leave my face feeling soft and hydrated. The downside is that they aren't rough enough to properly exfoliate and they burn my eyes, but I'll continue to use them because they make my skin feel so nice."
I love this cleanser but I'm havin a hard time finding it in the local stores. I'm very happy with this purchase.
"Since I started using this product, I feel like my face is cleaner and healthier, and looks radiant!"
"It's perfect all in one facial wash. Moisturizer, scrub and cleanser. Perfect for camping. Love this Walmart's 2 day free shipping offer. Good job!"
i love this 4-1 daily face cloths. it makes my feel smooth and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have used this product before and have always had very nice results with it. I would recommend it to everyone
