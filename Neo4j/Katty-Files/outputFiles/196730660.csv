"This moisturizer meets all my expectations. I was looking for another moisturizer with a sunscreen that did not cost as much as the one I had been using. Actually, I like it much better. It absorbs faster and is not oily. It keeps my face fully moisturized all day and does great under my makeup. I love the price and will never go back to what I was using. I just hope Walmart keeps the price reasonable because it is a lot of us retirees out there searching for affordable alternatives."
I looked it up on ewg and it had a very good rating. It is pure enough to use everyday and its smoothes on very easily. I love it.
I've used this for years instead of the famous name brand
"This moisturizer is definitely not sensitive-skin friendly at all! Put it on once I got out the shower and it did burn a little, but I ignored it. A day or two later it gave me closed comedones all over my chin, cheeks, and forehead. Not too happy about that, but I'm just trying to warn everyone else out there."
Smells bad and doesnât moisturize it just sits on top of your skin. It also rubs off like cheap sunscreen.
Equate is tested on animals :( This facial mosturizer smells bad and dries out your skin. The pump took forever to get working
I have never had such excessive burning and tearing from a moisturizing cream as this one. Had you toss and replace it with Olay.
Okay moisturizer but burns your eyes if your eyes get watery for whatever reason during the day
"I decided to try this before buying the brand name because my previous, expensive moisturizer made my face too oily"
"Reeks of chemicals, burned skin. Tried to use it as a hand cream instead, but the smell was too strong."
