Have tried a lot of other products and this one seems to be the most successful. Will purchse again.
"This product is truly amazing, it gets rid of zits in one to two nights."
"Best used before the pimple has come to a head, when it's still forming. Can prevent it from coming to a head at all. Small tube but lasts a really long time cuz a little goes a long way."
"I highly recommend this product if you're looking for an acne cream. I apply it to the spots on my face that need it after I shower, and in the morning it's like my acne was never there. Granted, I do rarely break out, my face is pretty clear, but this stuff is amazing, don't double think it just BUY IT."
"I bought this originally as a spot treatment but I began to use it as both a moisturizer and spot treatment. I only moisturize in the places where I have terrible acne and spot treat every other night on big zits. In a week and half, I can already tell a huge difference in my skin. I honestly wish this came in bigger sizes because 0.5oz is not close to enough!"
I really wanted to like this product and the entire line. It was really natural and contained a lot of good products. The product itself wasn't icky. What I had and am having a problem with is nothing contains clear instructions. The products all contain bare minimum directions. They do not specifically say how much and the order you should use the products. I am unsure if I am using the product correctly and that is why my face is aways waxy. Please for future product include clearer instructions for product lines.
"I really enjoy this product, it has been the best spot treatment I have used. I use it on some of the rougher days and when I wake up the next morning my blemishes are either significantly smaller or completely gone!!"
I have been struggling with breakouts for a while now and get embarrassed at very crowded events. I put this on one night and the next day the blemish was gone! I constantly use it. Great Product!
I love this stuff! It works great even on super sensitive skin! It does not over dry or cause redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product on my face back and chest. Was getting the worst acne VERY PAINFUL! Dermatologist gave me cremes washes .... ALL IT DID WAS BLEACH MY CLOTHING and make my face oily or more worse! So I came across a natural product and is so happy at my results ! I'm still breaking out but this puts a slowww downnn to my pimples I will be buying the whole line ! Thank you Burt's bees !!!!
I love this product. I originally purchased this for my teenager but I ended up buying a tube for myself for those once in a while blemishes. I did a lot of research looking for a natural treatment that would actually work and this was by far the best. I even purchased a couple of other brands but everyone kept coming back to this. There was no irritation for anyone but I will say you have to be patient because it is not instant. I usually put it on at night and see a big improvement by the morning.
"I use this at least once, if not two to three times a day when I can feel a blemish emerging, and it has not seemed to make any difference in keeping the blemish from coming to the surface or in getting rid of it once it has emerged. I will give it a bit more time but have been using it for about a week and have not seen any results from it."
"I suffer from atopic dermatitis/eczema around my mouth and on my chin. I also have cystic acne on my cheeks and forehead. Anytime in the past that I've tried to treat my acne, I've found the products too irritating and would always result in painful eczema flare ups. This stuff has been a God send. It has almost entirely eliminated my acne without irritating my skin at all! I've used it everyday for almost 2 weeks without dryness or discomfort. My skin is the best it's ever looked, I am so thankful for this product!"
i have been using this stuff for 2 days and it has cleared up my skin so much i cant believe it! the first say i got it i had a really huge zit on my face and it just wouldnt go away! i put this stuff on it and when i woke up it was completely gone!!!! i couldn't believe it and it didnt even dry out my skin AT ALL
idk how to use it do i rub it in or but in on the spots
"I have tried numerous acne treatments and this one is definitely near the top of my list. I love that it has natural ingredients but still has 2% salycilic acid. It goes on like a cream and doesn't over dry the skin. I have somewhat sensitive, oily skin and this cream gives it a nice balanced feel. I will definitely continue to use this along with the ultra hydrating cream."
"This product is a great spot treatment for any imperfections on your face. It works on black heads, white heads, and tones down redness and irritation. It doesn't dry out your skin because it goes on like a lotion. A little bit of it goes a long way. Great product!"
"I love this product! It really works great, i have finally found something to treat my chronic cystic acne. I use the full line of acne products. Also just recently started using their brightening dark spot corrector and am seeing results with this too! I love Burt's Bees I highly recommend them!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have suffered from mild acne for as long as I can remember, always having one to two blemishes on my face most of the time. I even tried Proactiv for a while with no change. I have oily skin and it's difficult to keep my pores from getting really large. I am over 40 so have tried numerous treatments over the many years, and this is the best one I've ever used. This one actually works! As a bonus, I found it has a smoothing effect under make-up too."
"Having tried several Burt's Bee's acne products, this product is #1. Fast acting is what I appreciate and doesn't dry out the skin! Love it and well worth the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I may be the odd one out here but, I got this stuff and it worked great for a while, my dermatologist actually had no complaints last time I went but now it seems to have stopped working as my acne is progressively getting worse now"
It smells and works great! I don't know if my acne just naturally went away... But they went away! I used clinique but stopped because it has too many chemicals! So I suddenly switched to burts bees! Which caused the acne because of the quick switch from chemical to natural! But I got this and there all gone! I love butts bees!!
If you put a good sized glob on and leave it on for maybe 10+ minutes and go back to the pimple and just wipe it off for the most part the white head on my pimples will just come straight off and my pimple will reduce dramatically. It also doesn't sting or dry out my skin like other acne solutions 10/10 recommend
"I personally have had better results with other acne spot treatments. I didn't like how this one smelled or how it left my face feeling after I used it: kind of sticky. I didn't really notice a difference either after using it for awhile. I love Burt's Bees, but this product didn't do me justice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
M skin is not overall oily but I have a few places that get touched by my hair that are regular problem areas. I get maybe 1-2 blemishes a week. I used this on one of them and took 2 applications daily for 2 days to see it disappear. Not bad results and I like that it didn't dry or damage my skin in the process.
"This stuff is absolutely perfect! I had a small blemish from when I first started using these products again and I put this on, and within the matter of a few hours, the blemish had practically disappeared! I'm in love with this stuff! Absolute perfection!"
I had horrible acne and this cleared it up. Within a week and a half I started to notice a difference. I highly recommend this.
"LOVE, LOVE this product!! I keep several on hand at all times. I give this as gifts in my gift baskets. This is the product that I cannot live without. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Acne Solutions Maximum Strength heals my skin of blemishes easily without drying out the skin. It's a wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is bar none the best spot treatment I've ever used. Perhaps because it's a cream and not a gel. I find gel spot treatments tend to dry the skin out. It's very effective.
"This product is great! Worth the extra few dollars compared to competition. Works super fast, clear, not messy. Highly recommended!"
I do not see very noticeable results when I use this. Clearasil helps me a lot more. And the price! Way to expensive. Burt's Bees is a good company. I like some of their stuff just not this.
Not effective and broke me out.
Best results I have had since I was 9 years old :)
