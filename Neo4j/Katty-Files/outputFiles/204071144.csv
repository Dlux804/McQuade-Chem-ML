"Very creamy and soft cleanser. I gently rub it on my entire face, and then, use my cleansing tool for about a minute. My skin feels soft, smooth and clean, not tight. Just be sure to rinse well! I love this cleanser, it's become my favorite. It's affordable as well. Love it!"
I found this cleanser to be gritty enough to scrub the skin but lathery enough to be gentle on the skin. I liked the air pump style of the product as well which means I'll get to really use up most of the product. It had a clean scent as well as made my skin feel cleansed but not too tight.

I received this product for review purposes from Influenster. This product does gently exfoliate your skin. But doesn't over dry skin. I do have a combination skin. But it doesn't irritate my skin. It just makes my skin feel refreshed and clean. Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like that it exfoliates while it cleanses your face. I also like the handy dispenser top. It seems to do a good job. It doesn't quite “whip up” as foamy in my hands as I thought it would, but I like it."
"I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for an honest review, so here it goes. Firstly, I love the packaging. There is nothing better than a product with a built in pump in my book. Secondly, I love the whipped feeling of this cleaner. It's not too heavy and not too harsh on my sensitive skin. I tend to produce a lot of oils throughout the day and this didn't make a huge difference in that for me, but overall I would say it is a solid cleanser that gets the job done! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ultimately this wasn't my favorite cleanser. The texture was cool sure but I didn't like the way my skin felt after cleansing. It was a little stripped but also not clean feeling? The ingredients also aren't the cleanest so if you pay attention to ingredients in particular you may not be a fan. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought Olay whip cleanser and loved it for the first week so I went and picked up 2 more so I'll be stocked. After 1 week my skin was dry and tight and breaking out! I have oily skin so this really shocked me. Very upsetting...
"I used this product one time and was very happy with it. However, I can no longer get the pump to work. I have repeatedly tried and also had my husband try to get out the product. No luck. I would be happy to rate this higher...if I could get to the product."
"The cleanser did it's job, which was to cleanse my face, but its exfoliation use wasn't as effective as I would've liked it to be. Personally, I don't think I'll be using this product again. I think that physical abrasion for exfoliation isn't as effective as chemical exfoliation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has little beads in the cleanser that help exfoliate your skin. It feels so good when you been at work all day and know that all that grime is just washing away. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best cleanser I have ever used in my lfe. It feels like whipped cream on my face and is very gentle. It gently cleans like magic and i am surprised because it is very effective. It is a very effect product and I do not think it needs any improvement.
This cleanser was great. Smells great. Does not burn. Leaves skin very smooth and fresh and clean feeling. It was a very gently cleanser and great for my sensitive skin. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The container is super friendly and pumps out exactly enough for one wash. The product itself smells great and is light as air like they claim. The microbeads make it feel like I'm getting a deep clean! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"LOVE THIS!!! so not in a HUGE need for wrinkle help, but love the way it foams,(not too much) and the tube is super convenient. I think that it was super effective I was a LITTLE skeptical. It more than met my expectations. If there was room for improvement I would say add something to help get the dead skin off the face , like a scrubby.

"I received the Olay Regenerist cleansing whip polishing cream cleanser free in exchange for my review. I am in love with this face cleaner, and the fact that it comes in a easy to use bottle. It's really easy to use super light, help scrub off all the daily gunk, and washes off right away without leaving any residue behind. Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser It is very easy to use. I will be buying this again. Way to go Olay!!! Total win. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed using this facial cleanser. It removed all of my makeup without making my skin feel stripped or dryer out. The consistency was also really nice and the anti-aging ingredients are a nice bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since receiving this product for testing purposes, I have not put it down! I rarely use my other products. It's gentle, despite the exfoliating aspect of it. I find it to be very safe for daily use though many exfoliating products may not be. My skin looks amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is very nicely packaged. It dispenses the formula easily. It leaves my skin feeling very clean but not dry. It has a very nice light fragrance. I would recommend this product to other people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This facial cleanser is so delightfully light and airy, and fun to use to boot! I love the unique texture and how it doesn't make my face feel like it hasn't been cleaned well afterwards, or make it feel stretched out and dry. I use it in the morning when I wake up and at night before I go to sleep. Great product overall, and something I plan on continuing to purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a little skeptical of how I would like this product I have it a shot and I really do like it! It made my skin feel so smooth and made my makeup look better underneath because it was really able to absorb my moisturizer better like it says [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how amazing this feels on my face. I love the smell and I love how it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth and clean it's gentle. This product met all expectations and I plan on purchasing more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this in a box a few weeks ago. I LOVE it. It is extremely gentle on my skin, and it smells great. I am extremely picky about face cleaners because some make my face break out. So I need extremely gentle cleansers. The olay whip cleanser is not drying, the little micro scrubbers in it aren't too harsh, but it does feel like it's actually cleaning my face. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out. I think I've found my new daily cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a great facial cleanser. It has some exfoliation which is nice to feel fresh and clean after using it! The smell was mild and not overbearing and my skin felt moisturized after washing it off. Overall, it does the job well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this foamy facial cleanser almost every day to clean my face and also to remove all the residues of makeup, the smell is very fresh. This crème cleanser has some little particles that help to deep clean all the face. The amount of products is enough to last more than a month. I received complementary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this face cleanser. I found it very easy to use, just apply and rinse. I felt like this made my face feel clean and soft. It didn't dry out my face but also didn't leave it feeling oily either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've really enjoyed using this product. I love the light exfoliation beads inside and how it makes my face feel. However it is very fragrant, I like it but I can see it being a problem for some. Overall I would recommend this product to my friends assuming they're okay with fragrant face washes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start off by saying that I got this product complimentary. I like how light this facial cleaner is. It's a nice deep gentle and hydrating wash that doesn't leave a residue. I feel my skin better since my pores are cleaned out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip is a great cleanser. The bottle easily dispenses just the right product, and it feels great on the skin. It is gentle, but removed the dirt and makeup easily. I really enjoy this product on my dry/normal skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Recieved this as a sample from @influcester. I loved it. I could feel it cleaning my skin. It left it feeling great without irritation. That was what I lived about it most. It's easy to put on and wash off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I want to start by saying I used this product like 6 or 7 times before I reviewed it. I had high hopes for this cleanser. The formula is creamy with micro exfoliating beads inside. I thought it would be more foamy. However it left my face feeling really dry afterwards. It might not be formulated for people with oily skin like me. But this was not it for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been a fan of Olay for years, so I was very excited to try this product! The pump is easy to use and so much better than anything in a tube or pot. The texture is amazing and the whip lathers up great! A little goes a long way so this product will last a while. Very refreshing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you want a foaming cleansing wash that is going to make your face feel amazing afterward, this is definitely the product for you. This is easy to put on, and washes away with ease! I definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this stuff for the past two weeks and I love it! It smells amazing which is nice and I can already tell a change in my skin. The consistency is really cool and it doesn't leave a nasty film feeling on your face after you wash it off which is a huge plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't usually use Olay products, so I wasn't expecting to love this product as much as I do. It has these tiny microdermabrasion pieces that left my skin feeling great! Grateful that I received this product (for free) from Influenster - I will be buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just like the mask this cleaner has a light floral scent that doesn't linger but smells delightful. It features tiny exfoliating beads that are easily broken down and washed away. My favorite way to use it is with a electronic brush cleaner but it's absolutely not needed. It leaves your face feel clean and fresh without stripping it of its natural oils. Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this wash I'm always skeptic when coming to exfoliate face wash but this was so gentle an dose the job. It makes skin soft an supple while cleaning great for anti age an provides a nice glow will defintely will be buying again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved the @oilofolay Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser complementary for my honest review from #influenster @Influenster. I liked it alot. The whipped texture was nice. It had little exfoliating beads that left my skin feeling very soft and refreshed. I love it and so did my mother. She has older skin. So it worked great for me (33 years old) and my mom (58 years old) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm always skeptical about trying new face washes. I love the whipped feeling of the product it was very light and fun to use, I also like the type of bottle it's in. I've been using it for a week now and it keeps my skin looking fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely LOVE this! I like the “whip” it isn't real heavy and thick. It feels good on your face. It has the exfoliating beady feeling which I like! Keeps breakouts at bay and makes my face look great and refreshed. Easy to use great product! Will definitely purchase in the future and recommend to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this cleanser for approximately 2 weeks now. Overall, I like it. I like the exfoliation it provides and my face feels clean afterwards - a little too drying but not enough for me to completely dislike it. My one complaint is that it has added fragrance which is a completely unnecessary addition to skincare and it will only cause irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It smells really good and my face feels soft after using it but the only thing I dislike about it is the packaging. It's hard for me to get any product out and the struggle lasts for too long that I don't want to use it anymore and use another cleanser for the night. I want to try it more and see how it actually effects my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this face wash. It has a nice smell to it that's not overwhelming. It also these tiny little exfoliants in it. I used a few times a week but it could be used once a day. I think using it twice a day would be too much on a persons skin. But it did leave my skin feeling soft and smooth after I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser has a nice consistency and leaves my skin feeling clean. This was my first time using it. I like that the packaging has a pump.

First let me just start by saying this smells soooooo good! Lightweight product that has a great exfoliating texture. The container is great with a pump type dispenser. My skin feels great and looks refreshed after use. Skin doesn't feel like it needs a moisturizer applied afterwards so that is a huge positive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this cleanser! It foamed up nicely and the microbeads were a nice surprise. My skin felt clean but not overly dry after rinsing. It would be a good winter cleanser since my skin is relatively oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The olay regenerist cleansing whip felt amazing on my face. I was so glad to wash my face and it didn't feel rough or dry.

"I was very surprised that I would like this face wash as I do not normally use cream cleansers because they are so thick and heavy but this cleanser was opposite of that, I liked that this cleanser is light weight so after use my face feels so nice and clean. I have oily skin and this cleanser has made my face less oily after a few days of use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really liked this cleanser !!! the pump makes it so much easier to use. the whip formula makes it very unique as I have never used something like it before.

I have no complaints about this cleanser at all! i would definitely recommend to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Very impressed. I juat wish it was made with organic, sustainable ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product in exchange for my honest review in my voxbox from Influenster.

"I love this facial cleanser! It's so easy to use! I keep mine in the shower, and wash my face with it every night. It removes all of my make-up and leaves my face feeling clean and soft! I'm not a big fan of the fragrance, it would be nice to have one that is fragrance free. But, it does lather well and rinses off easily. For a mom on the go, it's the perfect facial cleanser!

"I really liked the Olay regenerist cleansing whip face wash. It was moisturizing, while gently exfoliating! Best of both worlds. Had to use a cloth to remove it, no problem.

"This is an okay product for me. The pros are they it is amazing for people who have dry skin, smells really good. The cons are that I didn't really see a difference in my skin when I used it.

"I love the concept of this product- light, airy cleanser with just a little bit of grit for gentle exfoliation. My skin dries out really easily, and I find that using this every day is drying my face out a little too much. I've cut back to every other day and I tolerate it much better. Still recommend trying it for the gentle exfoliation! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the whip texture of this cleanser and it lathered very well.

It did leave my skin feeling very clean tho without drying it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My new favorite cleanser! I have really oily skin, blackheads and a few breakouts here and there but nothing big.

It's been a while since I've loved a cleanser from the drugstore but this has bumped my long loved high end cleanser for the last 2 weeks.

Not as light and fluffy as I thought it would be. But, overall really love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before I got this Voxbox, Olay was a brand I saw more as for mature skin. Both this and the clay stick mask have changed my mind. This cleanser is gentle but you still feel that it gets some exfoliation done. No obnoxious smell, a little bit goes a long way, and your skin feels clean afterwards! way to go Olay, two wonderful products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like this product. The scent is great and the packaging makes it easy to use. My skin is normally a bit oily. This product made my skin look fantastic immediately after use. However, my skin looked extremely oily shortly after that. I usually don't have this problem with the products I currently use. Probably would not use again in the future.

My mom always talks about the Olay Regenerist line and finally they have a whipped cleanser! Whipped and cream cleansers are my favorite and always leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.

"I'm not a fan of cleansers that have a scent to them so I didn't incorporate this cleanser into my daily skin routine. Instead I used this product when I wore heavy makeup and wanted extra cleansing. I did enjoy how a little amount was enough for my face. Once again, i would be cautious if a person is sensitive to scents in cleansers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think what I like most about this product is the grittiness. I really feel like dead skin and makeup are being removed and not just rubbed all over my face. It was very effective and made my skin so smooth! I have DEFINITELY been telling my friends about it :) Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am really not sure how I liked it. When I tried it out it made my face feel real oily. I am not sure if it it is pricey or not. I know I would not recommend this product to anybody unless they have really dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you're looking for word to a cleanser that will leave you feeling moisturized, this one is it. I like the subtle exfoliation and creamy texture that this formula gives. I definitely feel like my face is moist after I use it as well as being clean. It also has a really nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
WOW! Let's start with that! Perfect combination of cleaning and moisturizing! Left my skin feeling flawless! The small beads removed my dead skin and cleaned deep into my pores! This was my favorite product that I've ever been able to test! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love the Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser because it leaves my face feeling so fresh. It has tiny particles that make it feel like you are gently exfoliating while washing your face and it smells amazing. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely LOVE this product I love that it's a whip facial cleanser it's super easy to use it's not messy at all my face truly felt clean and refreshed this is something I would definitely purchase and recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this cleanser. It pairs very well with the moisturizing whip. I think it's a great value and it met my expectations. It was very gentle and did not break my sensitive skin out. I would definitely buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the whip feeling on my skin! Love the simple packaging and pump feature. A pea size amount cleansed my face really well. Got rid of my sebum and left my face really soft. Great for everyday use!! I have acne and so far I don't notice any new acne! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was not what I was expecting but still nice. When I thought if whipped I pictured more fluffy and foamy more like whipped cream. However it was still lightweight. Easy and convenient to use. Small exfoliating pieces in the wash. Leaves face feali g soft and hydrated. I keep mine in the shower. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Really enjoying this Olay whip cleanser, it has a really lightweight feel to it along with some small particles in it which feels like really fine salt I can only explain it as. My face felt nice, clean and smooth after each use. The product itself has a strong lotion like scent to it which could be a bit unpleasant if you have a headache to begin with or are sensitive to fragrant smells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I will start off by saying this cleanser is not for oily skin. Because it's a cream cleanser, there is some residue left behind on the skin for extra moisture. This made my skin feel congested and clammy which also made it harder for the products afterward to be absorbed. However my sister who used it has dry skin and for her it was really good because it provided the extra boost of moisturizer. And it prepped her skin for better absorption of other skin care products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complementary for review purposes. All opinions are my own. I absolutely love this cleanser. It is light with a fresh scent and subtle exfoliant. It cleans without being harsh and stripping the skin. I will definitely repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Normally I like a stronger scrub wash so that I can feel my face getting cleaner. I am not a huge fan of cream washes. I was expecting this to be very creamy. Even after pumping a small amount into my hand, I thought it would be creamy. However, when you rub the wash in your hands, it activated the “whip” and turns somewhat foamy. It does have gently exfoliating scrub texture to it. I fell in love with this! It is amazing and I would absolutely purchase this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited to try this as soon as I got it. The product has little exfoliating beads in it which I LOVE, and I feel that overall it does a good job of cleaning off all the left over make up off my face. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So Far i am enjoying this cleanser . I have oily skin and acne prone skin and it has kept my skin clear and smooth.. I noticed my face felt clean and fresh . My makeup even stayed on longer than usual. It's a good product and doesnt leave your skin feeling dry, dirty or oily... great cleanser.. I will definitely buy another bottle next time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love trying new products and this one was great love the packaging , the pump is great for easy use. The smell is light and not too overwhelming love the tiny grit the product has to polish my face. Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. Also very soft. I also love the price point very affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoy using this cleanser. It smells nice, and there is a little bit of exfoliation that I feel good about. My skin felt clean and soft, and I didn't get that “tight” feeling that some cleansers leave which is uncomfortable and I'm guessing not good for the skin. I really don't know why it's called “whip” though? I follow the instructions and it does get foamy, but with the name Whip I was expecting something a bit more.... fluffy? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved how soft this cleanser left my skin. It is very gently exfoliating and very light. The instructions say to lather it in your hands to ‘activate the whip' but it didn't lather much for me until I actually applied to my face and massaged it in. It was very hydrating and I almost felt like I didn't even need a moisturizer afterwards! Pro tip: use with a clay mask stick for a great spa day experience including exfoliation and leaving soft, smooth skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love it! It feels very refreshing on my skin, and I absolutely love the gentle but efficient micro beads/ exfoliaters! It's honestly feels great! I use a facial whip to take off most of my makeup before hand then wash with this cleanser to take the rest off. Works like a charm! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am really enjoying this. Great smell. Lathers fantastic. Leaves my face feeling super clean but not dried out. Uses very little product for each use, I find 1 pump works great. Was sent to me to try out but I will actually consider purchasing this myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The consistency of this cleanser feels good on the face. It made my skin feel more firm after using it for a couple of days. The packaging is pretty and it has a pump to dispense product. Olay is the queen of drugstore antiaging proudcts! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love, love, love this product. I use it at night as a mask and in the morning I put less and gently rub it in so it absorbs and it's not sticky and gives my face a nice dewy look, plumps up the lines and gives a lift and makes me look 10 years younger, lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had some initial expectations about this product based on what the packaging advertised. I was expecting a little thicker and creamier consistency, but the formula was quite light. I was not expecting the little exfoliating beads in it, but that was a nice surprise. After using it even just once, I definitely feel like my skin absorbed my facial moisturizer better than usual. I'll definitely continue using this to see what the long term results are. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pleasantly suprised at how refreshing my skin felt after using this cleanser. Not harsh at all and my skin didnt feel like it had been stripped dry like alot of cleansers. This really does just remove all the days dirt and makeup buildup and resets the skin so nicely and feels natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanted to like this as much as everything else but it's a little disappointing. The consistency isn't what I was hoping for.. and it doesn't feel as clean as I would like. I use a toner after I wash my face and there was still dirt on the cotton ball. The facewash didn't clean as well as I would like [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay's Cleansing Whip doesn't have much whip too it. It's more of a creme cleanser with a light exfoliate. It does a good job of cleaning but the scent is not great. The moisturizer within is almost like lotion so when you're rinsing your skin it can be tricky to figure out if the product is completely off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The women in my family have been using Olay for as long as I can remember. The Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser is a great addition to their line. It gently cleanses and exfoliates without being harsh or drying and it leaves skin looking and feeling great. A word to the wise: a little goes a LONG way so don't use too much or you will be rinsing for a long time. I will definitely be telling all of my friends about this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the new “whip” products that Olay has introduced. This cleanser is nice and easy to use and spread out. It doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or super moisturized just feeling of clean (I do double cleanse). I need to use more to see its anti-aging claims, but overall good standard cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cleanser! It is so gentle, yet so effective on my skin! It's a soft and creamy formula that really removes dirt and impurities, leaving my skin soft and clear. Other brands I've tried can really dry my skin out or they have trouble removing dirt and makeup. Not this stuff!!! It gets the job done so well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
A great every day facial cleanser that leaves you feeling clean and not dry or oily! I like how it felt going on my face and the nice whip consistency that it has. I would recommend this 100%. I will buy again ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like how the product feels like a lotion at first but lathers once applied. I was expecting more of a whipped texture but it is not a airy as you would think. The product does remove all makeup with minimal drying of the skin. You definitely need to moisturize after use but overall a great cleanser. I received this product complimentary for my honest review. Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free through Influenster for my honest opinion. I love this Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser. I can tell a huge difference when I use it. My face feels clean and refreshed. I love that it has anti-aging properties for a younger looking face. It doesn't dry your face out like most others. I will definitely recommend to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoy how lightweight this cleanser is. But it does so much! It has just enough grittiness to help exfoliate and make your skin feel softer and smoother. The smell is light and fresh. I don't know if it's made my skin look younger but I have only used it a couple of weeks. I have noticed a difference in texture and my pores looking a little smaller. Will repurchase for sure. May even try the whipped cleansers and want to try the moisturizers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was super excited to try this because my skin could always use exfoliation. First only use one pump. First time i tried it i did 3 pumps. I ended up with bubbles up my nose. The smell is good not too strong. I like the whipped texture, it's helpful for application. The only thing i didn't like was there didn't seem to be enough of the exfoliation product. It wasn't concentrated enough it seemed. My skin did feel smoother from using for a week. My skin looked even all over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"at first i thought i really liked this product the exfoliating beads felt amazing and it didn't feel too rough just perfect but after washing off my face it left my skin feeling sticky and gross, i was very disappointed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is okay, I dont hate it but I dont love it. I dont like the sand like substance in this product and I also think it's too oily for me personally, it does a good job at cleansing and smells pretty good, it's just not for me. I received this product free to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this every night to get my make up off. It feels great, smells great and does an amazing job. However the down side is that it leaves these little white ball like things behind. No matter what or how I wash my face they are there. I have found that it is best to use it at night so when I wake up the ""dots"" are gone. They are like little bubbles that help take off the dead skin and they do a great job. I just want them to go away once I am done washing my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised to find the little scrubbing beads. I love exfoliating and this was gentle enough to use every day. I also really like the lathering. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was bc the beads are micro plastic and don't wash away from your hairline that well and leaves little white beads in your hair. Plus the damage that does to the environment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Definitely loving this cleanser. I don't really notice the “whip” but that may be because I'm using it in the shower. Also didn't realize that it was a exfoliator.. so nice! It's not abrasive like a lot of other exfoliators are so that's nice. But it makes my face so so smooth after I rinse off the cleanser. It's easy to use and the packaging is nice as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a good cleanser. It doesn't come out of the bottle whipped. It comes out in gel form and when you rub it in between your hands it becomes foamy. I feel it is a mild cleanser that is good for everyday use. I also like the look of it by my sink. The packaging feels super nice. It doesn't have a smell, so it won't irritate due to fragrance. I have sensitive skin and my skin likes it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually only use the oil of Olay face lotion out of all their products but now that I got this cleanser I will for sure be purchasing more! I was surprised by how much I loved it and how soft it left my skin feeling!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is so nice! I love how it has some exfoliating particles to make me feel extra clean after a workout. It was effective, yet gentle. The pump is very handy. I wouldn't use this every day, but as a multi-tasking product this was excellent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very nice product. I love the packaging. The texture of this product feels so good. When you apply, it actually feels like it's working. My skin felt very refreshed after use. I'm very excited to see how this product helps my skin in long term use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used quite a few exfoliating cleansers. This one competes with the high end brands I've tried. It's creamier than the Vasanti Brighten Up but the exfoliating beads aren't as harsh as Dr. Brandt's Microdermabrasion. I actually liked this better than Dr. Brandt. It smelled nice and left my skin smooth, soft and bright. I'd definitely buy this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser leaves a very fresh feeling after using. I did not find it to be overly drying or irritating to my skin (although my skin is not sensitive, mostly normal). Overall I will buy this again I really like the container too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great cleanser. I love that is not the typical cream or liquid cleanser. Its whipped texture makes it much easier to use and a little amount of product is enough. My skin feels so much hydrated and smooth after just a few days of using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this face wash. It really is close to a foaming cleanser with how light it is, BUT it has the little grit to really cleanse and polish your face. I have used it for over a week now and I can see that my face is smoother and brighter. I'm definitely a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can not say enough about this product! I have been using it for roughly two weeks and my skin is clearing up and feeling smooth. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I recently received a compliment from a co worker that I was looking younger. It could have been the day but I'm going to chalk it up to my new cleanser. I give this An A+++ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A nice mild facial cleanser that isn't loaded with perfumes and scents. The cleanser has a light fresh scent, and feels light on my face. Was not expecting the scrubbing granules in it, but they are not overly harsh (coming from someone with sensitive skin). Easy to dispense and makes my skin feel nice and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Olay Whip Facial Cleaners for a few days now and I love it! It's smells wonderful, it gives you a nice gentle scrub, it's not a harsh scrub that will dry out your skin and it's light and airy. It leave your face feel fresh, smooth and clean. I'm really happy with this cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the foaming aspect of this mask. It leaves my face clean and feeling moisturized. The small beads in it that I think are meant to exfoliate don't really do much but other than that it's a fantastic cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this facial cleanser. It does make my skin feel nice and clean. I am not sure there is any anti aging going on, however. It seems slightly harder to wash off my face than normal face washes. However, I do like it and I think it smells pretty good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. At first it would seem weird to try this especially with it being a cleaning whip but the consistency was perfect for my skin type. I have combination skin and it made it feel amazing after every use. I would totally recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this!!! I love how it feels on my skin and how it makes my skin feel and look. Getting this free to try for my honest review has spoiled me, and I can't wait to get more. I would encourage everyone unhappy with their skin to try this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this face wash!! I'm 23, I'm not overly concerned about wrinkles but just from a fresh face feel and clean feel, I love it. It's exfoliating, it feels strong, like I can feel it working on my face but I don't ever feel like it's drying my skin out, be sure to always moisturize after. It also has a clean smell which I like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been loving using this facial cleanser! First off, the smell is wonderful! I've had face cleansers that I end up not using fully because the smell is unbearable. Not this one though! So refreshing! The cleanser does an awesome job of making my face feel clean and refreshed. There are small beads or something in the cleanser that helps gently exfoliate. My husband has even started using it and loves it! I think we have a new favorite in our home! Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Amazing face cleansing. It felt so good to use on my face after a long day at work. The bottle is so great to use also since it has a pump it gets out easy from the bottle. I totally recommend this product. My face felt nice and clean after using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For some reason, I wasn't expecting this stuff to have grittiness. I really don't prefer it and wish that it was just a cleanser. I'm not sure that I would purchase this product. I don't love it; I don't hate it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin hasn't been very kind to me lately and I've struggled to like anything I've used recently. This was a pleasant surprise! First use, I was happy with the way my face felt after. Very soft, not too dry but definitely clean. With continued use and a simple toner, I'm seeing improvements to my skin. I've bought expensive washes that didn't deliver on that so I'm very pleased. I think this is a great choice at this price point. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have anything negative to say about this product, but it wasn't really that special either. If you have relatively problem-free skin, I'd think it would work fine. I do like that the exfoliating bits are gentle enough to use this every day. I just didn't notice any big changes in my skin after about a month of using this every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Honestly. Wasn't so stoked at first to try this product. Whoopdido. Another face wash. But y'all! This stuff is so good! An exfoliating wash that actually feels like it is doing so gently and not just scratching up the skin. Also removes makeup easily. Even love that the pump gives the perfect amount. (Hate how other products don't self control the amount of product coming out so it ends up wasting if others use my wash). Definitely will be buying this from now on.

"I was so excited to try out Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser. After pumping out the cleanser into wet hands, the product foams into your hands. It has a light grit to it which is helpful in a gentle exfoliation. Overall it is effective in removing my make up and cleaning my face. I haven't notice much of a difference in my skin, but I've only used it for a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First i want to say you get a lot of product! 5 oz. And you only need one pump to wash your entire face. It foams up nicely and has a pleasant scent. I like the micro exfoliator in this creamy wash. It also does not dry you out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this night and day for almost two weeks so I am sure that my review is fair and that I gave the product an honest shot before I rated it. This has made my skin noticably smoother and softer. No other product I have used has done this by itself. I usually would have to use a cleanser, exfoliator, and then a moisturizer to get this effect. I am impressed. My only complaint is that Olay still tests on animals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off, it has a very clean smell to it, which I liked! I have very sensitive skin and this gave me no issues at all! It left my face looking and feeling clean! I highly recommend and I will definitely be buying in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed how it had small little beads in the soap, they weren't too much so it didn't feel like it was scraping my face and they easily dissolve as you rub your face. What i enjoyed the most is that when I finished my skin didn't feel completely stripped of oils, my skin felt soft and nourished. It annoys me sometimes after I wash my face I feel like the cleanser completely strips me of all oils that are beneficial for my face. Overall I enjoyed this cleanser and I will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start off by saying this has a very strong scent. Smells like shampoo and consistency is like that as well. Also this goes on before your moisturizer so I feel like it's an extra unnecessary step. The product is very slippery and contains little beads inside. Felt like my face was cleaner but I feel like im going to start breaking out because of all the chemicals. Not my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This whip is great for the evening! I tried it out and was really surprised by it! It made my face feel so soft and clean. The only con I have is the feel is gritty and it doesn't completely go away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was frustrated at first because it was very difficult to get it out at the beginning. However, I was pleasantly surprised once I started using it. The scent is mild.

"I received this product as a sample for free and am not getting compensated for this review. I found the formula to be quite gentle, yet deep cleaning. It feels as though there is almost an exfoliating texture to it. While it does well for cleansing, I'm not 100% it's anti-aging claims are substantiated from use. But we'll see what happens!

Olay Whip facial cleanser had a light air foam application that I liked. It felt soft and easy on the skin and could be used as a daily cleanser. My skin felt clean and fresh after use.

I really love olay's products but this one definitely is one of my favorites given that it's my first time trying this product I wasn't sure what to expect normally I am not a big fan of whip products but I really like how it gently cleaned my skin. It really does feel light as air the whipped combined with the slightly gritty texture cleaned my skin leaving it smooth and visibly brighter. I would definitely recommend.

"I love this product! I normally don't use exfoliants from the drug store, since the granules can be super harsh, but I would definitely buy this one! The beads are the perfect texture to give a good exfoliation, but soft enough to not damage your face. It also smells awesome! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have fallen in love with this product. After a week of using the cleanser my skin looks glowing and smoother. I do have to say this product has a strong smell when you put it on the face once you clean the product off with water the smell does go away [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This face wash I the best! It has tiny micro beads that help gently exfoliate your skin too. I have combo skin and I found that this did not irritate my skin. I recommend to all skin types (: definitely worth a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a must have now. I love when a facial wash has beads in it so it feels like my face is so much cleaner when I'm done. The smell is wonderful.

"I've used this product a few times now, and I really like it! I love the texture of it, and I really feel like I am getting a deep clean. I like to massage it into my skin and then let it sit for a few minutes, and this seems to achieve that deep clean feeling that everyone wants! My one complaint is that it claims to not be overdrying, but my face definitely needs added moisture after I rinse the cleanser off. But overall great product!

This product from olay is amazing! It left my skin so soft afterwards ..it's made to exfoliate your skin but it does not dry it out at all..and it's not to harsh either..I use it in the morning and it says it preps your skin for your moisturizer:) try this you'll love it!!

"I loved trying this out. My favorite part is how light and airy it felt on my skin. If I'm honest I'm not one to clean my face, but I can honestly say I don't mind washing it with this. I'll definitely buy after this is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love anything “whipped.” This was no exception. My skin feels clean after use but not too dry. Despite smelling very perfume-like, the fragrance hasn't bothered my sensitive skin at all which is a pleasant surprise! Using this just feels like a luxurious experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am absolutely loving this product I love the function of the pump and that it dispenses the perfect amount of product that I need for my face. I love the very small micro exfoliating beads. (The smaller the more exfoliating) this has an amazing smell I feel similar to the clay mask. This hydrates my dry patches and makes my face feel smooth and leaves my face with an all day freshness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has an amazing scent, and does not dry out my skin! I have hormonal acne, so.in between breakouts, this is an amazing face cleanser to use when I don't need to use medicated face wash. I feel as though the gentle exfoliant really cleans deep into my poors without being too harsh on my skin. Lots of acne products are so medicated or have such a high alcohol content they dry out my skin, however, this product feels amazing on and leaves my skin feeling refreshed."
"Wow! This is my new favorite facial cleanser. As soon as the cleanser was on my face I noticed the wonderful smell! It smells like a high end product. The formula is so soothing and a lot goes a long way. I normally use another Olay cleanser, but I'm switching to this one for my acne prone skin. I received this from Influenster for free for testing purposes."
This was definitely creamy in texture but I wouldn't say it's exactly whipped. It had the perfect amount of exfoliants in the cleanser. My face felt extremely cleansed rinsing it. My face also felt tight. I will definitely use every last drop of this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately disappointed. When i read ""whip"" I imagined a thick, foam like, smooth consistency which this product does NOT have. It feels like a standard gel face wash with tiny grainy beads. I did not enjoy it and did not notice any benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this after using the olay clay mask stick and my skin feels like I left the spa. So clean and renewed. The whipped formula felt great. I received this product from influenster for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Used this for the first time tonight. It was exfoliating but not extremely rough like some products I've tried. And oh em gee lol my face is smoother than a baby's bottom after using hahaha. But really, my face feels amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This gentle whip cleanser is very soft and silky. It made my skin feel very clean and soft after using it. It is not harsh at all. The packaging is nice and the effects are good. I can't tell yet if it has a ton of anti aging benefits, but it time maybe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's really good. Easy to use, it leave your skin feeling really clean and soft. It don't irritate my skin like a lot products do. I try to use it in the morning and before bed to get the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's a great blend of both creamy and exfoliating. The exfoliating is gentle enough to not feel like you're scratching your skin off, but rough enough to feel like you are scrubbing the dirt from the day away. I like it as a before bed cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think olay is the best face product and the things they come up with just keep getting better!! I love how the regenerist cleansing whip facial cleanser is so light weight when u to it on and it makes my face look and feel so clean! I will definitely be putting this cleanser in my daily face cleaning routine!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product works as intended. My face felt clean and was easy to apply. It didn't “whip” as much as I expected but that doesn't make a difference in how it cleans your skin. Overall this is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love a good gentle exfoliating cleanser. My face feels amazing after using olay regenerist cleansing whip facial cleanser. I definitely recommend you try this product. The smell was amazing. I will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has scrubby bits (hoping they're not micro plastic), but more gentle than say a certain fruit pit scrub. Smell isn't terrible, and it rinsed cleanly. My skin did not feel overly dry or tight, but slightly smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So this cleanser was honestly not that bad. I like the bottle with the pump ad it was an ok cleanser. However, my skin feels sticky after using it and I don't feel like it was super deep cleaning. However, when I was coloring my hair I rubbed this on patches of skin that had dye on them and it lifted the hair dye well. I wouldn't purchase this since I have other cleansers I prefer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face wash is very light on the skin. It cleans and exfoliates, not too harshly, and leaves your skin feeling soft. It does have a floral scent that I found pleasant but could be an issue to more sensitive skin. Overall it was a decent face wash that I will continue to use but would not consider it a holy grail item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product squirts out of a top like the top of some shaving cream. I thought the texture would be like foam because of the word “whip.” But instead the texture is a very light cream, which I liked. I wish there was more microdermabrasion beads to help scrub away dead skin cells. I have oily skin and this did not break me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved that this product lathered into a whipped foam. It was easy to apply and smelled amazing. It was easy to remove and it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I would recommend this to friends and family and I plan to purchase this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical at first, I thought it would be like a whip cream foamy thing that wouldn't really exfoliate but I was pleasantly surprised using it in my shower routine in the morning. It was very fresh and light but cleaned so much dirt off my face effortlessly! A little pricey but recommend"
"I love this product omg. When you first apply it, it has a super gritty texture, almost like its exfoliating while moisturizing and afterwards your skin feels so super soft and clean. I have oily skin, but this doesn't make my skin feel oily just moisturized and it smells nice too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this a few days, it's a decent cleanser. It smells great, and has tiny micro scrubbers. Not good for removing makeup, so definitely take off your makeup with a wipe or something first. I haven't had any breakouts yet, which is usually a problem for me. Will continue to use and test out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this facial cleanser with anti-aging yesterday. It was so nice because it did have a scrub agent so my skin felt nice and clean. It was more clear in the morning as well. I would highly recommend this because of the anti aging properties. Go get some now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this product makes my face feel after using it. My skin comes out soft and feeling fresh. The packaging was also a bonus. Easy to get off and start using right away. It has easily become one of my favorite facial cleansers. This product was received free as part of a promotion to test it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this cleanser. I like the light exfoliation, it's a pinch drying for my combination skin. It's very gentle, I'm excited to continue use because I really loved the moisturizer. I will definitely continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was disappointed that this product did not live up to it's name. For this cleanser being called a “whip,” I was expecting a much creamier formulation. With that being said, I loved the micropolishers in the product. It left my skin feeling smooth and clean, and not oily or dried out. I enjoyed using my Olay Fresh Reset Pink Mineral Complex Clay Face Mask Stick after cleansing my face with Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a good cleanser. I have cystic acne prone skin and was impressed that my skin felt clean and not dry or tight. I was a little nervous because there are very fine granules that help exfoliate the skin but it did not aggravate my skin in any way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist Cleansing whip facial cleanser is the best. I will most definitely use this product again. The the packaging is also nice and appealing. This product was very gentle on my skin. I love this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cleanser is as well very creamy and soft at the same time. Leaving my skin feeling super clean and fresh, when you put it on your face it cleanses your pores so deep that it leaves your face very soft and clean. It's a great price for the works of this gem. I would buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The olay whip is pretty neat and smells amazing ! The size is pretty big and it did leave my skin hydrated, only thing is at one point the whip seemed to be too runny but other than that I did like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product pumps out easily and had a pleasant scent. It's slightly exfoliating but I would've liked there too be more of an exfoliating factor. It rinsed off easily leaving the skin soft with no sticky residue which was nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just tried it today! I love the smell it's very clean And it's very refreshing! I didn���t get any foaming/whipping action and it's a little grainy but I actually liked that! I'm not sure how my skin will react but right now I feel fresh and clean! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this cleanser in my Vox Box. I have only used it a few times so far but I am going to make it my regular face cleanser. I am OBSESSED with the texture. It's sort of like lotion/conditioner with the finest exfoliating beads or whatever they are. It makes my skin feel super soft while I am using it as well as after rinsing. Does not make my skin feel dry or overly greasy either. Nice clean smell (I feel like it's typical Olay smell) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really good face wash. Even my husband liked it. Perfect for an everyday use because it's gentle enough that doesn't dry your skin but cleans really good and deep into your pores. I love that it has some tiny beads to help exfoliate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved how easy this was to use. The soap cake out easily into my hands and did not drip when putting it on my face. My face felt very clean after I washed it off. I would recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved this whip cleanser. I was so surprised when I started to rub it on to my face and there were small beads in the product. The beads were not damaging to my skin at all. They actually helped exfoliate my skin to a baby soft feel. Plus the smell of this cleanser is amazing, very fresh and clean! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just started using the olay whip cleanser and I love it! I was surprised by the small cleansing bead surprise. They are just the right amount of scrub that isn't too harsh but just right to get me cleaned right up! It gives me a clean refreshed feeling after cleansing and removed my makeup pretty well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a prefect mix between a creamy silky facial soap with a gentle but effective scrub. It made my skin feel amazing and the smell was even better! I would highly recommend this to a friend of family member! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really excited to receive this Olay Whip cleanser from Influenster to try in exchange for my honest review! I do not care for the cap, but the pump top was ok. I tried using my hands to wash my face with and I didn't care for using the product that way. I prefer to use it with a washcloth. It removes my makeup very quickly though, and leaves my skin feeling clean without being drying. It has a very light clean scent and it exfoliates too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love, love, and loved the regenerist cleanser. It really felt like whip cream. Soft, BUt powerful. Doesn't feel harsh like the normal cleansers but it gets the job done MUCH better than most! Its so very gentle and so very powerful that it amazes me. It's been my go to cleanser since my first use and I may run out sooner then later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure about using a product that has an exfoliant type of feel daily, but this is perfect for me!! I don't have to use a ton to get a good lather going and my skin is really enjoying this product. I'm realizing the importance of having a really good skincare regimen the older I get. I can definitely see me using this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product very much I am almost 30 and suppose I should start thinking about the future of my skin more and possibly, use this more ritualistically.Felt good to use on my face has tiny scrubbing beads In it which felt lovely. Also made my face feel a nice bubbly clean sensation afterwords and feel clean, looked squeaky clean. null [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product. it smelled nice and had a nice exfoliating texture to it. I would not call this a whip but I did enjoy using this for the first time as it was gentle on my sensitive skin. It left my skin feeling very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loving this face wash! It's super light and smooth while using. It leaves my face well hydrated and not feeling goopy or sticky after showering. I also really appreciate the packaging — clean and simple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Olay for years. I try something new and always end up coming back! The regeneration line is my favorite and this whipped formula feels so great! The micro beads give nice exfoliation without being too harsh and my skin looks so bright and polished after! Definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how light this feels on my hand and especially my face. It doesnt feel like I'm putting a glob of grease on and after just one use I can tell a difference of how clean and smooth my skin feels. I'm hoping with continued use I get good anit-aging results as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this cleanser! It feels very light and is accurate to feeling like a ‘whip'. Super light and left my face feeling really clean. I think it is worth the try! I definitely recommend to others too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this free to try and I like it. It cleans nicely and smells great. I like the pump container that makes it easy to get an even amount out at a time. I only didn't give it five stars because it is just a bit harsh with the scrubbing pellets [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wish I could give this more stars! Olay knocked it out of the park with this facial cleanser! Super gentle on the skin. It felt so good going on. Smells amazing! Nice and clean. Skin was amazingly soft after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never tried a product like this so it was my first time and I loved it! A little product can go a long way! I love the foam texture and the little balls it has in the cleanser and it really cleanses my face well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A nice and gentle exfoliator. My faces feels refreshed and clean afterwards. Obviously does not clean eye makeup but does a great job of overall cleaning makeup from pores. I think it is definitely gentle enough to use everyday with mild scrubbing. Face didn't feel too dry afterwards due to the creamy texture but it feels like your pores open up so its the best time to put a serum or serum oil after! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Amazing face wash! It is so gentle and effective on skin. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is better is hard to open and then every time you pump you have to pull the lid back up, however the contents inside are so good! It really does make your face feel soft and a great gentle cleanse. I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super easy to use. I was expecting more of a foam whip type application however it was creamy like a lotion. Smells very good and met my expectations. I have used it several times and would purchase it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this whipped facial cleanser. I love the bottle it comes in, it makes it so easy to use in the shower! It smells wonderful. I have used it for about 2 days now and I can already tell a difference in how smooth and clean my skin feels! I would highly recommend this to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture is fun for sure! It's kind of cool to have a face wash that is already somewhat lathered before it goes on your face! Fresh smell, got rid of most of my makeup but not 100%, so I would recommend using a makeup wipe with these. (Not a big issue to me.) the packaging feels heavy and expensive, and it smells fresh. My skin felt nice a clean but not overly dry after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really surprised with this product. I got it free to test it. I haven't used Olay products in a long time. The formula was interesting, it had little beads to polish the skin and the whip foam was really powerful. The fragrance was a bit powerful, but my skin felt SUPER clean after using it. It made my skin feel polished. I was really surprised by the final product. It definitely made my skin feel better, but it will take a while to see if it has anti-aging effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very fresh, clean smell. Has small, fine exfoliating beads in it that are gentle but seem to get the grime off. My skin felt so smooth and clean after use!! I didn't fully understand the “whip” name, though - seemed not too different from a regular gel cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay does it again! Upon opening the cleanser, I noticed it had a pleasant but light scent. It's easy to use and apply, and I like that it has micro beads to gently remove dead skin and dirt, leaving my skin not only clean but polished. It was a great addition to my skincare routine, because it made my moisturizer work even better. I'm a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So in love with how this cleaners makes me skin feel! It has tiny tiny beads that feel like it's an exfoliate but it's so light like a whip you don't feel it! Going to keep using it! Hopefully it help make me look less tired! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary from Influenster to try out. This facial cleanser is light and starts off a tad gritty which I liked for a deeper clean but light enough to not harshly rub your skin. It gets softer the longer you you rub it in. My skin felt clean and soft after just one use. I now use this wash morning and night and my skin is slightly oily on a daily basis and this product has helped decrease the shiny appearance on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent is not strong! The cleanser is gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I like pump. It helps keep the product sanitized. My face stays clean after using it. With other gentle cleansers, my face is oily shortly after using it. There are seeds that exfoliate your skin. After using the cleanser my skin is not red. My face felt moisturized with no greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this facial cleanser, it smells divine, its texture is soft and it feels so good on my skin that I do not want to stop massaging my skin when I wash it with this cleanser. Leave my skin super soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product few times..I like the formula is so creamy easy to cover all your face and feels gentle. leaves the skin soft and very smooth.takes all the dirt and gives me a special skin gloe. unfortunatetly I have very oily skin specially T zone.so after fee minutes of washing my face I saw it has an oily,shiny feel. so I probably wont use it as often. just when I really need an extra clean after the olay stick.but if you jave normal to dry skin should be perfect for your daily use.

"My acne scars have never looked better!! I'm very pale (I mean kinda pasty around this time of year already if I'm being honest) and hyperpigmentation always seems to get the best of me no matter what cleansers and scrubs I use. I've been using the once a day, at night, for the past four or five days and have noticed clearer, smoother looking skin already. I'm excited to continue use, but if it keeps up this kind of results I will definitely be repurchasing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is by far the best face wash I've tried in a while. I normally just look for something to help with problem areas such as acne for combo skin. I love the smell and the formula is a great consistently and has just the right amount of ""grit"" for it to be exfoliating while cleansing AND moisturizing. I recently started looking for more age defying products so I was excited to get this to test and see what I may be missing out on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this polishing creams cleanser for about a week now. I must say I'm in love with the whipped formula! It's very light and moisturizing! My fave doesn't feel dry when I get out of the shower. I can definitely tell a difference when applying my moisturizer, it's like my skin just soaks it all in. A big bonus that I love about this product is it's kinda exfoliating. For extra moisture try it out with the Olay masks fresh reset! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this cleanser. The micro beads lets me know my skin is getting a nice deep clean and it leaves my skin feeling fresh. I've been using it every morning for the past couple days and it has left my skin with an overall healthy glow. I received this product for free through Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the light feeling of this cleanser! It still has the beads in it so it makes you feel like you're getting a deep clean without a heavy feeling on your face. It also doesn't take more than a dime size amount to cleanse your entire face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"On your fingers it feels so smooth and once you begin to rub it on your face, you can feel the scrub. It's a light exfoliant that left my face looking and feeling amazing. I can't wait to show this product to all my friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this cleanser, so thrilled I got to test it out. I love the whip concept, and the feel of it is amazing on my face. It leaves my face feeling really clean, and it's not harsh on my skin. A little goes a long way, 1 pump should be more than enough. The smell is amazing, I always like a good smelling cleanser, makes it feel like I'm at a spa. Really enjoyed this new product and will definitely recommend to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally liked the texture of this cleanser. My cleanser of choice tends to be more gel-based than creamy, but I found this one to be gentle on my skin and quite effective. I liked the pump versus a tube that you have to squeeze. Feel like it distributes the perfect amount. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Didn't love this cleanser. The grains were a bit too rough for my skin. It wasn't clear that it was a physical exfoliant from the packaging. I did like the way it foamed up and it smelled good. Overall, I wouldn't purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I also got this product I have been liking this combo it's really soft but also works as exfoliator! It has made my skin look healthy and overall I have been enjoying it. I would buy it after this one finishes.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this new Olay Regenerist Whip Facial Cleanser! This is a creamy whip cleanser with tiny micropolishers that hydrates your skin without over drying it. This leaves your skin feeling very moisturizered. I highly recommend this!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this cleanser. It smells amazing and it has a gritty feel which is the ""micropolishers"" thats a fine grit like sand that doesnt irritate. I dont know if i would classify it as whipped..but it made my face feel moisturized and soft after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Holy moly, I have found my new cleanser! Their new whipped formula, combined with the anti-aging stuff, is ahhhh-maaaazing!! Y'all, I have to use an intense moisturizer after I shower or wash my face because my skin gets SO dry, especially in my T zone. I did NOT have to use moisturizer afterwards!!! Oh, and pro tip, you don't need a lot, a little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great face cleanser. I've been using it every night for my skin. I have combination skin with acne, dry skin and sensitive skin. It polishes the skin like a face scrub but it super gentle and does not irritate at all. This stuff smells amazing and only one pump gets super foamy and lathered. I can see an improvement in less than a week in my acne which I've struggled with for years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this every day since I got it... when I go home and get ready for bed I use it to make my skin feel clean and clear when I go to bed... I have always had oily skin this cleans it right up and I don't have to worry about the build up as much the next day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cleanser is wonderful! You only need one pump of product to cleanse your face! It was gentle, I could probably use it every day, but has an exfoliating aspect that left my skin feeling super clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to admit I'm not a fan of whip products so I was iffy about it but I'm beyond glad I gave it a shot and actually really liked it ! It did not dry up my face it made my face feel so clean and smooth and fresh it change my opinion of whip products it didn't turn watery in my hand after I pumped a bit which I loved I can say I'm in love with how my skin feels and looks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received it free in a voxbox. I really like the pump style packaging. Really nice for travel. It pumped out like a nice light foamy cleanser. I was pleasantly surprised that it had the little micro scrubbers, they weren't too harsh . When I rinsed my skin felt nice and smooth with no irritation. It didn't have any particular fragrance. I will enjoy continuing using this as my daily cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What can I say about this product. I really liked it and it's super easy to wash your face. The only two things I did not like is the smell. For something going on your face you would think it would have a good smell but it smells real weird. The other thing I did not like is that it's super easy to over pump because at first you don't really know how much your putting on. It's super foamy and when your scrubbing your face it works wonders. Other than the smell I'm all for it again!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip facial cleanser complimentary but my opinions are my own. It was definitely neat to try because I'm used to a liquid cleanser. This product was more like an awesome exfoliant-cleanser super hero mashup. I tried it first thing in the morning and my skin was super soft all day long. I would probably try this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this product. It is some what gritty in your hands and on your face. It does feel wired taking the mask off. But I love the after effects it leaves. Your skin is nice and soft and shiny and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cleanser has a really good small also I love that it has a pump to distribute the product. After using the cleanser it made my skin really bright and clear and very soft to the touch.

"This was such a nice experience! Not only is the product easy ti dispense with this bottle, but also the formula is light and smells good, in a clean way. I enjoyed the small amount exfoliating particles un the formula that help to truly deep-cleanse and renew the skin. I used alongside a spin brush and was excited to rinse it off and have smooth, clean and fresh skin afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in my complimentary VoxBox from Influenster. I used it for the first time last night. I was a little shocked how it could be whipped but yet have exfoliating particles in it. I applied it while I was in the shower. It got rid of a lot of dry skin that I had from my acne medicine and it left my skin feeling clean and smooth. I would highly recommend it. I will be using it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was so good! At first I was sceptical as I thought it would be like shaving cream. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. I felt like it truly cleaned my face and scrubbed off all the dead skin cells. I will be recommending this product to everyone I know! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a lightly exfoliating cleanser, which is exactly what I've been looking for but couldn't find one I was satisfied with! Not exactly what i consider microdermabrasion but feels pleasant on the skin. It's nice a creamy, slightly whipped, has a nice friendly scent and I am definitely looking forward to using in my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"O..M..G guys you have got to try this whip cleanser! It is like no other! This is my first time using this brand and not only does it look cute on the outside, but the whipped cleanser makes you feel clean and fresh! the little micropolishers help clean and take moisturizers better which means better results! I highly recommend this product to friends and family! It also helps with anti aging which is a plus for me since I'm a busy, stressful mom running after my 3 year old lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was a bit of a toss up for me.. but was surprisingly surprised with the results..I like that a small amount goes a long way and that the little micro beans act like an exfoliating agent at the same time as a cleanser.. my skin felt so very soft after use.. really enjoyed this..

"Loves it! It's just like the package says! It's feels like air! It's so soft, it makes a very very light foam and it also exfoliate your face.

I Love Love Love this cleanser. I've used so many different brands of cleansers but none have left my face feeling this good. I use it along with the Olay mask clay stick and I feel it's the perfect combo. From now on this will be the only face cleanser I buy. I've already recommended to both my sisters and mom. That's how much I love it. :) oh and it also smells really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like the packaging and the texture of the cleanser when it comes out. It does have a grit to it which I didn't expect for a ‘whipped' product. It seems to clean my face well without stripping it and leaving it dry. Would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to begin by saying this facial cleanser is amazing! The packaging is great, the pump is easy and does not release a ton of product, which is good because a little goes a long wait with this cleanser! The cleanser smells great and exfoliates really well. It left my face feeling hydrated and clean! I have tried so many different cleansers at all price ranges and I will definitely continue to use this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cleanser. I just used it for the first time and it completely removed my face makeup. It has a little bit of exfoliant in it, which made my skin feel even softer. Very happy with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow ! This has to be the best cleanser I've tried ! Thanks to Influenster for sending it complimentary for me to try out because i wouldn't had purchased it on my own. It has beads but they're not rough but it still feels like it's actually washing my face. One pump is more than enough. Favorite part is when washing off the product my skin didn't feel dry or tight, it actually get moisturizing! Love this product. Definitely going to purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay regenerist cleansing whip facial is a all in one. It has nice packaging, overall appearance was good and appealing. The product does not have the whipped texture that I was expecting but was lighter than other facial cleansers. I did like how it was a little gritty so exfoliated while washing which was nice and my skin felt soft afterwards and not dried out like with other cleansers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this Olay Regerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleaner to try. I have horribly dry, sensitive skin that is prone to rosacea flare ups. So I'm constantly putting on moisturizer. This did not irritate my skin. And my face lotion seemed to really soak in after using this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This okay cleansing whip facial cleanser is so nice. It gently exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling super smooth. The whipped texture also leaves my dry skin so moisturized. You also get a lot of product so it lasts a good while. I have really enjoyed this cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is by far THE best facial cleanser Ive ever used! I love the light airy feeling to it when applying to your face and the gentle scrub you get for that deep clean feeling! My face is so smooth and refreshed just after 3 days use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoy this cleanser. I have sensitive skin, and it didn't irritate at all. The smell is nice but not overwhelming and I was pleasantly surprised at the balance between a good lather and the small exfoliants. It made my skin feel soft & clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The olay cleansing whip facial cleanser was great! First thing when I opened it and used it I spelt a wonderful fragrance. Not too strong, but strong enough you can smell it and I think it smells really good. When rubbing it on my face it has a grainy texture to it which I love in a cleanser. It left my face feeling smooth and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never found a cleanser that I've all around loved but Okay delivered. It left my skin feeling clean but not overly clean. And it definitely helped with my moisturizing. New favorite. Looking forward to trying out the Total Effects Cleansing Whip. #complenetary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free for review from influenster. I've been using it for a few days now and I love it. My face feels so soft and smooth! It doesn't whip up as much as I expected it would between wet hands, but it doesn't have to. I fully intend on buying more once this bottle is gone. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrubby cleanser works well, my skin felt soft and clean after using it. The smell is a little strong and I don't usually care for scents in my skincare but it didn't seem to bother my sensitive skin. The beads are a little bigger than I usually like but it's safe for everyday use so that's nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Regenerist cleaner is def a everyday use, it doesnt over dry ur skin, and works well for sensitive skin. I used this first before the Olay Mask and they work well together. I would def keep in my shower for my everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off, I loved the scent of this product. I apply it to my face every morning and night and absolutely love how it works. It starts out as a cream texture with tiny beads in it, and as you work it into the skin, it creates a foamy texture. My face feels very refreshed and clean after I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So it's sort of like a scrub, it's got those little beads in it that you feel as you massage your face. But my face felt so refreshed and even had a glow to it afterwards! I felt like my youth was restored! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleansing whip facial cleanser does not disappoint! It lathers so well, and really deep cleans your face without drying it out. I really enjoy the fresh clean scent, and I love how clean my face feels after I use it! I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of course I have to try this product the day I receive it in the mail! Olay did it again with the smells! I'm very picky when it comes to smells on my face, the cleansing whip facial cleanser has such a wonderful aroma I almost didn't want to wash it off! This cleanser left my face feeling so moist and refreshed. There are small grainy things in the cleanser that I'm not too sure about but overall I am very excited about this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Actuappy a very nice face wash. It contains microdermabrasion type scrubs that are mild yet enough to scrub off dead skin. The consistency of the face wash is close to shave cream but not as thin as shaving cream. If this brand were cruelty free i would repurchase. Unfortunately they choose to test on animals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the way this product feels on the skin. I was excited to receive Olay as my first VoxBox, as they have a great skincare reputation. The skin polishers felt like they exfoliate well without feeling harsh or rough on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised this was a cream cleanser with exfoliants. It is definitely a soft cleanser you can use daily or every other day because it isn't harsh on your skin like many exfoliating cleansers. Also, my skin felt softer and smoother after two uses. Only downside is the smell. Kind of smelled like windex. I received this product for free for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Cleansing whip is great to use. I love how it comes in a pump container and it dispenses just the right amount in your hand. All you need is one pump, you really don't need to use to much product. It definitely moisturized my face while cleaning and i could tell because after i rinsed and pat my face dry it didn't leave my skin feeling dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try this ever since I found out I was getting this box,and I wasn't disappointed!The whipped cleanser feels amazing.It has a light exfoliator that made my skin feel amazing.I would recommend this as a daily cleanser,especially for anyone with dry skin,it left my skin feeling really soft and smooth.

Olay Polishing Creme Cleanser has a creamy whipped texture that makes your skin a younger looking after every wash. It is infused with vitamins and extracts that makes your skin firmer and hydrated. I do recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a really good scent. I didn't realize how abrasive it was until I started to fun it into my face. It left my skin clean and smooth but it is rough when you are first putting it on your face. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First of all this product will last you a long time because a little goes a long way! It did a great job exfoliating my skin, but I will probably use it up to twice a week because it was pretty powerful. I also liked that there was no strong scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Here's what I loved about the product: easy to dispense, nice clean aroma, micro crystals to clean deep into those pores (yet nonabrasive). Here's what I didn't like: the container is flimsy- I dropped it in the shower and the plastic base is such thin plastic that it cracked and broke. I also felt like this is the same as any other Olay cleanser. I have used a lot of different cleansers from this brand, and don't feel like it's any different or better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like Olay products. This was my first time using the product and it will not be my last! The packaging was very nice and there was definitely a difference in my face after using this product! I enjoyed the consistency of the formula and will use again!

"First impression for someone with combo skin at first I was thinking it was going to leave my skin oily, but its not oily but my skin feels super hydrated. The smell is amazing like a light version of Chanel Chance Eau Tendre perfume. I love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great cleanser. Truly feels light as air when pumped onto your hand, but has a thick, creamy texture when applied to the face. The polishing factor is not the strongest in this product but it does remove dead skin cells. It is, however, the most hydrating face polishing cleanser I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this facial cleanser this morning. I love how it felt so light and not thick on my face. It was very effective in cleansing my face. This is my first time trying it and I'm impressed! I would purchase this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loveeeee this cleanser! I was using a high end brand cleanser before this. I am making the switch over to this one! The whipped feeling makes it feel like you are applying a moisturizer to your face until you wash it off and your face feels so clean and hydrated. It feels like it cleans my skin so well yet it still hydrates my skin perfectly. Make sure to dampen your hands and face before applying. It really helps. You should really try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Only need one pump of this to get a good lather. It smells really good and it has little beads to exfoliate the skin . It's affordable and gets the job done ! My skin felt really clean after using it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Let me just say i love this product. I appreciate the fact that it comes with a small cap to close off the hole so the product doesnt leak out. Moving foward the formula was something different it came out as a cream but inside were small beads to exfoliate the skin. My skin feels very clean and it lookes brighter. Just make sure you really wash the little beads off good . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product provides a nice, mild exfoliation. A little bit goes a long way and it has a pleasant smell. It wasn't too drying and it didn't irritate my skin at all. It seems like a good cleanser. Overall, definitely worth a try! Note: I received Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanserfor free to review as part of a contest, but these are my own opinions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super good! I love the texture of it! And how amazing it leaves my skin! It's very gentle on the skin! I'm really going to start purchasing these products. It exceeded my expectations! Absolutely love It! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay's Regenerist cleaning whip facial cleansers feels like your everyday exfoliating cleanser with a twist. The creamy product helps cleanse and exfoliates delicate skin with their carob seeds and vitamin B3 combinations. The only problem I have with this product is it's misleading “light as air” label. Exfoliating products are never feels like air. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product does a great job at cleansing, but I don't get the whip aspect so much. It doesn't whip up as much as I thought it would. That being said it exfoliates well and the packaging is super easy to use. I'm eager to see the anti aging benefits too as I continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok so I opened my voxbox and was super excited to see full sized products. So I used this tonight for the first time. And it's super awesome it does sud like soap so it's easier to use in the shower bc it will be in ur eyebrows and hairline. It's got a grainy feel to it so my face feels super clean and it didnt feel dried out after I was done drying my face. 10/10 would totally buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just received this in a voxbox, however, I must say I would buy it even if I wasn't sent it. This product is really nice. It smells great and works well. The only complaint I have is that it was difficult to wash off. But, I dont mind spending an extra min washing it off. It just depends on if that is a deciding factor for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser was my favorite part of the Olay box I received. It was really gentle on the skin and felt super creamy and luxurious. The exfoliating in it was gentle enough that I could see myself using it every day and it did not feel irritating to my skin at all. I don't know if someone with acne or oily skin would wanna use it everyday but it was a nice treat for my skin. I would recommend this for sure to anyone especially someone with drier skin.

"I absolutely loved the Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleaner. It was such a light product on my face as it foamed up, but still had some cleaning power to it. It made my face feel nice and refreshed after a long days work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit hesitant on the consistancy of this product, however I was grossly mistaken. The whip makes a great light lather while the light exfoliation preps your skin for renewal. My face had such a glow after rinsing, this is definitely going to be a must have in my routine! Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Olay Regenerist Cleansing Whip Facial Cleanser has a very light feel to it when you first use it. It almost seems like you dont have enough in your hands to wash your face, then it foams up so nice!

"I actually really love this product. I don't think I've tried Olay products in years, and this was a great one to jump back in with. The whipped formula made it super soft, and it was super exfoliating. I think I found my new cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love love anything Olay. They are my preferred drugstore option face product. It made my skin feel super soft and smelled amazing. It also helps with anti aging. I mean you can never start too early cleansing your face and taking care of it. I could go on and on about this product. Buy ladies buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cleanser is uniquely packaged and has a design for that is one off a kind. Smell does not come of strongly which is a plus. It activates with warm water and as it's massaged into the skin, you can feel the creamy texture. It leaves your skin deeply cleansed and I could feel a firmess I my skin after one use. I love it, it feels light, a little goes a long way and my skin feels refreshed. Thanks olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary and let me just say I slept on Olay products but now I really enjoy them. This Whip is very gentle to my acne prone skin and by me being a first time user I was skeptical. But it turned out to be very good and I will recommend it to others [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is a really nice cleanser!! I like that it is in packaging with a pump, because that makes it really easy to use. This cleanser has a nice light skin care type scent that is not overwhelming. The cleanser does a really nice job of taking off all my makeup and cleaning out my pores. My absolute favorite thing about this cleanser is that it has tiny little micro beads that gently exfoliate your skin and help to thoroughly clean it.

"I received this in my newest VoxBox for free. It is a product I would buy though. It's a perfect product to use to wash your face before you go to bed or after a long day at work. Your face immediately feels cleaner and you can feel the difference in your skin before and after use. I never considered Olay a product I'd ever buy, but I plan on continuing to use this product after my sample of it is done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This face wash is pretty nice! I am definitely a fan of the micro-sized pumice in the formula and it does smell nice, but I don't think I'd switch from my current line (Mary Kay Acne line). I have moderate cystic acne and while this cleanser is nice, it doesn't keep the acne at bay like I need. For someone without my skin issues, I can see where it would be a favorite!

"I got this in a box, and I've only tried it once, but my I like my initial impression. It comes out like a whip, but according to the instructions you should still lather. It has small micro particles that gets let's coarse after you lather, I think it's be good for an exfoliation cleanse [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay regenerist cleansing whip is a quick way to get clean, renewed skin before applying moisturizer. Begin by wetting your face then lather the soap in wet hands to create the whip (which smells amazing) and massage into your skin. Rinse, dry and feel revitalized. I was so happy to have tested this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This smells amazing!! It has little beads within to help exfoliate your face while washing it. It was gentle on my skin and left me feeling refreshed after.
