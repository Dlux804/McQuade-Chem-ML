I bought this about a week ago and I was very skeptical about it because most moisturizers leave your skin looking like a grease ball if you have dry skin or you will still have a dry patch of skin . But my skin seems to react to this very well it leaves my skin hydrated and my make up lasted longer with it too which is a double plus super happy
"I've had a lifetime of allergies and most lotions irritate my skin. This one does not. It's a cool gel, almost like aloe vera and it glides on smoothly and your skin is left soft for the whole day. Normally I'm reapplying other lotions several times throughout the day but this has rejuvenated my skin. I love it!"
"I do not have particularly dry skin but I love Garnier products so I thought I would try this moisturizer because I like Gel type products on my skin. I love how light weight it feels on my skin, and how it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all. It also provides a really nice base for my foundation to go on so I have stopped using my primer. I also got a little red after being in the sun this weekend and so I applied this at night and when I woke up the redness had gone and my skin didn't feel at all tight or dry."
I love this gel-creme from Garnier. It works as well (if not better) than the department store brand I have been using that costs 3 times as much. It is fresh and clean smelling and sinks in quickly so I don't have to wait a long time before putting on makeup. It erased the redness I had from my skin being dry in just 2 applications. I'm going to use this rather than the department store brand from now on.
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I had never used a gel cream for dry skin. I'm actually used to medium to heavy facial creams and thought that was the only way to go for soft skin. But this product has definitely changed my mind about that. It's very light and refreshing to your skin. It rubs in very quickly unlike some lotions. And it doesn't feel like it's just sitting on your skin and just making it shiny. After you rub it in you'll notice how soft your skin feels. I would definitely buy it again.
"Started using this about a year ago. Really love it, replaced ""Origins"" with this brand and very satisfied at a lot less expense. Have already told all my friends tool"
I like this moisturizer. It goes on with a refreshing cool feeling and doesn't feel like you have anything on your face after - your skin just feels smooth and moist. The only thing I didn't love was that I can't wear it under makeup during the day. It just got kind of peely when I put makeup on over. Since I do like it though I will continue to use it at night.
"My face in never hydrated and I am always changing my moisturizers out trying to find the next best thing. I was a complete skeptic when I realized that this was a gel. When you think gel, you think about drying out, not moisturizing. To my surprise, it actually does moisturize and did not dry me out. It has a tiny bit of a cooling sensation that feels good on the skin. I am looking pretty hydrated these days."
"Pros: My face felt well hydrated and not like it was covered in goop residue. Cons: This stuff looks, feels and smells just like hair gel, it felt weird spreading it all over my face. No pro-retinol or alpha-hydroxy. All in all it was just ok. Not sure I would go for it again."
"I am not used to gels, so I wasn't a huge fan of this product, I am more of a lotion user. Pro's to the product: is not greasy, cool feeling. con's: kind of sticky. Does hydrate your skin and is refreshing (which comes with a gel feeling), however gels are not for me."
Feelss grwat on the skin and doesnt feel greasy at all. I have oily skin and I dont recommend this for dry skin at all. I feel thats more of a marketing tactic. It absorbs super quick but my skin feels like it wants more
"This gel is nice upon application. It feels cool, smells nice, and it doesn't feel sticky (dries off pretty quickly). I have combination type skin, so it is pretty moisturizing on certain areas. But for some reason, towards my lower cheek areas it still feels dry and is not as hydrating as I would like."
"I thought it was a pretty good product. I tend to prefer creams rather than gels, this is more a gel than a gel-cream and it felt at first like I was putting hair gel on my face! but yes its does a good job moisturizing, not the best facial cream I've used but for the price it's great value."
"I have to say that I do not love this. It feels really great and refreshing and I like that it is not heavy on the skin, this way I can wear it at anytime. I don't however like the alcohol scent. I think it is so strong that I rub it on my hands and air it out a bit. After that, I apply it all over my face and once the alcohol scent goes away, then I can appreciate the actual scent of this moisturized. Other than that scent, I like this product and I would like to use it without having to air it out."
"I love the Gel type cream. Goes on smooth. I have perfect skin for a 73 year old, but thought it was time to start taking care of it. Never a zit before, and evidently this added too much moisture.....because I got two whiteheads. Will only used every few days from now on."
"I have combination skin, and this moisturizer has been great! The gel is light and absorbs qickly without leaving my skin feeling greasy or weighted down by products. I really enjoy using this after washing my face allowing for easy absorption and all over moisturizing. Highly recommended!"
Garnier moisture gel-cream is nice cream especially for dry skin. It is very light and spreads easily on the face so it easily goes with any makeup. Its not too greasy. After using this product for more than couple of months i feel it made my face even smoother and soft.
Perfect for getting your skin back to tip top shape! Im a repeat user and find this product so good for my skin. The price is great and the packaging is very nice
"This is a product I really liked I just wish the size was bigger because I feel like it ran out pretty quickly since I would use it morning and night. I love the scent, and because its a gel moisturizer it never felt to heavy on my skin."
I have dry skin and use moisturizer every night before bed and in the morning after I wash my face. I like this product a lot because it wasnt too heavy on my skin and I actually felt like it worked and wasnt greasy which is something I need in a moisturizer. I would recommend!
Very happy with this product after done using it your face literally glows it was my first time buying it it was super effective I loved it not disappointing at all super gentle and it would give your have a nice pull. I really loved this product 10/10 would recomendable.
"I love this product, it's the same as the clinique brand but this is so affordable!!! Very effective!! As soon as I put this on my face, my skin absorbs it right up!!! Especially on a warm day, the gel feels very nice!! Packaging is pretty. Again, it would be better if it contained sunscreen."
"I bought this cream in winter when my skin was a bit dry, it smelled amazing and I loved the packaging, usually i do really good with garners products. But for some reason this cream didn't do it for me, I had major breakouts and the cream only functioned as a layer on top of my skin it never absorbed, i was really disappointed."
I really liked this gel cream. I came with an opened mind not expecting much since most don't work but this one mett my expectations. It didn't leave a sticky residue behind. The formula had a good consistency. It also smelled very appealing. I would deffinatly recommend to others.
"This face cream feels so amazing on the skin. It immediately calms the skin and feels very hydrating. I used to use a very expensive face cream with a similar texture, but I am now able to get 3 tubs of this cream for the price of 1 of the other! it is just a lovely face cream and I highly recommend it!"
I'm an avid user of the combo/normal moisturizer but I was too dry during the winter so I decided to give this a shot. It's not as light and leaves me a little too greasy. It does not work well under makeup. I wouldn't buy this again but rather my trusty combo/normal one.
I really like this moisturizer so far. It reminds me of the Clinique moisture surge like a total dupe. My fave feels very hydrating definitely effective. I will definitely be purchasing this again highly recommend
"I have dry skin and this product was moisturizing enough to last through the day, but lightweight enough not to leave an oily residue or finish. I would recommend this product for normal to dry skin. I also love the clean and refreshing scent."
If you are looking for a cream for dry skin. Then I would recommend this. It is very light and spreads well on the skin and your skin will feel hydrated. Also it does not have a dtorng perfume rather it has a very light fruit like smell.
"This was so refreshing on my skin. Not only that, but it smelled amazing! Id have days where my dry skin needed that little extra love, and this left my skin glowing! one of my favorite affordable moisturizers."
"Product wise - this is a good product. It smells nice and feels good on face. My face was dry for few days but after two days of applying it, it starts to show good progress. Now, my skin is smooth and moist."
Good product. Easy application. Glides on really well. Handy. Met my expectations. Good packaging. Well suited my texture and tone. No improvements required. Quite gentle tooo.
"I have rosacea and this is the only moisturizer I can use that doesn't set my skin on fire. Gentle and does not make my skin oily, which it naturally is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"very reasonable price, refreshing and effective moisturizer. use a little on larger face areas and a tad more around the eyes and lips. I can feel my skin is supple HOURS later. smells nice, it is a gel. I will be 65 and I love how it feels"
Nothing new to add that others haven't already said - a light gel that spreads well and dries fast and moisturises the facial skin well enough. Smells fresh and the scent is light - great as night cream / gel.
It's a great gel cream. It's not greasy or thick. It's quiet smooth and smells very refreshing. I use it as a moisturizing cream. It doesn't look oily and makes my face look good. I like it and worth buying it.
I love how smooth the texture of the product is. I am a person who has very dry skin so this bbn product brought oils to my face that helped me from breaking out. It is a great value it is the drug store pricess that keeps me going back to get this product
"I have a little dry skin sometimes, this cream has helped me feel hydrated all day. I've been using it for two weeks and it's really good and its packaging is nice, small and compact. Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for Dry Skin"
I like it so much are you ready to fight you to buy right now it's amazing amazing amazing and the really really really beautiful product and the packaging my God I really like it I really device you to buy it right now please and then amazing product
Probably one of my favorite gel moisturizers for the spring/summer. I'm not a huge fan of the packaging (jar) because it's not practical for a lazy gal like me where I use my hands for everything and can't be bothered to grab another utensil to slather the product all over my face. I wouldn't necessarily say that oily/combo people couldn't use this... you could really use either one - there's a green one meant for oily/combo skin.
"I love this product. I use it daily, two times a day. I've been using it for about 6 months, and continue to use it. I wouldn't change anything about this. The packaging is very nice and cute. It's got some weight. I will continue to buy this product!"
I really like this stuff!! A little bit goes a long way too. It feels moisturizing but it doesn't feel thick and heavy on your face. Which I really love. It's definitely gentle on your face and it's not super smelly or anything so it just feels clean and refreshing.
"I love using this moisturizer, even though I have oily/combination skin. I can get away with using a smaller amount and the gel texture doesn't clog my pores. The availability at the drugstore and the affordable price point is a huge plus too!"
"I love this product! In the winter, it helped my dry face with burning or feeling greasy or sticky. I feel like it even helped eliminate breakouts. Because it is a gel, I was skeptical but it's great! I will buy it again."
"I love this product. I received it as a gift, and continue to purchase it when I can! It leaves your feeling super energized and refreshed. I recommend it!"
"I liked this product because Ive suffered from dry skin around my forehead area for a long time, but this product really helps. You start seeing results very quickly!"
"This product was great, however I have really dry skin so i felt as though my skin dried up and absorbed the cream really fast, it was quite gentle on the skin though. Afforabke price."
What I like most about this product is it didn't leave any sticky residue on my face I would definitely recommend this to anybody who has dry skin I was not disappointed it was definitely effective and very gentle for my sensitive skin
This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. It goes on nice and cool and feels amazing. I put a little extra on and let it seep into my skin. I have oily skin and it never makes me greasy. Just a tiny bit goes a long way. Love the packaging too!
"I am 47 and my skin has started drying out. This is the best product, and I have used many brands and many types. I use a small amount and it completely covers my face. I feel hydrated all day, instantly. It isn't greasy, doesn't cause my skin to break out and I can see a difference! . My skin even feels better to the touch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After pregnancy my skin developed an extreme sensitivity to almost all moisturizers and lotions. I can't even us baby products or hypoallergenic products. A friend let me borrow her Moisture Rescue for a weekend and I've been hooked ever since! I can't say enough great things about this product! ZERO oiliness, NO breakouts, and it really really moisturizes my skin. Before this product I had dry scaly skin on my face and this stuff cleared it right up!"
"I've been through so many different moisturizers and this one is my absolute fav. Other moisturizers tend to break me out, but this one is super lightweight but provides the perfect amount of moisture. No lie, I've used over 10 of these and will continue to buy more."
"Bought this a few months ago because my face has always been dry, I would use it here and there and liked it, however now that it's creeping into winter my skin is very dry and I'm trying to use it every day, and I see a huge difference! I can tell when I go too long without it! Works AMAZING for the price. The only caveat is that it's not something that I think should be worn under makeup, so only use it at night or on days where I'm not planning on being out much!"
"This is my 4th day using this product for dry skin and ladies I will admit that my skin absolutely LOVES this gel-cream!!! I have extremely dry skin and it does exactly what it says it does, ""locks in moisture."" I use this gel-cream everyday both morning before applying my makeup and at night after I have cleansed my face. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!"
"I love this gel so much bc I have dry skin, and my skin usually feels very greasy when I apply lotions. I love that it is light weight and actually makes my skin look healthy and radiant. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is bc the product does tend to run out fast."
"This product felt great at first application, light, cooling. But within 5 minutes my face felt like I had dried glue on it. I had to wash it off. I'm not sure what that is about that the face doesn't remain feeling moisturized........but I'm bringing it back. Fail."
"I absolutely love this product! Winter has been harsh on my skin but this gel has worked wonders. Personally, I think it smells great. At first it was a little weird using a gel as opposed to a lotion but after application, it dries nicely and I love the feel of it. I really can feel a difference since I first started using the product to now, and for the price, you just can't beat it. My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a bigger size."
Worked great will buy again. Loves how it helped my dry skin. The price was a good price I would say for skin care. I would like it if it was a little cheaper. It met all my expectations. The package was nice. I highly recommend it to others with dry skin.
Super soft and gentle cram for smooth and refreshed skin. It has nice packing. I used it for the first time and I will buy it again. It has good value and it's affordable. I will definitly become repeat user. i recomend it to all my friends with dry skin.
im in love with this product its just amazing like I can't even describe how effective it is I recommned this product and yes it did meet my expections its perfect I would totally. buy it again okay each one of us will love a product but try this one its amazing
This product is my all time favorite. I use it all the time. It is so effective and I love it so much. I can't live without it. It is gentle on my skin and feels so nice on my skin. It is a must have in my household. I would recommend this to all of my friends.
I do not use this product year round but I do like to use this during the dry winter months. Garnier is an affordable brand that I find to be reliable and trustworthy. I love how hydrated this makes my skin feel when it gets dry due to chilly winter weather.
I LOVE this gel cream. It is very light and refreshing. Its cool so when you put it on it makes you feel fresh and awake. My skin feels so soft after the first application. Unlike most moisturizes this one doesnt feel thick and coated. Also has a nice smell! Love and great product for the price!!
I used to use this years ago for my dry skin. I like how it felt on my skin and I would say it is effective. I stopped using it because I found an alternative. The product is gentle on the skin and I used it twice daily! I would recommend it if you have dry skin.
"don't sleep on this moisturizer, it quickly absorbs, without leaving that thin layer or product that sometimes ends up being the reason your primer/foundations ends up looking patchy. not this stuff. it's gentle on acne, just a little sting, but definitely leaves you feeling that locked in moisture!"
"its very very nice and very very light weight, if you are searching for something that is very nice to apply this is the best product for you guys its very gentle you must try this one, you will never regret that you use this kind of product from yours truly garnier"
"This is one of the absolute best creams I've ever tried. Really locks in the moisture, absorbs very quickly, weightless, my skin feels fabulous! Texture is different from creams, but I totally love it. I have extremely dry skin and usually have to keep applying cream throughout the day, not the case here, once in the morning and once at night is sufficient. One thing I am wondering thou if this has SPF, does not say it on the box (or I have not found it), that would be and improvement. I will be buying it over and over."
"My favorite, by far, off all of my moisturizers. It's not greasy, gives a fabulous non-matte look and I love the way my face feels after."
"I love this product. It is so@lightweight but moisturises so well. My skin feels really smooth when I use it, with no greasiness or stickiness."
My favourite moisturiser. I like the fact that comes as a gel and doesnt stay sticky on the skin. Leaves skin very smooth and has a nice smell.
I use this product daily - I have dry skin and this product adds so much hydrating moisture to my face.
Smells delicious and its really smooth! I love the sensation on my skin! Really effective and at a good price! I hope we can get a bigger version of this amazing gel-cream!
"I LOVE this product! It smells really good, skin feels refreshed and moisturized. Its very affordable. Definitely one of my fav moisturizers and its affordable too!!!"
"Really good affordable product, really gentle on the skin not as intense as expectations, would recommend to others with normal to combination skin, i found this product did help with dry skin"
i LOVE this product SOOOOOOO Very much!!!! I use this product ALLLL the TIME! It NEVER has let me down!!! it does the job it is supposed to!!!!!
Love this moisturizer! I find that the gel moisturizer works better for my skin and does not clog my pores like the cream moisturizer does.
Love the fresh feeling I get when I apply this creamer at night. I especially love that its not greasy. Absolutely love!!!
"This stuff smells like Rose's! Very lightweight, Jelly/serum consistancy. Feels Very gentle and absorbs quickly."
"I really like the feeling of this on my face, I got it on sale and a little goes a long way! It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft for a few hours."
this is one of my moms' favorite moisturizers! she always uses it before applying her makeup! it makes her foundation lay on her skin super smoothly
I had very dry skin this winter so some body told me to use it it is miracle love it very smooth cream
this product left my face feeling well hydrated. its comparable with clinique moisture surge in my opinion. And much much cheaper. i'll definitely buy this again :)
I love this moisturizer. I have combination acne-prone skin and this does not make my skin feel oily or cause me to breakout. The moisturizer does not feel heavy and absorbs very quickly
"Lightweight and spreads evenly. Not used to a gel, but works great as a night moisturizer. Dried pretty fast after application and did not feel oily. Gave it an average rating since it is an average moisturizer."
Just started using this product and so far Im loving it! Works well at moisturizing my face and leaving it feel smooth and fresh! No noticeable scent and a great value for at how well it works!
One of my favorites for the harsh winter months or any time my skin is feeling in need of some extra hydration. The gel is cooling on skin and leaves skin revitalized and moisturizer. The packaging is nice too as it is sturdy.
I have repurchased this product multiple times. I prefer a gel over a cream moisturizer. This has a light pleasant scent and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.
"This gel works way better than I expected. You don't need much to cover your face and neck, it absorbs nicely and my face is super soft after. I wish it lasted longer than a few hours."
"I have oily acne prone skin. This moisturizer is great for my skin type! It doesn't clog my pores or increase oil production, but it still effectively moisturizes my skin."
"Really works wonders! Makes skin soft and really moist. The gel works wonders and works for all skin types, being very gentle on skin. However, proceed with caution if using is after exfoliant or a peel. Recommend to try because it really does work!"
I did enjoy this product!! It made my skin feel very nice and soft. I don't know if this was the product or just my own skin but after I ran out my skin started to have a lot of dry patches.
I've been using this in combination with another product for about a year now. I mainly use this one at night. It makes the fine lines coming down from my eyes completely disappear. It goes on smoothly and has nearly no scent.
"IT'S GREAT! It keeps my skin moisturized. Within a week, my skin was starting to clear from my pimples. It keeps it smooth, smells nice, love the packaging. It's very gentle for the face, I have sensitive skin. Most definitely would buy more."
"I just bought this product and the difference in my skin is like night and day. I honestly would wake up with horrendous texture and flaky skin, now using this product my skin is so smooth and refreshed in the morning. Definitely worth a try!"
"Easy to open container, smelled nice, seems like it will last a long time too :) would recommend to anyone with dry skin that actually ""works"" for a living!"
"the gel is different. it has the typical garnier fresh smell, which isnt a bad thing because i HATE musky smelling moisterizers. one of the best drugstore moisterizers ive ever used. def gonna continue to use. very refreshing and instantly my face looked so much more hydrated. if you use this before makeup allow ample setting time and use a primer !"
I would need to try it more to give a completely honest review however I have normal to dry skin. Since it's currently the winter I am chronically battling the drying wind and this felt like my face was drinking a glass of water. Would love to try out more!
I looove this cream so much ! I have a sensitivity skin and dont really like thick heavy or very oily creams! This gelly texture suits my skin perfectly! It smells lovely and leaves skin really brightened and smooth! Love it ! Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for Dry Skin
I have very dry skin and this has worked so well for me! I love the gel consistency and it feels so cool and refreshing when you put it on. My face has become so soft with this and I've had it for about a month or so and started noticing results after like 2 weeks. Great price too.
This is my first time trying the pink moisturizer. I usually buy the green one (for oily skin). Both are excellent products with almost the same results. I got the pink one this time as my winter skin is drier. I mix with a facial oil and my skin drinks it in. Love this!
"This stuff is actually extremely affordable which is always an amazing start! I suffer with dry skin so I'm always looking for new products to make my face feel that little bit more moisturised and hydrated... this for succeeds at doing that! It applies great on the skin and doesn't dry you out at all, it's gentle and actually doesn't make me breakout which is a miracle in itself!"
I've been using this product for over a year and I'm starting to think I'm an addict! I have super dry skin and I apply this every morning before I leave the house as it's the only thing that stops me from looking patchy. Are you guys giving away a lifetime supply? Because I could definitely use it!
"If you have dry skin give it a try, works well under makeup too!"
I use this as my morning and daily moisturizer. It's not too thick to use before I apply my makeup and the gel consistency feels amazing on my skin in the mornings. The smell is very nice but it's not too overpowering. The only downside is how fast you go through the product. I'm almost done of my second jar.
"I have yet to try s Garnier product that I don't absolutely love! From shampoos to conditioners, to masks and creams. They smell good. They work well. They're inexpensive. Easy to find. I highly recommend Garnier products and will definitely buy again"
Love this product so much! It's my daily day/night moisturizer. I use it on top of my Korres oil and it works wonderfully. The container is thick glass which is amazing considering the product is only $8 at CVS! The product is not heavy at all which is abnormal for most dry skin creams. It glides on and immediately absorbed into the skin. It's also never clogged my pores.
"I love love love love this I use it everyday and twice a day in the winter my skin is dry an this really helps keep it hydrated an plump. It's better than a cream because it doesn't leave a heavy or greasy feel like creams, also it does not clog my pores. You need this if you have dry skin!"
This is the most amazing moisturizer ever. It's a feel and not a thick cream. I prefer a feel and this texture is perfect. It absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn't leave it feeling sticky at all. It feels like a light moisturizer but really gets the job done.
I am in love with this cream. I will buy it agAinð
"I really like the way it moisturize my skin. It makes my skin hydrated. My skin can absorb it very quickly. However, I need to reapply it every 3-4 hours when I stay in the room which use air conditioner because my skin become dry again. If you are not bothered by applying it several times, you can pick this product up."
"When I first bought this product, it worked SO well! I was very impressed and my skin looked amazing! Now that I'm half way into the container, my skin began peeling and now it's drier than I first started with this product ... I ended up having to switch back to my old moisturizer to get my skin looking normal ... Very disappointed."
"This is my third jar this year. I could not have made it thru the summer months without its cooling and moisturizing effects. I will see how it goes for the rest of the year, but for now it is my favorite. I love how light and refreshing it is and my skin just drinks it in, making my skin feel smooth, moisturized and refreshed all day."
I've been using this product for a couple of days and so far so good. It hasn't caused any breakouts and it feels very refreshing when applied.
Nice for the summer and people with more oily prone skin. Quenches skins thirst without leaving a greasy feel.
"Super soft and smooth on skin, great for those who have really dry skin especially during the summer, this is a must"
I love this product it feels great for my face and I would recommend it and It meets my expectations and I would not improve the Product
Absolutely amazing !! Lasts for a long time as well as leaving my skin feel amazing !
"I Love this, it really helps my dry skin making it feel really smooth. For the price I'd say it was definitely worth it !"
"Good for dry skin, very light and spreads well on the skin and your skin . It does not have a storng perfume smell."
Its a really good moisture and I will use it once a week after I do a face mask because my face is already oily and when I do a face mask it gets dry
The best face moisturizer for dry skin! My face is so dry my nose flakes up at the corners (gross embarrassing) this kills that with no problem!
Amazing!!! Nothing has kept my skin as moisturized as this product. I highly recommend the Garner gel creams.
I liked this cream very little I felt that it did not help me much even though it is in gel I felt my skin a bit oily
Been a fan of this for years always liked it very good for your skin not expensive always satisfied with it
my sister I always see her using her and she is very good since she has largely solved her problem of her dry skin
I have super sensitive skin and it got irritated a bit by this cream. Its quite moisturizing though and smells fresh.
It didn't work as well as I felt it should have. My face was still dry a few multiple uses. It was somewhat sticky. I would not purchase again.
I love love love this moisture gel!! It really is refreshing. It just feels soo nice on the skin & make my facial skin so supple & hydrated. I always repurchase when I run out! I cannot rave enough about this product. My absolute favorite !!
I really like this Garnier moisturizer for the whole face and neck. It's very smooth and leave sour skin feeling nice and soft. Bonus is it smells great too!
"This product is amazing, I use it as my everyday moisturizer! I wash my face with the Bioré Charcoal facial wash and use this after and it locks it in for hours! I wake up feeling refreshed!"
"I was not impressed with this at all. Not only did it not help with dry skin, but it was not even great on areas that weren't dry. I purchased it once and never again. I gave away the remaining product, it just wasn't worth using."
All time favorites I use before bed when I wake up before make up after make up! If you want to start moisturizing you're face more often this is the perfect product it's gel so it's not oily at all.
"it was a fine product, but i didn't continue to use it. it made my face look oily, which it's already like that on its own. but i've heard from friends that it works for them. probably just my skin type"
Because I have a very dry skin this cream was amazing. Refreshing the skin and I'm so thankful. I recommend this gel cream for dry skin. It's very gentle and easy to use. I'll buy again.
Garnier skinactive Moisture is just perfect not too heavy not too late with just the right amount of moisture to keep your hair looking subtle and controls flyaways and split ends
it restores moisture in your face and hydrates but i didn't like the way my face felt after applying it. my face felt almost oily. i would recommend if you're in a hurry to hydrate your face but other than that i would not recommend.
Great product! Skin was absolutely super soft when I was done with this. Product is easy to find in stores which is great price is minimal I'm not outrageous. Would definitely recommend this product
"I usually have combo skin that leans a little dry, especially in the winter months! I prefer a lighter, feel like formula for a “day time” moisturizer. This moisturizer is perfect for that! It keeps my skin hydrated even in the Minnesota winters."
I buy this in the summertime because it's a gel so it's pretty light. I have dry skin all year round so I need something that hydrates but isn't too heavy. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a sticky feel on my skin.
"Good moisturizer, I like to use it when my skin has broken out, it helps to calm it. However, it makes a very bad base for makeup. Makeup flakes and looks very bad."
I bought this at the store earlier & just tried it for the 1st time after washing off my makeup & it left my skin looking hydrated! Not only that but it's not as dry anymore & my skinoops & feels really smooth!
All winter I had tried to find something that would make my face feel amazing all day without it going back to dry and itchy half way through the day. This did it. It's honestly the best moisturizer I have ever used.
Very effective!
"I gave this gel cream a try because I didn't want to spend too much money on a high end product. It comes in a glass bottle, which I love. It is a pink gel, not too strong of a fresh scent, and I absolutely love this moisturizer. It goes on smoothly onto the skin, and it leaves my face feeling fresh, smooth and hydrated. I do not regret buying this, I have bought two more containers, lol."
"I LOVE this gel moisturizer. It doesn't feel thick or heavy, and glides on easily. It works perfectly for a moisture barrier before makeup, and gets semi-tacky for a smooth foundation application. This moisturizer gave my skin a lovely and natural glow and seemed to hydrate my skin all day. Highly recommend."
"This is such a great moisturizer for its price. I have super dry skin and this just make it go over. It actually absorbs into my skin, not sit on it and washes off. My skin always looks radiant when I use this. I even use it on my legs, knees, elbows and other really dry patchy areas on my body. I highly recommend this cream."
"I have sensitive, combination skin. If I treat the oily acne prone areas, the rest of my face gets super dry and flaky. I saw this on the shelf and decided to give it a try. I love how quickly it absorbs, and doesn't leave oily spots! I actually scraped out the jar before recycling it, and will be buying more. I have NEVER finished a skin care item before it expired or got old. EVER."
"First let me say, that when I first tried this, I was not really sure that I would like it. I was always so used to a face cream having a creamy consistency, so the gel surprised me. Secondly, it does not have the feel of a gel, it glides on like a gel, but absorbs quickly and without a greasy feeling at all. My skin felt great, and I must admit that I was surprised that I would like it so much. I highly recommend this to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was looking for a new moisturizer. I tried the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue. The texture of the product is more like a gel instead of a lotion. I have dry skin and it leaves my skin feeling great. I will continue to use the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So after using Garnier skin active moisture rescue for a week my face feels Great! I was surprised when I first put it on, it felt that it might be oily but was quite the opposite. It is refreshing to use and has a lovely scent that's not too over bearing. I love using this in the morning, because it kind of has that cooling sensation that just makes you feel rejuvenated. It's doing wonders for my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the cooling effect that this product has. I used it on my arms and chest after sun exposure and it felt better. It was better than using sticky aloe. Overall I really liked this new product and had no reactions even though I have very sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I havent been using this for a long time at all, but I can already tell that I'm going to love this! I love the cool sensation it gives my skin. I have rosacea and sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it at all! My skin has never felt better and I will definitley continue to buy this product."
"I have dry skin that is also prone to breakouts if I use too heavy of a moisturizer. This is the only cream I've used that effectively hydrates my skin without breaking me out. I've tried many other gel creams including much more expensive brands, but I keep coming back to this. Nothing works better."
I didn't like this product. The hydrated feelong doesn't last. It feels heavy and doesnt smell great. Has a platic feel and smell
Really helped my dry skin be not dry skin it was gentle on my skin and it worked effictively it also had nice packaging
life is just long enough to be able to get a couple pair of the most important thing is reminds us that pretty much.
Final step to my daily skin care routine and I wouldnt miss it! Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple
This product is wonderful! I use it in the mornings and at night. It has become one of my MUST HAVES! I Recommend it to everyone that I know.
This gel cream is great it leaves the skin feeling moisturized but not oily or greasy and makes skin looked plumped
"I love this gel moisturizer! I have sensitive skin and allergies. It is lightweight, cools skin and no heavy lingering scent"
Very refreshing and easy on the skin doesn't dry you out nor does it leave you feeling oily it's perfect for all skin types.
"Love how it's pink, and it feels silky and rich, very classy i always apply it before makeup and after i've cleanse my face!"
I highly recommend this toner. I feel like it actually works on my skin. plus it helped with some of my stubborn acne!
"This is an amazing product, this is just excellent I recommend it to everyone who wants to look magnificent"
"This definitely helps my skin, especially during the winter! Helps it feel moisturized and hydrated! I love the smell also, so that's a plus!"
I didn't find it to be as moisturizing as I would have liked. Will purchase again in summer when skin isn't so dry
"Smells amazing, looks amazing and definitely is amazing! Instant results, made my skin feel amazing!"
Found this as alternative to Clinique Moisture Surge. Nice light moisturizer for the summer though too heavily scented.
I love this moisturiser as it is incredibly cooling and refreshing. my mum has just started using it aswell and it is a great deal for the price.
This gel makes my skin feel very moist and hydrated. I have used this several times. My skin is very dry and I put this on before bedtime.
love love love this product. it does exactly what it advertises. I just wish it soaked into your akin instead of leaving it greasy
This is very Non greasy which I like but sometimes you need to feel moisturized. This evaporated quickly and hydrated but doesn't leave my skin glowy
Love how soothing this gel cream is! Soaks in deep to moisturize and has a cooling feel to it that doesn't tingle or burn.
It felt like Clinique water surge. Maybe it is good for california summer. It does not work that well fir dry winter days.
"Love this product , garnier has some great products . This product is great for my skin. Has a great texture. Very small amount needed."
"Super good one leaves my skin so soft and hydrated and good, I swear it's the best, really love them so much"
"I am currently using this. It has a cooling feeling, so I prefer to use it during the warmer months. I have re-purchased it."
This is amazing! I love the smell and how light it feels on my skin! It helps reduce redness as well!
"Great for brightening skin, I use it under my eyes when they feel dull. Can be drying sometimes so I use another moisturizer with it."
My skin gets so dry during the winter and this product helps moisturize my skin and keep it feeling soft and smooth!
I use this as a nighttime cream to help like moisture my face also want it works great as a primer before my makeup love the smell of roses
Very good! smells really good and also feels good on skin. it‘s very gentle and definitely met my expectations
"Love this! I have super dry skin and when I put this on it feels so nice, it's like a drink for my skin! Plus is smells great."
It is not what I expected.. Not completely satisfied. My skin got oily and sticky.i wouldn't use this product again.
This is been my favorite moisturizer for 2018. It works very well it smells nice and it leaves your skinFeeling refreshed and super moisturized. I feel like it's good for sensitive skin and people who struggle with eczema
Breaks me out like crazy. Clogged up my pores... I wasn't surprised though every time I use their skincare it breaks me out and it sucks to because they are very well priced :(
This moisturizer okay. I have really dry skin and i feel like it doesn't really moisturize all that much. It smells nice and the packaging is pretty though. It's gentle but I think it kinda breaks me out.
My skin is really dry from the cold weather and it's getting already better after 2 days. My skin feels soft and good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the only moisturizer I can use on my dehydrated skin without breaking out, and I've literally tried everything else out there. Thank you, Garnier! Please don't ever discontinue!"
After using the product I can honestly say my skin feels much softer. My face has sun spots and damage due to me tanning in my teenage years and was always dry. Now it feels GREAT!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Moisture refreshing gel for months and I tried to go w/o it for a few days. I missed it. I love this product. It make my skin feel so refreshing!
I bought this 2 days ago and i can totally feel my skin more refreshing and less dry. I saw results with just the first application . It's amazing and I will definitely be getting more of these when i run out!
"This is great, especially in the warmer weather. Light and cooling, it glides on and leaves the skin feeling fresh and soft. A little goes a long way. I love it"
"I just bought this product about two weeks ago and my skin feels and looks so much better. I had very dry skin on my face, especially between the eyes and on my nose. I use this twice a day and the dry skin is a thing of the past. I LOVE it! I will never buy anything else again. Thank you so much Garnier!!"
"I loved it work so well made my face feel great and it was so refreshing, packaging was nice loved the colour, I was pleasantly surprised about how much I liked it and how good it made my face feel, good for the prize and its not to smell or too big so its great to travel with!"
This is so helpful for people with dry to normal skin! It hydrates the skin it feels so refreshing!! I have used it many times but I have kind of oily skin so didnt work so well on me but i gave it to my sister whose have a dry skin and she adore it! Her skin looks so healthy
This is one of my go to summer moisturizers. It's great in spring when your skin is still dry from winter but it's too warm out for a heavy moisturizer. This is light and so moisturizing. I have been using this and the green on for years. This is for dry skin. The green is for combo normal skin. I'll continue buying!
"I like the gel consitstency of this moisturizer, but I would like if it was a little bit more moisturizing. It's definitely good for the summer, since your skin doesn't need as much moisture, but I wouldn't recommend for the winter months. Overall it is worth the price, and very affordable!"
"I've only just began using this product, and I already love it. My skin is sensitive and dry, and this has brought so much moisture to my skin. I put it on at night and in the morning after cleansing my skin and i've noticed a huge difference. My skin is baby skin soft, and this has really exceeded my expectations. Especially for other products in the same category, you can't beat the cost for this product."
This is a skin savior in the winter time! This was the first moisturizing gel cream that was released in drug stores as far as I saw. It is cooling and refreshing. Skin absorbs the product very nicely. You feel the moisture all day long even under make up. A little goes a long way. Find at cvs or target.
"I was impressed with the color and look of the Garnier moisturizer, but when I put it on, I loved it! Absolutely love the texture! It's not oily and you can feel it soak into your skin. There's no oily, sticky residue. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised with the Garnier gel cream. It's consistency threw me off a bit but I loved that it was a gel and not an oily cream. I find most creams are too oily for my skin but this gel was perfect and my face felt so soft afterwards. It has a nice, soft pleasant smell to it, which diminishes after a few seconds. The container itself is very nice and feels like a fancy department brand. I plan on making this my go to moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this everyday since I received it and I can feel and see a difference. My face is much more hydrated and softer. I've been looking for something to smooth out my skin and keep it hydrated. My only complaint (which is a minor one) is the packaging. I went on a trip and took it with and when I got to my destination the product had gotten all over the inside of the lid and it was a mess but other than that I love this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the cool and refreshing gel is perfect for hot and dry summer in California. The scent is refreshing but doesn't linger, which is very good with any kind of cosmetics that I apply on top of Garnier Skin Active. Skin doesn't get greasy, so it does not affect my sunscreen or foundation. This is my 3rd week since I started to use the product, and I am already thinking about buying the next one in the store soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product is in a nice jar, it looks upscale. The gel is different, kind of weird. I'm not a fan of the texture, kind of hard to describe, maybe you would say gooey. Once you put it on it feels fine on your face. It soaks in quickly. It seemed to do a good job of moisturizing. Has a nice, soft smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely dry skin. Even in the summer. So I'm always on the hunt for a great product to give me super moisture. This product does a good job. It sinks right in and my skin doesn't feel right. I actually love it as a makeup primer. My only gripe is the scent. I wish it was unscented. It's too overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this brand's gel cream before, but never this one that's formulated for extra dry skin. It works wonders on my skin and gave me a healthy looking glow. I couldn't stop looking at my face. It was lightweight, hydrating, and definitely gave my skin the moisture it needed! I wear this under and in combination with my Garnier skin actives spf moisturizer and they work well together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisture cream that I've been testing for the last couple of weeks has been decent. It's not my favorite in the sense I've liked other gel moisturizers better, but this one isn't terrible especially for the price. I have terribly dry skin and though this seems to feel hydrating and doesn't make me feel greasy, but yet I feel like I needed just a little bit more of a thicker consistency for my skin to feel smooth and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Moisturizer is not my favorite one. The smell is pleasant, its not strong or overpowering. The feeling is smooth, but heavy. It is tacky once on and heavy feeling. It feels like having a think gel that does not absorb well. It does moisturize very well and the next morning my skin was really soft. But I am not a fan of the feeling when you put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product really seems to help moisturize my dry skin. Living in a dry climate, I'm always looking new ways to make sure my skin isn't dry. My only concern was that my skin is really sensitive. It did surprisingly well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always struggled with dry skin on my face. I have tried several products. But they all felt like they weighed down my pores and left my face feeling greasy. When I tried the Garnier Moisture Rescue I was pleasantly surprised it left my face feeling soft and just the right amount of moisture and best part no greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this moisturizer twice a day for a week and it was marvelous! I have some bad trouble spots of dry skin on my neck and face. They were resolved within just a few days. It also has a fresh feeling and didn't leave my face shiny or oily after application. The fragrance is pleasant and not overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think Garnier Moisture Rescue is a great product. The gel moisturizer leaves my skin feeling dewy and not sticky. It is absorbed quickly and I love the way it leaves my skin feeling. I was so excited to try this product since I love to try new products to help my dry skin. Garnier Moisture Rescue has a very light and fresh scent. I am pleased with the results I have seen to my skin since I started using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so excited to be able to try this, as my skin is incredibly dry. It's a nice, thick, gel that smells excellent. To me, it smells fruity. It just gives a light scent. It feels cool on my skin and instantly hydrates. I especially like putting it on before bedtime, the scent is soothing to me. After using it for over a week, twice daily, I feel like my skin is softer and not as dry. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i really liked this product. It's easy to use ( i leave it by the sofa for when im watching tv) and i feel like my face did feel softer after a couple of uses.plus it smells good. definitely going to keep using this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garnier's new Moisturizer Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for dry skin is a lite fast absorbing face and neck cream. I have been following the suggested morning and night schedule for about 1 week now. My skin feels smoother, less tighness and pores appear smaller. A little goes a long way so, this container should last several months. So far this product is a keeper in my daily skin care regiment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This gel has this cooling sensation that gives a refreshing feel to my dry skin. Its very soothing at night, the scent is a light scent. I apply it all the way down my neck and it left my skin very soft, but sticky. The reason that I dont give it a 5 star rating is that this moisturizer feels sticky and doesn't absorb easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried it for free and it has become a necessary laugh for my face. I never thought that when I tried it I would like it so much .. I put it in the morning after washing my face and it leaves me looking cool, bright .. I applied it before Of the makeup and if my skin looks a lot fresh ... I like it a lot and I recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The moisturizer cream wasn't for me ... It dried out pretty fast. I'm sorry I wouldn't buy it. My face is very dry and I was hoping this was the cream for me but it's not. On a good note it smelled good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is amazing. I have perpetually dry and sometimes flaky skin through my T-zone. And this stuff makes my skin so soft and hydrated, I don't even have to use it everyday. It smells great to me and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I would highly recommend to anyone. Even my sister likes it and her skin is oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The gel seems a little weird for a face cream, but it is quickly absorbed with no tacky residue. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. Most moisture creams tend to leave my face feeling greasy and slick, this was not the case with this Moisturizer Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream. I like it quite a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing I loved when I first saw this Garnier Moisturizer is the color! Then I opened it up and it smelled so good, like some high class. I tried this product for awhile before I wrote a review just so I could really know how it works. It made my skin less dry I think in time but it took putting it on everyday. It feels sometimes a little wet and sticky which is why one less star but it's not something that would make me not want to buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first I wasn't very satisfied with the garnier skin active. It was too sticky and I had to reapply. But after a few days my skin adjusted and now I love it! My skin is never dry and always soft. Everyone should give it a try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My thoughts about Garnier Skin Active moisture rescue is amazing. I love how my face feels after applying it. It gives you a sensation of coolness, freshness softness, and very hydrated. I definitely will buy it. I am in love with it. I definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There are many expensive moisturizers out there that I have tried and did not get the results as I did with this moisturizer. I love love love it! It goes on so smooth and the texture is one that I love. It really makes a difference when you have really dry skin and you can tell an immediate difference. I will definitely buy this from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow, this gel has this cooling sensation that gives refreshing drink to my dry skin. Its very soothing at night, the scent is divine and light. I apply it all the way down my neck and chest and it leaves my skin very soft. The reason I dont give it a 5 star rating is that were I live is humid and during the day this moisturizer feels sticky. But if you live in a colder climate you must give this a try, I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I applied this product after cleansing my face it felt very hydrated, refreshed and smells great but later on in the day my face felt dry but I'm going to continue with the product until I have an exact opinion on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Garnier Moisturizer Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for dry skin is exactly what I needed! I am in my mid-30s and have been paying more attention to my skin lately. I started using this product and saw results within a few days. It does not feel sticky or leave any type of residue on my face. My skin feels hydrated but not greasy. I will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a really good product starting with the pros it actually does what it says. My skin is smother and firmer you can feel the difference the first time you use it, it takes a few days to see the difference. There are only a few cons one it smells like hair gel not to bad just a little. Two it takes a while to dry more of a problem if you don't have the time and you want to apply make up. Three if you get caught in the rain it runs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think...I love Garnier products. I was searching for a good alternative but this is average for me. I really like moisturizers that are a gel consistency. This stuff is surprisingly moisturizing for being a gel and I don't have any issues using it under my makeup. I would recommended this to people who do not have extremely dry or aging skin. I'm happy with that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product a week ago and i loved it. I use it twice a day after cleansing my face, this is a very good moisturizer. It absorbs quickly, long lasting and it goes on smoothly. My face feels great and has my skin glowing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using it about it week. It goes on wet and doesn't really seem to absorb as quickly as I'd like. I really haven't noticed a difference as far as my skin being less dry, therefore I don't see this product as a benefit for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Garnier moisturizer gel. I liked the pink color and I liked the fragrance. However, it seemed to take longer to absorb...maybe because it's a gel? And the fragrance worried me. I don't have sensitive skin....but with the flowery fragrance I thought I might break out. I used for 2 weeks and luckily didn't break out. It was pretty good. I would recommend for anyone who does NOT have sensitive skin and doesn't mind the extra time needed to absorb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really enjoyed using this gel! It's lightweight, non-greasy and smells SO good! A little dab goes a long way. All week, my face has been hydrated, and smooth. I've received quite a few compliments from family also! I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this gel cream because after washing my face everyday my skin feels tight and dry. I wanted something light and has a refreshing feeling, but also a nice light scent. Since Garnier is a brand I like, I thought I would give the gel cream a try. After a week of daily use I've decided this product isn't for me. It leaves my face feeling sticky as if it didn't soak into my skin. I wasn't impressed with the smell either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this a few days ago and have been using it every morning. I don't notice much of a difference when I am wearing it. I live in a desert state and my skin is always really dry. I drink a lot of water, but still can't get moisturized. I was really excited to try this because I like the brand. I am highly disappointed that this doesn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I fell in love with Garnier Moisturizer Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream the first time I used it! It's light, glides easily across the skin, absorbs within seconds, and has a light floral scent that dissipates pretty quickly. I've been using it as recommended, 1-2 times daily. My skin is softer and brighter! It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy and I don't sweat it off either. This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I love how it feels once it is rubbed in. Its lighweight and a little goes a long way( seriously) this one jar will last a few months The fragance is not strong and that is a big plus. The only down side for me is the amount of rubbing.Because it is a lightweight formula it takes longer to get it absorbed in the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Garnier Moisturizing Gel Cream works fabulous. I have extremely dry skin and have tried several moisturizing creams. None of them which have worked well at all. ... until I've tried Garnier Moisturizing Gel Cream. Garnier Moisturizing Gel seems to help tremendously with my dry skin. Not to mention it has a wonderful smell as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I personally have very dry skin, so when I see a new skin moisturizer, I have to try. I really like the smell of the Garnier SkinActive and the packaging is really pretty. However I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because it seems to really do it's job, but towards the middle of the day I feel like my skin is dry again. I would recommend this product, I think it is definitely a good daily product, I just have unusually dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this Garnier cream. It feels soothing and refreshing in the summer heat. It absorbed quickly and made my skin feel soft with no greasy residue. The scent is very light and pleasant. I would buy this after I finish my jar and recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have dry/normal skin and I love how lightweight and cool this gel feels on my skin. It doesn't leave my skin greasy at all. It is very hydrating and has had no negative side effects. It has a fresh and clean smell and absorbs in pretty quickly. I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It helped moisturize my skin, but I felt like after it dried i couldn't really tell that I had put moisturizer on. However, my skin is super super dry. If you have normal/combination skin, this would be good for you since it does not contain oils. As far as skin like mine(super dry), I wouldn't recommend it for you. It didn't really have a smell, but the consistency was good and it felt good going on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before I even got this product I was excited. And after using it I fell in love with it. I'ts really lightweight, absorbs right away and smells great. The fact that it's so hydrating and made with antioxidant fruit water is a plus. So, if you're thinking of trying it don't hesitate. It's would make a great addition to your night time skin care routine. If you're a lover of their hair products like me. This will be a new favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Lightweight, smells great, and it's pink! This product has it all. The price point is great and so is the product. It goes on so smoothly and hydrates my dry skin. I have very sensitive skin, but this does the trick for me. Seriously, this is a game changer.. go try it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Garnier SkinActive Moisture Relief works well on my skin. It does hydrate my skin throughout the day, and it does not irritate my skin at all. It is a refreshing cool gel that feels great going on your skin. Certainly worth the money, and giving it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garner SkinActive Moisture Rescue is a great moisturizer that locks in 24hr moisture and soothes dry skin. It is oil free and contains fruit water. I love the feeling of fresh skin and this product certainly gives you that! I even put it on my elbows and it took away that rough skin feeling. The only thing I did not like is that my face felt a little sticky for a few minutes after applying. Other than that I think this is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far, I have tried this two days. It is very light and not heavy. It soaks in quickly, leaving my skin very soft and supple. It smells incredible but not overpowering. I love how it feels on my eyes and is a great moisturizer to prep my face for make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just tried Garnier's Moisture Resuce product. I'm overall pleased with the product. I was expecting it to feel sticky, but much to my surprise, it dried quickly and left my skin feeling hydrated. Only con I'd have to say is that it doesn't smell that great. It isn't a harsh scent nor can you smell it after you've put it on. Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had already used this product about 4 years ago and I loved it at the time. However, I began to experiment with other skin moisturizers and I have to say my best experience was with this product. I generally have sensitive skin, so the gel feels fresh on my skin when I put it on, and it does not leave my skin feeling dry at all!"
"I bought this just yesterday and applied it to my face the night I did , The morning I woke up im always prone to flaky dry skin and I was so satisfied with not 1 dry spot on my face I will definitely keep using this and I recommend it to those of you with dry skin"
"I've had problems with picking my acne over the years which left me with serious hyper pigmentation. This product literally made the red marks disappear! I'd only bought this product for moisturizing purposes yet I've been pleasantly surprised with everything it has done! After using this product for a month I've had minimum breakouts and my skin is the softest it's ever been. Since there are so many different skin types out there this might/might not work for you, but I do recommend giving it a try."
"I tried this product for dry skin after suffering for years from fall thru to spring with patches of dry skin on my face. This winter I went on line to find any suggestions that might work, and this product was mentioned. By the 2nd application, I noticed significant improvement and it has only continued to improve since, to the point that I can use my regular moisturizer in the day time and use this Garnier Gel-Cream at night only. Fantastic product for me."
After all the reviews I decided to try this product. I love Clinique products but just cannot afford them. I do like gel which blends out a lot nicer than regular moisturizers. I was really disappointed immediately because of the scent. It was to strong for me. I tend to get head aches from anything to strong. I have been trying it once in a while and notice how it dries quickly and feels real thin applying it. Just not for me.
"This product is amazing. My face was extra dry and I could notice results after just one use of this stuff. It is gel-like, so you'll want to make sure you give it enough time to dry and sink in completely before putting on makeup. Great product, strongly recommend, and it smells great too!"
Great for dry skin! Makes my skin feels so soft after using it. I love the packaging too
I Love this product!i Love garnier! #garnierlove #garnier the price is perfect ! Si very los cost
This gel cream makes you feel super refreshed! Doesn't leave your face looking oily. Very gentle.
This really helps if you have dry skins. My skin was super dry and now it's moisturized
"Good for dry skin kinda pricey but not really, gotta rub it in good or it leaves your skin oily"
"Absolutely love this gel cream! Hydrated my skin and leaves it feeling soft and refreshed. Very cooling on the skin, too!"
"The scent was very nice and loved how soft my hair felt , the only down side was that with my fine hair it made it a little too oily."
This stuff is amazing for your skin! It smells amazing and it's reasonably priced. I thought it was beyond worth the money and so effective. I would definitely recommend it to someone with dry skin.
Amazing! Definitely more of a night time cream personally . When I do use it in the day time it affects my foundation so I tend to either leave it for my night time routine or wear it when I skip makeup
"Love this product! I use this product after cleansing, toning, and applying serum to my face at night! It leaves my skin feeling soft the next morning! Would definitely recommend it to others!"
"Silky Straight Smoothing Serum is a formula enriched with fruit oils. It smoothes hair to make it silky, detangles unmanageable hair and gives radiant shine."
"Fresh, felt as if it was to water based. Caused a little irritating on really dry areas around the nose. And face changed to a darker shade of red right after."
"I love this moisturizer so much!!! It makes my skin feel brand new and so clean. I've use this almost everyday and it makes my skin feel great, the price is great for the quality and amount of the product!"
"It worked but it kind off felt oily, but maybe that's the point or my skin just reacted to it in a weird way? I have only tested it for a week so I can't see so much different, but my skin is a bit softer !"
"I used this every after cleansing my face with Garnier 3 in 1 facial Wash. it really help moisturizing my skin, and it is good also for makeup base. Not sticky to face. really nice product!"
I really trust garnier in general but when it's about face skin care....I'm extra careful. Thanks goodness this moiusturizer worth a try. Pure smoothness and hydration long lasting
"Just bought this today because I have recently experienced dry, flaky skin from the cold weather and I love this product! It makes my skin soft and supple and the flakiness has seemed to immediately improve!"

"I bought this a month ago. I've been searching for a moisturizer for my face and this one didn't dry out my skin, didn't leave a heavy feeling on my face and it make it instantly softer. My boyfriend loves it for his face also!"

"My face gets really dry, especially right now since I started using Proactive. I use this once a day and it keeps my face moist and smooth for 24 hours. I like how light it is and how it feels on my skin. I would recommend this to anyone. (:"
"I think this would be a great product for many people, yet many people also have different skin types! For me this product made my face a bit too oily, although it did refreshen it and I could tell a difference in the touch and feel of my skin after a weeks use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I gave this a try after I couldn't find my usual moisturizer, Garnier's Radiant Moisturizing Cream. I assumed this would be similar, but boy was I wrong. I'm not crazy about the way it feels when I first apply it, but that's something I could get over. What I can't ignore is how dry and itchy my face is after it's been on for 6 to 8 hours! Plus after using it for just two days, I've started breaking out. Not sure what they were thinking with this one."
Dry skin - moisturizers - refreshed face and neck !
This Moisturising cream is great for any skin problematic areas it will do the job and make you feel and look great
I love the way it feels on my skin....cool and moisturizing. I will definitely keep purchasing this product.
The Garnier skin active moisture rescue refreshing gel cream for dry skin does work and moisturizers it
I love this product! Very light weight not oily and lasts! A little goes a long way. Very smooth on the face to the touch.
Product works as described. I was very pleased with the results. It was easy to use snd I would highly recommend it. Smells amazing!
This product smells really good and feels refreshing on my face. It is great for really dry skin and a little does go a long way.
It isn't too bad for the value to product strength. It feels good on my dry skin. Recommended for dry skin.
"This does hydrate the skin wonderfully, but all the alcohol in it irritates my skin. Any acne and rosacea I have are emphasized."
"Great. Love it. My husband had me order him a bottle. Hands, feet and any dry areas stay moisturized for 24 hours, which is why I will reorder."
"This isn't what I expected. It leaves my face noticeably shiny and I don't wear makeup, so my face looks oily. It isn't very moisturizing either. Garnier products are usually awesome and I'm very disappointed with this."
"I use this for my dry skin, keeps it moisture, refreshing, smells nice, buy from anywhere"
Bought this a couple days ago I love you it !! BUT I feel I have something heavy on my face .!
My favorite moisturizer but it's very expensive for how little you get
"This is good, it's refreshing and soothes my face a little cause I have really dry skin."
I bought this product and I absolutely love it. I wish it came in a bigger container.
I love Clinique's Moisture Rescue But Is was 50.00 and this is Just like it for 6.50.
This cream works as it said. I feel little bit burning on my face after applying.
"Works just as well as the expensive brands, there is no magic cure other than surgery!"
Great product! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and so clean! Great price for such a high quality product!
