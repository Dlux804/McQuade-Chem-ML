"I absolutely love Miracle Blur but the tube it comes in isn't the best. Because you can't squeeze it to the fullest, a lot of product sticks to the sides. You have to cut it to get product out, which is a lot. L'Oreal should consider new packaging so the consumer gets what they pay for."
This stuff is truly miraculous. The very first time I used it I was shocked and amazed at how well it smoothed out my facial skin. I'm 50 and my lines and wrinkles just made an appearance this year. I love this so much!
"I am using this over the Revitalift Moisturizer and it is a wonderful product. I am retired and not working in public anymore, so I have no desire to put on base makeup just to run to the grocery store or gas up the car. I am perfectly comfortable just wearing these two products on a daily basis and saving make up for special occasions!!"
"I bought some of this over a year ago and I'm just buying more! Yes, it lasts that long if you use it correctly. I have extremely oily skin, and this doesn't make it worse like some products do. I have very large pores on my cheeks and this helps to ""cover"" them. It takes very little ( maybe smaller than a pea). I use it under liquid foundation, then I also apply a powder. My makeup looks so much better when I use this! My skin looks even. It's pricey, but if you consider how long it lasts, it's worth it!!!"
"I was a bit skeptical about this cream at first, but now I'm pleasantly surprised; very good quality and visible results! Well, the fact that I need to use just a little bit at the time to achieve such good look is a plus! I definitely recommend this product!"
I've used the L'Oréal Miracle Blur a couple of times now. I definitely notice the “blurring” effect. I am quite impressed with how smooth it leaves the skin. I wear it alone-no makeup. A little of the product goes a long way. I would recommend this product to others.
"This product makes your face silky, but it doesn't blur anything. Since I don't wear make up, I thought this would be a good choice to hide my laugh lines, but it didn't hide anything. We took pictures and compared them, and my husband concurs that this product doesn't do much for me, but he did say that I'm fine the way I am. Maybe this product would be helpful under makeup, but I am not ready to go there."
"This product is not a smooth cream like I expected. It doesn't even squeeze out of the tube because it's so firm. It's like the part of the lotion when it first comes out that's been dried up and you try to rub it into your skin but it just rolls. Even after getting it smoothed into my skin and letting it dry before putting on my makeup, it crumbled up on my face. I will be asking for a refund. Very disappointed!"
I started using this product Aug 18th 2016 and today Sept 14th 2016 almost a month later this so called instant is not so instant with not even one change at all!!! I use it every days and 2 times a day 3 days a week. I'm sad at the lost from the cost!
"Expected at least somewhat of an improvement. Failed miserably -- in fact highlighted all my wrinkles. Not real expensive, but not exactly cheap either. Keep looking because this product is not effective at all."
"By using this product every day, my skin is smoother and looks younger! A very affordable product for my face!"
My miracle blur has turned white and it's not gel like anymore . How can I fix it to be usable again ? I bought like 6 when she t was on sale and love the product . I'm 62 and nobody believes it since I started using the miracle blur .
"This is NOT the same formula as in the past. Once you warm it on your finger it still works the same, but the original formula was so much better and easier to use. Feel like im putting an old product on my face. Hope that isn't the case- hasn't expired, but so much thicker and different. 3 stars because it seems to work the same. Want original formula back."
"Makes my lines, sort of lubricated so foundation won't stick in creases."
"Have been using Miracle Blur OIL FREE for years and have been very happy with the product. Disappointed that it has been discontinued. Tried the ORIGINAL... goes on sticky and smells like suntan lotion. Very unhappy, a waste of money."
This product is fantastic. I have shiny oily skin and this gives me a mate look without it being makeup. It is an instant fix! Nothing else takes care of my reflective wine like this does!!!!! I have noticed that the product can separate in the tube and get dry/cakey or out when it comes out. The solution is to massage the tube for a few seconds before squeezing it out.
"I just purchased a new tube and was greatly disappointed. I have used the product previously and it came out of the tube nicely and smoothly. For this tube, I can barely squeeze some out. When I finally managed, it came out very thick and hard and crumbled. It could not go on my skin smoothly. I will not be purchasing again."
I don't wear foundation because I don't like the mask feeling. This is light and makes my skin look great
"This product gives you a great matte finish. Even after wiping away perspiration and oil throughout the day, I felt I still had adequate coverage of blemishes/pores."
"would like to use everyday but don't think it would last 2 weeks. Smooths my face as well as a more expensive brand, but in the long run, not sure it is a better value"
The product is very thick so it's hard to use only a small amount. I like that it can be worn alone since it has spf 30. Seems to work like they claim. Just wish didn't have to use so much of it. Becomes expensive.
"I have been buying this product for a few years now & I like it but there would be so much waste if you would just throw it out when you thought it was empty. Instead I try to squeeze every last bit & even dig into the tube with a bobby pin to try to get it all out. I also agree with some of the reviews as far as it getting crumbly & I find this when I get to the end of it. At first it is hard to squeeze out & when it does come out, it is almost greasy at this point. It's like it needs some shaky or squeezing to mix it up right."
"This is not any kind of 'skin smoother' to ""transform texture"" nor is it a 'blur' that ""diffuses light"". On the back of the tube it states: Purpose - Sunscreen. This is a sunscreen only. I don't know how they get away with advertising it as skin smoother"
"Can't get enough of this! Only need a little...not greasy, doesn't smear my makeup, absolutely can't go without it, but it whenever its on sale/coupons"
I bought this before and it spread out wonderfully. But just bought another tube yesterday and it is so thick and like a glob and comes out in chunks once you are able to get it out at all! It has a very thick consistency and does not work like it once did. Now I am stick with 2 tubes that are just worthless to me! A lot of money for nothing! What has happened L'oreal?
I have been using this for at least a year - and went to get 2 new bottles this weekend. It's different - it's white (used to be clear) and it feels like it all hardened in the tube. Was unable to smooth out on my face without pulling skin. The previous went on like butter. Now I have 2 tubes that I won't be using.
"Product seems to have ""separated"" in the tube. A clear liquid comes out, followed by lotion that won't adhere to skin. Maybe if I had a centrifuge, I could get this to work, but no matter how much I shake it, it is still separated. Not up to L'Oreal's usual high quality."
I did not realize I had previously purchased this in the oil free version and mistakenly picked this one up by mistake. It was very oily. so much so that if you don't shake it vigorously the oil separates from the product. I highly recommend this in the OIL FREE version.
"I bought my first miracle blur Tuesday and used it yesterday. It is a very thick cream which does not go on easily. It looked like my skin was peeling when I finally got it smoothed out on my face. Once I “dusted” my face to remove the residue, it covered as I wanted."
"It is so thick, it was very hard to squeeze out of tube."
I bought this wonderful product. I wear it alone on days I don't wear make-up and it takes wrinkles and redness out. It also takes shine out. I especially like that it has spf because my make-up does and I need spf because I had skin cancer. Love this product!
I just purchased this product after reading some other reviews. This stuff came out in clumpy chunks and there is no way to smooth it on to your skin without it making tiny pills of the product that end up on your clothes or hair. Definitely not what I was expecting from L'Oreal.
I bought this primer/moisture long time ago and I recently got it again its the best primer in the world it does really work and erase all your pores and leaves your skin looking so healthy and clear and when you apply it before make up it's a dream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this product! As some of the other reviewers mentioned, a little goes a long way for me. I do not have many lines and wrinkles yet but I do have pores that need to be minimized, and this cream does that and more. My face is instantly brighter, smoother, and more lively looking, with a moisturized elastic feel all day. I have also tried the oil-free version in the past, however I prefer the original. Hands down, my favorite beauty product."
It is not worth the money i paid because there is hardly any product in the tube.
"This product really smooths the look of my skin. Since I'm over 60, I wear makeup over it, but if goes on beautifully and looks very uniform."
"This is an exceptional product. I have used a Clarins smoothing cream from Macy's and it does the same tricks for 1/2 the price! You won't be dissapointed! I am 55, and have little crows feet that just seem to disappear when you use it!!!!"
I have combination skin with an oily tzone and large pores around my eyes and nose. This product when dabbed into this area works great at keeping my pores concealed and helped my foundation glide on great
"I bought this product 3 weeks ago. I will confess Im a man. I suffer from uneven skin tone and every other product made me look like i was wearing makeup. But not this one, i look even in tone and my ruddiness seems to disappear. Love this stuff!!!"
Sadly don't waste your money on this. It did not do anything it claimed and if you just spend few extra bucks you could buy a high end one that's way better then this.
"I purchased this product and when applied lightly with a concealor brush, you can see instant results. Must apply after makeup is on as the last step & fyi it is hard to squeeze off so twist the whole head off and it is easy!"
"I like using this product under my foundation. It makes my skin feel velvety and soft and helps the foundation have a softer finish. I'm not an expert at wearing makeup, but Miracle Blur helps hide my foundation blending mistakes."
I have been using Burr for almost a year now & love it! It's amazing at blurring out my slight imperfections and filling in the 2 wrinkles ;) I have! It has earned it's rightful place in my daily MUST HAVE!
"I am over 60 and was hoping to improve dark, puffiness under my eyes. Used this product every day in hopes that I would eventually see a difference but never did! I really like L'Oréal but was very disappointed!"
I bought this a week ago and I'm in love!!!! I've tried similar products but this is by far the best!! My fine lines are blurred out for sure!! It's name says it all!! I will continue to keep buying it cause it has earned a place in my makeup kit that I do not want to be without!! Thank you for a great product!!!!
Takes shine right out of your face. Very silky and feels great no oily feeling!
Once applied you can see results. Smoother looking skin.
Skin is very soft where applied. Need more time to review fairly
It makes my skin feel better & has a nice matte finish. Good base for makeup.
"I purchased a tube of Miracle Blur a few months ago and was so excited to use it! Unfortunately it was hard to squeeze out of the tube, Not smooth at all. It was a hard white blob. When I tried to smooth it on my skin it was like a crumbly mess, it looked like my skin was peeling. I even tried it again a few days later after exfoliating & using a hydrating mask, but the same thing happened. This product is not in line with the high quality I'm used to from L'Oreal."
"I like the product, it makes my skin feel silky and smooth while providing sunscreen. My only comlpaint is the packaging. The container is stiff and difficult to squeeze out the product. when I was a little more than half way through the bottle, I began to have to twist the hard plastic container to use it. I soon had to use scissors to cut the container in half to scoop out enough for an application. It's starting dry out. At the cost of the product, I don't know if I'll buy it again. Sorry I am unable to provide a photo."
I bought this yesterday and I ad mix feelings about it base on the reviews. But I have to say I was pleasently surprise this morning when I use it for the first time. It made my fine wrinkles disappeared and my skin look so smooth. I am so far loving this product.
I won't live without this! Helps make my skin look smoother. I am in my mid 60's and it takes years off of me.
"love this product, use it to smooth, take away shine and get some protection from the sun at the same time"
"Wasn't sure it would live up to the promises, but so great! My mom noticed immediately and got some herself. Great even without make up. Don't overdo it, small amount goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This erases fine lines
Helps
I got this from a drug store and it was expired! At first it came out like water then too thick to get out. Shaking did nothing to help. Tried using watery stuff that i could get out but since i assume all the good stuff is in the clumps it did nothing. I have seen this work for my friends so it is frustrating that my money was wasted!
"I have tried this product at least 3 times in the past 3 years, hoping each time it would have been improved. I follow the directions, but the product simply does not apply smoothly. It crumbles all over my face. I must be doing something wrong somehow in the application."
I received a sample of this when I purchased another product. It is so thick and hard to spread on the skin and it piles everytime I use it. Eventually I just use a facebrush to briush off all the pilings so then I still need another primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff breaks me out and has spf in it.Hello ---if I want spf I will buy sunscreen!!!
"I have been using the oil free version of this for some time now and it was great. Now that they've stopped making it, I don't know what I'm going to use to replace it."
"Tried this product and nothing happened. I'm 47 with a few wrinkles. I put this product on expecting to see my wrinkles visibly lighten up. Nothing ""Blurred"" my wriknles were just as visible as they were prior to using this product. Very over priced. I have tried many products for wrinkles and have come to the conclusion that none of them work."
I've been using it for a while and it works great in combination with the night serum
I like this product but I thought the moisture blur was a little better. I would still recommend.
"Absolutely LOVE this product. Smooths out your face so nicely, makes make-up look so much better and last like a dream."
"I find that this product did no ""blurring"" like the original. I threw it away without using all of the product. I have not found a product to replace the original. Disappointed."
I got a sample of this in my #WalmartBeautyBox and it is truly an amazing product. it is the best out of all the different blurring creams I have tried.
I tried the L'Oreal Miracle Blur Cream. I have to say that it felt a little different when I got it out of the bottle. It had a dry feeling to it. I put it on my face and I liked the way it was instantly dry. It was easy to spread and seemed to cover quite a bit with just a small amount. I really did not notice that it helped reduce the sight of my lines though. I don't think this is the product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very impressed with the Miracle Blur Cream. It's very light and a little goes a long way. At 57, I am always willing to try something to see if it will really be effective. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and my lines are slowly fading. I was also impressed that a product with sunscreen in it didn't have a strong odor. Very nice product. I was very happy with it! I will continue using Miracle Blur! Way to go, L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at before trying this. I am pleasantly surprised. The instant facial smoother really does smooth out your skin making the makeup I put on after look even better. Thanks for a great product that is easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for about a month now and I'm not really sure I'd call it a miracle cream. My skin is somewhat sensitive and acne prone, so I was a little nervous to see this cream was thick and felt a bit heavy on my skin. I will say that it didn't make my skin worse, but I didn't notice any lasting effects regarding pore size or lines. My skin felt somewhat smoother, but that's all I was able to take away from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Upon first using this i was very hesitant it comes out super thick and that's after the struggle to get it out of the tube! But one you apply it to your face it goes on smooth as silk and leaves your face looking beyond smooth! While talking with friends I mentioned it was smoother then a babies butt.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think L'Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur was wonderful. I used it for four weeks and this product did exactly what it said it would do. Revitalift made my face look like it had less wrinkles and the fine lines go away. My skin felt very smooth. I really enjoyed using this L'Oréal product and I would buy it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first got the facial smoother, I thought it would be thin and watered down like other products. But when I first tried it, I couldn't believe how thick it actually was. It's so thick and creamy I know it's working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this after my moisturizer and before putting on my makeup. It instantly smooths my skin and makes it feel super soft. My makeup looks flawless when I use this product. I also like the fact that it has sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is great, does a wonderful job of hiding fine lines. Overall, it makes my skin look fresh and glowing. Its also great because a little goes a long way! I would recommend this and definitely buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really didn't really like this cream. Being it was to thick and left my face feeling greasy. And I broke out to much. I noticed that water was listed as the last ingredient. In most creams water is listed first. I personally wouldn't recommend this product. As I stopped using it. Due to the acne breakout. I did recurve this product free for testing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the L'Oreal Paris Revital Lift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Facial Smoother on several times. Each time it made my tingle, and after a few minutes I had to wash it off, I didn't want it to break out my face. I have super sensitive skin, and I think it is a bit to strong for me to use. However I did pass it on to my sister who had no problems and says she likes how it makes her skin feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am giving this a 3 ... it made my skin feel smooth and I liked the fact that it doesn't have a smell to it, however I didn't like how thick it was in consistency. It was hard to get out of the tube.... almost worse then when you have the last bit of toothpaste and your trying to squeeze it from the bottom of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product far exceeded my expectations. From the moment I applied it, it made my skin feel incredibly smooth and soft. It also dramatically ""blurred"" the appearance of my pores. I cant imagine going a day without this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Unfortunately this product made my skin red and splotchy. For the 30 seconds before the redness started I did notice my skin looked smoother where I had applied the cream compared to where I had not applied the cream yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Bought this product as well as the Miracle Blur foundation this week after depleting my Moisture Blur tube and couldn't find the same product at CVS. This seems much more thick and dry than the Moisture Blur and does not blend as smoothly on my skin. I will try to get used to it...
"I think this cream is perfect, before use my face looks with pores and lines and after use i notice a change. My face looks a little young and smoother. I use in conjunction with my sun protection and is really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before receiving L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother, I was curious if it would really work. I was excited to try this product. After trying it out, I noticed that it really blended well and blurred out imperfections. It went on smooth and was easy to use with or without makeup. Overall, I really like this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit disappointed in this product. It is supposed to perform as a sunscreen as well as a preventive type of shield for wrinkles, lines and pores. I found this product to be kind if greasy....it did not absorb well. I tend to wear makeup over sunscreen, and it gave my face a slimy type of feeling. This product needs a little revamping. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin so the smell didn't agree well with me. I personally thought the consistency of the product was too thick, and did not get rid of a small dry patch on my chin. Also, when I first opened it, there seemed to be a lot of air in the bottle before the actual product started coming out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This wrinkle cream didn't really smooth out any of my lines. It felt pretty greasy and never dried down. I didn't like how my makeup applied over top of it and how shiny and greasy it made my face appear. It didn't work as I hoped it would. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Facial Smoother worked really well on my face. I have a lot of blemishes and by smoothing my face the powder I use as a fonduation went on so easily I couldn't believe it. I gave it 4 stars because it is hard to squeeze out of the tube. I had a learning curve at first. I kept dropping it on the floor, but squeezing it in the palm of my hand and then fingering to my face worked well. I would buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product feels smooth going on and absorbs quickly. However, I did not see any noticeable results in skin tightening or smoother skin. It's a great concept, but I don't think it met my expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really had no expectations when I put the Miracle Blue Cream on my face, but once it was on my skin looked awesome!! I normally put primer and powder foundation but with this product I didn't even need the foundation because my skin looked smoother and clearer. I would highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is not a bad product for an over the counter smoother. It is thick but it smooths your skin very easily. It did not make me break out which is what I was worried about. It also made my skin tone very even and soft looking. I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was disappointed to see that the description on the back of the product indicates that the main purpose of this is as a sunscreen. This is misleading to me, because the name of this product suggests that its main purpose is anti-aging or anti-wrinkle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A little goes a long way and I'm left with a smooth surface for makeup application. No heavy, greasy feel! I've used this product for about 3 weeks and while I haven't noticed a change in my pores, I do notice some softening of the fine lines on my forehead! I'll stick with it, hoping to see more improvements! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It felt so great putting on and I can definitely see and feel a difference now that I've been using it for a couple of weeks. I could actually feel a difference with the first application. Usually this time of year when it gets dry and cold out my skin gets flaky. I've been constantly touching my face amazed that it's not dry but that it's not only not dry but really soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I could not wear foundation before I tried this product. Foundation doesn't crack, dry out and it does blur foundation over my wrinkles above my top lip. Before this product I had quit wearing foundation and lipstick. And because of this wonderful product I can now wear foundation and lipstick. I will continue to purchase this product until I decide I will not wear foundation anymore...many years to go!!! I also apply at night time. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is really thick, I would use my fingers to soften it before applying it. I used it only on one side of my face at first. Have not had a breakout in many years then I started getting them. Maybe it clogged my pores. It is not a product I would buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is just okay. It works for far-away, but up close you can definitely see product on your face. I didn't like the way it felt on my skin and I feel like it wiped off really easily without meaning to. Maybe I'm not the target age for something like this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't love this product but it is ok. It is very hard to get out of the container and is not very creamy. You really have to work it on your face and I don't care for the smell either. I did notice a little difference to wrinkles though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Before I applied makeup, I smoothed on the Instant Facial Smoother. They call it a finishing cream. I call it spackling for the face. I like the cushiony texture, which resembles sugared butter. It doesn't have much of a scent at all, which is usually an issue with a lot of facial products. It goes on ever so smoothly, filling in all your imperfections, such as fine lines and enlarged pores. It contains SPF 30 sunscreen, too. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After a long weekend of grandkids, i was due back to work. I used L'Oreals RevitaLift Miracle Blur, Facial Smoother. My makeup went on much more evenly. I was tired, but didnt look it. My dark circles and just general wane look, ""blurred"" away! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great product. Easy to use and smooths out the wrinkles. I didn't like the fact that a liquid comes out when you try and get product out as if it needed to be mixed up. I was a bit confused on when to use it. Not sure if it was Day or night or as a base. It appears to be versatile. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did use this product as recommended and did notice a slight difference. I did have high hopes as it was from L'Oreal. I have wrinkling on my forehead that makes me subconscious and was definitely an area I concentrated on the most. As mentioned I noticed a slight difference and slight is better than no change at all. I haven't given up on the product completely, I'm still hopeful. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product worked great! My face feels so much smoother and my pores and blemishes have reduced. I will definitely purchase this product in the future. A small amount of cream goes a long way. Your face feels like silk when using the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the miracle blur cream! It is an instant smoother and instantly makes my huge pores almost invisible! I will buy this cream for that reason alone. I will say that you only need a very small amount. It goes a long way and you don't want to ruin your makeup if you're wearing I would have liked to have more time to evaluate the wrinkles but I love and will continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was, as usual, sceptical that this product would do anything to help my skin. But I'm happy to report that I was wrong. It made my face feel softer, smoother, and just overall better. I also like the way it made my makeup look when I applied it under my foundation. This is definitely going to remain apart of my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It really smoothed out the lines near my nose and chin. After the first week there was a noticeable difference. I'm not sure if the effects will go away if I stop using it or not. Guess I might try to see if that will happen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really skeptical about this product but was pleasantly surprised. It glides on really smoothly and makes your skin feel like silk. I seriously can't stop touching my face when I'm wearing this. I also use it on my eyelids to help applying eyeshadow easier. If you already use a primer, you could easily swap it out for this and get the added benefit of silky-smooth skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have recently tried a product similar to RevitaLife Miracle Blur Cream and it made my face feel greasy and break out. That's what I was expecting when I used this product, but I was surprisingly mistaken! I used it mainly on my forehead as that's my main trouble area and the thick cream worked great to give my skin and even palette! I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These two products worked miracles literally. Especially the eye serum. My crows feet and wrinkles have shrunken to nearly nothing. It took about two weeks for it to do a turnaround, but I noticed change within a week. I would recommend trying this for extensive results fast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream for a few weeks now and I've noticed a difference. My skin is smoother and I like that it has sunscreen built in. The only negative is I wish it was a little smoother going on. It feels tacky at first but smooths out during application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was worried at first because this product looked so greasy when I put it in my hand but I applied it over my moisturizer and it soaked it completely and made my skin feel feel amazing not greasy at all I will purchase and continue using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the closest to a miracle cream ive ever found. When i use the revitalift products i feel radiant. Its great for sensitive skin. It feels light on your skin. But if you dont believe me try it for yourself! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This did a fantastic job on smoothing out my lines on my face. I have recommended this product to a bunch of people. I highly recommend this product to everyone who wants to get rid of lines. I highly recommend this to everyone who feels they need this product to help them. It is fantastic. It is awesome ....................................................

"This feels nice on my skin and not very heavy, despite its thickness out of the tube. I did not notice any real reduction in how my pore looked but it helped my powder make-up look smoother once applied. I would buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is awesome to add to my nightly routine, its easy and goes on smooth. I have only been using it for a week and the outcome has not been drastic but has helped my face to fee more smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Consider me impressed! As a woman who is in her 30's, and a sleep deprived mom, this product has really helped me feel like myself again! It doesn't take much effort to blur those fine lines and get the smooth look everyone desires. Whew. I'm so glad I found this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this product several times now. The Blur Cream goes on so smoothly, that it's perfect base for foundation . However, I wasn't getting the results i thought I should. Fine lines n deeper lines still remained visible. I'm going to continue use and see if it fades fine lines as promised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal hit the nail on the head with these two products. I can see a truly amazing difference in just a week. Even without any makeup on, my dark circles have faded and my skin is silky smooth to the touch. I actually look forward to the weekends with NO make-up, just my L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Life Miracle Blur Instant Eye smoother and Miracle Blur. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does have a nice smooth texture however I can't say I see any difference. My skin looks about the same, I have been using the cream daily. It did not cause any break outs which is great, it just didn't add anything for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you want flawless looking skin if you wear makeup or not, this blur cream is ah-mazing!!! It made my skin look like it was airbrushed. I love it as I'm getting older and a few wrinkles here and there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really hoping to see more instant results since that is stated in the product name as Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother. I used it several times and I didn't see a difference. Frankly I wasn't crazy about the consistency either. I prefer a creamy product and this was more like the consistency of petroleum jelly...thick and dense. I will continue to use it to see if results come later but so far, not too impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream was wonderful! It really surprised me. I have a sort of orange peel on the one side of my face. Nothing I've tried has helped. This product actually hid it, not only that, it is so much smoother now after using this cream for 3 weeks! Thank you L'Oreal! The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it's hard to get it out of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Miracle Blur Cream under my makeup, and I don't like it! It says it's oil-free, but it makes my skin feel oily. It just had a really weird slick feeling that didn't really absorb into my skin. My mineral makeup or concealer didn't go on smoothly over it either. I don't think it really helped blend my skin or cover imperfections. Like I said, I still had to use concealer to over up some blemishes. I think it will be fine as a stand-alone sunscreen. That's what I'll use it for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed the apperance of less lines and wrinkles instantly and it seems to get better each day. Almost as if it is repairing your skin. I had a friend tell me after 3 days of using it that my skin was glowing and I looked younger than usual. She said whatever you are doing keep it up. If you are putting it on under foundation wait 2-3 minutes in between for the Miracle Blur to soak in. It seems to be easier to apply your foundation if you do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cream comes out thick and you don't need a lot . It goes on after your regular moisturiser and/or sunscreen. Take a small size amount and spread over your face. You'll notice a difference in fine lines and wrinkles right away. My sister even noticed the difference. The one thing that I didn't like is that my face did tend to break out. I like the eye treatment the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it really helped around my eye area so much .It just smoothed moat of all the wrinkles out .There was no bad smells so glad for that.I believe it helped tremendously. Thanks L'Oreal another great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very impressed with the Miracle Blur,. I have had skin issues since my teens, including acne and skin sensitivity. Revitalift Miracle Blur worked wonderfully on me, by reducing the appearance of large pores and giving my skin the beginning of a health glow. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good skin care product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm confused about the purpose of the product. Is it a smoother or a sunscreen? And what is the purpose of a smoother? I would define it as a primer with sunscreen. I actually like the product, the marketing is just confusing. Brighter side- goes on smooth as silk, it's light, and its moisturizing at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I'm in love! It's a little on the thick side, but not greasy at all and has no odor. It goes on so smooth and makes my skin soft and silky. I haven't used my primer since I started using this because,it works better than my primer to keep my makeup on all day. I am pleasantly surprised with the quality and efficiency of this facial smoother. L'Oréal hasn't failed me lately! Kudos to you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this product works great! It did exactly what it said it would. I would recommend this product to all my friends. I am going to start looking for this product in the store. My skin has never looked better since I started using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found the product to be effective on my forehead and t zone area but not a fan of how it felt or worked on the rest of my face. It felt heavy and greasy unlike the eye smoother which I loved. Maybe not right for my skin texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a bit skeptical about this product. If you could see my box of facial creams that haven't cut it, you would know that I am pretty picky. This Facial smoother goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling silky. I mainly use it on my forehead area in-between my brow - where all the little wrinkles are. It is great - it smooths the wrinkles and leaves my skin feeling great - not greasy. I will definitely be buying this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't over the top about this product. I found it very difficult to get the product out of the tube. I found the consistency/texture/feel of the facial smoother to be thick and greasy. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and didn't really find any difference in days I used the product and days that I didn't - in regards to the look of my facial lines/wrinkles and makeup results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i think this loereal miracle blur cream, instant facial smoother is not for me. the cream was so thick it was hard to spread it on my face. it felt heavy . i tried it under makeup too, it made my makeup feel so heavy...i will not be buying it. on the up side it smelled good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This used to be a great product! I told everyone about it! Now I am unable to get it without SPF 30. I am so grossly allergic to the SPF 30 I can't even be in the same room of someone using it!!!! When a product works, why do you feel you have to ""make it better""?"
"I have been loving using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Mircle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother. I have been using this now for a couple of weeks and have really enjoyed the way that my foundation has worn and stayed fresh looking all day. My pores are invisible using this and I couldn't be more excited that my T-Zone doesn't look like an oil slick by noon. I normally use Smashbox Pore primer but this is just as good if not better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great broad spectrum protection and spf 30 but chemical sunscreens rather than physical blockers used. Comes out waxy and apply to face like spackle for the lines in the face. Face felt smooth after and no irritation after using. Neutral smell. I think some people will see anti aging benefit since the sunscreen is sufficiently strong but I didn't love the feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream, it is seriously an amazing instant facial smoother. This makes my skin so smooth and soft, my pores disappear! My makeup looks flawless and stays on all day. I absolutely love this cream so much. I have oily skin but this does not increase the oil at all, if anything I really feel it makes a matte finishafter I put on my makeup. I think if anyone is looking for a smoother look, they need to try this out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal definitely made a product that's going to stay on my shelf. The Miracle Blur with SPF 30 was easy to put on each morning and made my skin looks great. I have some pretty large pores, so this noticeably helped smooth everything out. Additionally, I get the confidence that my skin is protected from UV radiation. The only things I didn't like was the scent wasn't my favorite, and the texture is a little thick right out of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I definitely feel like this is a temporary filler. I've put it on before I put on my primer and foundation. I understand that It's filling in the fine lines. I also noticed that it's almost like a primer in that it fills in large pores too. What I'm weirded out about is the texture. It's somewhere between soft butter and cookie dough. With lotions and creams being so much thinner and creamier, I was very thrown off by the texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first few times I applied this product it was almost like a thick paste. It did not go on easy. It wasn't until about a week later that it started to come out smoother and I was able to apply it without it crumbling in my fingers. Once applied it makes your face feel extremely smooth and soft but I have not really noticed any ""blurring"" of my fine lines etc. I do not think I will be purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a product that would minimize the look of the large pores on and around my nose area. I have found that product, L'Oreal Paris Revital Lift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother. The cream is smooth and feels very soft on my skin. The foundation I use glides on over the cream to create a very smooth appearance including minimizing the pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have had a chance to use this for about a week now and there definitely a difference in the appearance of my skin. The fine lines seem to just disappear and my face is so soft. I would definitely buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Been using the product faithfully for over three weeks now and I can honestly say I see zero change. I also would like to mention that I did notice some eye irritation I assume from the product. Everytime I used the product my eyes were very itchy and watery. I will at this point STOP my use of the product. I will NOT be recommending this product to anyone. It is a very easy to use product with nice packaging. Just not a product I feel is for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I first squeezed the product onto my hand I was taken by surprise by its waxy consistency. But after getting past that the L'Oréal Miracle Blur Facial Smoother I think did a pretty good job on blurring the smaller lines and underlying bumps I have on my face. I would definitely use this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What I like most about the product is that it has sunscreens in it and after a few applications made the lines around my eyes diminish. It also works great with my makeup. The only thing I don't like is that it is way to thick other than that it is a great product. I will be purchasing this in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product left my face feeling like it was sunburned. And I was greasy feeling shortly thereafter. I also didn't care for the texture as it came out of the container, very crumbly and not pleasant. Overall something I won't use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt like the product did offer some coverage but to me the sunscreen smell was stronger than I would like in a daily use product. I noticed it all day. I did not see any noticeable change in the appearance of my face after using and removing the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think I am going to LOVE this product..most excited to put it on then my make up. It is smooth in my hands and on my face. I like the fact that I have it on while driving because it is so important on the sun side. It is a routine I can put in force every morning. Wish I had more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For me, the cream is very thick and heavy feeling on my face. It did make the appearance of the pores, especially on my nose, look smaller. After applying the cream, my face felt almost sticky for a while until it was absorbed. Even after it had absorbed, I still felt like it was there and I didn't care for that feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My initial thought when squeezing the product from the tube was ""wow - this stuff is thick"". I worried that the consistency of the product would make applying to my face difficult. I was pleasantly surprised that the product did glide on smoothly. I liked the fragrance - not too strong, just subtle enough. I've used the product consistently and don't really notice any difference in smoothing out fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is very good. I really liked that it was non-greasy. I have very oily skin with nothing on it. I would recommend this for anyone who has greasy skin because it makes the skin smooth without the greasy feel. I found that I only needed a very small amount to cover my entire face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother I was instantly surprised at the results. It definitely worked well on smoothing out my skin and helped to cover my large pores. I would definitely try this product again in the future. I liked how it made my skin look and feel much softer and didn't leave it feeling oily or greasy . In my picture I only put it on one half of my face and I can see the difference it made. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked Miracle Blur. It made my skin feel so soft and shrunk the pores around the nose. I have really sensitive skin and I did not have any problem with fragrance or a reaction to the smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely love this. So easy to use.I like the way the applicator is made and it glides on nice and smooth. It feels good and soaks in quickly, which I love. I do think it blurs lines and shows improvement over several uses. It works wonders. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My bottle may have been sitting because it came out really thick for the longest time and then one day I got a glob of oil. However, even being thick the way it was, it was still fantastic. I have really dry skin ,open pores and acne scars, so this helps to moisture eyes and fill in any pits on my skin. I do tend to breakout but this did not make me breakout. This is a higher quality than the usual primer I use. I would definitely buy this again, I love it. The packaging was gorgeous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was able to try L'Oréal Revitalift miracle blur and was not too impressed by the smell. There was an almost overpowering smell of sunscreen that made me feel as though I was only applying sunscreen and not a smoothing cream. The texture was too thick for me to spread over my face and I had to wash it off immediately as it was difficult to even out and I knew my make up would clump over the product. Very sad this was not a happy experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the ""blurred"" effect of this product. It did an excellent job of minimizing my pores, better than any product I've tried before. What was even better about it is that it does this instantly, no waiting weeks for numerous daily applications to take effect. Unfortunately, though, I am unable to continue using it because it made my overly sensitive skin break out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this for several days and really wanted to love it, but other than the SPF value, I didn't really see a benefit to using it. It did not change the appearance of my skin which has very large pores. My skin felt smooth, but more like it was due to the layer of silicon product rather than because it was helping my skin from the inside. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream leaves my face very soft, also I love the scent and the results that I 'been seeing in the past days. Definitely I would recommend this product with others so they could start noticing a difference in their skin. All 30 women needs to start taking care of their skin and to see better results I recommend you the L'Oreal brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When you start applying the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother you notice it feels a little thick so be sure to spread it evenly and thinly then you MUST let it DRY before applying foundation or powder. My loose powder goes on nice and smooth and lasts much longer than if I weren't using the L'Oreal Paris Facial Smoother. Even though this isn't a permanent fix it does what it was meant too and a definite must have in the makeup bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a chance to try out L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother. It is a great product. Very light cream and goes on very smooth. I have very dry skin in the fall and winter months, so I need something that will last all day. Midway through my day, my skin started drying up and flaking. I guess I need something stronger and/or long lasting. Great product for semi-dry skins but not for the eczema skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was looking for a product that would reduce the size of my pores. I used this product for three weeks. What I like about this product is that it did not irritate my skin. After using this product my skin appeared to be much smoother and moisturized. It's very light and not harsh at all. My results were not instant but after a couple of weeks there was a noticeable difference. I think with continued use the appearance of fine lines will be less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the way this product felt on my skin. At first it seemed to gone on a little greasy but within seconds it was dry and my face felt smooth as could be. I real like the affect of this product. I wore it out for a day of sun beating and my face felt really good at the end of the day . I also didn't get burnt on my face because it does have SPF in it also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Blur Cream is very thick and not really 'creamy'; also, I don't feel that the product gave me the results it promised. I felt as if I needed to reapply throughout the day since it is so thick and caused me to feel as if I just sweated it off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok... so it's nice and thick and very creamy... I was very aware that I had it on. I kept touching my face. It did feel very smooth. I liked that it's an SPF...but I wasn't a big fan. I couldn't use this on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the product. It's a great primer and I love how it smooths out lines and wrinkles. I did notice it doesn't take a lot of this product to get results, and if you use to much your face feels greasy and also ends up looking greasy later on. However, it's an easy fix by just not using as much. It's a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift MIracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother and I'm sold! It worked just like it's advertising said it would. I was hoping it would make me look 16 again, but alas it didn't. Hahahaha. Seriously, though, it did take years off my face. I don't know how it works, but I'll tell you, it's going to be on my makeup shelf from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the fact that this had sunscreen in it and it did make my face smooth. However, it did leave my skin a bit oily and I didn't really notice a difference in my skin. I wasn't really that impressed. (Product was received in exchange for my honest review) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the cream for several weeks and it appeared to make my skin smoother. I have acne scars and, as I age, I also worry about them becoming more noticeable. The texture of the product was pleasing and it seemed to make a small positive impact on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It feels great going on and while on your skin, very smooth. I like the SPF protection but it is frustrating that I still need a mosturizer also, and having to allow everything to dry between every application. I guess it blurred some lines subtley, also my make up went on very smooth over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I definitely would recommend this to family and friends. Pretty straight forward and I also shared this with my mom, since I think I am fairly young and/or don't have any current problem with aging skin. My mom felt that it was simple to apply and did make her skin feel smooth while it also felt light on her skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The miracle blur instant skin smoother was nothing to write home about. Its thick when it goes on and feels thick as it sits on your face. Although, my face did feel somewhat smoother it definitly did not erase the look of my wrinkles, lines or pores. The positive side, giving this product 1 star is the protective SPF 30 in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is prob a really great product. I have naturally oily skin and i do not like the feeling of heavy greasy products. To be clear this wasn't greasy it was like a thick matte feeling. when i applied the L'Oreal facial smoother it was just to heavy for my skin. I tried wore it about 3 times or 3 days, before i had to just say no. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was surprised when I tried the miracle blur I really didn't think it would work. I used it on my forehead because there were some lines. It really worked when I looked in the mirror the lines were diminished. I also tried it on my chin and my pores seemed to disappear. I would recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very satisfied with both products. Very easy to spread around the eyes and over my face. Thick but with a velvety feel to the skin. Both products smooth wrinkles and fine lines without leave any signs of grease or shine on the skin. The facial smoother works great as a primer. The Instant eye smoother really worked well for me as a busy mom of 3 who works out of the house as well, goodbye dark circles and tired looks. This product was a lifesaver.

"After using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother (1.18 oz) for few weeks, I definitely love it. My skin is highly oily and super sensitive, so finding something what works for me is not easy, but this product is! I really like that this product is almost scent free, very light. It's make my skin matt and smooth, my skin looks refreshed. It's also works great under makeup. I will definitely purchasing this product in future! <3 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and LOVE it, it has decreased my lines and wrinkles and my skin is so smooth. It also works instantly by decreasing wrinkles, lines and pores, but the long term effects are even better. I have recomended this product to my mother and a couple of friends and they love it. My mom has noticed a dramatic reduction in her lines and wrinkles and her skin is so much smoother. She looks wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the miracle blur skin smoother felt like wax on my face, and I tried it several times. Not sure if it helps skin in the long run, because I don't think I can tolerate using it long term. Perhaps my daughter will want to try it. I was really looking forward to trying this new product from this company. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This not only met but exceeded my expectations. Was impressed that it was thick, rich and non greasy and was easy to apply. It made my face look and feel smoother. I will definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product goes on easy and takes a very little amount to cover your whole face. I did not like that every time I tried to use it I dropped what I was going to put on my face in the floor. It was very dry coming out of the tube. It is light on the face and does Deminish pores overall it is ok but not one I will likely continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product was thicker then what I first expected it to be. It takes very little to go a long way. It goes on smooth and feels nice to the touch on my face. I do think once i put on my foundation that this product smoothed out my face and fine lines a bit. It seemed ok to wear. It was not heavy feeling on my face. I have been using this for about two weeks. I think it helps when using it but does not seem to offer any affect when you arent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really didn't notice too much of a difference with this miracle blur product. It definitely made my skin softer and perhaps kept my make up on a bit longer. But it didn't blur any imperfections... not really. I will say though that it didn't hurt my skin or cause any irritatation and I often get irritated with other products as my skin is sensitive.

L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother I was impressed with this product I have some crows feet and always have bags under my eyes. I was reluctant but needed to find a great product I was excited that this actually does what it says. Now I feel more confident about my appearance I just dab some on daily and do my make-up and my crows feet and bag circles do not show. Well worth the buy .

"I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Facial Smoother and I saw instant results. The areas on my cheeks where I have some acne scars appeared smoother right away. My skin looking more smooth seems to be temporary and unfortunately, I have yet to see long term results, which is why I only gave it three stars. I am willing to continue to use it a bit longer though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it worked pretty well! I'm 30 and I had some deep lines on my face. After using I notice the lines getting faint and it smoothing my skin. I think my face looks better and a lot healthier. It moisturized my face and made it smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My first take on this is it goes on thicker than I am used to. I did knock off 1 star for the thickness of the cream. At first I didn't think I was going to like the texture of this product, but once on and them you apply your foundation, it looks so nice. It does make my skin look smoother and more refined. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The consistency of this product is way too thick! I was expecting something more creamy, but I gave it a chance. It stuck to my skin, causing it to dry out over the time I used it, and almost gave me a caustrophobic feel on my face. It did not look smooth at all, but really cakey. The one plus, the makeup I applied over it seemed to last longer than normal, I just can't get past the thick consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this for free as a BzzAgent. It seems like a regular moisturizer, I don't notice any difference compared to the Olay I normally use, except that if I use it close to my lashes my liner and mascara will smear. It's good for around my eyes though, but it doesn't seem to make my lines look smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I THINK I JUSS FOUND A PRODUCT I FELL IN LOVE VWITH I HAVE DRY SKIN IDIDNT THINK THIS WOULD HELP WITH THAT BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT IT DID!!!!

"I don't have many lines and wrinkles as of yet. I used this product for a week and didn't notice much of a difference. However, a friend commented on my eyes looking ""brighter"". I asked what she meant and she said ""more awake, not as tired looking"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream was smooth to apply though rather thick (more reminiscent of a primer than liquid foundation or sunscreen). Because of the thick consistency, I used the product up fairly quickly. It didn't really conceal or blur away my imperfections but acted as a great base layer with SPF. If you don't expect any more from this cream, then it is worth the rather reasonable price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. I have extremely oily skin. So, initially, when I felt the texture I didn't think this would be good for me. I used it alone and as a primer before foundation and it really helped keep the oil at bay. My makeup stayed put! When I used it alone, it did reduce the look of my pores. It's very hard to find products that work with my oily skin, so I'm vey happy to have found this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing! I put it on prior to any other products, it gives my face a ""blank canvas"" effect. Leaves my skin smooth and soft. I apply my concealer and foundation right over it and it leaves my face looking even, no wrinkles or discoloration. The product isn't heavy or leaves the feeling of product on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the instant facial smoother on one side of my face to see if I noticed a difference. Although, I didn't think it was noticeably improved, it appeared a little bit brighter or alert on the side with the smoother. The side with the smoother felt soft and silky which I loved! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin that tends to be on the oiler side with the more rare random, very dry patches. The miracle blur cream was very soft and silky feeling and left my skin smooth and made a nice foundation to put my make up on. I normally don't wear much makeup but it was great being able to have a great start and balance everything out. It's very lightweight also. If you like primer, I recommend trying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is very silky and soft; for me, it was actually a little too silky which felt like an odd texture for a facial cream. However, my skin felt good after the cream was applied. In terms of the ""Miracle Blur"" effect, after two weeks of use I did not notice a difference. I do not have many wrinkles, just a few around my mouth and eyes, but I didn't notice any difference in those areas after use. Good product as a cream, however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a nice cream. A bit heavy than i have had expected, but a good one. i applied it over my makeup and i think thats the way to go ... it blended well. There was no flaking or an unnatural feeling when i used it... i think my skin liked it. There was a nice glow to my skin also! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"To say this product works is an understatement! It goes on smoothly, blurs the fine lines and wrinkles, smooths out skin and makes my bare face look just great. I will definitely use this product again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift product for a few weeks. I'm pregnant so I was really hoping to find a facial smoother that would help my overall skin health. I will say it did mildly smooth old acne scars but really didn't do much in the way of helping with keeping my skin healthy overall. I still have hormonal breakouts and need to use other products to help clear it up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Texture of product is silky which makes your skin feel that way. Best worn alone or under very light foundation.Skin must be exfoliated otherwise product won't smooth out nicely. Covers large pores, and moderately for acne scars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how it makes my skin look so smooth. I feel younger looking after only 1 week of use. I'm just amazed how easy it is to use. I'm kind of a no fuss girl. I don't wear makeup. My normal skin care was just soap and water. Just can't believe the difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I mostly wore the miracle blur cream smoother as a primer. I applied it after my moisturizer and before my foundation. It left my skin looking so soft and smooth. I also think that it helped my foundation to go the distance and last all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product for a few weeks now and I have noticed No noticeable differences after using the product. i have VERY visible pores so maybe this product is better for people who have less noticeable pores than myself. i'm going to continue to use the item until its finished just to at least say i gave it my best shot but overall I've noticed no difference on my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very nice texture. I out it on over my moisturizer and I could feel the difference. It made my skin very smooth and seemed to hide large pores. Great base for my foundation and I love that it has SPF in it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Miracle blur instant face smoother is a miracle in a little bottle. After using it for a couple of weeks I started to notice that my skin feels smoother, and nourished. I use it every morning in place of my previous moisturizer and it's amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's like a magic eraser for your face! I LOVE this product. I put it on, and my skin instantly looks smoother and younger. It's not greasy or heavy. I have sensitive skin, and I have not experienced one break-out since I began using this product. Trust me, you'll love it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved how soft and smooth this made my face feel when I put it on.. However, unfortunately just like the eye cream, it dried out my face and left it irritated. That is not necessarily a reflection of the product but may be my skins sensitivity. I would recommend this product to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product goes on smooth and doesn't feel like it clogs my pores like so many other products do. Even when sweating it still felt like I was wearing nothing at all. It also made my skin feel very smooth and hydrated. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because a little more sun protection would be preferable. All in all a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is amazing! I love this product more than Smashbox. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It looks actually flawless. I feel that it also brightens my complexion. It fills in the fine lines on my forehead. Just gives me that extra lift I need in the morning when I apply it. Would recommend anyone to give it a try over the other overrated department store products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I haven't been able to wear any kind of makeup in years but the L'Oreal Paris has shaved a few years off my face and makes me feel younger also. This stuff is truly a miracle for me. You have to try it to believe it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oreal's Instant Facial Smoother! At first I thought it was going to be a moisturizer but, boy was I wrong. It is actually a skin smoother. When I read that I was very confused. Instead of just moisturizing it instantly erased my visible pores making look and feel smooth, and the best part yet is it lasted 12+ hours. I now use it everyday and put it on before I apply my makeup, and it does not even bother my super sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the Miracle Blur Cream's consistency to be a little difficult to put on. It was not as smooth as I had anticipated. When I did spread it on my face, I found my makeup to go on smoother and I did not need to apply as much of my base as I usually do. My pores, which are fairly large, seemed to be diminished with use of the product. I would purchase this product and use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First of all this L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother did smooth and hide lines on my forehead but for me having a combination of both dry and oily skin this was not for me. This made my skin feel oiler than usual but still somewhat impressed by how it smoothed out the lines on my face. I do like how there is a sun block added into this due to today's damaging UV rays. If L'Oreal were to make a version specifically for oily skin I would give it another try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always struggled with large pores, it's always been a huge problem for me! The very first time I used this I was very impressed! It instantly made my face look smoother and my pores smaller. Plus, I really like the fact that it has sunscreen in it. I think this will be a daily part of my makeup routine from here on out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the Loreal Paris Rivitalift miracle blut facial smoother for a week now and love how my makeup goes on after using the cream. I have told my friends about it and would like to try it as well. I will be buying more of this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was odorless and was not at all irritating, which is positive, but it is not effective. It has the consistency of wood putty without actually working. I have used it every morning for 10 days and have seen no discernible results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother for about 2 and a half weeks. I find the texture of this a little thick and lumpy. It does however make your skin feel nice and supple. It doesn't smell very nice either, but it does smooth your skin and is well worn under make-up. If texture isn't a bother, you might actually like this product. In my opinion, this should be in a jar and maybe retextured. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I start using the Facebook Smoother during my days off from work. When I returned to work the girls notice something different. They said I looked younger and wanted to know what I was doing. Told them that I was using L'Orel Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Face Smoother. They were very interested in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to say I quite enjoyed using the L'Oreal Paris Instant Facial Smoother!! I liked the thickness of it, made it very easy to put where I wanted it to go. Made my face very soft!! In all honesty it felt like a nice lotion on my face. I would highly recommend it to anyone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur. The product is a little pricey, and after using the cream every day for two weeks, I noticed very little difference around my eyes. I did love the smooth creaminess when applying the product, and I felt like the product was a good moisturizer for my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product at a point when I have been looking at different products to try to get rid of fine lines and wrinkles life has brought my way. I had looked at a lot of products and this was the one I happened to try, I was fairly pleased with the results. Fine lines are less noticeable after using this. It has a SPF to it which is nice. The product is fairly thick and you need to start with a small amount as it seems to go far while applying.I liked it and was happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found the awsome Loteal product to actually blur my imperfections. I have a single pore on my face that's overly large. Miracle blue filled in the gap and made my face look very smooth. I love this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently tried the L'oréal Paris revitalift miracle blur cream. I was very excited to try it and now I'm actually kind of disappointed. After reading the bottle I realized it's basically just sunscreen. I know using sunscreen daily will prevent wrinkles so I guess in that aspect it would help. It only takes just a small amount so the bottle should last a long time. I will continue to use it to help prevent wrinkles but once the bottle runs out I doubt I'll purchase it again.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother is a great product. I am so lucky that I was able to try this product for free. I loved it the very first day that I tried it. It makes my skin feel renewed. After putting it on, my face feels fabulous! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oreal miracle blur facial smoother and loved it! My skin is very sensitive and is prone to break outs, but I didn't have any trouble using this product. It made my skin feel so soft and smooth. My husband even commented that I look younger! Thank you for letting me sample it, I would definitely buy more when this runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like this product, but it didn't help my skin. Although, I liked the cream consistency for the eye smoother, I didn't like it for the facial smoother. I was expecting it to be like a frothy, lotion-like consistency. It dried out my face. On my cheek area, my skin was slightly flaky and peeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to give this product a try. However I was a little disappointed in it overall. The product feels good on my skin, and it does seem to provide s nice evening layer to my face before makeup. But it left me feeling a little greasy and broken out too. Have used lots of L'Oréal products over the years and never had that happen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the instant skin smoother. It's very smooth to apply and feels nice initially. My skin felt greasy pretty quickly and it smells strongly of sunscreen. I would consider my skin normal, not oily , so I can't imagine using it in the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely hated this product and giving a BIG FAT ZERO! It was hard to get out of the tube and when it did, it came out with a thick line. I tried to apply this to my face, but it was so heavy it felt gross on my skin, that I had to wash my face and use my benefit primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical of the Instant Facial Smoother product by L'Oreal Paris. But after using it for about a week, I am astounded that something could make my skin feel so soft and smooth again. Just like a baby's skin only it's Mine! The cream was so easy to use and applied like a dream. This product is definitely one of my favorites now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In my personal opinion I didn't really like this. When I first put it on it went on great but after about 10-15 minutes of it being on it just looked like I'd caked on makeup. It didn't matter how much or little I used... No matter how much I rubbed it in I still got the caky look by the end of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the facial smoother and had to adjust the amount used, because a little goes a long way. I noticed some difference the first few times I used it. After using this for about 10 days I can see fine lines are less noticeable and my face feels so soft. This is not a miracle cure for fine lines and pores but it does help. I loved the fact that it has a sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the product for about a week and I can definitely see and feel a difference in my skin. It is smoother, softer, and more even. I love that it protects as a sunscreen too! It has been so easy to add to my morning routine. My makeup even seems to stay on better! I will definitely recommend it to everyone I know! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the L'Oreal Instant face smoother as soon as I received it. I did not notice an immediate changes with skin smoothing but over time it seems to have helped even out some small lines forming. One thing I didn't really care for was the feeling that the cream leaves. It has a slight greasy feel which bothered me whenever I touched my face. I'm going to keep using it but not sure if I'll stick to this one product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not a fan of this product because of the texture. Not sure if mine is defective or if the product is supppsed to be a pliable wax but the consistency is not for me. I did not like the feel of rubbing wax onto my face. The miracle blur for the face is on the right in my pic, hard to tell but the texture is not at all the the supple lotion of the miracle blur for eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So i am going on week 2 of this product and i think its pretty awesome, i have never used anything like this under my foundation, but after this i will not go without! It really gave my face a flawless look using this before applying my foundation, it helped keep my pores from showing thru, it never made my foundation cake its simply awesome and i will be purchasing this from now on [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this for four days and the only change I saw was that my face and neck broke out. It is very hard to just get out of the packaging because it almost like dried glue. I couldn't get it to go on smoothly and once it was on my face felt sticky and greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the Miracle Blur Cream for a week. So far my observations have been that when I squeeze out the lotion, it comes out a bit hard. It breaks off on its own, while I am squeezing on to my figure. Then I rub it between my fingers and it gets soft. From that point when I apply, it goes on very smoothly. My face feels very soft after applying. I love the idea that it contains sun screen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried both products several times and I didn't really notice a difference in the way my face looked or the way my under eye area looked. I'm not a huge makeup wearer but I patted powder over the facial smoother after it dried and I didn't really look any different than I did before I put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this product was much better then the eye smoother, though for some reason it made my skin feel a little bit oily. It could be my skin type, but it didn't make me feel as though my skin was fresh. If it could be altered to give a clean feel, i would give it more stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product in place of a moisturizer and primer for my make-up. It feels velvety, like a primer. Over time, it felt too greasy. I've been using it for 2 weeks. I dont see a difference in the appearance of my pores or fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Not a fan of the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream. It felt very smooth going going on my skin but definitely did not moisturize. My skin was still very dry and I had to apply a second lotion on top so my skin wasn't flaky and dry. I wouldn't recommend this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"GREAT product to enhance skin. The formula is thick and took a while to get to use to using. However, the results are great. If you are looking for smooth skin try L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Instant Facial Smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only gave it one star because it really was a bad experience. I was exited to try this product especially since it said that it was tested on sensitive skin and for all skin types. I just got it today and immediately went home and took off my makeup and clenased my face. I put a mosturizer first as it indicated and as soon as I put it on my face it burned! It really irritated my skin and made me breakout! I will give this product to my mom to see if it works for her instead! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. It goes on very easily and feels nice on my skin. I don't know if the change is dramatic, but I do look fresher and maybe my wrinkles slightly more hidden. There is not a strong scent which is nice. I like that it is also moisturizing, because with the dry season approaching, sometimes my tinted moisturizer is not enough. I took off a star, because it doesn't seem like the tube will last very long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited to receive this and try it out. Unfortunately it didn't serve it's purpose with me and it actually broke me out. It's really thick and reminds me more of a primer. A little on the greasy side as well. Definitely can't see myself referring this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother helped reduce the size of my pores. It minimized the appearance of my wrinkles and left my face feeling soft. Thank you for allowing me to test this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this cream. It makes my face look less blotchy and leaves a smooth look. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel as though it's really hard to wash off. I notice on the days I use it that my night face wash doesn't sudz up. It makes me think it's leaving residue behind. But I do like the way the product works and I will use it on the wknd. I just won't use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Not sure if it was just my product but it was very thick so I can see why it's called miracle blur because it's so thick it covers it up. For a quick minute it looks smooth but then it goes back to normal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been trying this product for over 2 weeks now. I guess I was expecting something much creamier. It's hard to get out of the tube. I thought maybe there was something wrong with my product. It has a thick texture and left my face feeling oily. I did notice a significant decrease in the number of larger pores around my nose area. I gave this product 3 stars because of the feel and texture. Thank you Bzzagent for letting me try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a little surprised at first at how thick the cream was for sunscreen. However, it went on smoothly and didn't have a bad sunscreen odor which was good. Even though it was thick, it went on smoothly and didn't feel greasy. I have tried it 3 times and didn't get a sunburn on my face during any of the outings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother works wonderfully. When I first squeezed it onto my hand to apply to my face I thought it would be difficult to rub in because it seemed so thick but it smooths right onto your skin. It smooths lines and wrinkles and feels great on my face. I also like the fact that it has spf 30 sunscreen to protect my skin from sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother and I saw results almost immediately, my wrinkles didn't appear as bad and my face felt smoother and less rough. I didn't like the texture, it didn't seem to spread as easy as some facial products but it works great and can be used daily with or without makeup. It is a great addition to my daily routine and I love the face that it has sunscreen so there is no need for separate protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream - Instant Facial Smoother. I have used this product numerous times over the course of about two weeks, and for someone who does not wear foundation, I love the look and feel of this product. It feels a bit like a thick lotion, but it is not greasy. My husband even agrees that it makes my big, yucky pores almost disappear. I believe this is a product I will continue to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that miracle blur instant facial smoother is an amazing product that goes beyond primers I've ever used before. I love how it really smooth rough patches of my skin and made everything a smooth even pallet to apply cosmetics to or even go out with out any other makeup.

"I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother. I applied the cream after getting out of the shower. It goes on clear and dries quickly. I used it to blur out the lines between the eyes. Although I appreciate that it has sun screen, I really didn't see much of a difference in blurring my fine wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was too thick for its container. I loved the feel on my hands, but felt it was too thick for my face. I think this would be lovely as a severe weather formula for protection. I did not like how my skin felt after especially when I tried to apply make up. Seemed difficult to spread. Gave it a good try and think with a little tweaking this could be a lovely product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is awesome. I love how you get such a smooth feeling on your skin. It diminishes the fine lines and wrinkles. Especially on my forehead. I then apply my cover up and it applies so much smoother. I would recommend this product for others to try to see almost instant results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'oreal revitalift miracle blur truly is a miracle. It is very thick so a little goes a long ways. I've been using it for about a week. My face feels so smooth and soft. At age 55 I need all the help I can get! I'm including a selfie without makeup so you can see for yourself. I love it and I know you will too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can see why it would ""blur"" or fill in fine lines. I used this twice, but it was too thick for my liking to continue to use it. I could feel it on my skin throughout the day after I applied it. My skin felt really soft, but slightly greasy. I do, however, really enjoy the miracle blur eye cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the protective layer the product gives, however, I did not enjoy the texture. It was a little too thick. Perhaps it would be better to let it sit on your finger to warm up so it smoothes out over the skin better. Worth a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal miracle blur instant skin smoother is an excellent product in my opinion. This is a non-greasy,fragrance free product. This product is easy to use. It visibly erases lines, wrinkles, and reduces pore size. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great sunscreen the smell is nice and non oily. It makes my skin feel and look smooth. I don't just use it as a sunscreen I use it as a moisturizer too. This is a must try. I will buy this product and use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'OREAL Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur instant skin smoother is great though out my day I can't stop feeling my face to feel how much better it feels. It is so smooth.

"This product was freaking awesome. It is thick and comes out almost like it is dried out, but wow, you put it on and it does what it says. It is like a face smoother. Now I can not live without it. I love how non greasy it is too. Truly smoothed your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream really has a great smooth and creamy texture. It spreads easily and doesn't leave a greasy finish. I wear it under my makeup with no residual oiliness during the day. I'm not sure if it affects my wrinkles but will update my opinion after using for a little longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As with any skin care/ anti-aging product, I was skeptical at first. Normally I don't even bother because there has been very few that I have tried that actually lived up to their hype. Well let me tell you I absolutely love this stuff. A little but goes along way, my skin feels incredibly often afterwards & looks good. There is no smell and no greasy feeling afterwards, just amazingly soft skin. I highly recommend & plan to purchase it once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Definitely has made my skin feel moisturized and soft. Even took away my dark under eye circles and didn't take longer then a few minutes to notice the difference.

"I did not care for the Facial Smoother at all. The consistency was thick and greasy. It squeezed out like hard blob. I lost so many pieces in the sink. It did not smooth on like I thought it should.

"I think the L'Oréal Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother is a great product! It applies evenly and makes my skin feel so smooth. It makes my pores look much smaller! Any fine lines and wrinkles all but disappear when I use this product. The only downfall is that it makes my foundation pill a bit. I have to make sure to remove all the product that builds up on the skin. Overall, a good product! I recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way it feels on my skin. It is so smooth and soothing. Was difficult to get out of tube at first, but after first use it comes out fine. I love the product and my skin stays soft for hours. Would recommend and will recommend to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I normally don't use makeup so I was leary trying new products. I was happy to see I wasn't putting color on. I was happy to see it was helpful for your skin when you are in the sun...that's a plus! It went on easy and made my skin feel great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I give this 3 stars, because I used it for 3 days and stopped due to greasiness and I broke out with pimples. Facial cream is very thick, and had a greasy texture. @i guess for my skin type it didn't work well. I will be giving to a friend to try it out. And then maybe see positive results.

I got this just in time for the weather change from the last remnants of summer to the crisp fall wind. I'd forgotten how hot the fall sun could be and this came right on time. It goes on smooth and really protects my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"this is a great product I'm sure but unfortunately I tried it several times since I received it . It makes my face red. I thought maybe it was because it was new for me so I tried two more times with the same results. I know L'Oréal makes great products, so it must be my skin doesn't agree with.

"I think the L'Oreal Miracle Blur Cream does make your skin feel and look very smooth. It does feel a little thick, and I feel the need to wipe some of it off. It also irritated my eyes, so I have to be careful not to use too much. I also felt that it left my skin looking a little whiter than usual, and I am pale to begin with. I will continue to use it and let you know more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product I must say I love it! I have been using it for 7 straight days and my skin looks fabulous. It is fresher, brighter looking, the wrinkles are less noticeable. It's not heavy or greasy feeling. I will continue to buy this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Don't feel as if it did all it was touted to do. Did it smooth lines and make pores less visible..not really. Kinda but not really. But the issue is really that it clogged my pores and made me break out like crazy....something that is to supposed to help hide pores shouldn't make you break out or...so I assumed. Cant keep on with it due to this. Really wanted to as it feels delicious. Just can't do the breakouts. Giving to friends with less issues with their skin.

"I used this product reluctantly because I'm only in my early 30's and very recently realized I need to start using anti wrinkle and revitalizing products for my skin. I used it the day I got it in the mail and expected it to do little to nothing for my skin. I was very surprised to find that upon using the skin cream, my skin looked brighter and smoother. My tired looking skin looked somewhat clear and smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal has always been one of my favorite brands. As I get older, my face is not as youthful as it once was. I have used the facial smoother every day, with and with-out makeup. My skin looks smoother and more youthful. Moisture is an important thing when it comes to your face and the smoother has all you need. If you are within a certain age, I suggest using the Facial Smoother every day, IT WORKS GREAT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am always looking for a good face cream and as I get older my needs have changed. I like that the Miracle Blur Cream is light and does not leave me with a heavy feeling. It blends in smoothly and helps to reduce the dry skin and lines on my face. It is wonderful when used in combination with the Miracle Blur Instant Eye Cream. You can see a noticeable smoothness within minutes and it helps create a great foundation to apply my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the facial smoother is not for me. I used it for seven days and did not notice a difference. I don't know if being a woman of color with hardly any wrinkles or frown lines was why I did not notice a change. I did like how light and non greasy the product was. Overall, I was not impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was not good for me. The cream is extremely hard to squeeze out of the tube because it is so thick and it feels like it put a heavy film over my face. I also have acne prone skin and I broke out really bad after the first use. I will not be purchasing this item in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels heavy and thick when you first put it on. There is no scent which is nice and it soaks in quickly leaving your skin feeling smooth. However, I have very acne-prone skin and after 2 days of using this I had a pretty bad breakout. I will not use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream was so thick .. its hard to get out of the tube. It's not easy to spread and you have to use a lot. In honest opinion : I will not be purchasing this item. OH --- and my face becomes dry and flaky after a hour from applying the cream. I didn't see a difference before or after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Goes on smooth but if your someone like myself with oily skin I wouldn't recommend this product. Almost instantly after applying the cream it made my skin very oily. For someone with oily skin I think this would work great. I could see how it made my skin smoother and brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive never used any product like this before. I was amazed by the results. Unfortunately in my teens and adulthood I suffered from acne. I used this product and it instantly smoothed put my skin. It made me feel 10 years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product actually did a great job smoothing out my skin before applying makeup. It's rare to find an affordable moisturizer that smooths and acts like a primer.

"I had high hopes for L'oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother prior to use but I just could not get over the thickness and greasy feel of the product. I did give it a chance and used it twice before putting on my makeup but I felt as though it was too ""heavy"" for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using day and night i put on my normal face cream then apply this product and have no issue with creasing or product balling up. My face looks much smoother and my makeup seems to stay on longer, My wrinkles look minimized and i am happy with results so far i will need to use longer to see how long term results are . My one suggestions is put this is a pump to make easier to come out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product even though it comes out thick it smoothes out really well, it hasn't got rid of the fine lines but my skin looks more even and it gives my face glow giving it a younger appearance, I am definitely hooked on this product, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is now my favorite cream to use thank you BzzAgent for giving me the opportunity to try this. I uaed the cream right away when i got it and i noticed a big difference on my face right away. My skin looked clean and clear it also made my skin so soft. I was happy that it didn't make my make up cakey that was a big plus. I love this cream i now can't live without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was definitely skeptical about the product claims but this stuff does everything it promises. I have large pores on and around my nose and Miracle Blur really does a great job of minimizing them. I probably would've never purchased this product as I think the name is a little weird but after trying it, I am sold! My only complaint is that it does irritate my eyes a little as the day goes on even though I avoid the area around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal revitalift miracle blur cream surprised me- in a good way! It has a nice ,thick,smooth texture. At first I was hesitant because I thought it might be too heavy , but once I put it on it was great. It smoothed my skin out so nicely! Added benefit- it acts like a primer. Every time I wore it I got compliments on my ""flawless"" skin, which then opened the door to tell them about this L'Oreal product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was very thick and hard to squeeze out of the container. It is called instant skin smoother because it reminded me of a really thick foundation/concealer. Product not for me but maybe for some one else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product and i actually really like it! It comes out of the tube really thick, but ends up going a long way once i take the time to spread it. Stays on all day, and doesnt make the skin look oily at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this! I think the cream goes on super smooth, I feel like my skin looks really soft, and it does seem to fill in some of my fine lines. The only drawbacks are that I wish the SPF was just a little higher and that it is EXTREMELY hard to squeeze out of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this product has sunscreen! It helped smooth some of the more superficial pores, but I could still see some of the larger ones. It left my skin feeling smooth & soft. I may have to give in & admit I'll never be 100% happy with any pore minimizer. However, this one also includes SPF & felt great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream did seem to reduce the appearance of my fine lines, it honestly felt more like a paste than a cream to me. It's very thick and almost uncomfortable. Unfortunately it's not a product that I could use daily, but will be a nice addition to my skincare routine for when I need a quick fix or cover up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Alot of products promise to mak ur skin look or feel younger. It made my skin feel so soft immediately after applying it. It remained so soft I loved it. I've only been using it for a week but I'm hoping it does mak my skin look younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother made my face feel wonderful and I could see results starting to show in 3 days of using it and I'm still seeing results. You need to try this product yourself to see the great results you will get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure what to expect from the miracle cream, and after using it about a week, I'm still not sure. It feels and smells great, but I haven't really seen a difference in my skin. Perhaps I just need to give it more time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Unfortunately I didn't like L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother. It made my skin feel very greasy. The product was thick and didn't absorb into my skin quickly. I was looking forward to minimized pores but instead my acne flared. I'm not sure if it just isn't a good product for my sensitive skin type or what. It just isn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The texture of this is a bit weird at first, but once I read that I should use moisturizer first it made sense. It's similar to a thick paste. With the first use I noticed that my fine lines were less noticeable. my first instinct was that I looked ""ironed out,"" but in a good way. EVEN areas of my skin without fine lines looked healthier. I can't speak to any long term effects, as I've only used it a handful of times over a couple of weeks so far. Overall would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream went on as smooth as silk! It felt very good on my face and my makeup went on smoothly on top of it. It felt like an extra layer of protection. I like that it didn't have any fragrance to it as well. I've only used it a few times but I'm looking forward to seeing the results of long-time use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm still undetermined if I want to put this on my face everyday, but when I know I'll be in the sun it is awesome under my mineral foundation. Out of the tube it looks like wax and is so stiff but despite that on my skin it isn't greasy at all. And it doesn't make my skin more greasy by the end of the day either! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to use more expensive products, which I prefer to this, but for a drugstore product this isn't bad. I did find that it ""blurred"" the area around my eyes but I can't say that I've noticed changes to my skin. I also found that my concealer creased a bit when I used this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say that this product is amazing! I love that this product does not have a strong odor. It does not have a smell at all! This past weekend, I attended a football game, and guess what? NO sunburn!! This product makes my skin feel super smooth. When I put this on, it gives my face the look of a soft glow. I am so happy with this product. I have not noticed a large difference in my pores, but the lines in my face have definitely decreased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oreal Paris' RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother for almost two weeks, I am excited to report I can see a visible difference. I work hard to keep my face as free of wrinkles as possible, this is definitely a product I'll buy in the future. I was surprised by how well it works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a bit of a natural and organic nut, however, those products usually do not work all that well. This is like a filler for skin, great over moisturizer, under make up. It smoothes things up, but you have to be careful of the dosage, it is easy to put too much on. It is so great for acne scars, enlarged pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could not stop touching my face. I did it at night the first time I received it in the mail. And the next morning my face was STILL soft. Only downfall, it was a little difficult to squeeze out the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Omg! I received the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur sample from BzzAgent. This product actually does what it says it will. After applying my face felt silky and soft. The coverage was unbelievable that my pores looked smaller. My makeup looked as if I had it professionally done. 5 Stars all the way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product deserves a 5 star rating as its a great product. I used daily in conjunction with my normal skin care Regimen. Not only is it a Broad Spectrum Sunscreen but it's also a product which reduces lines & wrinkles. It goes on very Smooth and its not greasy or heavy. Although I didn't notice it reducing my pore size, It made my skin texture much Smoother. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like so many other products I have tried I thought that the L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother would just be another one that did not work. Wow! I was wrong, this is a great product and it really works. I saw the skin on my face become smoother and the wrinkles and fine lines were harder to see. I have now found a new beauty cream and I woun't be switching to anything else [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i have a face full of pores secondary to acne.I have been using loreal paris instant facial smoother.It works amazing.I have seen th difference the way my skin feels.My pores ha covered up and my fine lines have dissappeared [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Well I have been using the facial smoother for 5 days now, and I love it! My face looks refreshed and smooth. I even got a comment from my coworker! The cream is a little thicker then expected, almost a paste. The product also recommends pairing it up with their other facial products to get the best results, but I noticed a difference with this one alone! Thanks to BzzAgent and L'Oreal, I got a free sample to try first! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use facial sunscreen every day, usually in my moisturizer. I tried this instead for 2 weeks. I really liked the feel of it on my face. Not heavy feeling like a typical sunscreen. Will continue to buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really didn't see much of a difference. My age spots were exactly the same. I did half of my face just to see the difference. If you add makeup on top it's much better but I personally didn't see any difference between with the miracle blur vs without. I will use it this summer though since it does have spf to protect from the sun rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have large pores and some acne scars from teenage years. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother goes on under moisturizer. It really does hide the look of large pores, without feeling heavy or fake like concealers. It is lightweight and silky feeling. Good job L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, this stuff is THICK!! It is kind of hard to get out of the tube. It does not take much to get a full face application. Once I applied the instant Blur cream, it was definitely noticeable why they call it 'blur'. I felt like my face had a haze on it. I may have used too much though. I noticed a slight tingle as well, but I am not sure if this is because my skin was sensitive to the cream, or if it was the cream itself. I do not believe i would buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the way I could tell instance different in my skin, I tried the eye smoother it actually works in less than 3 days !! All other products I haven't been able to tell a difference that soon ! I will continue to buy and the factually accurate description of the product is perfect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well I have wrinkles, fine lines and deeper lines too! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother feels amazing on my skin. It definitely makes a smoother pallette on which to apply my make up. Big plus that it has sunblock too! It made my dry skin feel dewy and moist without feeling heavy, oily or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product. It's not greasy, non-comedogenic, and fragrance free. This product made my pores appear smaller. It also made my fine lines look less than they had. I can't wait to see how I look in a few weeks. I wear this under my foundation. It makes my foundation last longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product wasn't for me. I have sensitive skin and had a reaction to the sunscreen in this product. Although it was light weight and went on easily. For anyone with sensitive skin, I would recommend trying it on a small spot before trying it on your entire face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really thought that the L'Oreal Instant Facial Smoother was great and hiding my pores and fine lines. I put it on under my make up even though it says it is a sunscreen and to apply every 2 hours but also says it erases fine lines and wrinkles. I only applied once right before putting on my make up. It had a nice scent it did not make my face feel greasy. The only problem I had it was that it was very hard to get it out of the tube, very hard to squeeze and get the product out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this cream is horrible . First it is hard to get it out of the container . I have not really noticed a difference in my skin . I do not have deep wrinkle either.The moisturizer is just ok. I would not recommend this to anyone. It does have a sunscreen so that was a plus . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Both products are light-weight and covers well with just a small amount. The Instant Skin Smoother container was initially very difficult to get the product out. Seems too thick for tube design. I have taken a ""before photo"" and will do a final trial comparison in another week. So far I like the feel of the product but am unsure of any significant change in skin appearance. Will let you know soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the blur cream. The texture was more of a paste rather than a lotion. I was worried about that the cream would cause me to breakout (my skin can be sensitive) but it's been great so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a bit put off by the texture when it came out of the tube. I was expecting a lotion but it was more of a paste. Made for spreading it evenly a little difficult. The scent was ok, i could definitely smell the sunscreen. I did see a difference in my skin right away, we'll see if it improves over time. At this point, i probably wouldn't purchase it though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the way the cream makes my face feels even with full make up underneath. I am not noticing any changes with my face yet, but I have only been using it for a week in a half. I do find with the eye cream I feel sensation like something is working. I do feel that my eyes are not as puffy. Will continue to try to see full effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the Blur Cream and the one thing I noticed is it was very thick when I squeezed it out. It was a bit thicker than toothpaste and I actually dropped the cream on the counter the first few times. It stayed intact and I could pick it back up whole and use it. It did spread easier than I thought. It did not feel heavy or thick on my face. It felt light and translucent. I do like the product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very surprised with how thick this product was. I used this product in my problem areas and would rub it in my fingers to warm it up some before applying so it would go on easier. I used moisturizer first. Then this product and waited a few minutes before applying my makeup. It really helped to hide my pores and wrinkles. I would recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm on day 10 using this product, and I love it! I live in the North East, and winters are horrible. My skin on my face is so dry, but after using this product my skin is so smooth, no dry spots, and it doesn't leave my face oily. I haven't noticed any wrinkles immediately erased but I will continue to use because I love the way it makes my face feel and it does say it takes about 4 weeks to see major results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream is a great skin smoother. I love the way it makes your face feel kind of a velvety smooth skin texture. The product does not have an oder which is a plus for me. I've been using this product for a couple of days and it makes my face look smoother after applying my makeup. I will continue to use this product because I love the way it makes my face feel and will definitely recommend this smoother to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I squeezed the tube to try this product for the first time I was not expecting the thickness or gluey consistency of what came out. It was thick and it was gooey. But it went on easy with good coverage. I noticed some 'blurring' but not enough to add this to my familiar routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to get this product in the mail. I was a little disappointed as I thought this was a moisturizer. It is actually a thick sunscreen based cream to be worn on top of your normal moisturizer. It does have a silky texture but I made the mistake of applying it too heavy and it left my face with a greasy feeling. I have since only been using very small amounts and trying to avoid my naturally oily parts of my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so excited to try this product when I received it. Sadly, after 10 days of use I am still not impressed. The cream does not easily come out of its container and it has a very thick viscous consistency to it as well. Once you get it on, it has a nice feeling to it, but it does not do anything to ""blur"" anything. The best comparison I can think of is to a third tier face primer. It definitely does not live up to what L'Oreal claims it to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Miracle Blur cream for a week now. I'm not sure that I've seen any difference. It's a little hard to get out of the container because it is so thick. I will continue using this and hope that I do see a difference soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal RevitaLift miracle blur cream is not really what I was expecting. It is very thick and a bit of a pain to get out of the tube. It does go on very smoothly and does a little bit of blurring but nothing I would call miraculous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way is smooths out my flaws I will definitely buy more when I run out of the sample Some of my friends already use it and have raved about it Glad I was given the opportunity to try it out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, has some merit. although mine just showed up a few days ago it so far is working great. I have only had the chance to use it once but it worked great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is thick to blur lines, sort of. It feels like silicone on your face and if you use too much it is grainy and pulls your foundation off. I was not impressed. It says you can use it as sunscreen. Don't. Use facial sunscreen. It is gummy to apply. I would not buy this item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would've liked L'oreal to emphasized the moisturizer benefit a bit more. I've had this just 1 week and didn't think to use it without using another moisturizer before applying the Miracle Blur. It wasn't until yesterday that Iused it without othe moisturizer. It worked much better alone. I would like to see this product with a tint to it so it could be used without other products for more coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Creates a smooth surface for better makeup application or just to feel better in your skin. When applied correctly you could see very little pores on my face and fills problem areas in with ease. Definitely a product I would recommend and buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is like a snapchat filter for the face in a bottle. It is me but a better me! The blur is immediate and very visible. It stayed on all day, It was more like a no makeup makeup which I love. I made me look like I had just come back from a vacation. I will stress that you DO NOT need to use as much as the instructions suggest - a pea sized amount will do. I does not look chalky or uneven . I think it could be used a makeup primer if needed and it did not break me out . Two thumbs up!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first I wasn't sure what Miracle Blur Cream was about. As soon as I opened it I smelled sunscreen. That's one reason I like using it I always forget sunscreen on my face. The next reason is it helped as an under concealer lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Works really well. I don't wear make up or use any sort of leave on face treatment normally. You dont need much of this product to notice a difference. A little bit goes a long way.I definitely noticed an immediate difference with my skin's texture. All the rough spots were gone. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLife Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother and I loved the results. I could immediately see an improvement in the way my skin looked. It seemed much smoother and had a more even tone. The product was easy to apply and felt very luxurious. Plus, it had a pleasing fragrance. I think this is a great product that does what it says it will do. My skin has never looked or felt better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. The eye treatment cream took a little persuading to get out of the tube and a little goes a LONG way. It leaves you feeling very soft and smooth. The trouble was worth it. It has a texture similar to sunscreen. The Miracle Blur had a little rough texture but smoothes out to leave you feeling good lijewell your face is bare. Great for primer.

"I dont usually use alot of facial products, but this l'Oreal Revitalift facial smoother is a keeper, so far i've noticed amazing results. Definetely a keeper an i will be using this as an everyday skin regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product is very thick and I actually had it drop off of my finger; a little goes a long way. This product seems to cover your pores very well and fills in wrinkles by giving your skin a nice matte appearance. I didn't think it helps really cover dark spots, redness or skin imperfections though. It doesnt make your face feel greasy or sticky either. All in all, I'm happy with the product and I would buy it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I believe I may have joined this campaign a little late. I have only been using the product for one week. I have not seen any significant change. My skin is softer but as far as the fine lines they are still visible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical with a product that says it's a miracle, but it really is! It goes on very smooth and you don't need a lot of product for it to work. Came out of the tube easily with not a lot of squeezing required. I definitely recommend this product since it totally blurred all my wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the RevitaLife Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother that I received free from L'Oreal Paris. When I applied my makeup it made it so smooth I did not see fine lines at all. The texture was thick enough that I believe it made me look younger by filling in the wrinkles. I would definitely purchase this product in the future I think in the long run it would save you money because of less makeup. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is awesome!! I love the smoothness and the way it makes my skin feel. I personally prefer to wear it alone and not under make up because the texture is a little to slippery. But don't get that confused, it does not make your skin oily by any means. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product makes your skin feel silky smooth and an added bonus it makes my foundation spread evenly and easily. I've been using for 1 week now and will probably continue to purchase even after my full size sample is finished. Even though it is touted as a facial smoother it also contains a great sunscreen. I was a little hesitant about the sunscreen but was pleasantly surprised that it only has the faintest of sunscreen smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Eh. It felt like just another primer. A little bit goes a long way, but even using a small amount felt like it was too heavy. It did help keep my foundation from being too oily at the end of the day, but that's about all I can say for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't know if I received a bad tube or what but this product is so thick I had to remove the entire top to squeeze the product out, it was way too hard to squeeze it out the tiny hole on the top. It doesn't glide smoothly along your face at all. It also feels very heavy on my face. There are much better products out there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product as a primer for make up. I was instantly impressed with how smooth it went on. I do see that it had a ""blur"" to it. It had a nice matte finish. I was excited that it also had a sunscreen in it, as that is a must for my primers. I used this product consistently for three days and started to notice that by the end of the day my face seemed to get an oily feeling to it. I wish this product could hold up better to all day wear.

I have tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother and was impressed with the results. The texture of the cream was thicker that what I expected and I was a bit skeptical. I have been using it for a little over a week now and it smooths all the little wrinkles around my mouth. I use it mornings and at night and I can see a difference already. Great product!

This product came at a perfect time. My friends and I took pictures at Halloween and I noticed my pores looked huge. A couple of days later I received this product and was so excited to try it. I like that I don't have to use much product and a little goes a long way. On Friday I was at another party and had my picture taken. What a difference a primer can make! My pores were almost invisible! I wish I had both pictures but my friends took both pictures. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the facial smoother. The face that it went on smoothly, didn't have a greasy feel and left my face feeling moisturized and soft was a great thing. I will definitely be recommending this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a pretty low maintenance skin care routine; like wash my face with baby wipes then put on lotion low. So when I saw this I was excited that it had sunscreen, since I rarely think to apply it. I was so happy with the results! It was like a one step moisturizer/sunscreen/foundation all in one! I'm 35 and have some lines on my forehead... well those look invisible when I am wearing this! Overall very happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
the product does work and it does hide the lines as promised. The problem i had with the product was the smell it is very overwhelming. If you are particularly sensitive to make up or lotions or fragrances this may not be the product for you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Thanks to BzzAgent I was able to try this product. I was confused at first because the box describes it as a sunscreen. It is so much more than that! I don't use a foundation or bb cream but this would be a great replacement . It smoothes the skin and feels wonderful on. It doesn't make my skin oily or cause acne outbreaks. It really is an awesome product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall the product did smooth out my face and create a flawless foundation for my other makeup to be placed on top. The only tough time I had was getting the product from the tube onto my finger and onto my face, it is so smooth sometimes the product rolled right off my finger when I would try to squeeze some, but that just shows how soft and silky the product really is. Once I mastered putting it on everything went perfectly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is amazing. My skin looks and feels amazing after I put it on my face. I typically do not like make-up primer but I'm in love with this product. This year I've started to find small lines and this product truly helps to conceal them when I apply make-up afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is very thick and so mosturizes nicely without the use of more than a dime size. This means the products lasts awhile. I have sensitive skin and this didn't irritate me at all. All in all, I really like this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using this product for a few days so I haven't seen any drastic changes yet. However, after putting the cream on I have noticed that my face feels MUCH smoother! I did notice that my blemishes appeared to be a little bit less obvious, but not enough to say that they were totally gone. Just the smooth feeling alone is a benefit!

"With a couple of uses before bed, I see my face smoother. This product has smoothed out some wrinkles and fine lines. I prefer using this cream before bed since I have oily skin, I did not want to risk looking more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The consistency is velvety and smooth. I use it as a primer and my makeup stays and sets quickly. I love how my skin feels when I wash my face at night. I will continue using this product until I no longer have the same concerns I have now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product works great live it and keep it coming tried it work's really good my face has never felt better I feel young again my husband loves how it feels on my skin. I would love to try more of their products I think it does miracle's on me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I would describe this as more of a balm than a cream - it is incredibly thick and waxy. With that consistency, obviously it is going to ""fill in"" some spots. It doesn't correct anything as they claim though and only served to cause breakouts on my somewhat sensitive skin. It did make my face very soft, however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I m fortune to have decent skin so I've never much gone for face creams and such. On the rare occasion when I did they tended to break me out. This hasn't done that. I can't say I've noticed a major difference but I haven't broken out and it leaves skin nice and soft. So I would say for those with sensitive skin this is nice and gentle with no perfume-y smell. It also leaves skin soft, but not greasy. I'm writing until the end of the campaign to post before and after shots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. Although initially on first contact I did not like the texture of the cream, (too thick, ""like a solid paste) once you apply it, it goes smoothly on the skin. You can immediately see the smoothing effect on the skin. It's not greasy, and it leaves the skin soft and glowing. I really liked the fact that it has sun screen. I am looking forward to using the product more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It went on smooth but was a bit greasy. The packaging was confusing. It made it seem like it was a correction cream. But all it really is is a sunscreen. I did not like the marketing behind this. And the coverage does not last long enough had to constantly reapply. They should be more forethcoming and let buyers know that it is a sunscreen not a skin corrector. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love these products! I sleep using a cpap mask which leaves impressions on my face. This skin smoother really helps those creases disappear much quicker, so I'm sure the rest if my face is improved as well! And if the eye smoother didn't work, I'd still use it! It makes my skin feel so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this Facial Smoother for about a week. I'm not impressed. The cream is clumpy. It is not as smooth as I would like. Once it goes it leaves my skin greasy. I have dry skin so I would not recommend for anyone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really excited when I got this product I've been on the search for a great moisturizer with sunscreen and had high hopes for this one. Alas I was disappointed, it does not go on smoothly at all, does not make my face feel moisturized at all. Left my face feeling tacky. Plus it has a funny smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the instant face smoother! It's great to wear on top of your daily moisturizer to smooth out any fine lines and pores before putting on foundation. I've been using a similar product from a high-end retailer for years and this is very comparable. The eye cream is silky and soft but hasn't made much of a difference over the past few weeks. I've put on the cream in the morning and in the evening but haven't noticed a difference at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Miracle Blur instant face smoother is great! I used this under my makeup and it really made my annoying laugh lines and wrinkles on my forehead disappear. The product is a little thick which turned me off at first. I was worried that it was going to clog my pores and cause me to break out. This did not happen which was a nice perk. I also think this product makes your face photograph much better! I will definitely continue to use and recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris Miracle Blur Cream leaves your skin feeling so soft!! As you apply the cream it feels like you are filling in the fine lines and your skin looks and feels great the rest of the day! It does seem to diminish fine lines, have only been using this product for a week and it seems to be working very nicely! I will keep using it and I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Did blur wrinkles immediately, but lines reappeared after a couple hours. I did love the way it made my skin feel, but thought it was too heavy and felt and looked greasy. I don't like these types of squueze containers because so much of the product gets left behind, I tend to not repurchase, and instead buy something in a tub. Enjoyed the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Is thick as it goes on. Which right away made me hesitant because I have extremely sensitive skin and adult acne. I have been using for close to two weeks. I had stop as for my skin it was not working. I started to brakeout more. However it did make my skin feel very soft. If you don't have acne it might be a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It moisturized well but it did leave my skin feeling sort of greasy for about 30 minutes after putting it on. I haven't noticed a difference in my skin but I didn't really have any wrinkles to start with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Instead of putting it all over I used it on the problem areas for me; the nose, chin, cheeks & some forehead. By doing that I could try it more than once and see where it struggles. I loved it, but I also took it for exactly what it is...People kept saying how fresh and good I looked. It had given me a bit of an air brushed look with my few deeper wrinkles covered pretty well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing! I used it under my makeup and saw instant results. My pores on my nose disappeared! This cream was a bit thicker than I expected, but it soaked right into my skin. I also used it on my forehead to combat my wrinkle and it really helped blur that annoying frown wrinkle. The most noticeable instant result was on my nose pores. I will continue to use this cream!

I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Facial Smoother as a primer. It makes my foundation go on smoother and stay on longer. I would recommend this product to others and will probably purchase it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wow! This cream is amazing. I loved the texture of it and the way it made my skin feel. It is too soon to tell whether it is really going to diminish my fine lines but I can say that it is wonderful to use. I really feel like I am pampering myself when I use it.

"After 3 weeks of being uber sick, I finally was able to get out of bed. And boy did I need to refresh myself. I got my fantastic L'Oreal revitalift Miracle blur kit in the mail and gave myself a Mini Spa. My face feels so smooth without feeling thick or sticky. Today is day one and I'm already feeling the effects of my skin. Loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really love this product it makes my face feel soft and seems to be helping then underneath of my eyes and makes any blemishes that I do have very unnoticeable I have been using these products together for just over a week now and I usually don't use anything but regular lotion I know these r 2 products I won't be able to live without again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think it does a great job, except it's a little to thick. If it were thinner it would flow on easier. I use it under makeup so I have to wait for the color to completely dry. Also tried eye cream. Didn't notice to much off a difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it has helped reduce the lines and wrinkles. I love L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Facial Smoother. This product does what it says its going to do thank you for the chance to try it. I would recommend tis for anyone to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother and my face feels soft and smooth. My makeup applies much easier as well after I used the facial smoother. There is no heavy feeling after applying which I love. It's a brand I trust and have used for many years. I am not sure if my wrinkles disappeared but a smile was on my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Sadly I must say I was not impressed with this product. I did not like the consistency of the product as it felt heavy when applied to my skin, almost the consistency of lard only more dry. The product did say that it has a 30 spf which would be helpful. As far as diminishing the look of wrinkles, fine lines, and pores it failed on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product made my face feel awesome however the texture was way too thick. when I would squeeze it out of the tube onto my finger it was so thick that it would fall off into the floor. I really can't tell that it has smoothed my wrinkles that much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother is a product that is smooth and greasy to the touch it goes on your face like cream it leaves your face feeling greasy. It has not made my pores smaller nor has it even put my skin tone. I did notice breakouts on my chin. Thank you L'Oreal Paris for letting me test your L' Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was lucky enough to get to try this product. I have been using it now for 2 weeks now. The first thing I noticed was how much smaller my pores appear to be. The one thing I love about this product is how silky smooth my skin has become. I will definitely be purchasing more when I run out!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's a great idea I have been using the eye miracle blur instant eye smoother for a few days don't see much of a change I don't tend to wear a lot of makeup or things on my face. It doesn't feel heavy on your face at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like to use this product as a primer under makeup or by itself. It instantly blurs small imperfections and mattifies my t-zone. I keep it in my purse to reapply during the day if I feel there is some shine on my nose/forehead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for about a week now and i love it. It pretty much does what it says, it blurs out lines... as soon as I put it on I noticed my face looked smoother, I can't say it's a long term effect since i've only used it for a wk but for instant results it works. Also it leaves my skin very very soft... This product has a soft thick-paste like consistency and a very pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After really loving the Miracle Blur Instant Eye Smoother, I really wanted to love this product too. After all, who wouldn't want smaller pores and smoother skin? After using the product, it seemed really thick and a bit greasy out of the tube. I can't see using this everyday as it was almost like putting an ointment on my face. I love that it has SPF in it, but it smells a little bit like sunscreen. Overall, I love the idea but am not totally sold on the execution. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother which I received from BuzzAgent and have mixed feelings about this product. The first time I tried to use the product it rolled off of my fingers and onto the floor because the texture coming out of the package is more like a crumbly paste rather than a smooth cream. Once I was able to use the product, it went on nicely and does smoothen out my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The packaging was a little confusing as to what the product does and when to apply in your facial routine. I had trouble at first discerning if this was supposed to function as a moisturizer, primer, anti-aging product. I found it to be very thick and it smelled like sunblock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok, I have it a go for a while an I love it! It goes on great, doesn't cake after a humid day in Florida and it does what it says! My skin feels very smooth and my pores don't show as much. I only use a little translucent powder on top of it and it holds great. The biggest plus for me is that my face doesn't brake out from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just like the title; it gives your skin a smooth appearance. The product is very thick and I actually had it drop off of my finger; a little goes a long way. This product covers your pores very well and gives your skin a nice matte appearance. It does not cover dark spots, redness or skin imperfections. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. I recommend it to anyone. The best part of this product is that it doesn't give you that oily feeling. My face feels fabulous after using this product. I have more confidence than before. I highly recommend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked that this was a sunblock for my face. It went on smooth and silky. The product has a very subtle sunscreen smell, but not very noticeable. I like that my very sensitive skin was not irritated by L'Oreal Miracle Blur. The texture reminded me a lot of my Lancôme la base primer at 1/4 of the cost. Looks thick coming out of the tube, but like I said before just spread like butter on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is wonderful. It's super light and makes your skin feel like silk. Only used a few days and my skin looks amazing. I would defininitly buy this product again and would recommend to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As far as facial smoothing goes, I could use a little help. My pores are big and my face just doesn't have that smooth look that is so popular. Enter in the L'Oreal Instant Facial Smoother! Now I start my makeup regimen with the smoother, and my end result is as smooth as silk! It makes my pores less visible, and makes my makeup appear seamless. I love this stuff!

"I love this product! L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream ,Instant Facial Smoother does exactly what it says Facial Smoother, it makes your face feel so smooth and clean and it is definitely worth using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the product. Skin felt very smooth and noticed find lines where smaller. For me though I can't use with moisturizer also. My skin felt greasy but alone it was wonderful. And being a sunscreen also made me feel my skin was protected fro, the sun which is a big plus to me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I will continue to buy and use the Revitalift instant skin smoother and eye treatment. As soon as I applied the skin smoother I noticed a big difference in the wrinkled on my forehead and the eye treatment made my black circles and crows feet disappear!!!! I would recommend these products to everyone I know!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the way that this smoothed out my skin and made my foundation go on flawlessly. It minimizes lines and I love that there is sunscreen in the product as I spend a lot of time outdoors. Only thing that I think could use improvement is the packaging. It was difficult to get the product out of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Even though it smells like sunscreen I have to believe that's good it's protecting my skin. It does come out of the bottle very thick but it isn't hard to apply on your face it turns into a cream and is very easy to use . I don't wear much makeup just put this on and some eyeliner and I'm good to go. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I use the RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, my skin feels softer, smoother, and evenly textured. My pores disappear and my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable. I've made this a permanent part of my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product, and was pleasantly surprised by the results. I don't normally wear make up but this was so easy to use and made a positive difference in my appearance. I'd definitely use this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of I really like the way my skin feels right after I apply this, but that is about all. I really did not see much of a difference after a week of daily use. It is extremely thick coming out of the bottle and hard to apply until you get the hang of how to spread it. I really liked the scent and am going to continue to try using it for a few more days to see if any of my opinions change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Miracle Blur is a facial smoother. It's not a moisturizer or primer, it's a silky cream with opti blur to diffuse light. Instantly blurs lines and wrinkles. This can be used to target just small problem lines ,wrinkles, or use all over face for a really smooth , even feel and look. I personally use it both ways depending on occasion. My foundation applies so easily and looks awesome. With continued use of product fine lines and wrinkles fade away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I like this product. The cream is light and not greasy unlike some creams. My face doesn't feel clogged or shiny. I like the natural look. The same as the eye treatment. .very light non greasy. I will continue to use the product and add to this review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for about a week. I am prone to oily skin and when I use this cream in the morning, it makes my skin more oily. I love using it at night though. I wake up with soft, smooth skin which feels great! It hasn't made me break out either, which many products do, so that is great! It also doesn't have a strong smell. Completely happy!

I noticed a difference after only 2 days. I absolutly love this product and will purchase it in the future! My skin tightened up and wrinkles and crows feet ive had for years have started to fade away! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Instantly I saw my imperfections get blurred. No joke, I am as shocked as you might be. The L'Oreal Revitalift blur cream is a sunscreen as well as a face changer in an instant. Easy to apply and lightweight on my face. I used it without any makeup and I was complimented on my glowing skin (that's the words used) and then I applied makeup over the cream. I felt younger and looked pretty dang good according to my Hubby . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The facial smoother has definitely improved my overall skin tone. I feel like it has reduced the appearance of my fine lines and scars. Of course they aren't 100% gone but they are less noticeable and that makes me more confident in my appearance. It's a good step to even out my skin prior to applying my makeup for the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would definitely recommend purchasing the face smoother. I put it on before applying my makeup for the day and it adds a great finished touch. I gave it four stars because for oily skin it does tend to add more shine throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have had an issue with anything that has sunscreen in it for years, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother is no exception. I was excited to try the product, but didn't realize it had sunscreen in it. I thought, oh well I will give it a try since it's a Instant Skin Smoother. Big Mistake! I have tiny red bumps all over my face now just after one use, so ladies if you are sensitive to sunscreen be cautious in trying this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream can be used in conjunction with your moisturizer and makeup in the morning. It also has sun screen in it which is very important. The color is an off white and it has a thick creamy texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is amazing! It went on smooth and easy. It provided an even coverage and I noticed right away that my skin tone looked more even and smooth. I will most definitely buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I feel that this product is one of L'Oreal's greatest gift to women and out skin cells!! This product is easy to apply and has no ridiculous odor like most facial products!

My sister is trying the facial smoother now and she is reporting to me everyday and she isn't seeing any results yet but she has only used it for 3 days so we are hoping for good smooth skin for her and I let her know that I got it free from bzzagent to spread word of mouth !

I love the way my face looks and feels after using L'Oreal Miracle Blur Cream. It was a bit thick coming out of the tube. But once you rubbed it between your fingers and applied it to your face it was very light and smooth. I love that it has sunscreen in it. It does not have that greasy sunscreen feel that other products have. I was very happy with the way it smoothed out the texture of my skin and evened out the skin tone.

"A little bit goes a long ways! Only a small amount of this amazing - lotion? Primer? I'm not sure what to call it - is necessary. I put it on at night so I don't have to worry about whether or not I should put it on over or under my makeup, so it has plenty of time to sink it. Will definitely keep on the list of winning products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to be receiving some new face products to try! While i did find the Miracle Blur face cream was a bit hard to get out of the container and onto your face, i did like the texture it gave my skin. It does work well as a primer before applying makeup. I haven't noticed a huge change in my skins appearance while using it. I would suggest a change to the container as it is a bit hard to get out of the current container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Miracle Blur Cream is exactly what you need for sunscreen protection! The consistency of the cream was super thick, so no ashy skin for sure! It felt heavy on my skin so I knew I would be protected all day if needed. I have a few small (ok, tiny) crow's feet wrinkles budding and after using this facial smoother, I didn't see them! I will definitely keep this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok so I am almost 36 years okd and I have started to notice the wrinkles forming on my face...so imagine my excitement when this little gem showed up. I have been using this daily for about 1 week and I must say my face feels smooth as silk and I can allready tell a slight difference. It goes on very easy and u just need a very small amount. I would say this is my new favorite face cream and it has SPF so thays a win win in my freebie book!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have fairly large pores on my cheeks and nose, so I'm always looking for ways to minimize them. This cream does a great job! It has a silky smooth texture, and is nice and thick. It goes on so smooth, and I found it gave me very smooth, even texture, and even hid my pores to a degree. I like that is has a sunscreen built in.

"The ladys at work ask what was different with me and I told them about Opti-Blur Technology which instantly blurs lines which means it covers up wrinkles, pores and uneven texture. It also makes my face feel velvety soft and I love that!!!!! What more could you ask for? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Recitalift Miracle Blur Cream is a valuable beauty product which is easy to use. I have noticed my skin feeling smoother and my pores visibly smaller after the first application over my usual moisturizer. Applying foundation over it also is easy and results in an even appearance [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wonderful product! You could fell the results instantly.. my face felt smoother and amazing! I can't wait to see the long term results! This product really works just as it states.. don't believe me? Try for yourself.. you won't be disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is a life saver if you have huge pores like I do. This is like a primer silicone based lotion except I don't find this very helpful in keeping my face matte or making my make up last longer like most primers. Although this has different benefits like making your skin look smoother over all . You can wear this alone to go run errands or under makeup. I do find this product makes me sweat a little above my lip [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I just turned 39 years old and starting to see fine lines S when I had the chance to try this I jumped at it. Pros: I looked retouched! Made my makeup wear longer. SPF 30 Con: I didn't like the texture of it. However this is a personal thing. I LOVE this! And I will include it in my very detailed skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
At first I didn't know weather to love this product or hate it because it seemed to be a little thick but once applying it to my face I loved it! I have large pores and it really helped cover up my large pores. I also loved the fact that it has SPF and I dont have to worry about wearing a foundation without SPF. The Miracle Blur Cream instantly made my face really smooth. I will infidelity be buying this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using the Blur Cream for over a week, Im sold. I can feel the difference and see the difference. I do not wear foundation and I can visibly see how lines and pores disappear. My only complaint is the bottle, its hard to get the cream out and you constantly have to squeeze.....yet the Cream is definitely worth the hassle... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This helps smooth out imperfections & gives the appearance of smaller pores. It ""blurs"" them out. This stuff is a bit difficult to squeeze out since it is really really thick. Once warmed it smears on a bit thinner & it doesn't take much. My face feels nice and smooth after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"when i first tried it i put it on my finger i didn't care for it , it came out like a lump then i smooth it on its not too bad seemed easy to smooth on felt pretty good. the only thing i did not like is when it came out of the tube it was too thick and odd looking [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works great. My skin looks so smooth after applying. I've worn it under my makeup and also have tried using it alone and the results are as advertised. My skin looks smooth and youthful. Can't wait to buyou the serum and see how that works with this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this stuff! My skin is pretty good and this allows me to run out the house without a heavy foundation or concealer on. Gives just the right amount of smoothing and doesn't feel heavy. It comes out pretty thick but spreads out nicely. I would definitely buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great for those no makeup days where you just need a little helonger evening out your skin tone and filling in fine lines and wrinkles. I also love that it has a built in SPF. One less step in the morning! It's also great under foundation. It makes any of my foundations go on smoother and is a great primer. It extends the wear time by a few hours and just makes foundation look that more real looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am doing a review for Revitalift Miracle Blur instant skin smoother. I am in love. The skin smoother is beyond awesome. There is absolutely no need for foundation. My skin is so soft and looks so great with it. If you are looking for something to help you renew your face and make it smooth then you really need to try this. I will say this again, you do not need foundation. I have a lot of allergies and this product has not bothered me at all. I am sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I just started using the RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream yesterday. It went on very smoothly and had no offensive odor, like some creams do. I also noticed that it contains sun screen, which is great, since one of my medications is very sensitive to direct sunlight, which means I need to wear protection. I look forward to submitting more reviews. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to receive this package! I have hated the wrinkles around my eyes for a couple of years now and I've tried many products but have never fell in love with any of them. The eye cream goes on smoothly and doesn't look greasy or oily and it noticeably diminishes the depth of wrinkles! I have only used it for a few days and am really looking forward to seeing long term results! This photo is before I began using the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Lovely packaging, looks and feels high quality. Product goes on feeling somewhat like a primer, but the strong sunscreen smell was overwhelming and didn't quit all day. I also felt that my makeup changed color somewhat over the course of the day (oxidizing, perhaps?) when I used the blur cream. I won't buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the Miracle Blur Cream after my morning moisturizer and under my foundation and it did a great job of helping smooth my foundation on and keep it on throughout the day. It is hard to spread the cream unless you use moisturizer first. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing!!! My skin felt like silk. My makeup went on super smooth over it. I even felt like my make up stayed in place and looked fresher, longer. I will recommend this to all of my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The facial smoother is definitely smooth. It goes on nicely and has a texture of a cotton pad when being applied to the face. The scent is not bad it is a little too intense for me but disappears once applied. My face was smooth and looked refreshed but I did not see a lift or big changes to the appearance of my wrinkles. This cream is not heavy and is easily absorbed. The cream is in a medium tube that for me is small, I would love if the product came in different sizes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this stuff. I washed and dried my face and then applied it to my entire face. It's really thick so I had to work with it a little bit but once I got it applied I could instantly see a difference. My makeup went on smoother and had a matte finish. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. I used it once a day and in a week I could truly see a difference. My pores are smaller and my skin is silky smooth. I've received compliments on my skin already. I'm loving this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this would be a great product if you don't us any makeup over it. It went on smooth over my moisturizer and looked good (as far as my age spots go). Maybe if I were younger and had nearly flawless skin to begin with, I would use it. I do however need makeup, and when I put my makeup on over it, it went on horrible and blotchy. My setting powder made it even worse. I gave this to a friend who doesn't use makeup and I will comment when I hear how she likes it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've enjoyed putting this cream on face every morning! It makes my face feel smooth and the pores are gone! My skin looks and feels smoother! However: be careful near your eyes! It stings! And you only need a pea size amount! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this with the Miracle Blur Eye Cream. I use a very light layer, after I apply my moisturizer and don't want to use foundation (ie my light makeup days) going out but don't feel like wearing makeup. I feel like it makes the pores appear smaller, and evens out my skin, not making it too dry or too oily. It gives a tingly sensation if I put a thicker layer on after cleansing, but overall it's not too bothersome. Otherall it is great for giving your face a fresh, even complexion and look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had really high hopes for this cream, but the more I used it the more I didn't like it. It's been only one week and my face is breaking out due to the heaviness of it. It's a very thick texture that leaves almost a film behind on your skin. It does cover minimally certain facial discolorments which is why I gave it 2/5. I wouldn't recommend buying and discontinued using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is so smooth on my face. I put moisturizer on then I follow with the Miracle Blur Cream then my foundation. My face looks amazing. So smooth and my makeup stays on all day and looks good at 7 pm. Only a little touch up I need. I will continue to purchase this item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My first week trying L'Oreal Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream and I am starting to see a slight difference in my wrinkles on my forehead. I do love how it feels so silky on my skin even 8 hours later. I will show a before picture and in a couple days an after picture. So far I am liking how this makes my skin feel and I am hoping for more diminishing of my wrinkles. Stay tuned! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product. It's soft and airy. It made my face look so smooth and covered my pores completely. I can wear it alone or as a primer before putting on my makeup. The only small issue I had was squeezing the cream out of the container. Other than that I will definitely buy this product and recommend it to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The hydration is amazing! I love that I can wear it without any other makeup and feel great about my skin. My face feels smooth and soft. I notice a difference right away. I am not too crazy about the packaging. I find the product sometimes crumbles as well. But overall I am loving it. I plan on buying this product for sure.

"Very thick facial cream. I wasn't sure how it was going to spread, and if it was going to make be greasy, but it didn't. It did make my face soft and feel smooth, but it did cause my serum to pill when I rubbed it in. I currently use it for certain areas that I want blurred, which is working. Also is a good primer, and my makeup doesn't slide all over my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
A bit of difficulty in getting the thick cream to come out of the tube had me wondering how effective it could possibly be. Surprised was I when the Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother flowed on so easily and left my face feeling satiny smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I typically use a primer before applying my makeup but with L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur I didn't have to! I was amazed how well this covered up my pores and how smooth my skin looked after one use not to mention after using it for a whole week. Definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product did a good job protecting my skin from the sun. And my skin did look a little fresher and smoother but it feels a little heavy and tho it didnt I was afraid it would flake. If thats the price to pay for looking better I will take it.I plan on using a better moisturizer and possibly buying the serum. I think that will do it for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like how the creme feels on my face. At first I thought it was going to be thick and heavy, but after applying the Revitalife Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother it felt light and silky. I'm noticing that my pores are looking smaller and I can't wait to see the results after 4 weeks! Stay tuned ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I never thought a product can be this fast and effective. I've use L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur cream 2 times. And I can notice the difference. This instant facial smoother lighter the wrinkles noticeably. Like they said it's definitely more than foundation. Seems L'Oreal Paris has a new customers from now. I and my mom both can use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother and really liked it. It made my makeup easier to apply and my face had a smoother more finished look. I did not need a primer with it. My makeup stayed on longer and looked better later in the day when using it. I would recommend this to anyone with fine lines and large pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the product one time but my face burned like crazy and was red until I washed it off. I left it on for a few hours. I also wouldn't recommend this for people who have oily skin. It left my skin feeling greasy. It would probably be great for someone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did like the results from L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Miralce Blur Cream. This cream made my face feel smoother and my skin's appearance was improved. I would recommend this cream to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The great thing about this product is you can use it without a whole facial regimine. If you're like me then you don't have time for all that work. The loreal paris miracle blur lets you use the cream with or without a full facial regimine. It feels great on my sensitive skin and doesn't leave a greasy residue. I also use this with the miracle blue eye smoother which is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cream goes on smoothly and easily. It has a lovely texture and does not feel heavy at all on your face. Immediatly I noticed a smoother texture on my face and I looked rested and bright. The spf it contains protects me from the rays of the sun and act's as a sunscreen. I was very happy and satisfied with the product and love having it among my favorites. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the product sent was perfect for my skin. My skin is usually dry, with peeling dry flakes from my forehead I have large pores on my nose . I used for 3 days now and noticed a instant difference no longer dry flaky skin completely moistured smooth my pores are the same but hoping with more use they will disappear. I'm excited and they appear to be full size bottles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I generally don't purchase items like these and just use a moisturizer. I have psoriasis and it sometimes flares up on my skin so I was a bit skeptical. To my surprise, it made my face feel great and did reduce my pore size. I plan on purchasing this product for continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this MIRACLE Blur skin smoother is the best cream that I used. It very smooth on your face and you can see the difference on your face. I love it. I don't have to use other SPF cream on my face and looks even better under my foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The free sample of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother that I received from BzzAgent is wonderful! I have used it several times, both alone and as a base before applying my foundation. At first, I found the product to be a little thicker than I was used to but now it goes on just fine and smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high hopes for this product. I used just a dab on my whole face per the instructions. I saw no noticeable difference in my face. However, my face was greasy the whole day and not the normal facial grease but greasy everywhere this product was applied. You could not see the product was there but you sure didn't want to touch your face. Tried several more times, still saw not difference in my skin. Not worth the greasy feel all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first, I didn't think I liked the texture, but after using it for a week, I find that once I've smoothed it onto my skin, my foundation goes on so much better. The cream feels so silky that I enjoy applying it! I can't say for sure if it really makes my wrinkles less obvious, but I do like the product quite a lot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't sure about this one these products tend to be all product hype and no action.... this one is different though it was thick and not the easiest to dispense but when rubbed in showed results of fine lines by my eyes diminished! I was so pleased [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am loving the texture of this cream, feels smooth immediately. It reminds me of a primer but with filler. Seems like it fills in the small cracks and crevices. All this and a name that you know makes for a fabulous product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this products so far is fabulous. Only after 3 days of use my face feels and looks smoother. My fine lines and pores seem smaller and less noticeable. My skin feels and looks more alive. I would definetly recommend this product to everyone I know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product and would refer it to my friends and family. I was skeptical at first because the cream was thicker and greaser than expected. But once applied and blended my skin feels and looks smoother and that feeling lasts most of the day. It does take a few extra minutes in the morning to blend my liquid foundation in. It's worth the extra effort though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product makes your skin feel SOOO smooth and soft. All day! My make up glides on so easily, and it does make my skin look better. Smells good, too! It only gets 4 stars because it feels just a little greasy going on, but this doesn't make your face look greasy. Will definitely use this product for the long term! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Any creams or anti-aging products need more that a few weeks to truly see what their long term effects will be. This product is too thick and greasy for my taste. The consistency of this product is very thick and going on it is very heavy and greasy. The fragrance is fairly nice and light, but I don't care for it. No noticeable effects on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently received the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur to use. The facial smoother was very thick and seemed to sit on top of my skin. I didn't like the texture or feel at all. Was like putting petroleum jelly on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I used the Revitalift Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother for several days. I applied it over my usual moisturizer. The cream was thick so I would rub it between my fingers before smoothing it over my face. I feel this is more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer. It's heavy, but actually feels good after a few days. I like it, but I feel it doesn't do much for me. I would probably only use this in the summer months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this stuff, it is super soft so it just smoothed into your lines pores wrinkles all. Granted the first day I put it on I got a cold sore so I waited a few days to try it again, I don't think it caused the cold sore. But now I've tried it again and I really like it, I can't wait to wear it under my makeup . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. I have huge pores and this made them look a lot smaller. It's very easy to apply and goes on smooth. The only thing I didn't like was how pale it made my face look. I just started using it in my problem areas instead of all over. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is something that a lot of faces need. It helps smooth out the unevenness of our faces and helps with rough and bumpy skin. The results work quickly and effectively on my face. The quality ingredients are great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oréal Revitalift miracle blur was pretty good. My eyes were puffy, raw and dark before I tried the product. I could tell a huge difference after I applied it to my eyes and even more so when I applied my makeup! My eyes looked more refreshed and less tired. And it even had a soothing effect on the rawness under my eyes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was really impressive on blurring out pores. It was not greasy at all and left no residue. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because my makeup did not sit well on top of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Is very thick coming out of the tube but after 1 application I know this is something I will definitely use often I have wrinkles and I saw an immediate difference less wrinkles and a glow to my face love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall good product. I have pores that are bigger than I would like, and this product helped minimize the appearance of my pores. I've never tried a product like this before, but i would compare it to a primer. I am 30 yrs old, no wrinkles but I hate my pores. The only negative is I thought it was a bit too thick for my preference. I haven't used it for 4 full weeks yet as recommended by the box, so stay tuned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was anxious to try this because I have dry skin. I'm 66 and don't have very many wrinkles but my skin always has a dull look. My skin is combination skin with oily skin on my forehead. The Instant Facial smoother was waxy feeling and very thick. It was hard to squeeze it out of the tube due to the thickness. It did a good job of moisturizing & smoothing the appearance and texture of my cheeks. If it were easier to get out of the tube it would be a much better product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surprised at the instant effects of the product. It is more effective than a lot of other products I have tried. The fine lines seem to disappear instantly. The product applies smooth, at first it seems to have a bit of a greasy finish. That is why only a 4 rating. Other than that I think this is one of the best smoothing products I have ever tried. I have already looked into buying and the price compared to similar products is very reasonable. I can't wait to purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was super hesitant about trying this product. The cream has a wax like consistency and I was worried that it would make me break out or make it difficult to blend my foundation. 3 days after trying it, I can honestly say it works and I didn't break out or have any blending issues! It did as it promised and minimized my pores and fine line wrinkles! I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was easily applied and left my skin smooth in appearance and soft in texture. The mornings after its use, my skin felt refreshed and toned. I like the color of the packaging - red/burgundy makes it seem lush and luxurious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I was not sure about how this was going to feel once on my face. It did feel a little greasy on my hands. So, I was a little nervous at first. I applied this then my daily sunscreen. It was great! It did not break my face out at all. It blended wonderfully and was not at all greasy like it had felt on my fingers. Overall, it did blur some of my dark spots and freckles. I also say anything that helps with SPF is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy this product! I have only used it a few mornings so far and have not noticed any wrinkle improvement, but I have felt my face feeling so smooth, and my eyes look so much less tired. The facial cream is thick but i think that is how it fills in all the wrinkles and pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother for the first time last night!! I am so excited to see the long-term results but I'm already feeling it work! My skin was softer and tighter when woke up this morning!! This is going to be a product I continue to use on a regular basis!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is my third day trying the cream and I don't like how heavy the cream feels on my skin. Its hard to get out of the tube very thick. I was hoping it would br lighter and creamier. I don't see a difference in my skin yet. I will check in next week to see if there were any changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i use primer after my moisturizer.. i have to tell you that this is like, primer, smooth wrinkle cream , pore minimizer all in one!! it leaves your face sooo smooth!!! fill pores so they are not so noticeable.. i ll definitely try it again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother for 3 days and I can really feel the difference. My face is smoother and doesn't feel dry or flakey anymore. Looking in the mirror, I can already see the difference in the lines around my eyes and mouth. This is one product I will be happy to buy once my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Of all the skin creams I've tried this by far is the best - I've always used L'Oréal products but only makeup so this was a nice change from the greasy non productive ones I've had in the past - after 4 nights faithfully using I already notice a difference no more dry patches around forehead and my skin actually feels firmer - I will definitely be purchasing this product from now on - can't wait to see difference after a month !

"I was really excited to try Miracle Blur facial smoother cream, but it fell short for me. Squeezing out of the tube is pretty hard as it is really thick. It felt heavy after application, although I have to admit that the texture was smooth. The one good thing I noticed is that it doesn't feel oily and has no unpleasant smell relative to other sunscreens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So my first impression was sad. It is thick. Like super thick trying to get out. Then it was very hard to apply. It kept balling up due to how thick it was. I didn't notice any difference. But i have not given up yet. I'm going to try again. Maybe it needs to be used more than once to notice a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Revitalift facial cream, and felt the product was too thick. It was somewhat hard to squeeze from the tube, and felt heavy on my face. As I checked the ingredients, it seems to be only a sunscreen, and I would purchase other products instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think it was feeling a little heavy on my face, but I did notice improvement of my pores on my nose, they seemed to not be as noticeable as before. My skin felt softer & the product did not have a oily or greasy feeling. The product is very thick & hard to squeeze out of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First impressions: Nice mild smell Thick paste type texture, it almost reminds me of the Benefit Porefessional primer. It does a good job at really filling in my pores and making my skin feel smooth. I really like that it has a high spf. I'm not wearing makeup up today but look forward to seeing how this sets under my foundation tomorrow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was excited to receive my L'Oreal Paris revitalift Miracle blur instant eye smoother. I was a little bit hesitant as I assume that it would have an overpowering smell. I was wrong the smell was great. Not too much at all. The packaging was cute .it grabbed my eye. Normally when I show up to work one or more of my co-workers always tell me that I look tired. Even after 8 or more hours of sleep at night but lately I haven't heard a word. And I owe this to revitalift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The packaging is nice and attractive. I have only used it for two days but I like the way it feels. Thick when you put it on, a little bit goes along way. The smell reminds me of summer a light sunscreen smell. My face started looking a little greasy towards the end of the day but a little blotting with tissue helped with that. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Revitalift product was packaged attractively. It's smooth on my skin. I rubbed my face after applying and my face felt so soft. I really enjoyed using the sample and I recommend this product for anyone looking to protect their skin in harsh weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am loving this blur cream - it really mattifies and smooths my skin. I have used it for 2 days straight and it makes my face feels great. The only downside is that the effect wears off after a few hours and leaves my face oily looking. I would def say this is great for a night out with the girls, when you know you'll be taking some photos early. Its also nice for events when you want an HD makeup feel without applying too many products. Grade A! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product! I first tried it on my hand to see if I could tell a difference in the way my skin looked/felt. It definitely did. Then I tried it on under my makeup this morning. My makeup went on smooth and flawless. It definitely had a nice blurring effect to minimize the scars, dark spots and fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Don't hesitate to buy this product! It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel super soft. It does what it says and blurs out imperfections. I was hesitant at first but I will buy this product! My skin stays soft all day and I have no issues with makeup not blending well. I don't feel like I have to use that much makeup either because it does such a great job of ""blurring"" imperfections. The container is also very easy to use too and no waste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received Revitalift Miracle Blur cream yesterday.It is an honor to be in a buzz campaign,testing products such as Loreal Paris Revitalift.I especially love knowing there is SPF 30 in this product. I love how my skin felt so soft after one application,will comment again after trying both products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After opening the package I was happy to see the bottle was larger than expected, good value for the price. The cream was difficult to squeeze out though. I noticed it was not creamy but waxy. The scent was not terrible, both the texture and scent reminded me of bag balm. After rubbing into my skin, this took longer than expected, my skin did feel soft. I noticed the lines on my forehead and between my eyebrows did not look so deep. So far overall I like the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I couldn't tell instantly that my face appeared different. After about 30 minutes though, my wrinkle lines diminished and my face felt so soft. I love that it doesn't have an oily feel either. I think after weeks of use I will see a big difference. I would recommend trying it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The facial smoother was great! Within 3 days after using, I could not believe it! The fine lines are truly disappearing!

"The Facial smoother is amazing! I have tried high end department store products and like the L'Oreal one the best! Its great to reduce pore size and blur fine lines. I found it also helped with oil control and a smoother application for my make up. As a make up artist with 21 years of experience, I highly recommend this product!

I tried out the L'Oréal revitalift miracle blur cream by trying it free. I liked the way it made my skin feel. I like to wear it under my make up when I go out as it has SPF30. I think it helps ease the look of my fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think the moisturizer leaned more towards a primer. It wasnt creamy lije your average moisturizer. You definitely can smell the SPF all day which I'm not really a fan of. Also it doesn't seem to sink in like a moisturizer does. I don't think I would buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Miracle Blur Cream has a thick consistency (like cake frosting). It applys smoothly and my face feels smoother. I love that it has SPF 30 sunscreen in the formula. This cream feels pretty light once applied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This isn't a product I'd pay money for. I'm glad I #GotItFree because I don't know if it's just my batch or what but it comes out super thick almost dry. It's not easily spreadable and for how little comes in the bottle you'd go through this pretty quuckly. I noticed it leaves a white film on my face even after blending and when I let it dry then put makeup on over it, the make up rolls up with it and kinda flakes off. I love using primers but this is not good for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream Instant Facial Smoother every day this week and I can't get over how well it works. I smooth it all over my face in the morning before applying makeup and the lines are definitely diminished. Great product for us gals over 40! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just began using this product yesterday (and will report back in a few weeks of its effectiveness), but don't have a lot of confidence of it working. Unlike the ""lotion"" consistency of the Eye Smoother, the Facial Smoother was gritty and almost ""dry"". I would guess the product is old and therefore have low confidence in seeing any benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for three days and my opinion, so far, is that this is just what I have been looking for. This product makes my skin feel very smooth and silky. It works like a primer helping my foundation go on very smoothly.....with the added benefit of making my lines and wrinkles less noticeable. It does not make your face feel greasy or shiny either. It stays perfect all day too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so satisfied with this skin smoother. It goes on easily and feels lite. Not only does it help reduce the appearance of my fine lines and pores, it's a sunscreen! This is so important to me. I will be purchasing this over and over again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this product L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother is the best that I have tried in a long time. After using this product for a total of 5 days I notice a difference in the way that my skin started to tighten back up to the way it was before. I just love the way that it makes my skin feels.

I really love the facial smoother. It doesn't leave my face greasy and it doesn't feel like I have anything on my face. It just leaves this velvety feel to my skin. I will definitely be buying this from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Cream, Instant Facial Smoother. Since being diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome my skin has gotten so bad not just from the daily stress but also from medicines. The first time I used it I noticed an improvement right away my pores looked smaller and skin felt so smooth . Will definitely be buying this once I'm done with it . And telling my friends about it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is unlike anything I've tried before. I used it after my moisturizer and before my foundation and it gave a very smooth canvas for my foundation to lay on. It comes out very thick so I rubbed it out a bit between my fingertips before applying and that worked great. I typically use a primer and this would definitely replace that in my regime. It also has SPF and that's always a plus! Great innovative new product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Goes on pretty smooth. However, it is really thick and I had to remove the cap to get the product out. It is also very white and I had to keep rubbing it in to get it to disappear. i do not like the sunscreen smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just received the L'Oréal Revita Lift Miracle Blur and so far I like it. I will report back after I use it longer. I'm excited to be apart of this campaign as I am always trying new products! I love L'Oréal. This cream is really different from the normal face creams. It comes out almost like a paste, but smoothes on perfectly! A little hard to squeeze out of the bottle at first, but easy to use! FACE feels super soft after I applied it. I will come back later with more thoughts!

"What an amazing feeling this is to have my face feeling fresh when I wake. I saw a noticeable difference in just 2 weeks especially around my eyes. This product is simply wonderful.

"I tried this product on today and i can honestly say that it is awesome!! I have large pores on my cheeks and they are gone. Its the first day and i can see my pores gone!. I love it. I will buy it again and again. Try it pls, you wont be disappointed. Your skin feels so silky and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is to hard to squeeze out of bottle. For someone with arthritis is would be a challenge. Maybe a different bottle or thin it up a little. I'll try it for four weeks and give another review. Thanks for the product. Can't wait to try more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been given the chance to try Loreal for free as a bzzagnt only I have never used this product before or any like it. I'm very excited to see the results. It smells great seems easy to use. After 1 application I don't see or feel a difference just might take a couple more tries before I know for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Instant facial smoother and loved it! First, I hate strong fragranced products and this had almost none. Just a very faint soft smell. It went on smoothly after moisturizer (as recommended) and was very light feeling on my skin. I could totally tell a difference between using it and not. My pores seemed smaller and overall appearance looked smoother. I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how I can tell a difference instantly. It helps with lines, wrinkles and pore size. it doesn't leave an oily feel to your skin like most sunscreen based products do. Most of all i love how smooth it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I 1st put this product on I thought ""wow, this is smooth & makes my skin look flawless."" It's lightweight & looks nice initially, but as the day went on I noticed it feeling heavy on top of my skin & if I itched my cheek, it would scrape off. It's not a terrible product but not thoroughly impressed by end results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Revitalift miracle blur instant skin smoother works wonders! Instantly notice smoother skin and it's invisible so you can't see it's on. It does wonders around the eyes and erases lines. Leaves your skin looking young and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I recently started using this product and I love it! I don't need need foundation after it as it smoothes out my skin perfectly. It is a little thicker than I pictured but I was surprised how smooth it went on my skin. It gave me this airbrushed feeling without any make up! I tried a concealer once on top of it and that was perfect but most times I don't even need a concealer. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"this blur cream is AMAZING. I was hesitant at 1st because it was so thick. However, once I put it on and spread it around my face it was unbelievable. It was very light and more importantly no strange smell as other products sometime have. I applied my makeup afterwards and was instantly able to see a smoother appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that at first its feels weird its thick out of the tube but once you apply its really nice. I have oily skin so I was worried but it was really nice and matte feeling. No oily feeling at all. My foundation looks great. It did wonders for my pores. I would recommend this for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think it's like paste, it goes on thick and feels heavy, after a while my face started to burn, turn red and itch. Covered well but after a few hours it rolls off my skin like I was peeling after a sunburn. So sad I wish this was something to rave about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal definitely scored tens across the board with their Miracle Blur Instant Skin Smoother! As the product implies, my skin instantly felt smooth, soft, and supple. My pores even looked much smaller which helped my skin look even more youthful. This is definitely a must have product on the top of my list. love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this product is awesome. My face is smoother and my pores are a lot smaller. I would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to reduces the appearance of lines an wrinkles as well as your poors. It does exactly what it says it will do.

I just tried the Loreal Revitalift Miracle Blur instant skin smoother today and my skin is feeling pretty smooth! I like how smooth it was applying and the scent isnt that strong so that is already a plus! I am always a little hesitant trying new facial products with scent and i feel confident with this new product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Before I got this product, I was curious how well it would work for me. I don't use facial makeup. I received it today, and have had a chance to apply it once. I have red and dry cheeks all the time. It is neat, since I have put it on, my face is so soft. It has been ages since it felt like that. I am excited to see how soft and smooth, my face will be in the next few days after I have used it several times. My boys even think it is nice how it is working for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical there's so many products claim to help with skin issues, this product delivers!! Your face has awesome feel, after few days ur face looks fantastic. I received this product free to sample, in exchange for my own opinions, I love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had never tired Revitalift products before. I must say I have instantly fell in love. Miracle Blur is not greasy at all and super concentrated, half a pea size amount covers my whole face. The first time applying Revitalife I could instantly tell a different in the size of the pores on my cheeks. Yes, I have large pores! My face fells amazing super smooth, and looks refreshed and more even!! Two thumbs way up!!! Will definitely continue using this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Feels very dimethicone and silicon like. Leaves a cast on the skin and a gritty feel. Settles into pores and lines which makes it seem like a filler. The smell is very sunscreen but not a good smell at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First I love how soft it makes my skin feel. My face has been so dry lately and I have been trying everything and nothing has been working. So far it has been working great. My skin tone has been very uneven too and this is making my skin look so healthy. Well worth the money!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product! L'Oreal has been a brand that I have trusted for a long time, so I was not surprised that this did a good job on my face, but WOW! It did even better! This line that they have has great products and is worth your time and money. Would recommend to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's cold out so the product is still cold and waiting for it to warm up more for easier application. I'll try the Eye Treatment in about half hour for it to get to room temperature for easier application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother left my skin feeling smooth. It also looks more even with less lines in it too. I'm not sure if it helped my wrinkles but it did help my pores clear up. I would recommend this to friends and family too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is amazing, i have 30 years and with this cream my face looks radiant, the cream is not greasy, you feel fresh and hydrate, is the perfect size, is recommended 100%. I use in the night before sleep for best results. Is hipoallergenic and don't smell bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Miracle Blur Instant Facial Smoother is great for winter It is smooth and very plasent for skin. I am also like bright colours of tubes - it is stands out from another creams which I have and it is easy to find in your purse [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It spreads smoothly and leaves no heavy cream look after you put on your makeup. The results are wonderful. You spread the cream on your face and and under your eyes, wait a couple of seconds and put on your makeup...you will love what you see and feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have previously used Miracle Blur oil free with no spf and it really did help my skin smooth out and reduce pore size. This product however did not work for me at all. The one I got dried up before I could even apply it to my whole face. Disappointed with this purchase.
"I recently received a sample of miracle blur in my glamour magazine ,I'm 48 years young :) and have tried a slew of wrinkle fixing ,face smoothing,skin brightening concoctions,without much satisfaction in their results. I tried my sample yesterday and I've got to tell you ,I've never had a product do exactly what they claim it does,Miracle Blur is the exception to the rule,its my new best friend! Thanks so much for another great product! April Monty [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was not a good thing for me. I only used a pea size amount because it's very greasy and goes a long way. It didn't soak into my skin at all and caused my makeup to be slippery and build up in fine lines on my face. It also caused my skin to break out. I'm sure of this because it was the only thing I was using different. Sorry but I can't recommend this product.
"I got this product for my dad and I to share ( to help him with fine lines & wrinkles and for my large pores & shiny T-Zone). Overall, I think this is a great project. Though it doesn't improve lines and pores instantly, improvement is seen within a day. It also mattifies and has SPF."
"Very thick, very waxy feel. Little to NO coverage. Very poor absorption that just sits on top of the face. Feels like diaper cream on your face! Yikes! Difficult to wash off even with harsh soap. I removed it after 5 minutes. Avoid this one, ladies! Disgusting product. Cruel. Just the opposite of what a beauty product should be."
LOVE the product and the smooth look it gives my skin. HOWEVER< why is it in that horrid tube?? I can only get about half the product out before I have to cut the tube open!! What idiot chose that packaging?? Am I the only one who is frustrated by it???
I did not really notice a difference in small wrinkles or pore size BUT what I do love about this product is it's staying power. I have oily skin at 50 years old and this is the first product I've tried that makes my makeup last all day. I will buy this again for that reason alone. I have tried many other primers and none have accomplished this. It makes your skin feel nice and smooth too. I recommend it!
It goes on smooth leaves skin smooth with a nice texture airbrushed look no lines or anything great alone or undermake up but u look so great u dont NEED face make up tho lots of time im going out somewhere special so I do wear make up but for around town n home no need :D
"This felt like putting a layer of wax all over my face. My skin couldn't breathe. Maybe it works by waxing over all the imperfections. On the positive side, it was very matte. But I disliked having my skin sealed shut. Plus it took forever to wash it off. Cleansers and soap couldn't penetrate it with one wash. I had to scrub my face 3 times to get it off! Will never buy!"
"I've been using Miracle Blur for a couple of weeks now. I thought I was seeing a difference, but wasn't convinced 100%. I had a doctor's appointment today for my annual check up and my doctor said, ""You have beautiful skin, Teresa.....what do you use?"" Well, that settles it for me. I am going to keep using this product. I am 49 years old and I haven't had someone tell me I had beautiful skin in a loooooong time! This is the first time I've used a L'Oreal product. I am definitely going to give their other products a try."
I have been using this for about a month. I like to layer it with moisturizer for sunscreen so my skin doesn't break out. I would prefer it were in a jar . It is so thick it was hard to get out of the tube after a few uses. So far i really like this product.
"I am a newcomer to this product. I am a 60 year old woman and so far I have not seen any difference in the appearance of fine lines or wrinkles, but it did help in minimizing the appearance of enlarged pores, but you can get that same effect from using a primer, which is much cheaper. The product glides on well and is not greasy or oily to me. I have dry skin. I will stick to using primer."
"I received a free sample in the mail and I really liked the results of this product, however, it had a strong odor of sunscreen which irritated my eyes. I also found the product to be very filmy on my face later in the day and difficult to remove with cleanser. The sudsy cleanser would not foam up and my face did not feel clean after 3 attempts! Unfortunately, I would not buy this product."
I received a free sample and I fell in love with this product. After using this product my face looks softer than ever and you can't see my pores or any lines. Miracle Blur almost gives the effect that your face has been photoshopped to remove any and all imperfections. I highly recommend.
"This product is great for FINE lines and pore minimizing. I used is on my forehead and did notice a diminished look of the worry lines. The pores on my cheeks were also cleared up. GREAT work, L'Oreal! However, I didn't notice any change in deep wrinkles (nasal labial fold), which is a problem I have that I had hoped to address--maybe I should use a crane to lift that up... This product doesn't advertise use for these deeper lines, so wasn't expecting anything (but did have my fingers crossed)."
"This product is satiny goodness. I had to write this review because I'm typically skeptical of everything. The results for me were instant! A true miracle - my fine lines were erased. If you haven't tried it, you're honestly missing out. Thank you L'Oreal for keeping your promise."
"I Received this as a sample, i have to say this is one of the best skin smoothers i ever tried, i use the porefessional by benefit, and stop using it for this miracle blur ( purchase full size yesterday) not only is it $10 cheaper than the benefit porefessional it has added benefits like disappearing wrinkles and and lines under my eyes, thanks loreal for making a great product"
"I got the sample today and tried it today! After washing and moisturizing, I put this on half my face to see the before and after. I was really happy that it did matte my face (that was apparent instantaneously) and it did seem to reduce the look of my pores. Luckily I don't have any wrinkles to hide just yet but pores are my problem and I was happy to see that this did reduce them."
"Got the sample and tried it. Miracle Blur did make my pores look smaller and skin had an even tone. Not too keen on the smell would have preferred a little fragrance. Also a little too thick to spread evenly on the skin, but still going to buy a full size bottle."
"I received my sample today, and I fell in love. It is nice, for once, to get a product that does what it says it will. My skin felt so smooth. I applied my foundation over it and my skin looked younger and even toned. I do think it is on the expensive side. But I will be buying some."
"At 55, although I don't like wearing a lot of make-up, I definitely need some help with evening out skin tone and blurring wrinkles! I don't usually comment or review but I like this product so much I couldn't resist. It DOES even out my skin tone, blur my wrinkles and give me a finished look while being extremely light weight, not like other products I've tried! It's so light I would use it every day and that's saying a lot!!"
I have tried the Revitalift miracle blur and absolutely love it. At first I wasn't sure about it because there are many products out there that promise it will work but it doesn't . I have tried this and felt it works great. I notice that my pores look smaller . I have always had large pores and never find anything that worked expect now.
"Tried the sample out that I got in the mail today. I was excited to try it. Quit honestly however, I don't like it at all. It's too thick, and thick feeling on my skin. I'm worried it will block my pores. I didn't see any amazing results, and it has a smell to it that I don't like. I'll be passing on this product."
This product is amazing! I will buy it next time I'm at a store. It's like magic and has a matte finish which diminishes blemishes and fine lines. I will highly recommend it to all of my family and friends. It works like magic and it's perfect for during the day without having to put foundation on at all. I could just put a little bit of blush over it and I'm ready for the day. Thanks for sending me the sample of this wonderful product1 I LOVE IT!!!!!
"TRIED A SAMPLE TODAY..OMG! I LOVE IT! it is a little pricey for my budget, but when there is a sale and i can use a coupon, i am definitely treating myself! as a widow and single Mom, it gave me more confidence at work and the dating world....can't wait to get more!"
"I have used the sample and it more than met my expectations. I am nearing my fifties and I have good skin but I am showing signs of aging. The Miracle Blur made my skin smooth and I applied my makeup over it. Although the before and after pictures are a bit dramatic, Miracle Blur is a product I will continue to use."
"I'm really surprised it does what it advertises! It is really thick and fills in the fine lines on my forehead, around my lips and around my eyes. I'm not a fan of the feeling of my skin though it leaves my skin feeling oily, definitely needs to be set with powder."
Miracleblur is an amazing product! I have been trying out the sample for a week now and it leaves my skin feeling amazing. Now that I am in the 30s club I am more concerned with skin care especially creams aimed at wrinkles. I would absolutely recommend miracleblur to anyone who wants fabulous skin!
"I LOVE LOVE LOVe this stuff!! It is AMAZING! My foundation goes on so much smoother. My make-up seriously last ALL day and I don't have to touch-up with powder throughout the day. The lines around my eyes are not as noticeable. My skin just looks smoother overall I wear it to work, my son's baseball games and my make-up stays on the WHOLE time! Best part? It has SPF 30! Buy it! Try it! Don't like it? Return it!"
"My sister has started wearing this,wow I can really see a big difference, I am the younger sister,but by look's now she look's younger! I am fixing to try it myself, maybe we will reverse this! I want to look younger than her again! ""LOL"" SORRY SIS I STILL LOVE YOU!!!"
I had a Redbook + L'Oreal House Party this past weekend where we got to try several products including the RevitaLift Miracle Blur. All of my guests and myself were very impressed by this product. The product worked instantly on our fine lines and wrinkles. I even noticed that it seemed to minimize my large pores. We will all be buying this product in the future!
Just hosted a REDBOOK & L'Oréal Paris Happy Hour House Party! We got to sample L'Oréal Revitalift® Miracle Blur! It is TOTALLY AWESOME! All guests received a mini sample tube and one lucky winner got a full size product! We all took before and after pictures! Can't wait to use my $2 off coupon that was in the April issue of Redbook!

"This skin product is true to its claims. I washed my face, moisturized, then put this on. It's a little thick when it comes out of the tube but it glides on smoothly and a little goes a long way! The product feels nonexistent on my skin yet my eye crinkles diminish and my large pores seem to disappear. I've worn it alone and under airbrush water based makeup. Works well either way."
"First thing I noticed was my makeup went on smoother. But the 2nd day, I noticed the small lines around my eyes (laugh lines that aren't funny!) seemed less noticeable. I, too, was a skeptic, but glad I kept an open mind! I love this product! The sunscreen is an added bonus!"
"I LOVE this product!! I really wasn't expecting anything great just because I feel like I have tried it all but REVITALIFT MIRACLE BLUR is a little bit of heaven! It literally feels like dry satin on your face when you apply it and you really do see a difference in the lines, pores and wrinkles....I am a BELIEVER and thank you so much for this amazing product!"
At 65 years old I needed something for my skin and I found it with Miracle Blur. My face has never felt so soft and so young once again. My pores are smaller and I feel so much better about myself. Small lines and wrinkles seem to disappear. Love the product and thank you so much for bringing Blur into my life.
"This is a great product. I bought it yesterday and used it on one side of my face to see the difference. For me, it erased the pores and greatly reduced the appearance of the lines around my eyes and mouth. I slept in it last night and got up this morning looking just as wonderful as when I first applied. I love this stuff!"
"I think I am in the minority here, maybe I received a bad batch of this product. Actually, it does blur and smooth, however, it takes a lot of work to do so. The product is crumbly, don't know how else to describe it, I've tried to rub it between my fingers to try and melt it some, but the problem is no matter what I do it looks like I have peeling skin as in a sunburn. I then have to spend all this time trying to brush off all the little pieces of it that are all over my face!! Very annoying!"
"I really like this product because it's so light and fluffy feeling after applied, and it does what it says. It is kind of thick out of the tube, so I warm it up a little, then press to apply. The coverage is so good, I use this alone, on my lazy days."
"It does what it is told it does, if not, more! I ignored all the advertisements since I have purchased so many products and they simply are hype! Not this! I tried a sample that I received in my magazine and could not believe what it did. I put my coat on, went to my pharmacy, and was there, purchased, and was home in less than a 1/2 and hour! Great stuff! It is a miracle in a tube. This is a keeper!"
"10 STARS!!! I am ABSOLUTELY impressed with Miracle Blur!!! I had read about it and decided to try. Well...I am on my 3rd already because I NEVER go a day without it! It's so soft on your face. And the lines do diminsh over time. Being a redhead, I needed this. And the BEST...it truly works!!! I'm almost out, so will get another. Well worth it!!!"
"I have seriously never used a product that does exactly what it said it would. Immediate results. I bought it for large pores and wrinkles too but mostly for the pores, and I could tell the first day. Thank You, LOVE LOVE LOVE . I recommend this highly, I am 59 and sadly to say I have never taken care of my skin, but I noticed results right away. BUY BUY BUY!!!!"
"I love this product! It fills in my fine lines and love that it has an SPF 30 in it! My Visible Lift Makeup with the brush and Miracle Blur make me look younger than my 59 years! Thank you L'Oreal for making such great products for us Baby Boomers! I can't wait to try your new skincare line, Cellular Rennassiance! Keep those wonderful products coming!!! Great NEW website, too, very easy to navigate:)"
"Just from one use, I noticed a difference in the smoothness of my skin. My makeup went on better and my skin looked pore less. Would purchase full size..."
I love this! Especially for days when I am not wearing makeup it makes my face look smooth and even and feels so soft. A little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just started using products like face primers recently. The consistency of the cream is a little strange. I don't think I used it frequent enough to really see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product does work because I do see improvement but I already have oily skin and the cream makes my skin more oily. It should be ok for winter harsh weather but maybe not ok in summer hot days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Revetalift blur leaves my face feeling so soft and protected. This is one of my favorites! Have been using it for quite awhile now. I don't go out without it!
This product is a Miracle. I have deep lines around my mouth and this product works miracles. It makes the lines almost disapear and my mouth is much smoother. I apply it to my crows feet as well. I love this product.
"This is amazing, literally. All u need is a small amount and when you use it, u can instantly tell the difference. It works that well and fast. It is so soft and silky and u won't believe how much better ur skin looks."

I love this product. I am African American and it works well for my complexion. I can use the product alone or wear under my foundation. Great skin care product!!
"I am African American with every oily skin, and I found this product helped a lot. My skin was smoother and much less oily throughout the day. With this product I found a little goes a long way. I am very happy with it and would buy it again."
"This felt heavy and thick. My skin is combination and this made my skin very oily. After an hour of wearing this I had to wash it all off. Such a waste, I felt like I had just thrown away money."
I had gotten a free sample of RevitaLift® Miracle Blur from a big box retailer. The next week I bought it. I love the smooth look I get when I put it on under makeup.
It works! I was skeptical so I applied it to half of my face & had my boyfriend look at me in bright light. He immediately clocked the untreated part of my face.
I liked this product. Definitely makes my skin feel smooth and even. The product fills in small lines in the face so my makeup does not sink into facial lines and wrinkles. A little pricey but I will buy it .
"I have been using this for about 2 months and i see that it works well. However it doesnt do as much as its advertise.... Unless, im using it incorrectly."
Once again I was hoping that this would be a product that really did what it said. It did absolutely nothing to help my pores or fine lines. Extremely disappointed.
loreal just sent me a wonderful beauty giveaway package with miracle blur in it and I love it. it makes my skin look flawless and classic with a simple lipstick and mascara.
"I felt that this product was a waste of money. I saw no difference in my skin while using it. With or without it my face looked the same. I do like other l'oreal face products, but this is not one of them."
This exceeds its own hype. I only use a tinted moisturizer instead of foundation and with Miracle Blur my skin looks fabulous. I am 67 years old and this is the best product I've found in a long time.
"This isn't what I was expecting at all. I assumed it would be a sort of BB thing. But it completely defied my expectations. Translucent, dissolves creamily into the skin, its like photoshop in a bottle! I definitely recommend it."
I am a dark skin black woman. 56 years old . I really didn't see any improvement of instantly erasing the look of line or wrinkle . I did like the softness of the skin.
"I tried a sample and found it to be very heavy on my face. And I didn't see any results whatsoever, and my skin didn't have the ""velvet soft finish"". Would not recommend."
"this cream was tested on sensitive skin and did not cause an allergic reaction. cream a little greasy, but after a cream skin is soft and elastic. I recommend!"
I was lucky enough to try out a sample of this product. I saw NO results after applting it. It was greasy on ny face dir a few hours and thats about it. I would NOT buy this item.
"Love it! I applied it after my moisturizer and waited to see if it would settle into my fine lines under my eyes, no chance, I'm sold! I received a sample in the mail and on my way to purchase a full size of this!"
I received my sample in the mail tried it and loved it. I am 100% sold on this product. I am using a lot less foundation due to the smooth coverage this gives your skin. This product will in my cabinet always!!!
I did not see the 30 second miracle I think the picture is photoshopped and exaggerated. It does leave the skin very smooth but at the same time it's too oily and it smells like sunscreen which is not a plus for me.
"Unfortunately, I saw no change at all. The before/after pics are very deceiving. They're probably edited. I saw no smoothing or evening of skin tone. I will not be buying nor recommending."
I received a free sample and this makes my skin feel soft and the wrinkles seemed to go away. It feels identicle to a water activated $65 cream in my cabinet!
"So far I've love the way this has made my skin look. I didn't even use foundation after and my skin looks a lot better. I used a sample, but will be buy this product."
I am a fan of Miracle Blur! Be careful and do not be too heavy-handed...a little bit goes a long way. I have noticed when I use it my pores seem smaller and my skin is smoother. Great product!
this stuff works try it mom every one should try this awsome stuff go to yr nearest store and but it you will say awsome i want to stay young as possiable for ever
"This product is amazing! I am a makeup artist and have used all sorts of primers. This product primes and ""fills"" in imperfections to give me a flawless canvas to apply my foundation. I will never be without it!"
I bought this product yesterday and tried it just a few minutes ago. It did nothing to minimize the look of my fine lines. I will be returning the product for a full refund which is a big inconvience to me.

I was eager to try this just for the sunscreen benefits but it really did make my skin look better! It does not feel heavy at all and I would certainly reccomend this product!
I purchased this product and used it twice...then developed a nasty rash. Apparently I am allergic to some of the ingrediants. If you have very sensative skin...beware.
I love how this product works. It melts into your skin and leaves it looking and feeling flawless. Pores and fine lines seem to disappear. I don't leave my house without it.
It actually softens the look of my crows feet & puppet lines - pretty awesome! Works perfectly under my foundation & love the benefit of sunscreen. Definitely will buy again!
Finally! One of the few products out there that actually does what it promises to do. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I will buy in bulk and tell all my friends. It's my new miracle skin care must have.
"I like the product. the ad talks about perfecting the skin, erasing lines, etc. HOWEVER, when I read the directions on how to use it, the whole package talks about suncreen. A little confusing??"
"This really helped to even out my skin tone and texture, and was the perfect base for my foundation. Highly recommend for every day and especially for special occasions when you expect to be in some pics!"
I have used this new product and have sensitive skin and I find it really helps my wrinkles around my mouth and forehead. It is a product that does what it says. I recommend it. I am not a teenager and mature and this works for me.
I realy like this stuff. It did not give me a breakout (can not use fundation or powder at all); didn't cake or collect in the wrinkles; was wearable all day; skin still looked smooth by night; like its smell and in general my skin felt smooth.
Actually saw visible difference almost immediately. I have already ordered and received this product.
"This product does not repair damage, it does what it claims to do. Its a skin smoother and I like wearing it under my makeup."
Must have i have used it for 5 months and I can tell the there's a big difference with my expression lines around eyes and mouth .
Love this product. Apply over foundation and your pores almost disappear. This is by far my favorite l'oreal product.
Helps diminish wrinkles and fine lines. Also evens out skin tomes. Fine lines and wrinkles go away instantly
"I used it, and noticed a difference right away, lines diminished, and overall my face had an uplifted appearance."
"I got a mini sample, even though it was only good for one try it made my skin look alot more even. I have uneven skin tone. I like the product."
"Love Revitalift Miracle Blur. Have been using it for 3months...GREAT PRODUCT. It's truly a ""WONDER""Skin Smoother."
"I love, love, LOVE this product...so much so that I have actually demonstrated it on myself for and on friends. The name says it all! THANK YOU <3"
