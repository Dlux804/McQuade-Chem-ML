Apply this within 3 minutes of stepping outside shower and retains the fresh hydrates looks the whole day. Doesn't leave any oily residues on the skin. No irritation or itchiness. Gives the skin the brighter glow and freshness. I like it and would strongly recommend
"Love this for face and even on my bald spot. Keeps face and head from getting dry. My local walmart 0933 has stopped stocking in store, ordered once from Wal-Mart.com but may just buy at a competitor's store."
"Fortunately men's skin care is slowly catching up to par with current medical/dermalogical science. The onslaught of men's skin care regimes is not likely to go away anytime soon. While admittedly I have found something that is better than men+care SPF, I use this as a backup because my current skin care regime is a little pricey. The best offense for aging? A good defense."
I love the feel of my skin after I apply this product. It absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy residue. My only suggestions would be to drastically reduce the fragrance or offer a fragrance free alternative. It's a bit heavy on the baby powder smell. The other suggestion would be to lose the funky pump dispenser. This thing is impossible to get to deliver a consistent amount without spending way to much time manipulating the pump mechanism. How about an old fashioned squeeze bottle?
Hard to find in store so I ordered 3 online. Fast free shipping. Good price
Facial lotion with a sunscreen. Really nice fresh scent!!
"I exclusively use dove for men for all my toiletry needs The lotion is fantastic but the dispenser, even when new is difficult to use and dispense the product"
"Lotion felt good after the shave. still felt great after several hours.. The pumping mechanism did not function, opened container to manually start lotion flow. Fragrance is very nice. Too much attention to sunscreen use,etc. I believe attention should be directed to face cream advantages and then sunscreen benefits."
I used loriel men's skin products for many years with great success. My store doesn't carry that brand any longer so I bought the Dove men's products. I don't care for the aftershave balm or the face moisturisor at all. They smell like diapers and don't absorb into the skin quickly.
The lotion absorbs well and doesn't leave a greasy feeling on your face.
"As a 40 something guy and I typically use Nivea Energy and thought to try the Hydrate Face Lotionâ€¦but I found the label confusing. The only active ingredients are 3 suncreens, which gave me the impression that this was a sunscreen-only product. I work inside all day on a computer and sunscreen means little to me, especially in the winter. I wish Dove made a product with active ingredients that that cater to reducing lines/wrinkles and moisturizing for men who spend time indoors."
"Fantastic product, rich and creamy, but light in texture. Eliminates dry areas around the face, especially after shaving which reappear with other creams, don't appear when using Dove Men and Care Moisturiser. It doesn't leave the skin greasy, it sinks right in and leaves the skin soft and smooth."
Hydrates your skin well. Very good product for an amazing price! Would defenitely recommend this product to anyone!
"Very awesome lotion, first time using it and I loved it, made my skin feel better and look healthier, Im all for this product."
"This works great on my husband. He has had a lot of face cancers removed and this is great on his skin. Really a fantastic product. Was so disappointed when my local Walmart stopped selling it. But, hope they keep it online."
"I have tried my mothers face lotion and to me.its to feminine, which isn't bad but I wanted something for a young man my age (i am 20), and i ordered a deodorant from dive that gave me a free face lotion , i tried it and it made my face smooth and moist. I was also happy that the lotion has spf which protects my face from the sun and is known to keep you from aging more."
"Have tried countless face lotions with SPF that were either too greasy, left tints of color or would burn the eyes when sweating. This product works well with or without facial hair. Absorbs quickly, leaves no colored tint, doesn't drip into and burn eyes when sweating, holds hydration, and sun protection. Works so well my wife now uses it as her daily facial lotion."
"Received my gift set and gave my husband his part. He says the lotion works very well on hydrating his skin, and has a nice ""manly"" smell to it, as compared to the ""fru-fru"" smells some women's lotions do. We would definitely purchase it again, and recommend it to our male friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I obtained some of this as a trial-sized gift and although I don't usually use moisturizers, creams, etc., I have fairly dry skin and decided to give this a try. I've tried a few after-shave balms and used some ""hydrating"" face soaps before and they mostly made my face feel dry. This stuff doesn't make my skin feel dry, and it doesn't feel heavy or oily like most. I now use it every morning and my skin feels great. I like that it has sunscreen built in."
Pros: A new product from Dove that as has SPF 15 protection. Doesn't feel greasy and keeps your skin hydrated even when out in the sun for longer periods of time. Works Great! Cons: The Biggest Downside is it only comes in one tiny size!! Need more ounces.
If you are like me and have a really hard time with your skin drying out then you should really try this product. It adds such moisture to my skin and makes it feel great! And it lasts for hours so I would highly recommend this product.
My husband has really liked the face lotion. It really moisturizes and it has a pleasant smell. He has sensitive skin and hasn't had any issues with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My husband tried this product - in place of his normal generic lotion - and loved it. Make his skin look and feel much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product it absorbs quickly I find it works best to put it on at night. It has a powder fresh semi order less smell. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good face moisturizer that won't irritate, or dry skin out."
My husband loved this product. The smell was not overwhelming but his dry skin stayed moist all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for years and most of the drug stores have started carrying this. I used much more expensive products in the past but I can now tell you this product stands up against any of them. It is a great moisturizer and even has a low level SPF of 15. This tooo is a plus. Lastly the price is awesome and when I can't find it locally there is now Walmart.com to use!
"I've used this product for years and love it, just wish my local Wal-Mart stocked it in store so I wouldn't have to purchase it online."
Thank you for the gift set! My son in law loves Dove products and will be a nice birthday gift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
