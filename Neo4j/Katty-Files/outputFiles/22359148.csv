'Simple Kind' is a great moisturizer - I have used this product for many years. It controls my oily skin and hydrates it at the sme time.
"I tried this product after receiving a coupon for it. So glad I did. It is a great moisturizer, very light and does not feel heavy on your skin. I put it on just before my liquid makeup and it makes my makeup just glide on my skin. I feel like I use less and get just as much coverage. If you are looking for a great moisturizer that is light , give this one a try."
This light moisturizer is perfect!! I use it everyday under makeup. It isn't heavy or sticky like some moisturizers/sunscreens. And I love that it's a moisturizer and sunscreen in one product.
I love this and Simple overall! I have very sensitive skin that's prone to breakouts/clogged pores and extreme dryness/redness/irritation and I keep going back to their line. I'm eagerly awaiting the day that more of the products that are available in the UK are available here (like products formulated for acne- especially blackheads)
"I have very fair skin, so I like to wear moisturizer with SPF, however, many face creams are just too heavy, and I hate that filmy, gunky feeling! Maybe I just have thin skin, because putting product on my face can really be too much--I often put the tiniest amount on, but then the effectiveness is lost. This is the first moisturizer I can spread a normal amount all over my face without feeling like I have a thick layer of gunk. My skin is moisturized and feels smooth and clear."
"I bought this a week ago, and can see a different already. I suffered from acne at the age of 13, and all the harsh things my dermatologist recommended were hard on my skin. I have sensitive combination skin, and this is perfect! I put it on in the am and does not leave my skin dry or oily. Love this product!!!"
"I've been using this for about a month now, and I haven't had any problems. This doesn't cause breakouts, and it's doesn't sting like some moisturizers with sunscreen. I would have given it a full 5 stars if the SPF was higher. It is only 15, so I hope Simple creates the same product available in higher SPF, such as SPF 30 or 45 or 50 :)"
"I normally use the Simple Day Cream with spf15, but my store didn't have it the last time I was there, so I ended up getting this instead. I actually like it better than the other. For one, it's in a squeeze bottle instead of a jar. Two, the scent is even lighter. Three, the moisturizer is lighter than the Day Cream - not as thick I guess is what I'm trying to say. All in all, both products are great. This one is just a bit more of what I was looking for."
"I applied it at 6:30am without any other makeup. I was curious as to how long my skin would feel soft, and not greasy. It lasted until 4:30pm and then my skin felt tight and dry again. Although, happy that it lasted 10 hours of the day. I'm glad to have given the Simple product line a try."
"I had saw this moisturizer in a beauty blog that I follow, and she raved about it! But honestly, it just doesn't do it for me. My skin have never been too sensitive, but since I am so oily, I thought this would be a fit. My face does not like it. I have a large breakout from using the product and dry splotches that still make their appearance. I AM NOT SAYING THIS IS A BAD MOISTURIZER. I am simply saying that this does not work for me! I cannot wait to get back out there and see what I can find at Walmart!"
I bought this lotion at the beginning of summer last year. I didn't want anything heavy or leaving a greasy feeling. This was perfect! It's light and blends easily.
"Im suprised at how well this works and feels! and for a wonderful price as well. I've tried practically everything so my expectations were kinda low, but it works great!"
"This product has become my go-to lotion, I have tried other brands with SPF lotions but my face always seems to break out from them. Not with this. Highly recommend!"
I really enjoy the makeup removing wipes so I thought I'd give this product a try. It goes on very thick and oily. I know it has SPF but this has an overwhelming smell of sunscreen. Very disappointed and won't be buying again.
This is such a wonderful face moisturizer with 15 spf. It is so hard to find a natural moisturizer with spf that is simple & with face friendly ingredients. I only wish that they made a 30spf!!!
I bought this a few years ago and I remember disliking it because it had a strong scent of sunscreen. I would totally buy again if they got rid of that.
"This product I have used for decades. It is supposed to be hypoallergenic and as the name says simple and light. Reformulating was a big mistake as I am now allergic to it, have eye infections and cannot use it."
"I got this as a sample and tried it both on my face and arms. It definitely has that sunscreen smell, but besides that, when I put my makeup on over it, the lotion kind of left this crumbly residue on my face that I had to sweep off...weird! It did make my arms feel really smooth."
I have a very sensitive skin and this product agrees with it and does the moisturizing well!
THIS IS MY DAUGTERS FAVORITE
I am a person who doesn't breakout necessarily unless caused by products i might using. I decided to try this moisturizer because i am always told that i should be putting SPF on my face: however this product caused my skin to break really bad in places i never have before and my face would immediately sting and itch upon using this.I do not recommend this for sensitive skin.
"I have fair, combination, acne prone skin and just started using this product a month ago. My acne has already cleared up substantially. Price is great and I love the way it helps my skin stay soft, moisturized and protected. I plan on using more of this brand's products!"
I've been using this every day for the past two years (or more) and I wouldn't recommend a better lotion.
Provides a light moisturizer and sunscreen without a greasy feel. Easy to apply.
I started using Symple Skin 2 years ago and your products have helped me tremendously. I have very sensitve skin which is very oily. symple Skin helps keep the oil from coating my skin to much which in turn keeps the breakouts from forming. Thank you so much for inventing this product. It works awesome for me.
After having seen the advertising you had done with Zoella I was very interested in purchasing your product. After purchasing and using it for a little while I realized it was doing nothing for my dry skin. I continued using it in hopes is would help but I eventually had to change to something else as it never helped my dry skin.
This is seriously the best facial moisturizer I have ever used. I feel like I can never find a facial moisturizer that hydrates my face but doesn't feel thick and sticky. This is the one!! It is the perfect balance. And I love that it also has a little spf to protect my skin. :) I highly recommend it!
good spf protection. doesn't make oily skin more oily. moisturizes well.
Works very good on dry and sensitive skin if you really dry
Love it! My favorite face moisturizer so far!! It is perfect for my sensitive skin!
I bought this two months ago and I'm so happy I did
It works. What else is there to say? It's really effective.
I got this while in the hospital I really like it.
"Purchased for a 94 year old lady, caused her skin to break out"
"Im happy with my purchase! I recently had an allergic reaction to a face wash, i used this cream and has helped my skin so much."
Brought this product and it was really light and smooth on my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What I like the most about this lotion is the fact that it feels lightweight without making my face feel greasy. I can use mineral foundation once the moisturizer has been applied and have flawless looking skin. Any other brand of moisturizer does not provide a nice base pre-make up like this does. I've had issues with my foundation powder looking caked on if I use something else. Simple works great for me.
Wont clog pores but is way too drying. I bought this because I heard they were discontinuing the 24 hour cream and I was really very disappointed with the product. While the 24 hour cream left skin soft and hydrated this did nothing for my eczema prone flaky skin.
I got this lotion about 6 wks ago and it turned out to be terrific. It softens my hands since I'm a nurse and wash them so much. It also left my elbows soft and my feet were al thanking me for the moisture . This product is great and everyone should try it!
"It's ok product for it's price, I don't really expect a lot from it. But it does what it claims for. I will recommend it if you need a budget everyday sunscreen and you are not out a lot in the sun. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I use this moisturizer every day, I love how light weight it is but it doesn't feel too oily or heavy. My skin gets dry in the cooler months and this helps combat that problem. The price is super reasonable and I love that it has an spf since I'm only 24 and already see signs of aging in my skin! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I recently heard good reviews about this moisturizer so i bought this to try,its skin protecting light moisturizer with SPF 15 ,its really does work great , gives your skin enough moisture without making your skin feel greasy ,definitely for a person who has dry skin and I would've loved this product more if the SPF level was higher then 15. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love Simple Kind To Skin Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF 15 because I work outdoors and it is very important at my age (mid '50's) to use SPF no matter how warm it feels outside. I find it great for my slightly allergic 'nose' and the lotion applies very smoothly, the bottle is easy and the price is right. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Not the best moisturizer but its good because it has spf 15. I use this on top of other moisturizer to benefit from spf when i go out in the afternoon. If im going out in the morning i have to use a greater spf 30 and up. I feel like it dries out my skin a little when i remove it but maybe its because of the weather changing i don't knowbut definitely it doesn't lock the moister in. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This is a great lightweight moisturizer for the day. it has a light texture and it absorbs quickly into the skin. it has spf which is good and it wears well uderneath makeup. i recommand it for people with normal to slightly dry skin (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I would recommend this for young people who don't want to splurge on an expensive moisturizer. More mature skin that need more care wouldn't really benefit from this since it's very light and doesn't moisturize deeply (in my opinion). It's very nice for the price and the 15 fps is great but expect to smell a little bit of that sunscreen scent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've recently heard good reviews about this moisturizer and my daughter bought me a bottle because she heard me say that I wanted to try it. I have to say that I've tried many different moisturizers and find that they are either too heavy or greasy or clog my pours so I opt out of using them. However, I really like how light this Simple brand feels on my face and have used it almost everyday! The SPF 15 is a great added ingredient and I will be purchasing this again for sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I must say, this is a great product! I tend to shy away from moisturizers and sunscreen usually because my face just sweats it all out and I become a greasy mess but this is GREAT. Goes on smooth and leaves my skin silky smooth and feeling weighless on my skin. Gotta love this. Try it ladies, try it :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really like this moisturizer! So many brands I am unable to use as I have very sensitive skin on my face. This product does not burn like many do on my face nor does it make my skin oily which many other moisturizers do. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this moisturizer. I used to use the clinique moisturizing gel before I found simple which is much cheaper, has better ingredients and also comes with SPF 15. I use it twice a day, morning and at night and love how it feels on my skin. It never feels too heavy or greasy for my combo skin and moisturizes well. Definitely recommend this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I feel like I like to go back to the drug store products once in a while to mix things up. I especially like this Simple Kind to Skin Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF 15. What I love about it is that it feels very lightweight and as a bonus it has SPF 15 so I don't have to put on sticky sunscreen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is a decent moisturizer, but isn't right for my very dry skin type. I really like how gentle it is for sensitive skin, but I would recommend it for someone who has normal to oily skin. I bought a bottle and ended up giving it to my husband. he uses it and seems to like it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Works very well. It is a very light feeling moisturizer which is nice. I don't like when they feel heavy and sticky afterwards. This one does not leave my face looking greasy or oily. It dries up very nicely. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have sensitive & dry skin.. when I stumbled upon this product I had truly found my match. It's light, non- greasy and contains SPF 15 which protects me from the sun. Great product at an affordable price. Highly recommend!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"i used the brand Simple for over 3 years, they are one of the best brands. I love their moisturizer, it comes with SPF 15, it's not a lot, but it does help. Whenever I use it, my skin is soft and smooth. I would totally recommend this moisturizer, after all, how can you live with saggy skin? (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"For the summer, I was searching for a moisturizer that was light, no greasy and has an added SPF. I am glad I came across this one. BUT, it is pretty light so I would only use it in the summer. I never felt oily after a day with it on. The smell isn't very pleasant going on, but you do not smell it after. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Maybe it was just my skin at the time but I found this product made my face feel more oily than usual and I broke out. I tried using it for a couple of weeks with no improvement. I did try other products afterwards with similar results so it may have just been my skin at the time for whatever reason. I haven't tried this product since. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is a good moisturizer. Simple products are simple, you know what you are adding on your face. no allergic, no extra perfume, I love this kind of simple. This moisturizer has SPF15, it's perfect for me for the daily morning use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Love this product. So gentle on skin and gives the moisture I need! The SPF is the best thing any face product should have noadays!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product is only okay because it's not the best and it's not the worst. I find that it doesn't do anything for my skin and remains the same. However, I do like that it is perfume free and that it's not as greasy as other moisturizers. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The simple brand is known for being perfume free, and are sensitive skin experts, however i find that their products tend to leave my skin feeling very sticky and tacky. Leaves my skin greasy and a bit oily feeling, and does not work for me. Also there is a very weird smell that the Simple line leaves on my skin, I did not like it, and will not be rebuying it. Didn't notice any differences after using their line for several weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Great light moisturizer for sensitive skin. I like Simple because they focus on using simple and natural ingredients. I have sensitive skin and often I find my skin breaking out after trying new moisturizers but this one was light but absorbs well. Skin feels hydrated without feeling too heavy or oily. Also I like SPF15, you should always protect your skin from sun damage. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love the lack of greasy feel in simple products. This moisturizer is perfect for summer and doesn't feel gross after going all day. I like to blend a bit of makeup in it to really blend it around my face (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Very good price for this lightweight moisurizer. Perfect for summer. I tried mine in a sample but have purchased full size and a few other from the brand. Works very well and keep skin soft and moisturized all day. Love it and definalty recommend it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Was given some from a family friend - really, really like it! Goes on smoothly, light weight, non greasy blends into your skin so easily, works well and the price is right! Highly recommend for daily use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love the simple line of facial skin care. I find a lot of skin loton that contains any spf will make my acne worse. I didn't find that happened with this. I do find the simple brand a little bit expensive than others but it is well worth the money. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I enjoy using simple kind to skin protecting light moisturizer it makes my skin look good and feel good. It doesn't break me out it make my skin feel really great . I like the scent though and I like the fact that it's non greasy feel and helps Proctect my skin from sun I will put it on it the morning and it last the entire day . I would recommend it to my friend and family memeber . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really like Simple products, including this one! It is a very light moisturizer and it absorbs quickly. It's very gentle and helps with my dry patches. This is also a drugstore product so it's easily available and very affordable! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Works super super well! I like that it is not greasy. So many sunscreens I don't like because they make my face feel slimy and they make any makeup I wear slide off my face in summer! So I really like that this feels non greasy. I like that the scent is not too strong, too. I also like that I can get my moisterizing and my sun protection all in one. Good product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like to keep my face moisturized. The Simple Kind to Skin Protecting Light Moisturizer is one of my favourites. It's light and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy or sticky, it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. My skin feels soft and moisturized. It's completely scentless, none of the scentless scent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This moisturizer works just as great as any other one. Keeps your face very moisturized and non greasy. It has no distinct smell or perfumes which is a plus! I use this every morning and it keeps my face smooth. I have very dry skin and this helps. No more dry patches! Price is great very affordable you can find it at any drug store. It glides on smoothly too. Definitely recommend for anyone even men (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer was nice. I have combination skin, so the lightness of it was great. After a while I found that it wasn't moisturizing as much as in the beginning. My skin wasn't reacting to it as well after a couple of months. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am the queen of moisturizers! Being Canadian I get dry skin easily with our cold temps and am excited ro try new products when they appear as always looking for something better! This moisturizer was nit that great. Which was disappointing as I like the line of products. The smell is horribke and it tenda ro lwave a sticky feeling on skin. Dies not leave feeling moiaturized, about ten minutes adtrr applied akin feels dry again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like using #Simple (Kind To Skin Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF 15) it is so light, no heavy or greasy feeling. It also contains SPF 15 so it also helps protect my skin from the sun. It also moisturizes and is a great base for under my makeup. Very affordable @Simple Skincare. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Very light and gentle and has a nice fresh scent. I bought this as I wanted a really light and feather weight moisturizer with sunscreen to apply under my foundation. I use this in the morning when I am going to be outside for any length of time during the day. It is good for sensitive skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Okay ...... It's an expensive sunscreen. Nothing special. It has a slight nauseating smell but it;s bearable. The lotion is a bit only the oily side but once again bearable. Won't be buying it again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I just recently purchased this product after reading some reviews on it and because I like other simple products. I was looking for a moisturized that had an SPF in it. I like this moisturizer I find it to be effective, but nothing special. I'm not a fan of the smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The selling feature for me here is the SPF15. I like having SPF in my everyday moisturizer because it is just one less thing you have to think about. This is a light moisturizer that won't make your skin oily. I like this for summer but need something with a little more moisturizing power in the winter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is the only Moisturizer I have tried from Simple Kind and I do like it better than some other brands I have used. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I love that it has an SPF, I walk to work in the mornings and like that I don't have to put sun screen on first thing in the morning. My favourite thing about the moisturizer is that I can't smell it when I am wearing it, I don't like when my products have scent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I did not like this product. I have very sensitive skin, and I bought this moisturizer, thinking that it would be gentle on my face. It has sunscreen in it, so I used it every morning before going out to school or work, and by the end of the day, my face would have broken out and be itchy. It did not go on very smoothly either; it was more thick and sticky. Personally, I wouldn't buy this brand again. I've found much better products since that one. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Simple is a brand you can trust especially great if you have sensitive skin , prone to irritations. This moisturizer is light and refreshing , not heavy like some other face creams I have tried. It absorbs well and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. With the summer coming I try to stick to and use products with SPF , for extra protection. This Simple moisturizer fits the bill, only wish the SPF count was a little higher. #Simple (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a nice light, non-irritating moisturizer that doesn't leave my 'oily' skin feeling like an oil slick. I would prefer that it had a minimum of SPF 20, but it is still definitely a bonus that there is SPF in it at all! Those with sensitive skin can't go wrong with the Simple brand. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I always look for a moisturizer with SPF in it and this one has that and everything else I like in a moisturizer! It is moisturizing but doesn't feel heavy on my skin. It helps to calm redness but doesn't contribute to the oiliness of my skin! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love, love, love this moisturizer!!! I have been a fan of Simple cleansers and cloths for a while, so when I needed a new moisturizer, I knew I was going back to this brand. The scent is not overly powerful, it doesn't leave your face feeling oily or greasy, and it's very lightweight. I put this on before I apply make up and it doesn't feel like I'm wearing a bunch of layers on my face. 10/10 would definitely recommend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Simple has so amazing products. I love the light scent of this moisturizing cream, it's easy to apply and absorbs great. I love the fact that it has SPF, just an added bonus. Great product definitely recommend and will purchase again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a very good moisturiser for daily use, especially in the non-summer months. It has a non-offensive scent, goes on nice and light and absorbs easily. However, in summer don't forget to put on a higher SPF if you plan to be outside for longer than five minutes! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"""Light"" indeed! This product didn't work well at moisturizing my skin, unfortunately. Initially, it felt great, but I noticed that during the day, my skin would begin to feel tight. I'm definitely not a ""mid-day touch -up"" kind of person, so this isn't for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer is a great price, and is a pretty good moisturizer! It's very light and goes on smoothly! It says it's unscented but you do smell something which I'm guessing is the SPF. You don't notice it after a few minutes or when you put your make-up over it! In the winter months I have super dry skin and this moisturizer didn't really cut it.. I would still have dry-skin by the end of the day and have to re-apply. It's not oily and absorbs quickly. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The Simple Kind to Skin Moisturizer is fragrance-free although I could still smell something. It works great in moisturizing my skin in the summer but I have to apply more than once during winter since I have dry patches on my cheeks. It is gentle on the skin and I am glad that it did not make me break out. It also helps protect the face from the sun. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"As much as i enjoy the Simple Kind products, the odd scent but not a scent that the moisturizer has is not something I can apply to my face and half to smell on and off throughout the day....I like my moisturizers to be body and face (full package) and this is not a winner (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I absolutely love this moisturizer! Really inexpensive and great quality. I have combination skin and this is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Light yet moisturizing. No scent which is perfect for us with sensitive skin (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was initially attracted to this moisturizer because of the price, but quickly fell in love with everything about it! It's light, blends in well, doesn't feel greasy, no scent and I love that it has an SPF! It's now my go-to moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have sensitive skin and I'm always looking for a light moisturizer that won't make me break out mid day, which this product did. It claims it's light and oil free but the texture of it is silky (like most sunscreens which should have thrown me off in the first place) and oily. If you have very sensitive skin and you're prone to break out from the slightest bit of oily or greasy products like I am, don't use this one."
The price was right and I love this moisturizer. I can wear it close to my eyes without tearing up and burning my eyes like all the other moisturizers I have tried. I can't wait to try more Simple Skin Care products. I am 61 and it makes my naturally dry skin feel so soft.
Worked fine for me just got it last month and was skeptical at first
"I bought ibis because it is so hot, and is is working miracles for my skin"

"I spent a week in Florida using this sunscreen. It was the first time I did not get hives! I ran out the last day , used something else, and broke out in sun hives."
"I too would like to see various levels ... 8, 30 etc."
My skin is very sensitive and I always have had problems with moisturizer but with this one my skin is perfect and I don't live without that anymore! I really recommend
This is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used. My skin tends to get oily and this doesn't cause any issues. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I would prefer the SPF to be higher (I'm very fair skinned).
"this is one of the few best creams i had because i have a very oily trouble skin, I'm very satisfied. thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I dont have sensitive skin at all and this makes me peel every single time i use it. Leaves my skin feeling rough and like stated makes my entire face peel.
I have tried the lotion before and I do like the texture of the cream and the smell . And the fact it does not feel oily on my skin. I have always been curious with you hair products also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great day moisturizer. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves my skin feeling moisturized throughout the day. It's also great that it has SPF. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
A very lightweight moisturizer. Very good on my sensitive skin. Price is pretty reasonable as well. Leaves my face with a very fresh and light feeling (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Nice basic starter moisturizer for someone who is concerned about using natural and healthy products. I need something with better ingredients but aside from that it works well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This product did absolutely nothing for my face. After 15 mins it felt like I hadn't put anything on. The spf is way too low for sun. Maybe it's more effective in the fall and winter months. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Nice affordable moisturizer with light creamy texture. It absorbs quick non grass at all. Not too much harsh chemicals in it. Mild scent.could use on everyday basis (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I am very fair skinned and I dont like putting heavy SPF on. This is a great SPF if your are going out for some errands or going for a quick jog. I was not fond of the smell (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This is a very nice light moisturizer. My face is somewhat oily and I found this to be very balancing. My face felt very fresh all day. I would definitely buy this again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I like that Simple Kind to Skin Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF15 is not greasy and has SPF 15 protection cause sometimes I forgot to put my sunscreen on it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Moisturizer is so light and easy to apply. I love how it doesn't leave a greasy film but an even moist tone that lasts for hours with the benefit of skin protection from the sun. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This is a cheap and effective product. I love when facial products just have SPF in them and you don't have to add sunscreen to it. It was very hydrating. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I buy this product and use it daily. I have had skin cancer a few times and now wear SPF all year round as the winter can do as much damage as the summer. This was light and kept my skin soft. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I like that it's light and doesn't feel heavy like some moisturizers with sunscreen in them, only downside is that I typically use spf 30- if simple came out with 30 I would use it everyday (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Very nice product, great scent, and very gentle on your skin. Its a nice and light moisturizer just right for your face , with added protection from the sun ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The SPF quantity is a little bit low for my taste (being uber pale and all), but it moisturizes extremely well and does not leave an oily sheen. It gets rid of dead skin in a few days. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love Simple Kind To Skin Protecting Light Moisturizer SPF 15! It is perfect moisturizer. It feels so refreshing in your skin and love the addition of SPF 15 on it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I love a great moisturizer that has an SPF quality to it I definitely would not use this instead of an SPF specific product but if you're going in and outside I would recommend it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I actually liked this moisturizer, pretty light weight as well this would be my third choice due to liking the nivea cream better but over all still a good moisturizer that doesn't clog the skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Super light weight moisturizer, great for summer months under foundation or alone to protect from the summer sun! Non greasy, comfortable to wear and smooth to apply. skin feels really great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My skin is very sensitive to sunscreen products but this one doesn't make my skin break out. I do prefer a bit of a higher SPF in the summer, but this is good for the rest of the year. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Love this product, great price and amazing quality! It feels so fresh and natural too! I would recommend to any friend or family member, definitely! I would purchase again in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is the second moisturizer I have used my entire life and I LOVE it! I keep on rebuying it because it is so amazing. It doesn't clog my prose or irritate my skin. I live by this stuff. It is the best!
Totally in love with this product! I use it after I use my mia clarasonic3 and it even makes my skin soft when I dont wash my face! I used to use clean and clear's morning burst gel moisturizer and this is wayyyyyy better!!
"For the first time I've finally found a moisturizer w/ a SPF that's not greasy. I've wasted so much money on others within the last year. I'm so glad this is on the shelf. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"I started using this about 4 or 5 months ago. The first thing I noticed, besides the chemical smell, is it stings my skin a little bit when I apply it. After a few months of use I've now noticed my pores are becoming clogged and appear larger than I have seen them in a long time. My skin does not seem to react well to this product."
"As a redhead with sensitive skin, it is very hard for me to find products that don't irritate my face. I like this moisturizer because it works with my skin and it has a soft, silky texture. However, after using this moisturizer for a long time, my skin is starting to look dull and tired and the bags under my eyes are sagging. I would keep using this moisturizer but I'd rather have a product that does a better job of firming and toning my skin."
I purchased this product two months ago and I really like it!
I got it last month and i just love it i love the smell and everything
"This is my favorite moisturizer. It has spf, but doesn't feel greasy. It is the best!"
I've used this product for a couple of years now! It really works!
