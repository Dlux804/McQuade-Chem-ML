"I cut the top off my container because I wanted to get the best use of it all and since I couldn't find it. Super bummed, it's not the same!!!! I'll have to find a new brand!!! HUGE BUMMER GARNIER!!"
My mother had stopped wearing foundation because she gotten to the age where it settled into lines and wrinkles and made her look older. She never have that problem with this stuff. She blend it in with a sponge and it looks very natural but does even out skin tones. She use this in addition to her regular moisturizer. It is very lightweight--if you are trying to cover up acne or other skin problems you'll need to use concealer or a heavier product.
"BB cream makes it very light coverage on the face. I got it for my mom as she doesn't use the foundation. This is a really cream which provides very light foundation effect along with the moisturizing cream. And one important thing about this cream is one cream works as foundation, moisturizer and SPF. I would definitely recommend this all in one cream."
"I've used a few BB creams in the past and wasn't very impressed by them. I was beginning to think I would never find one that worked for my skin. But this one is fantastic! I have a medium dark skin tone with some blemishes. This BB cream moisturizes my skin, slightly covers some of the blemishes and blends in flawlessly. I can see the difference in my skin each time I use it. It makes it look perfect."
Why this has not been around since I started wearing make up is just an opportunity us older folk missed out on however glad it is here now !
"If you want need a very light tint coverage this product is for you. I usually use full coverage foundations, but I love this BB cream for use at the beach where I do not want to use a full coverage foundation and need a moisturizer that provides some skin coverage. I think Garnier has a great product line and I have not found one item that I have not been impressed with."
I have been searching all over for the old formula only to discover it has been discontinued! I accidentally bought this new version not realizing it wasn't the same. It has an unpleasant smell and manages to be sticky without providing coverage. It does nothing to cover up my redness but makes my skin look shiny and terrible.
I am not a fan of this new product.way to thick please bring back the old formula.uktra lift transformer anti aging skin correction spf20
I cannot find this product which I love. What is happening. Please don't discontinue. When you have a good product why do you change. This is what I bought now can't find anywhere.
"I reflect the sentiments of many other reviews. This was the best BB cream! I recommended it to many friends and they all lived it...now we can't find it anywhere. I, too, I have tried many other products and nothing compares. Please consider bringing it back."
I have been using the old formula for years and tried this new formula and it is not the same at all. It sits in my pours and makes my skin look horrible. PLEASE bring back the old formula. PLEASE!!
I have been searching for this BB Cream for so long. It is the only product that doesn't make me feel cakey or like I'm wearing too much. It makes my skin look stunning and I am very disappointed that it has been discontinued but the lighter shades have not? Please bring the medium/ dark shade back! It would be truly appreciated
For years i've been wearing this BB Cream..its the best affordable daily cream out there! The old formula gave you a flawless finish and felt like you didn't have anything on. The new one makes your skin dry and flaky!!! Why change something that was working?? And don't get me started on the cap...you make the new cream a liquid and give it the most leaky cap!!!
"Im not sure who thought taking this item off the market was a good idea, but its not. I ahve been using this for sometime now. This needs to be reconsidered, Im italian and I have tried to use the light/med and its aweful, I look like a ghost. The med/deep is perfect. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING IT BACK"
"I really loved Garnier BB cream Miracle Skin Perfector SPF 15 for normal/dry skin. Now it's discontinued, and the only replacement would be for oily/combo skin. It's not good on my face. I wish my old one was not discontinued((( I have to find something else. Bye-bye Garnier BB cream"
"The product is actually AMAZING, but what upsets me is that I am pale as all get out and garnier discontinued the shade that I can use (fair/light) and I was redirected to this shade. This shade is WAY too dark for me and I had to cover my whole dang neck and ears so that I didn't look ridiculous this morning at work."
I have searched all over for yrs now to no avail locating a comparable product/color for my skin!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.. BRING IT BACK!!! *loyal user
Ican't find Medium/Deep in any the the stores I've been to.Please tell me were I can get it Thanks.bb cream is clean and light feeling on my skin I love it but I can find the right color.
"This is the only thing I have used for years. I love the SPF and the full blend of color I get on my face. This removes all my flaws but now I'm stuck with the 5 in 1 and after using it, I would rather switch brands. Please bring back my shade!"
"I have LOVED this product - regular, not oil-free- as my go-to for years and received untold compliments on my complexion and skin. I would love the formulation to sell if Garner no longer wishes to. Have better marketing strategy as well."
"I have used this BB cream for years. I love it. Now I can't find it anywhere in medium/deep. The light/medium is much too light, I by no means have very dark skin. Please bring this Skinactive BB cream for oily/combo skin back in the medium/deep! I see I am not the only only one complaining about the discontinuation of this product."
"I would have given this a 5 star for consistency. I love the way it goes on and how my skin feels after it's applied. However, the Light/Medium is way too dark for my pale skin. It has kind of an orangey tint and I feel like an oompah loompah. I see by reading other reviews I'm not alone here. Please consider making more shades."
"I have been using this BB cream forever and I love it, but now that I'm not tanning to protect my skin, light/medium is TOO dark for me. Please bring back the fair/light shade and also a darker shade for others. Sadly, I can't wear this anymore due to the lack of shades and I haven't found a replacement."
"I used this cream first time and I felt good in continuing it. It's a great moisturizer, lightweight and evens the skin tone nicely in a natural look. It has a mild smell and gives a glow and shiny to our face. I like this product and will continue in using it."
I love it. I have tried tons of bb cream this it by far the best. Walmart has the best value..
I like the light feel and look and the way it evens out skintone.very natural looking.
"Reading the reviews, I'm so confused. How can I be the only one that feels like this is the greasiest, heaviest “BB cream” on the planet? It's not a BB cream by the way. It's a tinted sunscreen and nothing more. It is greasy like sunscreen and it rolls off your skin like sunscreen. It slightly evened my skin tone but it got splotchy in a matter of minutes. I'm prone to dry skin so I'm surprised how oily this made me. It felt like I was wearing a face mask all day. So heavy!! I will not be buying this again or recommending it to anyone."
ive loved this product for the last few years and now cant find it in any stores. quite a few of my friends were using it too. were all now using different manufactures but none are as good and their colors dont match like this did. we are all bummed! can you bring it back please?? thx
"I've been using this for years and want to continue to do so. Everyone doesn't have pale skin, so please make it available."
I bought this not knowing the formula had been switched. I will no longer purchase this bb cream. I will be looking elsewhere.
PLEASE BRING THIS BACK! I've gone through 5 other BB creams and nothing works like this one. Seriously need the Medium/Deep to be revived!
This is the only product that works for my biracial skin tone without wearing makeup.
Pleeeeeeaaaaassssseeee bring it back!!
I use the oily/combo. It is the best BB cream around hands down but the light/medium is too dark for me. Please make a light shade!
I am so upset that I can't get the Medium/Deep 5-in-1 BB cream anymore. This was my favorite product. PLEASE put it back on the market as I can't wear the lighter one. I have looked everywhere for any remaining bottles and have been unsuccessful.
"I've used this product for so long and now I cant find anything to replace it, I've looked everywhere...PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA in medium deep!!! This is so frustrating!!!!!!!! :("
Please bring back the original formula. I have tried the light/med with new formula (too light for my skin and too thick!). Plus the old formula for combo skin had SPF 20 not 15!
The original formula needs to come back! The light is much too light. I have been using the medium/deep for years and now can't find it anywhere. Please rethink your decision to discontinue.
I found that this has been discontinued. I used the medium/deep. It is easy to find the light/medium but not the former. Please continue this product and make it readily available. This is by far the best tinted moisturizer I have ever used.
I switched from other expensive CC and BB creams - I love this one year round and am sooo sad it's gone!!!! Please bring it back!!! I received multiple compliments on my skin when I wore this!!!
"I would be happy if you still made the medium/deep shade. I love using the light/medium shade in the winter, but need the medium/deep shade in the summer and I mix them as my skin changes seasons. Please bring the medium/deep shade back!!!"
This has been a miracle BB cream for me- it's the only one I've found that controls shine and doesn't cause acne. The light/medium is too dark in winter and too light in summer- please bring back more shades!
"This has been my go to foundation for about 5 years, I finally ran out of my most recent and now I can't find it anywhere !!!!! Please bring it back !!!"
Unfortunately Garnier have discontinued the BB Cream Oil Free for oily to combination skin. They recommended I try the 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector BB Cream Anti-Aging but it's way too shiny and has very little coverage. I've now had to switch to another oil free brand as I'm sure a lot of consumers will have to. Please listen to your consumers Garnier and bring the oil free version back.
"I enjoyed the convenience of an all-in-one product, however I prefer to actually use powder. I have not used liquid foundation in awhile, and only use powder. I heard great things about this product and agree, but will not be making the switch to BB Cream regularly."
"For a person like me with just the moisturizer on and not any make up, this would be perfect fit. it blended perfectly with my skin color. I did not feel conscious that i have something unusual other than my regular moisturizer. It is very light and served the purpose"
"This is my first time using this product and although it appears to be thicker than expected, it goes on very light and you dont need to use much in order to get the coverage you want. Instantly I was able to see the flaws on my skin fade and my skin remained looking fresh all day. I worked out while wearing this BB Cream and it did not streak or stain my clothes when I was sweating. I highly recomend this product."
I'm actually really lazy when it comes to makeup. The only 2 things I require when I leave my house is 1) SPF and 2) something to even out my skin tone. I have relatively good skin so I don't need something strong or heavy. This BB cream does the trick and is an easy 1 stop shop for all things good on my skin. It's a pretty light formula and doesn't provide a ton of coverage but does a good job just enhancing my face. I would highly recommend!
"I was unsure as to what color would suit me so got both the medium/deep and the fair/medium because I am on the medium side. This works well for a nice night glow without over darkening my skin. It gives me a little bit of a tanned look, which I actually quite like...paired with a glittery blush and bright lipstick. Nice product and Walmart has the best price."
"I really liked the product as it blends great on the skin. As promised it gives instant perfection. Its great all-in -one product, i stopped using separate moisturizer as this itself provides keeps skin hydrated whole day. I would definitely recommend this product."
I've had many friends tell me about BB cream so I wanted to give it a try. This cream does in fact seem to make my skin softer and it has evened out skin tone. My biggest complaint though is the lack of variety in colors. The light is too light for my skin tone and the dark it too dark. I had to take a gamble and I have to wear powder over it to blend it in with my skin tone because it doesn't make perfectly.
"The range of skin tones it covers is really amazing, you need not worry much about the shade you have to use for your complexion. It spread nicely when applied and is looking consistent by covering uneven tones. As it said it looks better after each application. It is non greasy and lightweight"
"I have dark skin, but love Garnier product so I gave this a try. I used a small amount and made sure to blend completely in since the cream is lighter than my skin tone. It worked well for a matte and more even complexion. When it's cold and dry outside, I will sometimes add a dab of additional moisturizer. It helps the cream blend and ensures that my skin does not dry out over the course of the day. My Mom and I are different colors and this worked well for her as well."
"I bought this Skin Active BB cream because the box store was out of a different brand I prefer. I've used Garnier BB cream before and it's not my favorite because the coverage is more chalky and dry-ish on application then creamy and smooth, but what I hate most is the tube is always leaky no matter how tightly I screw the lid on. It still seeps over the threads, into the cap and can seep out onto the counter. I believe you need to redesign the container lid to make it leak-proof or move to a pump container."
"Received very fast, would purchase again."
Please bring back the medium deep bb cream. I have tried different brands and nithing come close to Garnier...I'm so disappointed
"Please bring back the original BB cream in Medium/Deep, it was PERFECTION!!!! Why change something that isn't broken?????"
I can find it no where n now I see it is a discontinued item!!! WHY???!!!! The light/medium is too light! Nothing compares !!!
"I've been trying many kinds of tinted moisturizers and bb creams but keep coming back to this product. It covers well, doesn't enhance my wrinkles and scars and moisturizes. It's easy to use and blends we'll into the skin. Use it everyday."
as with any other Garnier product no disappointment with this as well. It blended perfectly but for my complexion i felt light/medium suited well than medium/deep.
So this product feels great on my skin and makes it feel moisturized however the medium/deep tone which I usually purchase for my skin tone in other products is too dark for me in this line. I would definitely use it in a lighter shade
"This is a great cream for a light coverage when your looking for a quick all-in-one. I'd like a bit more SPF, but it's great to use in place of a tinted-moisturizer when your looking for a little extra something to help even out skin-tone."
"I want my money back, please. I'm very very disappointed; I thought this would be a good product that I can use daily. I used it only once, and I didn't like it for several reasons. First, it made my T-zone very oily with dry patches on the cheeks. Second, the color was horrible, looked like an orange fake tan. Third, after a few moments of applying it, I had a powdery-look skin, as if I had rubbed a chalk on my entire face. I will never purchase again or recommend to any friend."
This formulation is horrible! Just awful! My sister and I used the skin renew for years. In my opinion it looked better than foundations that cost $$$. I don't know why you would alter or discontinue a product that was already so amazing. I am disappointed in this company. And it would appear that I am not the only one.
"I 'm in my 50s and have very dry skin. Its the type where I still have mild flakiness even after exfoliating. This BB cream covers well and also covers the flakiness. I am really impressed by this. Many other products look thick and cakey on my face and emphasize the dryness. This one does Not. Very, very pleased. Good coverage and a nice mild fragrance."
"I am 43 and I have very dry skin. The foundation I was using started to sink into the fine lines and wrinkles on my face making me look older. I recently started using the Anti-Aging BB Cream in Light/Medium. I am already impressed with the way it makes my skin feel. It is light, and easy to apply. It evens out my skin tone and my skin looks younger and firmer. I really love this product. It exceeded my expectations."
"I have very sensative skin and have went through many products in my time. I will break out easily, dry out, then get oily. I am 39 and LOVE that I can get a BB cream with the anti-aging. My skin is starting to look pretty darn good. I havent been through a bottle, just started and allready seeing results!"
I have extremely sensitive skin and the old formula worked perfectly and never broke me out. This one makes my skin look oily and doesn't cover nearly as well as the old formula. I thought I'd like it better at first because the formula is thicker but I'm not loving it.
Why does it seem that whenever I really like a product it gets taken off the market. I have been using the med/dark anti-aging BB cream for years. The light/med is too light and I can't find any others that I like. Please bring it back!! (Based on the number of people writing similar reviews it appears that I am not the only one who would like to see this return!)
"I have used this product since I was in high school and now I'm a senior in college! I have searched high and low for the medium/deep tone at nearby drugstores and now I know why I can't find it. Please don't discontinue this product! I love it! It's all that I have used throughout my young adult life. The B.B. cream definitely beats other high end B.B. creams. Also, it's a little racist to discontinue the tan color but not the white. Anyway, please don't get rid of this product!! It's amazing."
An excellent product especially considering the price. At first I was not going to buy the product thinking that it would only be something else I would either give away or throw away but I am so glad I tried it. It does everything it claims! Love this product. My skin looks great with only this and some mineral veil over it. Thank you Garnier!
"I have used this product for years, always loved how my skin looked and felt. I bought the new formula and it is the worst. It slid right off, the strangest consistency, not wearable. Please bring back the original formula! Look at all of these reviews! Thank you!"
"I have used the medium/deep BB cream for years and love it. I have lupus and have red blotches on my face and this covers it flawlessly and blends with my skin tone. Often get compliments on my skin and asked what I use. I have been searching stores for the medium/deep but after only finding the light tone came to your website. Stunned to see you are discontinuing the darker one. You do realize that women have different skin tones, right?!"
"i love this BB CREAM, i am 57 years young and use it for years and years, SUDDENLY i cannot find this MEDIUM/DEEP in ANY STORE ???? it is very very frustrating, since the light/medium is still available everywhere, what is happening here, WHY WE WOMEN WITH DARKER COMPLEXION especially in summer time cant purchase it in our shade we need, you know how chalky it looks if we put light/medium on our skin ... is this some sort of message ??? it is very very frustrating."
"I've been using the Medium/Deep for years. I have more of an Olive complexion. I love the way it blends and feels on my skin, especially during the summer months because of the exposure to the sun. The tone in your natural complexion changes with the seasons. I've been looking for this for months. It's so disappointing that it was discontinued. Please bring it back."
"This is not the same as the old formula. Doesn't cover your face as well, goes on splotchy, and smells horrible. A bunch of my friends and I all agreed this product is garbage compared to the old 5 in 1. Garnier please bring back the old product!!!!!!!!!"
I am seventy one years old and have always taken care of my skin. 5 in 1 makes my face feel like it does when I have a professional facial. I live in Florida and you are breaking my heart discontinuing the medium as I always have some tan. This is a wonderful product. Please don't discontinue
"I have been using this BB cream med/deep for years, and now I cannot find it anywhere."
What happened? I'm 75 years young and this cream did wonders for my skin and pores!
Please bring it back...I'm so upset...there is no better foundation out there than Garnier BB miracle
"I am a mature woman with sensitive skin. This was the only BB Cream or makeup I could wear that would not cause breakouts or rashes and covered my imperfections....so why on earth would you discontinue it??? My skin is miserable without it!!! I loved my face when I had it on...now I look tired and sad, not loving that. Please please please bring it back!!!!"
"Please bring the 5-n-1 BB anti-aging BB cream in MEDIUM/DEEP back. Why discontinue something that so many seemed to have loved? Doesn't make sense. I hate when this happens. It was my favorite foundation and perfect color for me, by far. I am not a happy camper. :-("
"Garnier, when I discovered miracle skin perfecter BB cream in Fair/Light is was LITERALLY a life and game changer!! Why oh why oh why did you go and discontinue it??? Light/medium is too dark for me -- Fair/Light BB was the product I had been seeking for my whole life! Now I am forced to seek a substitute elsewhere. :-(. You had me at hello; sadly, I need to say goodbye. :-(((("
"I agree to bring back the BB Cream..I love love love this product the other anti aging is to thick and it cakes on after a while, while the 5 n1 is perfect. Why would you leave only the light/medium skin people with this wonderful product.. This is definately not fair..Please reconsider [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best BB Cream ever! I use the light/medium in the winter and the medium/dark in the summer. I am shocked to see that it is being discontinued. I have no problem paying more for a better product, but this cream out performed the more expensive creams that I sampled. I am really disappointed!"
"This product was my favorite for so many years. I have been driving to every drugstore near me and could only find the light/medium (too light for me) so I decided to look for it online, only to find out that it was discontinued. I am extremely disappointed in the company. I used to recommend this product to everyone searching for a BB cream and now I can not find it in my skin tone."
"I couldn't find the original BB cream that I've used for years. Bought the Anti-Aging formula instead and thought it would be the same. I find it too thick of a consistency and doesn't seem to go on as smoothly as the original daily moisture care BB Cream. I'd like to see it brought back. After I use this tube up, I'll probably go back to the No. 7 line from England."
"I have used the light/medium tinted moisturizer for a long time and loved it. I was excited to see that Garnier came out with an anti aging formula and bought it yesterday. I'll be returning it today. It does not cover evenly, sits in my creases, and cakes up when I try to blend it. It's a disaster of a BB cream. It should be called aging cream. Yuk."
"I love the Anti-Aging BB Cream. I have been using it for a month & notice a difference in my skin. Its is easy & quick to apply. It gives me an instant glow & smoothness. My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a fair/light. The light/medium I use pulls a little too dark for my skin. Please, please add the lighter shade like some of the other lines!!"
"I love this product in the med/dark shade. Please bring it back. It is the only product that matches well with my skin coloring and works amazing on my skin with hydration, fine lines, evening out skin tone & brown spots. It is also the perfect summer color."
"I absolutely adore and love the original bb cream! Please bring it back!!! I wear this cream every single day and love it, I get so many compliments on how beautiful MY SKIN looks...before using this people would say MY MAKEUP sure looks good. I really do love it. I guess since the original is no longer made I'll try the antiaging bb cream."
I have been using your BB cream as a foundation for 7 years now. The anti-aging does not absorb into your face like the original 5 in 1 miracle cream for normal/dry skin. Just sits there looking uneven and greasy. I wish I would have heard this was being discontinued< I would have stocked up while searching for a replacement.
"I used to LOVE your bb creams. I bought both the light and the medium/deep for oily skin depending on if I had a tan or not (summer vs winter). It covered imperfections so well and was not oily. Now, the medium/deep has changed. It's super thick and I look like an oil slick after applying! I can't find anything that compares and this has totally hindered my beauty routine and overall look. Why do you have to change good thing? Please bring back the old formula!"
"I have used the BB cream for combination skin for years. It was recommended by my dermatologist. After discovering the original had been discontinued, I purchased the ""replacement"". What a disappointment! It's heavy, oily and does not absorb into the skin. It literally felt like my skin was sliding off my face! YUK! Sorry Garnier, you really messed up! From the other reviews, it looks like you've lost a lot of customers....count me as another one."
This stuff really was a miracle for my skin. Please bring back the medium/deep shade! The light/medium just doesn't work for my skin tone. I am so disappointed that Garnier has discontinued this product. Please consider bringing it back and representing more than just light skin tones!
I am so frustrated that the medium/deep BB cream has been discontinued! It was the only cream that worked perfectly with my skin tone and type. I can't understand why Garnier would get rid of this shade. Not a fan of the new product - the color is not right. Please bring back the BB medium/deep!!!!
"I thought I bought this by mistake, only to find out it has replaced the normal/dry skin version. This product slides all around the surface of my skin. It never seems to settle, requiring some sort of powder to make it even... defeating the purpose of a B.B. cream ."
I have been using this cream for years and have stopped using a foundation because this cream is lighter but covers flaws in the skin. Now I am trying to buy more but have found you cannot get the medium/deep color. Very disappointed. Please bring this formula and color back!!
I bought this because I really hate to much makeup but wanted some coverage this is perfect it doesnt brake me out my skin looks flawless like I have nothing on i bought 6 more unfortunately one was the one with acne control and I hate that one the perfume smell is just to strong its thicker darker everything I dont like so i am sticking to this one I love it my new favorite and many others get it
"Why was the Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector Medium / Deep discontinued? I have been looking for it everywhere. This is the perfect color for me. I love that it is so lightweight, doesn't feel like makeup but has some great coverage. I see many others are looking for it. PLEASE BRING IT BACK"
PLEASE bring back Medium/Deep BB cream combo skin!! I'm out & went to 20 stores already! It's the only BB cream product I use for years! Nothing compares..literally!! Please guys bring it back! Why discontinue such an amazing product loved by many that sells like crazy?! Whyyyy?!
"I cannot find medium/deep bb cream anywhere. I also liked the old bb cream formula (Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector) better than the 5 in 1 bb cream. It was much creamier, smoother and more evenly applied. The light/medium is too light. Sorry Garnier--I'm going to have to find another bb cream!"
The original formula in medium/deep was my favorite BB cream ever. This new formulation is too heavy/greasy. Not at all the same which is why I no longer use it. Please bring back the original formulation for medium/deep. I don't understand why it's only being sold for fair skin. That's just not fair (get it?!).
"I have used the medium deep BB cream for years, when I was near the end and was searching for another and couldn't find it in the stores, came to the website and saw the disappointing news. Please bring that back. I had clear skin and didn't need to use any other foundation or products, now that I have had to shop for other BB creams I have acne really bad. My skin tone is too dark for the light medium shade, NEED THE MEDIUM DARK Shade. Please bring it back."
"The original miracle perfector bb cream in meed/deep was my favorite beauty item in my 29 years on earth. I could wear it on its own for a ""natural"" face or as the base of a full face of makeup. I am distraught that this product has been discontinued. I've tried the new one and it's nothing like the original. Also, so unfair that light/med gets to keep the original formula for some reason."
"Like several of the other comments, I was thoroughly disappointed in this product that replaced the previous version. It's so runny compared to the creamy texture of the previous version, which I could live with, but I look like a clown with the dark tint. Such a shame because I really did enjoy the previous product as it met all my needs, and I use several other Garnier products."
"My last tube of this was super great, the only ""foundation"" I've ever liked using! I just bought a new tube and it is awful, pasty, thick and unnatural chalky looking. Also in the past it was unscented. The new tube is fairly strongly scented and I can't stand smelling it all day. The added fragrance irritates my skin and it burns a bit after applying. It does not look nice on my face anymore, and the smell is quite bothersome Very disappointed in these changes."
"I have looked EVERYWHERE for the old version and do not like the new version AT ALL. Have also tried sooo many alternatives and spent a lot of money with no luck. Since it doesn't appear that garnier is bringing this product back, has anyone on this forum found a different brand that works for you? I hate to switch brands, but you leave us no choice!"
"I love this BB cream. Have been using it for years. However, why have you discontinued the medium/deep shade???? I can't for the life of me understand why you discontinue a shade that is needed by so many people based on all these comments. I would think before discontinuing a product an alternative would be offered. What are we to use instead? Please please please bring the medium/deep shade back or so many people will be looking to other brands."
"I have been using the Skin Active 5-in-1 both light/medium and deep (winter/summer) for years now, and it was perfectly light, no streaks and never made me break out! I'm very disappointed that the new version is completely different- greasy and non-blending. PLEASE bring back the discontinued stuff- I'm trying to find a new BB cream because I can't use this new version."
"This product do not match my skin in any tone, I miss the discontinued product, nothing like the original formula, light and perfect coverage with a natural look. I have to find another brand, this was the only product that I used to wear in my face. Please bring the discontinued product back."
"I have searched every store in my area looking for this sunscreen, BB cream Anti-aging in fair/light. At first I thought that the stores just ran out. Now I see on here it was discontinued. I am fair skinned and found this to be the perfect color for me. Going a little darker will look phony. I guess I will have to search for another option. Because of this I would not recommend it for some one of Irish heritage. Which includes a large population."
My sister in law turned me on to this product a few years ago and I had never found anything like it . We both love it and can't believe you're discontinuing Medium Dark . Please bring it back soon . We live in Florida and with the heat and humidity this product looks great from morning to evening . The ones we have tried since being unable to buy we have just thrown away not even remotely nice .
"Apparently this is the replacement for the skin renew version of their B.B. cream and I have to say it is not as good. I really liked how the skin renew version really did help my acne and scars heal MUCH better. Please bring back skin renew, oil control"
I love 5-in-1 Perfector BB cream I don't understand why you discontinued it. I am having a lot of trouble finding a product for my face that does the same as this product. I tried to look online but the price to get my hands on this product has tripled in price. PLEASE bring this product back! it is amazing and affordable.
"I've been mixing the light/medium with the medium/deep for the last few years. I hate to say it... because I LOVE the stuff, but if I can' find the medium/deep within the next few days I'm going to have to use a different brand all together. HUGE mistake discontinuing this shade."
"I too loved the BB cream that was evidently discontinued. I have been searching in several stores trying to find it, thinking they were out. I have purchased this and the anti aging and HATED them. They're too thick, greasy, and don't give nearly as good coverage. The 5 in 1 miracle skin perfector for combo-oily skin in medium deep was AMAZING. I don't understand why it was discontinued. Please bring back."
"I have used the original BB cream, sunscreen, skin renew, miracle skin perfector, Fair/Light for several years now and find out online that you discontinued it. I have tried the new ones and they are too dark for me and dry my skin out too much. I have bought six other BB brands trying to match your original and so far no luck."
I have been using Garnier BB Cream since it was recommended in In Style magazine. Brilliant to discontinue. I tried the anti-aging by accident and it is not the same texture at all. I have dry skin so the oil free will not work either. Would have been a life long customer!
Thanks now the search begins for a new BB cream.... :(
"The texture and moisturizing is A DREAM. The best texture of skincare or makeup I've ever tried. There's a problem with color, however. It's got a pinky undertone and I (like the majority I believe) have a yellow undertone. Looks off. Bummer. It would be my #1 if it the colors were better."
"I have been using Garnier BB Cream since it was recommended to me in an Ulta store. It makes my skin so soft and radiant and gives just the right amount of coverage. However, just like all the previous reviewers...the color is too dark. I have to mix it with a lighter shade from another brand and I just don't get the same result. Please bring back Fair/Light."
This is not for fair skin. I like everything else about this product except that it's just too dark for fair skin. I still attempted to blend it as much as I could but as the day goes on it becomes more orange. It doesn't break my face out like so many other BB's so I wish there was a lighter shade available.
I have really sensitive skin and I always end up throwing stuff away because it makes me break out. I am almost done with my first bottle and I love it. I have not worn any foundation since I started using this product. It makes your skin feel soft and yes it does work for wrinkles. I would recommend this product to EVERYONE!
"I have used this product for many years. I am about to be 82 years old and have a great complexion, attributed to BB Cream use every day and my Cherokee heritage. Am so disappointed it is now available only in light-medium. Have looked everywhere. The light is simply too light.I have always been happy with your products. I am often complimented on my complexion and I credit Garnier BB Cream."
"I've been using and enjoying the original BB cream in medium/dark for years. I'm disappointed that you've only discontinued the darker color. Why just keep light/medium? Shouldn't women of darker complexion be able to use a product that matches their skin tone? Not only is this replacement product not the same formula as the old one, it has a lower SPF. I fail to see how this is better than the previous formulation."
"I was in love with the Miracle Skin Perfector for Oily/Combo skin in Medium/Deep but that product was discontinued and the Garnier site says this is even better. The one that's discontinued blended well and lasted all day. It was more mattifying. This product is greasy, smells weird and doesn't blend as well. It also comes off skin easily. Disappointed."
I have been using this product for the last 4 years..and absolutely loved it. The current product does not work because of the color. I am very fair and the Light/Medium shade is too dark...even in the summer time. Please bring back the Fair/Light Color.
This does not work as well. It stays wet looking and does not provide the coverage or give the matte finish and appearance of smooth even skin like the original did. It also doesn't stay on as well as the original. I gave my tube away after three uses.
"This is a Great BB cream. It really does help to moisturize, smooth, and help with anti-ageing. I would give it 5 stars if you had a lighter shade. I have a fair complexion, and light/medium is too dark for my face, and I don't want to, but I have to mix it with a light foundation."
"I had tried the light/medium shade in the past and it felt great on my dry/ dull skin, giving great moisture and a dewy look that I really liked - but the shade was too dark for my skintone. I would definitely buy a fair/light shade of this product if it were made."
"I have been using the 5 in 1, but it dries out my skin. I love the moisture this one provides, but the light/medium color is sooooo much darker than the light/medium 5 in 1 BB cream. The anti aging definitely needs to be lightened or a fair/light color should be made. Again I would love to continue using it, but color is just too dark for my fair skin."
"I don't think that it reduces wrinkles or fine lines, but it works great as a moisturizer with some tint to even skin tones. I use it in the mornings and my skin looks refreshed and with more evenly toned (I am 70 and still have ruddy cheeks). If I am going out, I apply the Garnier Skin Cream first, then apply my regular foundation. My foundation seems to cover more skin imperfections than without it and the two together do not gather in skin creases. I really like it; this is my second tube and I will buy again."
Bring back the old medium deep BB cream. Not fair!!!!
"I love the product , but it's way too dark for my face. I wish you'd make a product for light skin."
"Works, just remember to get the right shade for you and follow directions for best results. Thank you."
"I was very disappointed in this product and cannot believe all the ""glowing"" reviews it has gotten. Left me looking dried out and chalky looking, creased up and I'm pitching it in the trash."
I love this for the summer now that it's winter even better I use deep in the summer and in the winter I mix medium/deep with deep and the coverage is awesome. Amazing.:)
"I have used this bb cream for a long time. In the winter I use light/medium, but in the summer I used medium/deep. Now I can't find medium/deep. Did you stop making it and if so why."
What have you done to my fav bb cream??? It's now in a smaller bottle with a different dispenser and it's more of a liquid than a cream now. You ruined it! Please return to the original formula.
I looked in 5 different stores for the BB anti-aging medium/deep cream and now realize why I can't find it. Please do not discontinue it. I have been using it for years and especially love the shade for the summer months. BRING IT BACK!!!
I am 60 years old and have been using 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector BB Cream Anti-Aging - Medium/Deep for at least 10 years. I love it and hope you'll consider bringing it back
I have been using this for years and it makes my skin look even and fresh. Please do not discontinue the medium/deep as this is the only shade I ever found that matches my skin tone perfectly.
Please bring back original B.B. cream. I loved it! This new formula does not compare at all. Why do companies take away a product that works well and customers like and replace it with a lesser product that doesn't work as well. Very confusing!
"I have faithfully used this product since it came out and I am sincerely dumbfounded that it has been discontinued. I am someone who has extremely sensitive skin and this was my go-to foundation for daily use. Why, Garnier why?"
This product works great. But its much too dark i wish it was a few shades lighter so it would look more natural and i didn't have to add more make up ontop
I have been using the medium/deep B.B. cream for years! Nothing else compared. The new formula is completely different and is TERRIBLE. So frustrating to have to find something else! Bring the old formula back!!!!!
I have dry skin especially when the weather gets colder and after shaving. This hydrates and covers up razor burn. Only downside is I have to wait for it to dry and pat my face with tissue to clean up the shine.
I wore the medium deep shade for years and recommended it to all of my friends! I can't believe you discontinued that shade when so many women continue to ask for it - don't you understand that not all women have the same skin tone?!?
"This product is my all-time favorite thing to put on my face, but the light/medium shade is still a bit too dark for my face. It would be amazing if you guys released a lighter shade!"
Where can I find 5-N-1 MIRACLE SKIN PERFECTOR BB CREAM ANTI-AGING - MEDIUM/DEEP. I have been looking everywhere for this product and cannot find medium/deep anywhere! I have been using this product for over 4 years and I love it! Please help!
"I can't believe you changed the formula BB cream for Medium/Deep skintones/ Oily/Combo skin. I stopped receiving compliments on my skin as soon as I started using the new formula. Please go back to offering the original - please, please, please!!"
"I loved the Fair/Light Skin Renew Miracle Skin Perfector with SPF15 but sadly it was discontinued. I tried this recommended replacement, but it's too dark for my skin. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere."
"Upset is an understatement. Only makeup I've worn for 5 years and it's discontinued in only 1 shade??? No, I'm not signing up for a newsletter for a product I will no longer use now that you discontinued the only good item you HAD"
This is the only product I've used for years. I can't believe you discontinued only the medium/deep. This product was amazing. I can't find anything else like it.. Very disappointed
This new formula is thick and difficult to blend. Coverage seems blotchy and color does not look natural. Old product was great - why did you change it??
"I love the old product in medium/deep and I'm extremely frustrated that it's discontinued. Obviously, I'm not alone. I hate to find a new product, again but seems I will have to."
"the 5 in 1 oil free medium deep was perfect,now I cant find it anywhere."
guess ill have to find another base.the anti age is to heavy and makes my face greasy.
"I am fair skinned, light auburn hair, of Celtic descent. I can't tan much at all. Please bring back the light/fair! Light/Medium is still too dark for me and, most likely, a host of other women. Disappointed my shade discontinued."
"This formula is awful and drying. I loved the highlighting effect the old formula had, this is obvious with all the great reviews this product had in the past and now I just wasted my money! Returning to the store after a few uses."
I am absolutely devastated this was discontinued. This needs to be brought back and the light/medium is too light for my skin tone. I don't know why you would discontinue such a great product. PLEASE BRING THIS BACK!!!
"I second all of the comments requesting for the old formula to come me back in medium/deep. It was my daily go-to and I'm so sad to see that I'll have to find a new product. I've tried the anti-aging and new formula, and they do not feel the same."
I bought this because they replaced the original formula. It lays too heavy on the skin and so does the oily skin formula. The one they discontinued was a true BB cream. These are both more like a foundation.
Please bring back the fair/light...this is just too dark! I never understand why companies try to fix something that ain't broken to begin with! Not to mention this one glops up when applying. Sooooo disappointed.
"Unfortunately this BB cream is too dry , I need to use a face primer in order to avoid feeling like I have plaster on my face. I like the coverage it provides as well as the fresh sent"
I agree with all the reviews. I so loved the old medium/dark version better. Now I will have to find a different brand to buy as this does not work with my skin tone.
I love the product!. I am very disappointed to find out the product has been discontinue in the medium/ deep shade. The product is great. I love the light weight feel. I am at a complete loss now.
"I've been using the B.B. cream Miracle Skin Perfector Daily Shine Control for the past few years, so sad it's being discontinued. My daily routine would never be the same."
This new formula is thick and orange :( i have used the old formula for years and cant find anything i like as well as the original formula! very frustrated!
I've been buying this stuff for over a year now. I absolutely love it over all the other BB foundations out there. Unfortunately I'm not able to find my shade anymore at the local stores.
I have been using the bb cream go the past two years and love it. As others have said the med - deep shade is not available and or very hard to find. Very frustrating!!!
I bought this prduct when I could not find BB cream Miracle skin protector. It is heavier and no where near as good as the previous product. Disappointed!
I love the bb cream and was so disappointed to discover that the fair/light shade has been discontinued. The light/medium is too dark for fair skin tones.
I have fair skin with some freckles and the light/medium is way too dark and makes me look orange. They really need a fair/light option. Complete waste of money.
Echoing the other comments...i was disappointed that I couldn't find it. Please consider bringing it back. It worked so well and I highly recommended it to everyone that came in my path as well....
"I tried this as suggested to replace the old 5-1. It is a completely different formula. Very little coverage, greasy, leaves skin oily and still in need of coverage. SO upset. Please bring back the old formula!!"
"I quit using foundation and powder 2 years ago and use only this. I having trouble finding it now in the medu to deep shade in Lincoln, NE I hope you are not removing this product"
The Ultra-lift Transformer is so much better than this BB cream. I liked the fact that you transformer is not cakeee! Your BB cream cakes to your skin and dries my face out. PLEASE - PLEASE bring back the Ultra-lift Transformer anti-aging cream!!!
"I would give this product 5 stars if you still made the medium/deep shade. I love having the flexibility to mix the light/medium and medium/deep shades to make my perfect shade in the winter, and using the medium/deep shade when I have a bit of a tan after vacation or in the summer. Please bring it back!!!"
"I'm on the last drops of med/deep ORIGINAL formula, that is no longer available. I purchased the light at Walmart ( only one available) and returned it. Not the same product at all. The original was my everyday foundation. The med/deep was a good match to my color and had nice sheer coverage. As another reviewer stated, If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Well Garnier you broke it, now you need to fix it !!!"
Great coverage for summer. And just a little color without being heavy.
Great use a a moisturizer and foundation. I highly recommend this. Great quantity in the package!
"Makes my skin feel smooth and fresh, very good product, love it"
"I love it!!, cover the imperfection of my skin as a makeup!"
"makes my face feel smoother, but does not cover up dark area on my cheeks"
"I bought this 2 years ago in Florida.It is the best product I have ever used with some color or a tan. I see high reviews on this product. You don't need to use anything else. I have been using it ever since. There is no other makeup with all the ingredients, no competition. Why in the world would you discontinue it?"
I have used your bb creams for at least 6 years and am very disappointed that the medium/deep shade has been discontinued. I have sensitive skin and this was the only product I had for coverage that didn't make me break out. I used to tell everyone about it- and it was affordable. Please consider bringing this shade back
"I don't understand why this has been discontinued. Please bring it back. Once I tried it I never used anything else for probably 6-7 years? Perfect coverage yet lightweight, good oil control, color matched my skintone. The light/medium is too pale for me. Why only provide one color that is sure to exclude a huge chunk of your customer base? The other formula is way too oily for my skin. I have tried it. This was such a good product - please consider bringing it back."
I have gone to multiple stores & searched online for medium/deep for normal skin. I need the product to be easily accessible because as an African-American woman the light/medium gives a dull finish. It has been my favorite moisturizer of all used. (I'm 41 but my skin looks better than 10yrs ago.)
I have used the previous formula for years and have loved it. Why you changed it I will not understand. The pigment does not blend nearly as well and it is over all too thick and heavy. The other formula was light and fresh. It gave a dewy glow and removed easliy. Not a good change for me and I am so disappointed.
"I used to use your bb cream the oil free combination skin medium deep . I tried your new product and it's aweful. Feels super greasy. Doesn't stay on long, and smells bad. I don't ever complain, but you had a great product and am very disappointed thathat you changed a good thing. Please consider bringing it back."
"I used to use the original BB Cream and I loved it. When I couldn't find it a while back I bought the oily skin formula, which was okay but not as good as the original. Recently I ended up buying the Anti-Aging hoping it was more like the original, boy was I wrong! The Anti-Aging is absolutely the worst, it does not apply well, it stays splotchy and uneven, it smells funky and it has terrible coverage. I will be throwing it out immediately and purchasing the oily formula...since that is now my only option :("
"I absolutely love the 5-in-1 Miracle Perfector BB Cream Oil-Free - Medium/Deep product and am so upset that it is being discontinued! I've tried the anti aging product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. Incredibly greasy and I left absolutely gross within 5 min of putting it on. It nearly melts off your face. Please please bring back the oil-free miracle perfector! I am rating the 5-in-1 Miracle Perfector BB Cream Oil-Free - Medium/Deep at a 5 for excellent, but I would rate the other BB creams at a 2 at most."
Where is a redhead going to find her skin tone? Please bring back the fair/light color. Light/medium is too dark for my skin.
I would love to buy the medium/deep bb cream. I have tried other bb creams and yes this is the best one. Please do not discontinue :(
I have been looking all over for my face cream B.B. med/deep. I have used this for years and just found out it is discontinued. Please bring it back
I can't find it anywhere and the new one is too greasy for my skin. Médium/Deep!!!
BRING IT BACK PLEASEEEEEEEE!!!!!
Please bring back the medium/deep. Light/ Med is way to light for my skin in the summer. I am heart broken that was my favorite make-up to wear.
I have used this product for years. Why have you discontinued medium/deep color? Is there any chance you will bring it back?
Have used this product since it became available please bring it back why do companies get rid of something that works?
bring back your med/ dark bb cream. this new brand is horrible and I won't use your products anymore. why change a good thing
Please please bring the old formula back! We all want it back in medium dark it was the best on the market!
Please bringing back this i loved is perfect for my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
its not fair to take Ultra lift transformer off market bec it was a mirecale cream plz bring it back
"I'm Hispanic and it's hard to find a good match for my skin tone. This matches perfectly, feels great, and provides just enough coverage."
"I love this BB Cream, but can't find Medium/Deep anymore. Do any stores carry it? Did you stop making this shade?"
Why can't this be bought anymore ?? It's the only cream I have used for years and now I can't find it??
Please please bring the old one back. The medium/deep . I have looked everywhere!! It is a great product.
Wasn't better like it claims to be. Super oily and greasy. Please please please bring back the old one. I've used it for yrs.
Bring back your old medium deep B.B. cream. This new stuff is too greasy. And no one wears the light here in California.
My light/medium bb cream discontinued. It says the anti ageing is my alternative. I will give it a try but I sure loved my other!!!!!
Not sure what Garnier did to this product or why they would change a good thing. Leaves my face VERY greasy! I can't wear it anymore.
I love this bb cream but it's too dark for my pale skin. Great coverage. Please make in fair/light shade.
I have seborrheic dermatitis and this helps cover some of my redness. I am a guy and you cannot tell that I am wearing this stuff.
I had a hard time finding this product in the stores. Had to order online.puts the finishing touches on my skin. Makes my skin look less pororous.
I love that it has coverage unlike a lot of BB creams. It goes on dewy but if I don't like that I add powder and mute it. My skin is happier with this than gross foundation.
"Completely more than I thought it would be. I used another B.B. cream and was out. So I thought I would try this one. It made a very smooth and dewy look to my face. Natural looking, truly was surprised!"
"I was using BB Cream Miracle Skin Perfector Anti Aging which was discontinued. This product smears on face and doesn't apply as well, It will eventually blend in but not as well as the discontinued product which was creamier."
"I use regular anti-aging, not oil free."
"Why isn't there a ""light"" shade? Light/medium works fine in the summer, but when the season changes, I need a lighter shade."
I do agree with those how recommended the old formula. It was the best cream ever. I've used the cheapest to the high end. B.B. is still the only one for me. Especially in the summer
"The 5 in1 has no coverage and feels very greasy. I have been using the Skin renew as a foundation for years. The 5 in1 feels more like a moisturizer, but offers little benefit"
Please bring back the original formula! The alternative formula smells and the texture is off. It was my everyday go to and now I'm stuck experimenting with other brands wreaking havoc on my skin :(
"i have very WHITE skin, and i got the lightest one that they had, it made my face look like an ORANGE pumpkin! waste of time effort and money! wish i had a time machine. product is horrendous!"
It is the first time that I have tried using a BB cream and I loved this product. It gave me a glowing and moisturised skin. It also helped reduce my blemishes and red blotches. The only difficulty I had was trying to figure out if I had to buy the fair or medium. I have fair brown skin. Maybe you could put some kind of colour chart on the packaging to make it easier. Other than that I love this product especially for a lazy person who finds taking care of my skin too time consuming. Thanks
I am in love with the formula of this but am disappointed because the lightest color makes me so orange looking. I am fair with a warm ubdertone and the lightest shade is definitely a few shades darker than I am. I would definitely buy this again if the shades were better.
This is an amazing daytime makeup. Foundation is too much when your running around from jobs then to kids and I work in an animal shelter part time. I dont have time to check my face and powder up. This doesn't break down or clog pores. Stays the same keeping my skintone even snd hydrated.
Absolutely love this new 5-1 BB Cream from Garnier!! It's replaced my old make-up and has become an absolute must have before I leave the house even if it's the only product I get to put on!!! It goes on great covers evenly and stays on all day no matter what though the heat sweat rain it stays on. Absolutely love love love it and I've showed and recommended it to everyone I come in contact with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It smells so bad and leaves my skin so oily. I used the old one for so long and I love it but now the new one is really bad product. Why discontinue it not everyone skin is the same so is ok to create a new one for some people that like oily skin but what about the rest that don't like it. The new product is a completely disaster.
"I have used the Miracle Skin Perfector Daily Shine Control faithfully - and loved it. The new/replacement product is not the same, the coverage is not as good, it does not stay on and the texture is really bad. PLEASE listen to your client base and bring back the original formula, I am now using another line of product - and while it is good, I miss - and would come back, to the original Garnier product as stated above. So very disappointed."
"I have been using this product for the last two years and have gotten tons of compliments on my complexion ever since. My skin tone looks even and my face just glows! The light/medium is a little dark for my very fair coloring, so I do need to add a dab of regular moisturizer to it and mix it together before applying to make the color closer to that of my skin. Please never stop making this stuff! I'd be lost without it!"
Hoping to add to the list of unhappy customers! Please Bring back the old formula!
Why is it every time you find a product in the shade that you like it gets discontinued?
Terrible. Bring back old formula. The old formula was amazing. I don't understand the change.
This leaves my face cakey & oily. Horrible for my combination skin.
"Please do not discontinue, this is the best BB cream"
"I LOVE this product, but the Light/Medium is too dark for me."
Please bring back the Fair/Light.
"Oh come on, why would you discontinue such a wonderful product? bring it back!!!!"
I want to wear it this summer but it's too dark for me!
Just adding on to the disappointment. Miss my color and old formula. Please bring it back!!
It doesn't match as well as the discontinued one .
I like using better than regular foundation
"LOVE IT!! I'm 50 yrs old, with very sensitive skin and this is the best stuff I've ever used"
This is my first time purchasing this product. So far I really like it. It does what it says!
Goes on smooth and does not give me an overdone look. The color is also great for my olive skin.
This is TH ONLY foundation that works for me. The anti-aging BB cream is horrible and sticky. Please bring this product back.
"I have tried every BB cream and this by far is my favorite. It controls shine without drying me out. Also, the medium to deep color is great!"
Bring back the old formula Medium/deep B.B. cream oil control that one was the best type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin is quite light and Fair/light was perfect. Light/medium is too dark so I now have to mix with lighter color
I love the B.B. anti aging cream med deep . I tried it when I left my bag home on a vacation and it was great . My friends tried it too and they love it as well . I can not find it in the stores and don't understand why
"I have used this for a very long time. Loved the formula, until it was changed. My reason is the same as all the others here. It is not even close to the old one. Disappointing. I will not buy it again."
"I've been using this product about two weeks. It does cover well but it doesn't have enough moisturizer for my skin. The opening to the tube is too, too large and I waste a lot of product every morning. I won't buy it again."
I bought this product because it has multiple uses for my skin. I love your BB cream and I usually purchase the other 5 in 1 miracle skin and I think it evens out my skin tone and hides my redness. I decided to try the anti-aging one since it seems to be almost the same but I am unhappy with the coverage. it makes my skin just look oily. just wanted a little more coverage with the color.
I've been using this product for a couple of years now and I Love it!! It's not enough to use as a foundation but under it's fantastic!! It's more a tinted moisturizer/sunscreen. If people would understand this I think it would hopefully get better reviews.
"I've looked Everywhere trying to find the medium/dark only to find out now that it's discontinued???!!! Why in the world would you do that? Epically for summer! I'm out and have tried other BB creams....wasted money. PLEASE, PLEASE, bring it back ASAP!"
I LOVE this stuff!!! I received a sample of it in the mail and thought I would give it a try. I don't like to wear a heavy foundation type product but do need a little tone to even out my skin. This cream feels so soft and comfortable and stays looking good ALL day!!! I like a lot better than the Maybelline Age Rewind product that I had been using for years. Definitely recommend this product.
"New packaging, has a stronger smell. Not a bad smell but there's a scent that isn't in the other bb cream for oily skin. Seems like I have to use more to get the same coverage as the one for the oily/dry skin. The package is bulkier so not so easy to fit in a makeup bag if you needed to bring it with you, but will fit."
I really like the Garnier 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector BB Cream . It makes my skin look very youthful and dewey also even and those are qualities that are important to me. It takes care of spots on my face and redness as well. It literally covers everything. It has a great smell also! I would have gave it five stars if it came with my color. I got the light/ medium and it was a tad too light for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this BB cream! I was pretty skeptical, because BB cream tends to be a very light coverage. However, I found that it has a medium coverage, that is build able, if needed. The make-up felt very lightweight and natural, as well. I am definitely a fan, and will buy this again in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this BB Cream it's my summer go to! It fits my skin tone perfectly and it gives you that perfect summer shimmer. What I love about this product is that not only does it protect me from the sun it's also helps me with my oily skin, I recommend this to everyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is an inexpensive great product using natural ingredients that protect from aging sun damage which no one wants! The color tints are very natural looking and it smells a great! I have found my new BB cream that is loaded with anti-aging antioxidants! My wrinkles are disappearing and uneven skin tone is completely resolved, all with the protection of worsening sun damage!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this bb cream! It protected my skin and it also covered my imperfections, I was very surprised and pleased at how well it matched my skin tone and it left my skin looking luminous and feeling very soft! This 5 in 1 bb cream is the holy grail! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Easy to apply and my skin looks smooth! It even helps with blotchy skin! I used the light/ medium and it was a tad light but when I added a little powder it worked. I like it for everyday use and would definitely purchase again Below is a picture with half my face using the Garnier BB cream and the other half without makeup. You can see that the tone is more even though a bit more pale. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My favorite BB cream so far. Super creamy and super smooth. It feels at first a little grease which I don't mind because my skin is super dry but when it dries up is not grease at all. Very light for does hot days that you don't want to get suffocated with makeup. Ripped jeans, t-shirt, sandals and perfect !!! Also it has SPF 15, SIMPLY AWESOME!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is very nice to use. I'm not big on makeup besides eyeliner and mascara. So when I tried this I assumed that I wouldn't like it like most else. I still went on to try it. It went on lighter than most makeup I've tried. which is very nice. it also evened out my skin tone really well and looked a bit more natural than some other products. Even though I may not use it every day, I will be glad to have it with my other makeup for special occasions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is noticeably smoother and more plump, my pores look less visible, and my facial contours appear more defined. I loved the texture of the cream, and it was a bonus having 15 SPF. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I over all like this product. It's coverage is wonderful. It only takes a small amount to do the job. It's texture is creamy and smooth. It also prevents sunburn. The only negative is it made my skin break out at first but it seemed to clear up rather quickly. I would definitely recommend this product to friends.

I really love this bb cream actually I use it as a primer and it makes my face look flawless. I've tried a lot of expensive primers and this works just as good if not better. I have also worn it alone like when I go to the gym and it makes my face look smoother the pores are hidden and it doesn't get cakey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this product! I don't usually like using foundation because of how it feels. When using Garnier 5-1 Miracle Skin Perfector BB Cream it helped cover up like foundation and evened out my skin tone plus I didn't feel it at all! I definitely would recommend using this product.

"5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector BB Cream Light/Medium is an excellent option for oily skin girls that love a lightweight base for everyday routine! The color match was perfect for my neutral completion. You'd use it as a foundation and just concealer the most critical spot areas. I'm still trying it, but loving so far.

"I received this BB Cream for free in exchange for my honest review. I'm a bit sensitive to smells in my beauty products, and I couldn't stand the smell of this. It was a very strong SPF scent with something else- I'm not sure. I gave it to a friend who doesn't mind the smell and she adores it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this cream daily for over a week and LOVE it! I have very sensitive skin and it is very hard to find sunscreen that doesn't irritate my face. It also has enough tint coverage to cover larger pores and redness. It has replaced me using a foundation altogether. For the price and availability this is a fantastic product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This BB cream is a great alternative to foundation! If you want more than tinted moisturizer, yet don't want the heavy feeling of foundation, this is your product. It goes on smooth, and blends to your skin tone evenly. All while covering blemishes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This really isn't for me. There's really no coverage at all, so what's the point? I already use a moisturizer and sunscreen, and since this doesn't give any coverage I'm wasting money and I have another product I don't use on my counter. If this did offer some coverage or color correction, I'd buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like the evenness this bb cream brings to my skin tone. It does have a bit of an alcohol-y smell to it which wasnt pleasant, but it went on matte and dried almost instantly. May purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Garnier SkinActive BB Cream! I have used other BB Creams in the past and this one is by far my favorite. It goes on smooth and doesn't give you that ""cake face"" feeling while still providing an even tone. I rarely put on a full coverage face and this lets me feel flawless without that much makeup on. As an added bonus, no greasy feeling and SPF 20. Can't get much better than that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product, I work outside and as a redhead I burn easily. I also wear makeup, but I usually end up sweating it off. With this tinted sunscreen I don't have to wear makeup at all, it gives me just enough color. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The BB cream didn't match my skin tone and it didn't really have the coverage like I thought it would. It didn't really cover my pores or even out anything. The package is nice I was hoping for good results. I don't have much to compare it to tho as I don't really wear make up or put anything similar on my face. The smell was nice and the overall thickness of the product was good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This 5 in 1 miracle skin bb cream is so great! I love the coverage and the color blends perfectly with my skin color. You don't even have to use a lot of product for coverage either! This item is my bet best friend, I've added it into my daily makeup routine. Another bonus of this product is it is anti aging and it has spf in it to protect your skin from the sun! This item is great for on the go trips to the beach etc. it lasts all day too, if you are looking for a new bb cream I recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Garnier SkinActive BB cream for a few days now. I really like that the cream is lightweight and offers me just enough coverage to even out my skintone. I'm not a huge make-up wearer, but I absolutely love the BB cream and what it does for my skin. The only thing I don't like about this product is that it is a bit runny. I would have expected it to be a little more thick, but overall I have really enjoyed using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After recently having a baby the pigment on my face has been uneven and gets worse with the sun. My workday routine included sunscreen, correction concentrate, concealer and powder. I have ditched the sunscreen and concealer for the 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector and the result is lighter weight coverage with a more even skin tone. It is also great for casual days on the weekend when this is the only product I apply and I have sun protection and a better skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In getting the Garnier SkinActive BB Cream, I didn't really have high hopes, since I typically purchase all of my makeup from department stores. I'm someone who is outside quite a bit in the summer, and a lot of times am on the water. I was SHOCKED with the amount of coverage this cream gave. It has all the SPF I need and really went a long way in evening out my skin tone and covering all the little imperfections. Paired with a little mascara, and it was a fresh clean look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product while on a mission trip. I did like the fact that it has SPF in it. However product claims to be oil-free, and I found it feel very oily on my face. Other than that I loved the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This BB cream is better than any other BB cream I've ever used. It goes on smoothly, and blends in very well. Also I work all day in the outdoors, which means I sweat a lot, and the BB cream stayed on and worked efficiency through it all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In the first use it works.. it went on soft and evenly. You don't have to use much at all ... blends fantastic. It really does it all.Being a mom of a toddler I don't have much time to get ready in the morning, but with this product it's truly a 5 in 1 product. Cuts down so much time in the morning. My face has been oil free since I got my skin active 5 in 1 in the mail a few days ago. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream did wonders i do struggle with oily skin and do it alot of sun burn issues around my nose but this cream not only matched my skin tone but helped with my skin and is a sunscreen.. amazing product will defiantly be buying again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm very pleased with this cream. Im typically not a fan of BB Creams in general but this one really works. It covers up imperfections perfectly giving a nice glow to your skin and goes on smoothly. It's light so it doesn't make my face feel cakey. I love that it doesnt make your face oily at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would have wanted to know that a sunscreen was included in the mixture of the product. In my opinion this product had light coverage and minimal sunscreen and to me not really moisturizing. I had high hopes for this product and was really looking forward to it. The coverage was decent and it did go on evenly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I first got my 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfector BB Cream I was a little skeptical. I'm not a big fan of foundations and was worried this was going to feel cakey or heavy on my face. I was pleasantly surprised with how light this product is!! It evened out my skin nicely but wasn't obvious I was wearing anything. Bonus...it's also a sun protectant! Can't get much better than that!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this perfecter cream. It's light and creamy so it goes on smooth and you don't feel like your face s caked with foundation. It's got a very cool feeling and is breathable so it's almost like you're not wearing anything at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to receive the Garnier BB Cream with Sunscreen. The coverage is great, and it's so light I don't even know I'm wearing it. It makes my face look flawless and smooth, and hides any blemishes, plus the SPF just adds to the benefits. It also does a phenomenal job keeping my oily skin at bay (T-Zone). I've only been using this for a few days, but after I use this tube up, I will definitely be buying another one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a really great product! I didn't expect it to offer as much coverage as it does. I set it like a normal foundation and it gives a nice natural finish without the weight of a foundation. I deducted one star for the scent. It's a little too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only had the item for one day. I tried it yesterday and today and so far I love it!! it doesn't leave your face looking like a clumpy mess and goes right into your skin tone! I wish it was more for sunscreen uses because I would use this product everyday! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this cream is great! I used it before heading outside with my kids to play yesterday, and today before the beach. My skin stayed protected from a sunburn and I loved that it not only smelled great but it also made my skin shine! You can feel it hydrating your skin and will look great anytime of day with an even skin tone. My red, blotchy face appears smooth and soft after a light application. I will keep using it for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the Garnier BB Cream 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfecter is a wonderful product! I applied it right after I got out of the shower like a normal moisturizer. It went on great, it is thin/light and not cakey feeling. It blended in perfectly and did not leave streaks. Super impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Garnier SkinActive BB Cream with sunscreen works like a charm! Not only was I confident with the full coverage and matte style of foundation, but I was also impressed with the sunscreen. I stayed out on a boat in the sun all day and even with just SPF 20 I did not get sunburn or any peeling skin. It cleans off easily with generic makeup remover. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never tried a BB cream before because I was afraid it wouldn't be as much coverage. I was so wrong. I put this on yesterday morning and wore all day at my office job. I love this cream. It covers good and evenly and stayed longer then my normal foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product applies like sunscreen but covers like makeup. I constantly touch my face during the day, but the product never came off on my fingers. I was surprised that the color actually looked fine on my skin since it's such a vague tint (light/medium), but you can't even tell it's on. It doesn't cover all skin imperfections (after all, it's not foundation), but it did dim my under eye circles and make my pores less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the BB Cream 5-in-1 Miracle Skin Perfect or, it hides my blemishes perfectly and goes on smoothly and blends really well, the only problem I had was when I sweat it ran, badly, it streaked and everyone could tell I was wearing foundation. That's my only problem with it. Others may not have that problem. Everyone is different. Aside from the running while sweating problem I would definitely recommend this to people for other occations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried out this product for the first time and im not one to use alot of things on my face because of sensitivity but this worked amazing felt smooth and not heavy and the coverage was great i will definitely be purchasing this again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product typically isn't something i usually would try but I'm glad i did. Its lightweight and you can't even tell that its sunscreen or that i'm even wearing it. When i first put it on it was tingly i'm not sure why. It left my skin smooth and the color like stated above is like a natural look. I'm very impressed by this product and the best part no burn! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I revived this product on8/7/17. I was so excited that I used it immediately. Just from one use I fell in love with it. It goes on nice and smooth. It is not a thick product. It covered my age spots and minor imperfections flawlessly. It left me with a natural look which I absolutely loved. I will be buying this product when my sample runs out. Great great product.

"I have to say this is the best BB I have ever used! I am typically not a fan of BB Creams in general because since I am so into detailed makeup, I always need full coverage and perfect skin. But, this did it all! This is definitely blendable, can be layered very well and is not too shiny as well as not too try. It feels amazing on the skin and stays on the skin well throughout the day. This is so perfect for great coverage and sun protection at any beach day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product. I think it does its job really well and it does exactly what it says it does. I think I will continue to use this product even after this review and I will probably buy more from this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't even begin to explain how amazing this BB cream is. I've tried so many and never had one that feels as lightweight as this one does while providing close to full coverage for me. It is the absolute best and I'm kicking myself for not having tried it sooner. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my more detailed review I posted about it.
"I absolutely love this BB cream! It keeps my face soft, smooth, and hydrated all day long. On days my face is really dry I wear it by itself, but if I want more coverage, I'll set it with powder. It smells amazing and feels like a moisturizer but makes my skin look really healthy and polished, but still natural. My only complaint is that the light/medium is way too dark. I wish they'd bring back the fair/light color or offer a better variety of shades. Other than the severe lack of color choices, this stuff is amazing."
Shiny face.. smells so strong it triggers my sinuses and allergies! I'm tossing this one.
Doesnt look good one
It makes your face shiny and greasy! As a result you'll get acnie .
I love this B.B. cream. It works amazing with my combination skin. I am a medium/deep but right now I can't find it anywhere!
My daughter and I have used this product for over 3 years and it is the best BB cream product we have ever used. We absolutely love it!!
"The product is great for everyday usage. Light coverage, is a slight oily but is great for aging skin."
The coverage is not great. It has spf 15 which is pretty low. For the poor coverage and low spf the product is overpriced. You are better of purchasing a good quality primer or concealer for this price.
No coverage. The only reason I bought this was because they discontinued my normal oily/combo skin tube. Decided to give this a try but I plan to return it. No coverage and very greasy.
I use the bb cream skin perfector ( dark ) i love it. Everyone compliments me when i put it on.. but i cant seem to find it in any store now. Has it been discontinued
BB Cream is my favorite! I just started using it about 6 months ago and has been using it ever since!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I liked that it was easy to spread on my face, but it felt heavy and made my face look very pale. It felt more like sunscreen than as a foundation with sunscreen included. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I use this along with the garnier concealer and like the medium coverage that it gives. If you need light to medium coverage, this is the product to use."
I buy this from Walmart on sale amazing product after one year use I feel my pores are very less I use it daily and even for make base and even to cover my acen mark as well
I never wore any kind of foundation or bb cream before and now I wear this bb cream everyday. It goes perfectly with my skin and the coverage is so light. It doesn't cause me to break out and stays on all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"just a hint of coverage, mattifies...love this..just hard to find in medium/deep"
"I love this product, but can NEVER find medium/deep in stores"
Why can't I find this in the stores? I need the normal/dry skin medium/deep. I really like this product.
The best light weight foundation that I have tried without feeling like a mask. It matches my skin tone perferctly and coverage is right on point.
Love this product but unable to find the medium-dark colour anywhere- has it been discontinued
Soo disappointed
"Sticky , not the same as the oil control kind which I love"
This stuff smells like a self tanner! It stinks! Zero coverage. Made my face sting
Love this product as my daily moisturizer. Provides light coverage of imperfections.
I used to love this cc cream until they changed the formula.
"great price, nice coverage and sunscreen is a plus."
"It looks a little darker, but when I add it to my face it looks great. I love it so much."
Very Nice I like it
Nice cover
Use this instead of makeup when I am just around the house.
