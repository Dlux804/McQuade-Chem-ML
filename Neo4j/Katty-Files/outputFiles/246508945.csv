"I really like using my Earth To Skin Watermelon Serum. I wash my face thoroughly and afterwards I put the serum on my face. I use it every night before I go to sleep. The serum smells so good, the color is really pretty, the texture is nice. It makes my face feel really soft right after I use it on my face. I love how soft my face feels after I use the serum."
"I believe this is my first time to use Earth to Skin brand. It delivers an immediate blast of hydration & the fruity smell is amazing. The directions is easy to follow. Wash your face like you would, towel dry and apply a few drops onto the palm of hands and gently press onto face. I check out the ingredients and there is nothing there that I am sensitive to. I recommend. Thank you Home Tester Club for the opportunity to try the product"
Watermelon serum has
"greatly improved the texture of my skin , it feels tighter and fine lines are almost invisible. Using the watermelon serum is a pleasure the smell is so refreshing and it's so simple to use, I highly recommend anyone to add watermelon serum to their daily routine."
The smell is amazzzzzing!!! Seriously it's almost the best part of the serum. It was easy to put on and it made me face feel very soft after it dried. The smell doesn't fade away fast either so I smelt like watermelon for the majority of the night and I wasn't complaining. Loved it! It didn't irritate my skin. Great serum!
"I loved this Earth to Skin Watermelon Serum. It is light, goes on smoothly and moisturizes, however, it did not like my skin and turned my face red after I used it. I tried it several times - after washing, before regular moisturizer, after regular moisturizer, but it just wasn't the best product for me. I would definitely recommend it, though, to anyone looking for a good product if they don't have sensitive skin."
"There were several things that I liked about the Watermelon Serum. The first thing that I liked was the scent. It fits in with summertime, as it has a nice fresh, watermelon scent. It is easy to apply, and left my face feeling soft and moisturized. I did not notice a huge difference in my skin after using this versus some other products that I have used in the past. It did, however, leave my face feeling better than if I had not used any product on it at all. Overall, I think this is a good product and will continue to use it."
"If you are a fan of watermelon and smooth feeling skin, this is a fabulous serum for you. The first thing I noticed was the sweet smell of Watermelon (think jolly rancher) and the second was how smooth my skin felt after application. It wasn't sticky, which is always a concern with any liquid product I try. Overall I enjoy this serum and will definitely purchase more when I run out!"
This Watermelon Serum not only left my skin looking and feeling more moisturized than my usual products but it smells and feels great! I love it! I could see the difference after only a few days. My skin looked more plump and smooth. I will definitely continue using it!
The product smells absolutely wonderful. It is a nice size container. It is easy to use and is very gentle on my skin. My face felt smooth and hydrating after the first use.
"I highly recommend this product to everyone ,looking for a new fast working serum."
"I really like the earth to skin Super Fruits Watermelon Hydrating Juicy Serum. The serum is easy to pump from the bottle, and a little goes a long way. The serum was easy to absorb into my skin, and I like how it had a light feeling on my skin, not heavy or greasy. The serum has a very light, and slight watermelon scent to it, which is nice. I also like how the serum has watermelon extract, Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and other anti-oxidents that are great for your skin."
"I really enjoy the scent of this moisturizing face serum.It is indulgent and unique.It is non sticky and absorbs quickly.I do see a difference to my dull skin, which this helps brighten.Cruelty free and long lasting throughout the day.I have oily skin and did not break out. This is great for everyday use and I plan to buy more."
"I tried the Watermelon Serum by earthtoskin for the first time last week. It comes in a clear bottle so I can easily see the light pink serum. The directions are easy to follow and the bottle is easy to use. Just pump one to two pumps into your palm and apply it around your eyes, to your face and neck area. The serum has a sweet watermelon scent and is very hydrating and refreshing! It dries quickly leaving my face feeling soft and refreshed.I love that this serum contains vitamins and anti-oxidants that are good for my skin."
"The smell is amazing and refreshing. I love the feeling once it's on, as it keeps my skin soft all day long. I do not feel that it clogs pores or have any unwanted affects."
"I would prefer to have it thicker, as it is a little more runny than I prefer. I would like it to stay on my hand till use instead of running"
"This serum smells so delicious that I want to drink it! However, for being a natural product, the nice, but artificial scent doesn't sit well with me. The serum does feel nice on my skin, but it is difficult trying to dispense a few drops. Larger globs shoot out when I press on the pump."
This moisturizer absorbs quickly without a greasy feel. It also doesn't feel like it just sits on top of my skin. My skin and neck feels silky smooth after application. It also has a subtle watermelon scent that is very pleasant and not overpowering.
"My first impression of this watermelon serum was based upon the wonderful scent! The watermelon scent is so refreshing. I have not seen other skincare products in this scent on the market, so this is unique. I used this serum daily on my face, neck and around my eyes. At 41, my skin showed some improvements with this serum. It appears brighter and also hydrated. My skin feels soft as well. I'm definitely impressed with this product!"
"The Earth to Skin watermelon serum is the most yummy smelling serum I've ever tried! I use it in the morning to give me that healthy glow. My skin feels moisturized and refreshed. My face really needed something like this in these hot summer months when you need something to moisturize your parched skin, but don't want to use anything heavy. This is perfection. I highly recommend this serum! I can't wait to check out more from this brand!"
"This product smells just like watermelon, which is a bonus. It easily spreads onto your skin and absorbs quickly. It is not tacky or sticky and feels very light on your skin. It made my skin extremely soft and smooth all day long. My skin felt hydrated all day. It did not interfere with my foundation. I really liked this product a lot and will purchase it in the future."
"This smells amazing! It smells good enough to eat (but don't eat it). It is soothing on my skin and it hydrates well. The packaging is cute and the pump is easy to use. I am not sure how well it brightens yet because I need to use it longer but for moisturizing and hydration, this is excellent."
"While it goes on super smooth and dries quickly, the scent is far too strong for me. I feel like I just wiped a watermelon jolly rancher on my face. I think if the scent was toned down a little so it wasn't so strong and sweet, it would be a little bit better."
I am loving this watermelon serum . I like the fact that it refreshes my skin. I also love the fact that my skin feels so hydrated. I definitely can tell the difference in my skin . My skin has a healthy glow and looks brighter. This is a product I would highly recommend if your looking for a new serum . A +++ and also the smell is awesome and not over powering!
"This is the best! Not only does it have a great smell but it didn't make my skin oily or break out! I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this made my face so soft and feel much better after a harsh face wash. I've yet to come across a product that does well with my skin, but this is perfect!"
"I loved the freshness and fruity scent of this Watermelon Serum. I applied this daily and it kept my face moisturized and glowing for hours. A little goes a long way, so one bottle will last for at least a month."
"I enjoyed the fragrance. It was very natural. I also liked the consistency, it was not overly runny or too thick. I like the way it left my skin feeling."
This serum smells nice and the smell dissipates quickly after application. It sank into my skin well and left my skin feeling hydrated but not oily or greasy. I really like this serum!
"I'm in love with this watermelon serum! It makes my skin look dewy, bright and fresh. It also smells amazing! I love that it's cruelty-free and has solid ingredients. A really great skincare product! I would highly recommend!"
I really love this! It hydrates my face and leaves no sticky after feel. The best part is that it doesn't break my skin out. It has a nice light scent so it isn't over whelming.
The watermelon serum has a very nice scent and it applies easily to my face. The coverage is light weight and feels terrific. My face feels hydrated and smooth. I notice a definite difference in the texture of my skin by using this product.
Lightly scended(like watermelon jelly ranchers) I like it. It is super lightweight so I'd say it's good for combo and oily skin types but also nice on my dry skin layered with other products. Absorbs very well into the skin without leaving a film.
"I LOVED being able to try Earth to Skin's Watermelon Serum! The product felt great on my skin, absorbed and penetrated fast and left my skin feeling nice, clean and soft! I liked the smell too! Fresh and refreshing!"

"it was ok, i dont know that i would buy it on a regular basis"
I didn't notice any difference when using this product.
I loved how smooth this made my skin. It made my face glowing and plump. It smelt so good too.
"I use a lot of skin care products from drugstore to high end. This serum works very well and honestly can't see a difference between affordable (this one) and high end. Save your coin and get this, it's wonderful. Bonus is that it smells amazing. I bought this whole line of skin care products in sample size to try them all. From what I understand, this new line is Walmart's own brand, so I'm looking forward to trying them all. Good job WM!"
The product is wonderful! I would have given it 5 stars but the dispenser sucks. It's very hard to push down. You can't control the amount of product that comes out. You have to push it down hard and the serum gushes out.
This complete line is trying to copy Glow recipe. It's like the great value of glow recipe. They are okay products but do not do the skin as much justice as the original. Sorry. Coming from a skincare junkie.
this product is soooooo good! It feels really good on the skin and leaves it feeling so soft and hydrated. And the smell is amazing I love it!
