"The Clinique moisture surge is the perfect winter moisturizer. It relieves dry skin, and also feels great to use. It gives a really nice dewy look that you usually don't get in other moisturizers. This is definitely one of my go-to products for daily skincare."
"This is my very favorite, extreme dry southern Utah summer weather moisturizer!! I always use it before bed and any other time during the day when my face feels dry. Unfortunately, Clinique doesn't seem to be making this original Moisture Surge anymore, so I was super happy to find it at Walmart.com!"
I really like this. My skin feels so good and hydrated when I use this. Its visibly smoother and softer too. I am finally getting that natural glow back. It didn't cause any blemishes either which I always get nervous about when using a new product. I recommend this 100%. This review is being left in part to a collaboration with Walmart. My opinions are as always my own.
Great skincare product!
Great moisturizer that leaves skin feeling silky and not oily or greasy. Absorbs fast. Great under makeup.
Facial Moisture Surge is great for my very dry skin! Just one of the Clinique products I use daily! Daily...30 years!
great one [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the BEST moisturizer I have used! It feels wonderful on my face, and there is a very noticeable improvement in the glow of my complexion!"
It works well on my skin. It can provide the moisture needed where other products cant

It does help to keep the face hydrated and it is excellant to wear under as a primer under your makeup.
Wonderful item. Skin feels wonderful.. thank you Walmart. Please carry more Clinic.
This is awesome! My skin feels so much more moisturized!
"Does exactly what it claims, and the WalMart price can't be beat."
Clinique moisture surge is very lightweight and absorbs quickly.
Great moisturizing for at least 12 hours. Light and wonderful for sensitive skin--no scents.
Have used it only five days and already see a difference. Softer smoother skin.
