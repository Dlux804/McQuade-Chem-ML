"I have been using this moisturizer for several years and I find it to be very good. The CoQ10 is an addition I find helpful in reducing the development of small wrinkles. I use it daily, alone or under makeup; and I also use it at night after cleansing my face before retiring for the night."
It feels lightweight for my Uber sensitive skin. I used 30spf but wanted to try this and it feels good and lighter. This brand is the only one I can use that doesn't break my skin.
Its moisurizing and has sunscreen. Not heavy. And not too light. I have a very oily t zone and the rest is dry. And this stuff works great
"The product is fine, but the shipping took way too long!!"
I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product I have come across that does not break me out or make my skin red.

I love this product and have been using over 15 years. It is great for my sensitive skin and is absorbed nicely. Never looks greasy on. I wish more stores would carry it.
"I came to this web site to see where I could buy this. This is the best facial lotion I've ever tried and after a pharmacy merger I'm having a hard time finding it. I've been using it for years, and my face still looks just the same. I love the pump because it is so much easier to put on than the jar."
I've been using this brand for so long. I really like the consistency of the SPF 15 vs the SPF 30. I highly recommend this product.

I have extremely sensitive skin and I'm prone to breakouts with too much moisture and terrible dry skin without it. This lotion is the perfect balance! My skin has never felt better! I have made family & friends try it and every one of them has loved it and you will too!
"I've been seeing a lot of articles about using an anti-wrinkle cream while in your 20s and I decided to give it a shot. Thought to myself ""what harm can it do?"" Well I must say that I abolutely LOVE this product. I've been using it for about 4 months now and I receive a lot of compliments on my skin. The most I hear is that my skin has a glow to it and it's not oily. I haven't had a compliment like that about my skin since I was in my teens. I've recommended this product whenever someone mentions skincare. Seriously!!!"
"At 55, I can tell you that Ive tried just about every product on the market, in every price range. I have sensitive skin that is 'thin' and easily chapped and reddened and reactive. Not to mention tons of fine lines. I could tell a huge difference after first day of using this product. Skin more elastic, even toned and fine lines at least 50% gone! (more than I would ever expect from a topical cream!) I highly recommend Eucerin products. These folks KNOW what skin needs!"
I have been using this product for over two years and can not imagine using another. I have extremely sensitive skin and need to use a product that can provide anti-aging without causing inflammation and this is a total winner!! An added plus - The reasonable price tag :)
"I tell myself there simply cannot be a cream at this price that soothes, moisturizes, minimizes fine lines and makes your face feel plump and firm. I am 65 and have tried some pretty high end creams that did not come close to this one. I have strayed, lured by the next miracle cream promise but none of them deliver and I'm tired of spending a fortune when this cream works beautifully. The search is over!"
"I found this product a couple of years ago and will never use anything else! My skin is dry and sensitive. Most moisturizers for dry skin make your face feel thick and heavy. This moisturizer is perfect and wears very well under makeup. I actually look forward to putting it on my face each morning! It is hard to find in stores, but certainly worth the search, or ordering online."
"I purchased this item after trying a sample. My skin immediately felt hydrated without irritation and I wanted to be sure it was not a fluke. It is said that the average time for a visible difference is five weeks of use. I noticed a positive change in two weeks. I do not wear makeup and often am complimented on how smooth my skin is, the even tone and soft glow. Thoughtful research developed this product. Hello permanent skin care product!"
"I've tried quite a few products over the years (59 years young :) ) but there is no comparison to Q10 anti-wrinkle cream! After just two weeks, not only has the texture of my skin become softer, smoother, and healthier looking, this product has also diminished the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes. Sincerely, my friends and family have been noticing the difference already! It's clean, pure, non-greasy. I highly recommend this product, especially for those with sensitive skin. It really works!"
I have used the Q10 for Sensitive Skin Cream for many years. Love the product but disappointed that I am unable to find it anymore. I even asked the salesperson if she could order it for me and she tried but said they no longer could get it??? I see that I am not the only one having the same issue...Please bring this Priduct BACK!!!!
"Better late than never! This cream is amazing, it's rich without being super greasy and has vitamins, no oils, no parabens, fragrance free it's very gentle yet effective. I love it and its now a staple for me. My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins."
I have been using this creme for over 5 years. I am a redhead with light freckled dry skin. At age 57 people who I tell my age to can't believe it. At my last check up my doctor told me I look young for my age. Of course you also have to live a good life to look good. I eat a healthy diet and exercise often. I don't smoke or eat junk food. I limit the sugar and fat in my diet. I wash my face with water and no soap. Eucerin is the only product I ever put on my face.
"Been using this for years! I love that my sensitive skin tolerates this, it has anti-wrinkle properties, AND has SPF protection all-in-one product. My only suggestions for improvement would be to increase the SPF protection and make it more readily available. I cannot find it anywhere locally and have to resort to ordering online."
"I went to get the pump Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle for sensitive skin, but it's been replaced by a jar of thicker cream. I loved the lotion because it sank in immediately and wasn't greasy. The new product is hard to spread and feels greasy on my face. Not happy, Eucerin!"
Very good for oily skin. Absorbs nicely and provides enough sun protection for me. Doesn't make me look ashy
I get so many compliments on my skin since I started using this product. I do have a heard time finding the lotion though but it is wonderful because of the pump and the texture makes it easy to put on my face.
I have used this in the morning and at night for several years; I love it and my skin loves it. It is non-greasy and protects my skin with SPF 15. I never go a day without it and it is always beneath my foundation (which has SPF 15 as well).
This is one of the best face cremes I have ever used. I have used 20 plus jars and will continue to use it on a daily basis. I highly recommend it to anyone for any time of the year. Absolutely fantastic product!!!
I was looking for a moisturizer plus anti wrinkle. I found it with eucerin anti aging. The very best cream I have ever used.in noticed a a big difference on my face and I've only been using it for 4 weeks!! I'm very happy.
"Something happened within the last 3-6 months. This formulation is very different than before. The label used to say for sensitive skin, it no longer does...even though it is listed in the description on this site. For years I had searched for a sensitive skin face lotion with spf that would not get all gunked up in my facial hair. This new formulation does not absorb into the skin as well and sticks to my beard way more than the old product."
Great product for those with very dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a sunscreen NOT A MOISTURIZER as advertised by walmart.
I'm 53 with thin 'Irish' skin. This creme makes it look more plump and firm. I am going to send some to my mom.
Feels very light going on. No unpleasant smell. Absorbs very quickly. Not sure if this would work well if you have very dry skin due to it not being very thick at all. But I like it so far!
It moisturizers very well and not overly greasy. Works great when my skin dries out during the Winter months. No breakouts using this either. Shipping though did take awhile.
"The old q10 was amazing stuff -- thick, rich and smelling a bit like vanilla frosting. New version is slightly thinner, and has a nasty chemical smell. More importantly, it does not feel as rich or smooth on my face. I'm going to keep using to see if the results are still as fabulous, and if I can get over the smell and feel. Eucerin, this used to be a five-star product: Can you get it back to that?"
"This is the moisturizer I have been using for the last 3 years and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer is perfect because it is odorless and feels very light when I apply it. Another great advantage is that as soon as I started to use this I havenÂ´t noticed any new wrinkles or lines around my eyes and forehead, where I had already developed some. I also use other Eucerin products and they are also great."
Best product ever hands down! I refuse to buy anything else!
Product leaves my skin rather oily. I see no improvement in my skin's texture.
"Smooth, not greasy, very very very little scent. Love it!"
"Why does lotion contain alcohol?? If its suposed to get rid of dry skin, doesn't alcohol dry the skin out! Contradiction, don't you think"
I have used user in for the past 25 years. It is an excellent product. It's not greasy nor heavy. Protects from the sun.
I have been using this lotion for over five years. I am always getting compliments on my skin and I am 62 years old. I would recommend it to anyone.
I just found this product and am very surprised to find this rich lovely cream. I have a few wrinkles now and was looking around and luckily came across this. This product will now be part of my regimen.
"This is a very nice moisturizing lotion. It is not too heavy, blends well and leave skin soft, smooth and hydrated. My only disappointment with it is that it does not provide a broad spectrum sunscreen. Please consider making this with a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen, or, alternatively, leave the sunscreen out so this can be used as a night time lotion. The only reason I would not recommend this to a friend is because the sunscreen is lacking."
"Have been using this face cream product for years, i.e. the one labled for sensitive skin. Note that other users are asking the same question about the new packaging. Is this face cream the same formula for sensitive skin in new packaging????? Please respond,"
I always used the Q10 for sensitive skin but when I wen to replace it got confused because of change in packaging. (I didn't remember if used sensitive skin or reg but when I came home checked my empty jar and it was sensitive..guess not that observant) They both work same as far as I can tell but when this jar empties I will go back to sensitive skin Eucerin Q10 Would be so nice if these manufacturers posted there is change in product/packaging so I guess it is up to us to be more vigilant.
"Nope this one is not for me... I have an idea it may be my allergies and not so much the product itself. I do like the majority of Eucerin products so this was disappointing. However I like that it is fragrance free and not overloaded with a vast of both organic plants, grasses ect.& chemicals, although where I tested on my arm with in minutes I felt a burning and it did turn blotchy and I can still feel it even though I washed it off. I am actually too sensitive for this product but the Eucerin Original lines I can use with no issues, thankfully."
"I wanted to let this company know that I felt so excited to finally find a moisturizer for my very sensitive skin that moisturizes, keeps the wrinkles away, and does not cost a fortune. I use it morning under makeup and at night. This cream beats all those expensive brands at the department stores by a long way. I am 65 years old and several people could not believe my age. I do have one request for this company....which is to please make the Q 10 moisturizer in a larger jar....say a 3.4 ounce. I would appreciate it very much."
"I have very sensitive, dry skin. My face loves this product. I have tried other brands (mostly as it is hard to find in my hometown) and always come back to the Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle CrÃÅÃÂ¬me for Sensitive Skin. I stock up on it so I don't run out! Nice to find I can order it online!"
"As a female of 73 years, I've had compliments on how young I look. Some are from genetics but Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle creme has been really good for my skin by giving it a good moisturizing and keeping deep wrinkles at bay. Not much is needed as it goes a long way."
"When my doctor told me 15 years ago that I had Diabetes, he suggested I start using Eucerin Lotion and gave me samples to try. The lotions actually seemed to heal my dry spots and bits of eczema. Since I have extremely sensitive skin I decided to give the Q10 Anti-Wrinkle a try. I've been using it for 14 years now. I wouldn't want to face a day without it. I'm 54 and people guess my age at 32 :)"
I have extremely sensitive facial skin. This is literally the only thing that calms my red skin. Every other facial product I've tried breaks me out.
"I really like the way this lotion feels on my face, and I know it also protects with a light sunscreen (SPF 15). It .leaves my face feeling firmer and clear. I will definitely continue using it."
"I have been using this cream for years because it causes no problems with my sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly, unlike the SPF 30 version, and is non greasy."
"My 103 year old Grandmother uses this product and her skin is flawless and practically wrinkle free. She has the face of a beautiful 70+ year old, and that is something to brag about! I highly recommend this product too all women, and men."
"I have used this product for two months. By far the best product i've used. I have sensitive,dry skin due to my Thyroid problem. I have noticed my skin feels soft and non-oily. I highly recommend this product."
"Thought I would try this cream for night & boy am I glad I did! Does not irritate, fragrance free & makes my face so soft. Now I have another product to add with my other Eucerin favorites!"
"I've used EUCERIN 'Sensitive Skin' Creme for years and just LOVE it !!! I agree with the customer who said the company should advise when the packaging and wording has changed. It appears that Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme is now simply Q10 'Face Creme'. ...Are they EXACTLY the same, EUCERIN ??? ??? ???"
An inexpensive light cream with no scent. Gentle and effective for my face.
I'm allergic to everything but not this. The face lotion goes on light and absorbs quick. I love it. Highly recommend.
Have tried so many anti-wrinkle creams with poor results. Q-10 absolutely proved itself to me! Do not intend to ever use any other face cream!!
Non greasy and it truly works. My entire face has firmed up in just 1 week. It's truly great and gives me a nice healthy glow.
"This lotion has a strong sunscreen smell. It makes the area around my eyes burn, which I'm guessing is from the sunscreen. I wish they made one for sensitive skin without the sunscreen."
This is the only anti wrinkle cream that is sensitive enough for my skin.
Excellent cream! Great if you have sensitive skin and need help with fine lines.
Most people think I am in my 50s instead of 60s. Absolutely love this product!!
Eucerin is the only product I can use on my face without breaking out. Really like the Q10 lotion because of the added SPF.
A friend tried mine and bought her some!
