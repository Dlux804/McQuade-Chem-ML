"I've been using this night cream for years and occasionally try others on the market, but this is the best for me. I have dry, sensitive skin."
This does not make my skin feel oily at all. It is a thicker moisturizer but I think for night it is fine and you still can't tell you have it on. This is my first night cream but I can tell the difference between using this and using a day moisturizer. Will definitely buy again!
"I love this product, I've been using for 5-6 years as well as the day cream! They both are great products and affordable!"
"I bought this moisturizer before spending 5 weeks onboard a research vessel where I was doing work outside, exposed to wind/sun/seawater and then sleeping in a very dry cabin at night. I slathered it on after washing my face every night and woke up in the morning with skin that felt soft and very nourished. One jar lasted well past these 5 weeks with nightly use. I won't use another night moisturizer ever again!!!"
"La compre hace 3 semanas y me facino, la volvere a comprar."
This product does just what it says. Great moisturizer without greasy feeling!! This works great on my sensitive skin. I noticed a difference in a week. Skin seems smoother and fresher looking Love it! Love it! Plan on trying more Neutrogena products. Any suggestions for eye puffiness?
"I bought this three weeks ago, and my skin was fine. After using this at night every day since, I have been getting pimples where I haven't gotten pimples since high school. The cream is heavily fragranced, and I think that might be irritating my skin. All in all very disappointed. I had to throw out an entire pot of moisturiser!"
"Bought this in hopes for something for my face a night, used it for 3 nights not and all 3 nights my laugh lines, outer nose, and forehead are burning! Also my face is red about 10 min after. I've had no other issues with Neutrogena products, but, Do not purchase this!!!"
This product works very well for me!! I tried 2 other brands before this one and both caused breakouts. I should have stuck with Neutrogena in the first place. This goes on nice and soaks in fast. I also use the Neutrogena Naturals cleanser and the Deep Clean scrub.
"I have very oily skin, large pores and also rosacea whih makes it hard to use hardcore acne products. I have used every moisturizer out there and they not only clogged me up but also didn't really supply the moisture I needed. This product THIS is the only one that fits the bill. It doesn't contain any silicones is why it doesn't clog and it holds in the perfect amount of moisture without making more oil. I slather this stuff on it's like GOLD. Please don't ever stop making it. It's my holy grail of moisturizers."
"I don't know what this ""light night cream"" was... But this is honestly the best deep moisture night cream I have ever used, I love it so much I even use it during the day... It gives my dry skin so much moisture and makes it baby soft. it's my favorite!! Please don't ever take it away!!"
I use this product every night. It's thick and creamy without being heavy or oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this product because of the excellent reviews that I read. I was just looking for a night cream to keep my face moisturized. I have been using it for about three days now, and my face has been a little sensitive. Today, my face is burning so bad it feels like I need an ice pack. My eyes are swollen and puffy. I don't spend money lightly, and this was an expensive purchase that I wish I hadn't made. I use neutropenia face wash and I just assumed this would be safe also. Very disappointed."
I added this to my winter skin regimen and have avoided breakouts. In the morning my skin is plump and soft.
This burned my face and the only reason i am giving it two stars is that the moisture was good. I could also do with out fragrance in this product. I am not sure if that is what caused the burning or not. It really is a horrible replacement for the Light Night Cream. Please bring it back!
I bought this cream 2 days ago I am a big neutrogena sunscreen fan but this cream did not work for me at all I have a dry skin and no redness on my face the first day when I used it I felt like it was burning my skin yet I gave another try the next day it burns even more now I even see the red spots on my skin a big no no for this one if you are looking for a good night cream
I have been using this product for three years now and I just had to write another review. My problem skin loves this cream. I am 71 now and my skin looks great. Please never discontinue this cream. All the anti-aging products are too harsh for me.
"Felt okay. Made skin pretty smooth. A little greasy later but hours later so nothing major. But it clogged every single pore on my face. My pores are slightly enlarged and noticeable, especially on my cheeks and nose. Every single one of them had stuff I could squeeze out. Not good. Face was slightly red too (before I started squeezing too)"
This product burned the dryer areas of my face (my laugh lines around my mouth). I didn't think much of it at first but now its hyperpigmented because of the burning. Not sure what the ingredient is in this product that causes this but I see I'm not the only one. Think this needs to be reformulated
I was very disappointed to find out that the Light Night Cream has been discontinued. I have been using it for years because it moisturizes my dry skin and has no fragrance. I used the Deep Moisture Night Cream and had to stop it because it burned my skin. Please bring the Light Night Cream back. I really loved that product.
Ive tried this product a few times now and after trying to determine what in my daily routine could cause this I finally discovered it after spending money visiting a dermatologist and reading similar reviews on the website that match my symptoms. Long time user of Neutrogena products - this is the first to cause a bad reaction. Potentially the acid or fragrance in the ingredients. Odd to not have the ingredients even listed on the packaging.
"I have been using Light Night Cream for YEARS. Day AND night! Its all I use.I tried the replacement Deep Moisture cream and it made me break out. I don't want perfume or any extra stuff, just something nice and simple. It needs no improvement. It is absolutely perfect as is. PLEASE keep making it!!!"
"I've been using this for about three weeks now and am throwing in the towel. Every time I apply it, it stings and burns for several minutes. I've had multiple breakouts (unusual for me) and often wake up with itchy raises areas that look like hives. This occurs mostly along my jaw line. I can't find a full list of ingredients anywhere to see what's going on. I continued use in he hopes that it would calm down, but since it hasn't, I'm gojng to have to call it a no for me."
"I bought this a month or two ago and I used it every night the first week. It dried my skin out and made it peel. I even tried using it just a few times a week before bed and every time it feels like I'm sunburnt. Sad to say this cream is not great. I loved the night cream but couldn't find it at the store, so I tried this instead. Don't buy!"
"This made me break out after a few days of use...I can't use greasy creams, so I will have to find something out there that is light like their discontinued cream was. Why are you only worried about the bottom line, when there are so many people benefitting from a product that is hard to find otherwise??!!?? Keep the variety for a change!"
"As a woman surprised to find herself in her '50s, I'm always looking for good skin cream. I used to have oily skin but as I've gotten older I've needed to moisturize more. This I bought in the drug store, on a whim. And I couldn't be more delighted. I apply at night, and in the morning, my skin is soft and dewey...non-greasy. It just seems to absorb in. Good quality for the price. I wash, then apply this every night. I'm almost out...and will be buying more. Thanks, Neutragena! I used your products as a teen...and am still using now."
"I bought this product a week ago. Used it for the first time at night and woke with extremely itchy red blotches all over face and neck and raised, red, circular bumps. Face was flushed and dark red around eyes and eyebrows. Stinging, prickly sensation all over face as well. I have never reacted to a moisturiser before and know Neutrogena is a good name. What ingredient could cause this? Rash taking several days to subside and skin intensely itchy still. Please advise"
"This is the only night cream that actually works for my super dry skin. I use retinol a prescription which is very drying. I struggled to find a product compatible with my prescription. Out of all the products I tried, including expensive creams, this worked the best."
"This cream definitely don't work for me, I try this cream for first time, but I have a bad burn and rash, i little swelling under my eyes , I bought the day, night and the serum cream nothing work for me, now I have to wait until my face recovered to use my cream a use to use before !! I had to visit my doctor for that, I don't recommend this cream"
"I have rosacea so was leary of trying this product because of the negative reviews. I am so happy I tried it anyway. This is a great moisturizer for my problem skin. I am 68 but cannot use anything with retinol or alpha hydroxy which most anti-aging products have. They are a big triggers for rosacea. The ""Deep Moisture"" line is free of these. I could see a big difference in my neck in just a few weeks. Please continue this line."
"While I would recommend other Neutrogena products, I would not recommend this. It feels very nice going on, and appears it would be a great moisturizer, but it is causing red bumps on my cheeks and a burning sensation when I wake up. Unfortunate because of the small amount required for coverage and silky feeling going on. Maybe it is the fragrance, why does a moisturizer need a fragrance anyway?"
"I love this product and use both the day and night versions. The only negative I have is I would like to have the scent removed. I have very dry, sensitive eyes and I find the scent bothers my eyes. I used the previous day and night creams from Neutrogena similiar to these and they did not have a scent. Could the scent be removed and keep the excellent quality of the creams?????"
"I've been a Neutrogena fan and super-user since my mid 20s. Actually, I've gotten complements on my skin and always credit Neutrogena products. But this time, I'm afraid I have to agree with most of these other reviews. I don't have sensitive skin at all and never have, but this created such an itchy, scaly rash all over my face, neck and even ears. I haven't used it for three days but the rash hasn't fully departed. I really hope I can locate the old night cream; otherwise I'll have to switch brands and that's a sad thought for me."
"I bought this cream about 5 days ago, I liked the texture but I started feeling a burning sensation and itching; I applied it at night and next day in the morning my face is dry and itchy."
"I read other reviews with the same complaint , so now I am sure the cream caused this."
"I always use Neutrogena, I trust the brand, but this time it didn't work for me."
"The texture of this product is nice, because it's a deep moisturizer that isn't greasy after application, but the stinging after I apply is pretty bad. I selected this product because I trust the brand and it's a good price, but I wouldn't recommend because of how badly it stings."
My skin is super dry. I live in Las Vegas and I'm a former Accutane user. Pretty much nothing works. I had resorted to just using oil and 3 moisturizers at a time. I've seriously tried everything. I bought this because it's at a good price considering I've tried and used more expensive brands in desperation for my excessively dry skin. I used it at night and wok up with soft skin. First time in years. It's amazing!
"I had a hard time finding the light night cream, which I really like, so I thought I would try the deep moisture night cream. It felt cold on my skin and had a strong scent. It began to irritate my skin, so I washed it off. My skin still doesn't feel right. It feels hot. The form didn't let me say I use this product 0 times per week. I use the light night cream 7 times a week."
"I love Neutrogena products but this one really gave me a bad reaction. I wanted to get a good moisturizer since winter is around the corner. I used it after using my usual gentle cleanser and the next morning my face was full of little bumps and was itchy, red, irritated and stinging. Two days later my face is still messed up and itchy and I have large bumps on my face. I don't know what happened but please do a test spot before you slather this all over your face!"
I applied the cream two nights in a row and on the second morning woke up with a terrible red rash on my face and neck. It wasn't itchy but my hands were itchy. I stopped using the cream and one week later the rash finally was gone. Makes me wonder what toxic ingredient must be in this product to cause that skin reaction? Very disturbing!
"I used to use Neutogena Light Night cream which has no fragrance, but because I'm having a hard time finding it, I thought I'd try this night cream. It has such a strong perfumed-scent that I can't use it, and because I opened it, I can't return it to the store. I just wonder why Neutrogena had to add fragrance at all."
"I recently bought this product and didn't notice that it doesn't say ""hypoallergenic"" . After applying it overnight I woke up with itchy,blotchy, red skin on my face and neck where this cream was applied. Even after washing it several times and applying antihistamine cream my skin still hasn't improved much! Other reviews report similar results. Not sure if it's the alcohol or another ingredient in this product but if you have sensitive skin stay FAR away from this product. Disappointed."
"The first time I used this cream, it made my skin feel like it was burning and made it feel extremely tight. The next morning, I woke up to find my skin badly irritated and flaking. Later I noticed red spots on the areas that I had applied the cream. I don't know if it was just an allergic reaction, but, if you are thinking about using this product, test it out before applying it all over your face. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone."
"I purchased the day & night cream today, based on the brand. I have always heard that Neutrogena is high quality. As soon as I put it on tonight, the smell started to bother me & within 20 minutes, my skin felt like it was burning. Even after washing it off, my skin still tingles & not in nice way! I was very disappointed with this purchase & am hoping the store will give me a refund!"
I too am experiencing a burning sensation after I apply this product to my skin. I am concerned that it will do some damage if I do not learn why this is happening. Will discontinue use until I learn more about the product. It is a brand new jar too.
"This moisturizer seems so great as soon as you put it on, but after a few seconds my face starts to burn, and the next morning when I wake up my face is slightly swollen and very red. I wish that wasn't the case, because it seems like it would be awesome if it didn't irritate my skin so badly."
I started with the moisturizing day cream a little more than a year ago and decided about a month ago to also use the night cream. I experienced burning sensations Whenever I apply the cream and now I'm breaking out... This is not good at all NEUTROGENA... It's awful and it's causing me a lot of embarrassment whenever I go out!
My skin gets really dry from the weather and make up products. So this night cream really keeps me soft and moisturized and I love how it doesn't make me feel dirty. The only issue is it causes some minor breakouts on my face so I don't use it everyday
"I bought this product to help combat my very dry, sensitive skin and loved the way it went on. I woke up the next morning with a red rash but didn't think too much of it. The next night it burned going on and the rash kept getting worse. I finally realized it had to be the night cream and stopped. My face is still red and irritated. Hopefully it disappears soon."
I use many Nutrogena products and have never had a problem... Until now. I used the moisturizing cream two nights in a row and the day after the second application my entire face and neck broke out in red bumps. I take care of my skin and am frustrated by the fact that my face looks like it did when I was 14 right now! I have not used any other new products and after reading other reviews to try and find out why my skin was reacting I have come to the conclusion that it is this product.
"Bought for my teenage daughter who has dry skin (but not sensitive) and after using it for 5 days, her face broke out in a rash! How has this not been pulled from the market?! Wasn't there testing? It took at least a week for her skin to recover. I looked up the reviews online and there are plenty of reviews which state the same! I wish I'd read them beforehand, yet I would have probably figured the rashes were only people who had sensitive skin. The cream worked well the first 5 days before the rash appeared."
"I use Neutrogena sensitive skin products, always find them reliable and good value. Tried the Deep Moisture NIght Cream for the first time yesterday, just a small amount on my face, and in a few minutes I had to get out of bed to wash it off. The scent is very strong, and was too much for me. I'll be returning this product, find another night cream with less of a scent."
Great moisturizer! It looks like it would be heavy but once you apply it on your face it melts and absorbs into the skin. My face looks great and not greasy at all after applying! I usually just pat the moisturizer in using my fingers. I have combo skin and I am 26. This really helps with my dry patches (cheek area) and my oily skin (t-zone area). Very happy with this purchase. I definitely recommend it.
"of all the products I use by your company, this one was the worst! I only used it twice over a 4 day period and it burned my skin! I don't know what is in this product but my face itched, peeled and split something terrible. I took it back for a full refund and purchased. I purchased the triple Age Repair Night Moisturizer which I had used before but both stores I frequent was out of it. It has taken two weeks for my face to ALMOST come back to normal!"
"I love neutrogena! I have sensitive skin and have been using their products for over 10 years. I needed a night cream and thought that since this one claims to be hypoallergenic it would be good for my skin, however right after application my cheeks, above my lip and chin start to burn. Not a good feeling, especially since night creams are supposed to be soothing. Only neutrogena product that has done this to my skin so far"
"I'm NOT allergic to anything, but after using this product every night for over a week, I now have a red itchy rash across my cheeks and chin! I usually love your products, but this one is a complete bust. You would think after reading all these reviews about this happening that there would be more testing being done. Oh well, now I'm out the money I spent, have a jar of useless cream, and the only thing that I have to show for it is an ugly rash all over my face!!"
"I love this face cream, so happy to have found it. After grieving for 5 years over the Ageless Essentials being discontinued I've tried countless face creams but none that didn't burn my sensitive skin. This is very nourishing to mature skin and doesn't burn."
This is a good moisturizer that you can still feel the next morning.
I have used Light Night Cream for years with excellent results and am extremely disappointed to learn that it has been replaced by a product that is far inferior.
I use this at night and find my skin soft in the morning. I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the few products I can use. My face feels clean and soft not oily.
"I purchased this night cream last month and unfortunately, it doesn't work for me. Pros: it's moisturizing and doesn't make my skin break out. Cons: it makes my skin burn every time I use it and I don't like the fragrance."
"Only hurts when my skin is sensitive, but works really well! My skin is super soft and hydrated now, best night time moisturizer i've used. I love how it smells too! Immediately makes my skin feel hydrated."
Been using Neutrogena products for years and started with the deep moisture as I could no longer find the 'light' night cream. Experienced red bumps and flaking and also the fragrance is way too strong (that alone is enough for my not using).
BRING BACK LIGHT NIGHT CREAM!!! I used the Light Night Cream in the morning too. There is no cream in your line that compares. I am changing to Oil of Olay. Lost me as a customer!
Too bad. This cream is heavy and not very good for your skin. Way too heavy. The light night cream was much better for my skin which is a combination type. Will have to find something else. Why would you discontinue that obviously sell out a lot?
I am using this night cream as the step following Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser Creamy Formula. WOW! The combination is really working for me. This night cream does not make my face shiny. My skin still feels great the next morning.
"Purchased night cream about a week ago. Developed red burning rash all over face. I was supposed to attend a shower this weekend, but had to cancel because of this product. The rash is visible even under make-up."
"Why oh why did you put fragrance in this product? You'd think Neutrogena would know better. Didn't read the fine print when bought it, but just thought Neutrogena would be beyond adding fragrance."
"I like this product, that's why I bought it. I've researched night creams and this one serves my every need. The price however, is higher than three retail stores in my area. I will buy this product again, just not through the Internet. TP"
I absolutely love this night cream. You can see the difference on my skin the next morning and I have received many compliments since I started using this product.
My skin burns after use it just two days and there have many red spots. I like Neutrogena's foundations but after I use the night cream I am disappointed. It wasted my money.
"I suffer from chronic adult acne, and this product agitates my acne and causes breakouts. I'm sure it might work for others but not for my acne-prone skin."
"My dermatologist recommended that I use this Night Cream. She said it was better than the more expensive cream. I just finished my first jar without any problems, and am off to buy more."
"I bought this thinking because of the brand name it would be fragrance free. It's very perfume""y"" and I certainly can't wear it to bed at night. For those of us who are sensitive to scents, please put on the box that it has a heavy fragrance."
"I live in the high desert of N. Nevada and it is a very, very dry climate. I use this night moisturizer as day moisturizer and it is WONDERFUL. Consumer Reports placed this item number one on their list. I highly recommend it."
"I bought this product about a month ago. It goes on very nice, not greasy. The only reason I quit using it after a few nights was the fragrance is too strong. I've got a full jar that I won't be using. Wish it came in fragrance-free."
"I tried the cream because I have used Neutrogena products for a very long time, (35 yrs). I was very surprised when it turned areas read and had a stinging sensation."
"This is a really effective moisturizer. I would like to keep using it, but have learned that vitamin D3 is effectively absorbed transdermally, so I am wondering approximately how much vitamin D is in a teaspoon of this product? Thank you."
I bought thi a month ago and it has made my skin feel soft and young!!
Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this because my skin was dry and I needed something to soothe the dry, tight feeling. The burning and itching that replaced my initial symptoms is worse. I don't notice any perfume that others have mentioned . but definitely concur with all the negative reviews, this is an awful product."
"I wonder if the low reviews of this product are due to the soap, toner or combo used with this moisturizer as I've found it to be gentle and wonderful at keeping my skin hydrated. I use it as a day cream since I don't like wearing sunscreen. I live in a high-altitude, dry climate and need a hefty moisturizer in the winter. The scent is light in my opinion and the product has not irritated my skin at all."
"Used this cream for a few weeks. Smells nice and lathers well. Feels like a Vaseline/cream. I also used it as a day cream because the only difference in the day and night is the SPF ingredient. By the end of the day by skin would be a bit oily but it didn't make me break out which was good. As a health concern, it has BHT and a couple other ingredients in it that is a mild cancer concern. So if that's a concern for you I would buy another night cream. But overall not bad"
I have tried several moisturizing night creams. I don't like high priced treatments that promise things that aren't likely. Deep Moisture Night Cream has a wonderful texture that smooths out evenly. I love the fragrance. No stinging or burning. I'm a fan and the price is very reasonable!
"I have been using this cream for about a year now and I love how soft it makes my skin feel. A little goes a very long way. I have oily skin and most other creams felt heavy on my skin and made me feel like I needed to wipe my face off frequently, but this one is light and clean feeling."
"I don't have sensitive skin and have always used Neutrogena products. I could not find the night cream I normally use so I bought this one. After 2 days I woke up with red, burning cheeks. It looks like I have been out in the sun. I am not allergic to anything so I don't know what is in this that could have caused this reaction."
"I got an immediate headache when I put this cream on my face, like a stabbing pain in my eye. My skin felt nice, but I can't tolerate the fragrance. I like Neutrogena's Anti-wrinkle cream and thought this would be similar. I need a fragrance-free night cream."
"I absolutely love this product!! I have very oily skin especially in the morning and when I wake up in the morning, my skin doesnt feel oily it feels smooth and so so so soft!! I also love how it doesnt feel heavey on my skin and doesnt clog my pores and the scent is awesome!! Please keep making this product!!!"
"I am confused why this has gotten such poor reviews. This is a great product with a wonderful scent and has done wonders for my skin. Since I am turning thirty this year, I am a little more concerned with the health of my skin and I find this product to be everything it promises. I recommend it to anyone willing to listen and is serious about having good skin. I love Neutrogena products and will continue to be a loyal consumer/customer!"
I originally bought this because my store was out of light moisture day cream (I think this line must have been discontinued). I was skeptical. I have extremely sensitive skin. It's been 3 weeks and so far so good. My skin is very dry in winter and this is doing a great job keeping me hydrated.
I love this moisturizer. I have very dry skin and I haven't found anything better than this!!!!
I have very sensitive and oily skin and this product i have found works wonders for me. Leaves my face so soft!
I use a lot of Neutrogena products but this Deep Moisture night cream has a strong fragrance. What is it?
I am 30 now I have never had pimple or any other skin issues. But after using this my skin broke out badly! I am sacred to use this!
Bring back the night light cream! Repackage it into the hydro boost line if u have to. How many customer reviews have to say the same thing?
This product made my neck and face red and rashy and it itched so bad! Couldn't even hide it under makeup!! Horrible do not waste money
I love this product.I saw a difference in my face write away.I pair it with Loreal Hydraulic deep wrinkle serum.
"I bought this product a month ago and my t zone area has been red, bumpy and inflamed. I was wondering if it had retinal in it or some sort of acid. I DO NOT recommend it."
I love this cream!! Its non greasy goes on smooth. I have notice a big change in the dryness of my skin . I have fairly sensitive skin. I have had no issues with breaking out ...
"This cream is ok. It does go on nice, not geasy. Stings for just a minute but that goes away. Will probablly try something different after this is gone."
"For a long time I used your night cream and day cream. Loved them. Then, you switched to this smelly, non-effective cream that I am sensitive to--itchy eyes and it is not effective on softening the skin. I am so disappointed. I had a little left of the original and cannot believe the difference it made in my skin in just two nights and days. Please bring the original back. Sometimes you just cannot build a better mouse trap. I will have to look elsewhere until you correct this and put the original back on the market."
I guess Neutrogena discontinued their Light Night Cream which I had used for years and loved. Tried this and don't like it at all. Greasy. Guess I will have to find another brand. I don't know why companies discontinue good things - guess it's all about profits these days... disappointing! Lost a loyal long time customer!
"I was having a really rough time with a so-called ""moisture"" cream that I was using during the day. My skin hated me. Then I applied this cream. Instantly I felt relief and my skin regained its elasticity. I look forward to putting it on each night. It's yummy. I even like the scent."
"I got this when my skin was incredibly dry. After using it at night for a couple of days I saw an improvement and after two weeks my skin was nice and soft. I did not feel any kind of burning when I put it on, but it does have an odor, which I don't find offensive but if you're very sensitive you might. I was concerned at how much it was for a tiny jar but after using it for about a month now I think it will last me for a very long time."
"I didn't have the burning sensation as bad as some others described but I do definitely have some stinging and redness after applying. However, it does soak right into my skin and leave it really hydrated and smooth. But there are other products out there that will do the same minus the stinging."
"I have never had sensitive skin. Never had a severe acne problem. I tried this product because my skin was so dry from the winter. The first night I used it it burned and caused my entire face to turn red. My natural skin tone is tan, and I have never had a skincare product turn my face red. When I woke up, face was still red. The second night I used it my face completely broke out and I woke up with a rash on one cheek as well as 3 pimples within the rash. After reading other reviews I see this reaction is common unfortunately."
"This product is very moisturizing and has the same main ingredients as other moisturizers many times its price. Made of primarily glycerin, I'm not sure why it has so many negative reviews. It could be a reaction to the calcium chloride - not sure why that's in here."
"I would get annoyed at my skin because of how dry it would feel sometimes. I tried this product and instantly I felt refined. I felt like I was wearing a mask and its now coming off with the help of one of Neutrogena's cleansing products, the sonic wave and its deep cleansing pads."
"It burns, quite a lot... I'm gonna throw it away."
Just a waist of money.
Please bring back the classic Light Night Cream. Better than new version!!
Want to know what we liked about Light Night Cream? It was Light Night Cream. Bring it back!
I have been using for about 9 months now and absolutely love this stuff! Best ever.
Please take out the perfume. Dermatologist recommend I doubt it
Read an article that this was thickest best face cream in the drug store and the review was right!
I have used this moisturizer for 3 days and my face and neck are covered with hives.
Clean light fragrance not heavy on my skin but very moisturizing. A great buy for sure
I bought this last week and cannot believe how horribly dried out my face became in just a couple of days. It is a horrible product.
I have used Neutrogena Deep Night Moisture for a couple of years and love it. Really leaves skin soft.
"Purchased it by accident (meant to buy daytime), but love it! Not greasy, goes on easy, and face feels refreshed in the morning."
I used to use Neutrogena because it was great for sensitive skin. This product has a very heavy fragrance that caused an allergic reaction on my lips. I am still recovering weeks later.
I couldn't find my beloved Lite Night Cream so I bought this. I do not like any fragrance in a moisturizer. The fragrance of this is awful! I am very disappointed. A product can be good without fragrance!
This is a great moisturizer that hydrates my dry/sensitive skin at night and does not irritate it. Leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated in the morning.
Was okay. Used for a few weeks. Sometimes skin would get oily but no break outs really. Just concerned with the BHT ingredient. Switched to hydro boost and I love
I have used this product two times now. The first time I used it I thought my eye cream gave me a rash. I used it again last night and woke up with a terrible red rash all over my face! It is warm and burns a lot! I'm checking into ingredients.
AFTER APPLYING THE CREAM MY FACE AND NECK HAS DEVELOPED A RASH ON MY FACE AND NECK CAUSING A VERY BAD ITCH AND BURNING!!!!!..I SURE DO NOT WANT ANY MORE OF IT. GOING TO MY DERMATOLIGST TOMORROW TO SEE WHAT I MUST DO TO GET THIS CLEARED UP
I don't have a problem with the cream scent or rash after using this product but in the morning my skin felt stretched out and looked tired and heavy. I much more prefer the Light Night Cream and don't think will be buying this one again.
"Started using this product, felt a burn once i put it on but told myself that is was probably just taking affect and that it was normal, woke up the next morning face was completely red like a tomato. Product might work and make my skin feel better but totally not worth changing the color of your skin! Thats too bad...."
"I used Clinique for years and in my mid-twenties I noticed that my skin was very dry and my usual products didn't seem to be working. My friend recommended I try neutrogena and I love it! I use the daily face lotion, primer, tinted moisturizer and the deep moisture night cream. My skin looks great and it's very affordable."
"I have been using the light night cream for a long time but there wasn't any in the store so I tried the deep moisture night cream instead. I have dry, sensitive skin with slight rosacea and it gave me bright red cheeks. Fortunately, it faded but I won't be using it again."
"I have been a Neutrogena user for years and have used the Ageless Essentials night cream which I loved. Recently, I was unable to find that at several stores so I purchased this night cream. I noticed right away that it had a very strong perfume scent which made my eyes water. I also noticed the next morning that my skin felt like it had a waxy feel that did not wash off. I am very unhappy with this product."
I recommend it for people with dry skin. I like this product.
I use this cream on my hands. It really makes a difference in their appearance unlike anything else I have used. My hands just look so much younger.
"This product has been wonderful! It makes my skin very soft, doesn't make it irritated, and doesn't seem to make my acne worse."
got a terrible rash and redness...im a person who has always had very clear skin...since i started using this cream i've got a horrible rash which just isn't going...first time ive been let down by a neutrogena product
This is one of the only creams I have found throughout my years that has given me the moisture my face needs. I have severely dry and oily skin and this cream has helped to even me out for the first time in many years. Very happy with this product.
This moisturizer is currently suiting my needs where I presently live (climate: humid spring and summer). It soaks right in and is very moisturizing without a heavy feel.
This is the BEST moisturizer I have ever used. I am 40 and have used quite a few but hands down this product is powerful and feels like heaven when you use it!!
"I used to love nutrogena products. But this night cream gave me real bad allergies. After applying this cream next morning my face was all covered with small red bumps ,itchy and flacky. I really disappointed with this."
This cream would be fine without the heavy fragrance; it's almost nauseating. Also it burns my face when I first put it on -- could be caused by the perfume?
This cream has alcohol as the third ingredient so it burns as it goes on. Especially the lips. If you can tolerate the alcohol in this cream then ok but if you got sensitive skin like mine dont even to bother to purchase. The older night cream and day cream has less alcohol buy that instead. I dont know who thought that alcohol doesn't dry the skin and take away moisture effects in so called moisture creams need to go back to college and research why not to use alcohol in moisturizers.
"I used this for a week or so, but only on nights after I had been out skiing in bitter cold. At first it felt great, but within a week I had such a terrible rash and itching that I had to go to a cortizone cream, It took days before it calmed down. Neutrogena, I've always had such wonderful results from your products that this took me totally by surprise. In fact, I wasn't positive it was the moisturizer until, on whim, I went to this website and saw similar reactions. Where is your reseach/testing department?"
This is the best moisturizer I ever used leave my skin soft and my make glides on.
My skin is softer and not dry and scaly I was dealing with flakes and dry patches I clean my
"Tried this Deep Moisture Night Cream due to the extreme cold weather in the NE. I'm not allergic to anything, but this product made my face break out into a bright red itchy rash. Also, used some on the top of my hands and they broke out !"
"This product is non-greasy, and goes and absorbs into the skin leaving it soft and refreshed."
I have oily/normal skin and this product dries it out! I will be returning this as soon as possible.
