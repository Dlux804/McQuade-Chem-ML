I've used this night cream for the past year and I really like the regenerating effects. The color of the cream is the result of the astaxanthin in it which is major to the effectiveness. No fake coloring.
"I use this at night, and it seems to be very nice. I've only been using it for about a month now, and it seems to work very well. I can say there is no blatant smell to it, and it smooths on nicely with no greasiness or caked on feel to it. Just soaks right in, to where you could also use it for day time. Derma-e makes great products all across the board IMO. I have a different one I like for day time even better. Can't remember the name, but it comes in the white & blue container."
"I did not notice big difference while using this cream, but I like that it is natural, organic, and does not contain any chemicals."
