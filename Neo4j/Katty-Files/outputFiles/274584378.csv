then this is the product for you - can't beat it at any price. I am 74 and people don't think I'mo ld enough to retire!!!
"im 31, i have been using olay for 9 months now and i will not go back to my old skin care product, my skin tone improves my skin is glowing, radiant and more youthful looking, people often say that i dont look my age and blooming! and i know my skin is better than before.. i owe it to olay, im getting used to that comment! i love the result!"
"I have only used this for four days , product states....noticeable difference after 5 days. Glides on face underneath moisturizer. I have used other Olay serums and have been pleased. Trying this new product."
I have used this product. I use every night. Last for 2 monhs + a container.
"i was skeptic after trying so many other ones i saw on tv, this is the best. just wish came in pump bottle but love it"
"I have been using Oil of Olay for many years, the products are wonderful I am happy the way it keeps my skin moist yet non greasy. I am looking younger and younger daily and I feel great. I have my daughters using it too. I recommend Olay to women who seeks a youthful look while growing to a mello age."
"Love the product. Walmart price is lowest price around but whenever I look for it in the store, its always out of stock. I was glad it was available on line."
Seems like they could Package in simple squeeze tube or bottle instead of the pump bottle. Then we could get more product for the price. There is very little actual product in this small bottle. So it is more of a sampler of product. Product is soothing and feels good but does not seem luscious enough to fully hydrate my dry skin. I will keep using to see how it works over time. Other people seem to like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have just started using the Regenerist Micro Sculpting Serum. My face feels like silk after using it and in the morning it is still soft and silky. I love the product. I still use the Microsculpting cream every night and I am also using the Regenerist DNA Superstructure cream with 25 spf during the day now. I love the regenerist line!
"i use this serum in the morning before the moisturizing lotion and in the evening before the night repair elixir and my skin is so soft and it just glows...not to mention it has improved the look of crows feet, brown lines and smile lines. makes the moisturizers even better. you will see a noticeable difference immediately."
"This is the first age defying product I have ever gotten...it took me a long while at the store to decide on one and by george, I think I got it. I hate lotions, they make me feel so greasy. This serum is so silky I want to keep touching my face. I read the other reviews...a few people complained about the fragrance. I LOVE the fragrance, it's like aroma therapy to go along with the facial treatment. I'm going to use this every day, and I'll check back in to let you know how it's going. I have a feeling it's going to be great."
"I'm 50 with oily skin, large pores and a little sagging around my mouth. I was looking for something that would firm up my skin and help my minimize my pores. I wasn't able to use it long enough to see any results in firming up my face but what happen immediately was that this serum made my pores look huge overnight!! It also made the oil on my skin impossible to control during the day even though I only used it at night. Thinking maybe it wasn't the serum, I tried it again"
"I have tried all of the expensive lifting products, i.e. ROC, Estee Lauter, Max Factor, etc., but this, along with the microsculpting cream work better for me than any of the others."
"I love it, have used it for a while and have no complaints. The results are noticeable by myself and others. Costco has 2 1.7 fl oz bottles for $39.99."
"It tightens the skin around the eyes a bit. It's easy to apply, smells good. It smells.... shampooy?. I've only been using for about two weeks, but I would recommend to a friend."
"WAYYY too much perfume in it! Product goes on great, it's not greasy and absorbs really well! If not for the heavy perfume, I'd give it 5 stars. How about making it with a lighter, fresher scent...or no scent at all??"
"This would be a good product if it weren't so heavily perfumed. I have had to stop using it, as the scent is too overpowering. I was surprised to find a cosmetic with this much scent in it."
This cream has done nothing for my mature skin. Don't bother with it.
For years I have use this facial product there is nothing better-my skin looks fabulous.
The cost and the product quality are fantastic.
I have tried many serums. This is the best; gives you a great glow.
"My all time favorite, Keep my skin soft and bright, I feel great and beautiful all the time."
Used this product for 8 days and definitely saw a difference. Skin seemed firmer and eyelids didn't sag as much....Will continue use.
This is an amazing product that I've been using and have been so very pleased with. Walmart makes the price so affordable!
"It seems to be doing the same job that my favorite retinol serum did, and it smells heavenly! I really like it so far!"
This is great product. I could feel the difference in a couple of days. Looks and feels brighter and firmer.Thank you.
Great price and really goes on silky smooth. A little bit goes a long way. So far so good. My skin looks less dull!!
"Love this serum, it is too early to see any sculpting results but I like the way it makes my skin feel. At 66, I think I need more time to see any visible improvement. At this price, it is worthy of 5-stars to see at least some results."
"Well, they call it a moisturizer. It dries too quickly to get foundation on smoothly so I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. I usually buy REGENERIST. I think it works better for my needs. Neither lifts my skin any though."
"This product has vastly improved my jawline appearance in the short 2 weeks I've been using it, and it feels absolutely luxurious. Thank you SO much. I love OLAY!"
good product
"I'm 31 and I stopped my skin care routine 5 years ago after my first child. Recently I noticed many fine lines appearing under my eyes. My skin tone was uneven and much of my face is covered in freckles. Daily makeup to even out my skin was a necessity until I picked this up. Some of my freckles faded, and my skin tone is even and glowing. My fine lines are almost completely gone. My skin is smooth and wonderful not greasy at all. I don't want to wear foundation and hide my new glowing skin! I will never stop using this!"
"I have sensitive skin so I don't like any product with fragance. But this serum is very good for me. It doesn't cause breakout, which is a plus because my skin is acne- prone too. After I cleanse my face, I put the serum on in the morning . I love the smooth feeling and the smell of this serum.. I will try the regenerist cleanser next . I really love this product. will purchase again."
It is a great product..a bit pricey but I really is worth it. Try it.
I see a difference in my skin brighter firmer.
I have lost 128 pounds and this product has made my neck look like it has never lost weight!!
Love it been using it for a few years
"I love the way this product makes my skin feel. I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks and I can feel a difference in my skin and I have to say, I also see some differences as well. I will continue to use and am excited about the results."
I have used this product for a few years now so thought I should write a review. This is one product that I can say showed me a difference in my skin in two weeks. It is just a wonderful product and I will keep buying it. Thank you Oil of Olay !!
"I use this with the SPF30 Day Cream in the morning, and with Miracle Boost Concentrate and Micro-Sculpting Cream at night. I like that it has a similar feel to the original Regenerating Serum, and it makes my skin instantly look better. Only issue is that there are so few anti-aging ingredients in this now. This should be much more concentrated as it is a serum. If this still contained carnosine it would be a 5 star product. Overall though, I really like this product and would recommend it."
"I feel like a diva when I put this one. It goes on after I cleanse with the detoxifying scrub,and my face is so moisturized and glowing. I love it. Definitely worth trying. If I am leaving the house I usually add the ""total effects 7 anti aging moisturiser with tone correcting CC cream and spf 30"", they work great together! Remember ladies, more moisturised skin is younger looking skin.."
"I have been using your products for over 40 years and have loved them but over the last few years they keep changing the product. The last few years I have been using the regenerist regenerating serum which is light and not greasy and that was fine but now I can no longer find it in stores. I have the micro-sculpting serum and it is awful, after about an hour if I rub my face it peels off. I am so disappointed and actually looked into purchasing another line of skin products."
"I had pretty high hopes for this product, but it's not as good as I was wanting it to be. I think it's too high priced for the drugstore, even though it's a skincare item, and I really just didn't see any difference after using it. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to see my more detailed review I posted about it."
"I have known serums to be powerful and results noticeable. I wanted this to work for the affordability and it truly does have a nice texture. I don't know if it was my skin, the wrong product for me, or whatnot, but it seemed to have little noticeable effect over the 5 months I used it vs. more concentrated serums Ive tested. Liked the packaging- twist lock cap and size were great for travel and keeping my toiletry kit spill free, however."
"I have used this product for a long time. When I went to a lunch with former 'classmates' they all said I looked so good and then asked what skin product I use. I gladly told them of the Regenerist products. Also, my doctor can't believe I'm 80. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After my night regimen with Regenerist micro-sculpting cream, I'm ready for my serum. It glides into my skin - not just on my skin and prepares it with softness and plumps it up. I honestly can't do without it. My husband can attest to this because he always says, how pretty I am and how soft my skin feels. What woman doesn't want that from her husband!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum goes on so smoothly that my skin immediately responds with an inaudible 'ahhh'; but with an immediate plumping effect. Within a couple weeks of morning and night use I see the sculpted results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the cream for years to smooth and firm my jawline. I tried the serum with my last purchase as the cream was sold out (no surprise there!). It works just as great to firm the jaw and neckline. This product is my go-to daily and I won't travel without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love Olay products. I don't really see the changes on my skin. Every time I see my mom and sister they all say my skin looks great and better than the last time they saw me. Now they are all users of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Absolutely the best product I have ever tried... My skin knows when I forget. As I have oily skin the serum is absorbed without leaving a greasy spot on my pillow. Until I discovered the Serum I was not using any product on my skin at night as they were all so oily. This is by far the best product I have ever brought and I make sure I never run out.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for only a few months now as a ultra light weight moisturizer under the SPF and it is the best! So silky smooth and makes my skin feel so refreshed and soft right out of the shower! I very highly recommend this product to others!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This has become my go to moisturizer and it is not a bad price point and found at the drug store. It has many very health and anti-aging ingredients. I find that this is equal to many more expensive products. I have always trust Olay. I would recommend this product and others in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i've tried many, many beauty products and this one is simply the best of all. It makes a satin pillow for the moisturizer and foundation to sink into and look like no makeup at all. When i look back over the other products i have spent a lot of money on i just wish i had tried this one way sooner. The price is right and the product is great, can't ask for more than that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this. I use it every night before I go to bed. I have the eye serum. I have seen a difference in my crows feet. They have gotten lighter. My mom even told me I am looking younger to which I had to go buy her some. this product is amazing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Before this product touched my face I knew it was going to be amazing. It feels so light to the touch but packs some major power! It goes one smooth and absorbs almost immediately. It is my new favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using Olay Regenerest and am receiving compliments on my skin over and over. I travel to Jamaica 4 times a year, over 21 years to the same place and people constantly remark how my skin hasn't changed or hasn't aged. I can recognize false praise, but these are people who have known me all this time, and we speak the truth to each other. I'm a white, 71 yr. old female who loves life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this serum for several years along with a Regenerist moisturizer. I ran out and didn't replace it for a few weeks, but soon noticed my skin wasn't as firm. A few days after restarting to use it, the firmness was noticeably returning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love, Love, Love this product. Does what it says. In 1 week, my skin felt firmer. Follow it up with my Regenerist micro sculpting moisturizer. This is part of my daily and nightly routine. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being 48 years old, I was getting those fine lines and wrinkles. I truly tried so many different products, that did not work. I found the Olay Regeneration Micro-Sculpting Serum, and no lie, it works! I love this line of serums and creams. I use it daily. My fine lines and wrinkles have decreased immensely. I love the way my face feels and looks. Thank you Olay for helping us stay young and beautiful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would recommend this to anyone! It may not be what it was made for but...I have alligator/crepe skin on my legs right above my knees and on my chest. A friend had bought the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum and said that it helped hers, so I tried it for myself. In about a week or so I could see a big difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this serum under my morning moisturizer and my nightly night cream and I think it has aided to the fact that my skin looks tighter and more youthful than before I began. No matter what, it goes on first, and even if I don't use the other products, the serum is always part of my regimen!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been a faithful user of this product for over 10 years. I'm 73 and approaching 74 years of age. The product has truly given me a huge benefit. I'm told that I look somewhere between 59 and 60 ish. I use the Micro Sculpting cream as well for both am and pm. I'm hooked for sure and so grateful for these affordable products. Thank you so much.

"I have been using this product for about 3 years, nothing else compares. I'm 59 years old and most people think i'm in my mid 40's, I credit the whole regenerist line for my great wrinkle free line free skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the serum in conjunction with the Regenerist Micro Sculpting Lotion SPF 50, and I love the combination! It makes my skin soft, smooth, it absorbs very well making application of foundation no problem whatsoever! I love the combination of the two and will be sticking with it for some time to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Regenerist Micro Sculpting Serum is very light yet has a very deep moisturizing quality. It is light weight and non greasy, which helps it to absorb quickly. It also is light under makeup, which makes for an easier application of makeup and makes for a smoother appearance of the makeu p on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with this product (actually the Regenerist line in general). I use the Daily cleanser, Serum, Microsculpting cream and the Microscuplting nightcream. My skin has never looked better or smoother, I am actually confident enough to leave the house without make-up other than some lipstick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this a week ago. After 5 days, a friend said to me, ""What did you have done to our skin? It looks so much tighter!"" I was shocked! I went home and looked in the mirror! The only thing different I had done was use this Olay serum. It made the crow's feet around my eyes look so much better. I was so impressed by this. It is so inexpensive, too! Well-worth it!"
"I purchased this product at the end of last December, and I have to say I absolutely love it! I will definitely be re-purchasing it as soon as possible. It has made my skin so smooth & soft, my make-up looks flawless after using it for the past 4 months. I read a lot of people don't care for the scent. Honestly, I don't mind the scent, its a light scent and it smells nice! I recently purchase the pro-x eye restoration cream for my under eye problems, can't wait to see the results!"
"I just started using this product since the last month and I admit I do see results. You just need a little of the product and it gives you wonderful result. However, sometimes it makes my skin looks little white and leaves some white residue behind.. will appreciate if anybody can answer how to avoid that ! Also, LOVE the soft scent of this product. Please keep it. Regards, Poppi"
Excellent moisturizer leaves skin feeling fresh. Perfect for sensitive skin.
It is great stuff
I LOVE THE SERUM but after I just bought my second bottle of it it came out really crusty and since it was opened I couldn't even get my money back :(
I had never actually known a cream could be so effective I was so impressed and amazed I also had blemish areas and gradually removed and lightens.I love this product.

"I have only been using this product for a few days. I think that it does help with appearance of wrinkles pretty much immediately. As for long-term results, I have no way of knowing."
This product has been tested and compared to many products that were much more expensive and the Olay product won every time. It is more affective and it is at a price that most can afford.
"I have heard good things about Olay Regenerist, so I tried this serum. On my first application, I had to wash it off my face because the smell was so strong. If there is a fragrance-free version I would be happy to try it."
I have been through 2 bottles of this and noticed absolutely no difference in my skin. Disappointed for sure. I grew up watching my mother use olay products and her skin looked amazing.
"i will buy it again, it is the best product i ever had!"
