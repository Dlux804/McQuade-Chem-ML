"I have tried a variety of creams, and I found RoC to be the best. I like the way it makes my skin feel, and most people can never guess my age. Vanity aside, it really does work. I use all the RoC products for night and day."
I have been using this night cream for the past two weeks. I see more radiant skin. Also have gotten compliments. I am a 67 year old woman. I use to be a sun worshiper when I was younger and this really is helping with some of the wrinkles. I use the night cream with the day cream with noticeable improvements. I really do recommend. I will be trying the other Roc products soon.
This is an amazing product. It makes my skin so soft and I've never broken out from it. My wrinkles have virtually vanished and my makeup goes on smoother and smoother every day. Not greasy. Would highly recommend.
"I have sun spots that *nothing* has ever been able to shift. I've even had microdermabrasion without good results. Within 3 weeks of starting this product, my stubborn spots are fading away. As for the fine lines, I have to get very close to the mirror now to see them. Even the one on my cheek from sleeping on my side is becoming much less noticeable. I've already added in other Roc products to my regime and will continue to do so as I use up the much more expensive products I've been using."
I tried the 5 in 1 Restoring Night Cream after a friend recommended it. I have sensitive skin and was happy there was no Retinol in this product as it is irritating. I was very impressed after one night of using this cream. My pores seemed noticeably smaller and my skin looked brighter. I have been using it now for a week and every morning my skin gets better and better. This just replaced by old night cream.
I just started using this product 2 nights ago. I had immediate results. I have roscea and hyper pigmentation. The very first morning after using this product the redness in my face and chest area was seriously decreased. I'm 45 yrs old and have been in the beauty industry myself for 27 yrs. I have tried countless products over the years. I am just completely amazed by this product and I cannot wait to see what my skin looks like after the jar is gone!
"I've been using this nightly with & without a nighttime moisturizer and my skin feels very soft. So far, I haven't noticed any major changes but I haven't been using it that long. Only time will tell."
"I used this night cream for the first time and woke up with my face extremely itchy, dry, puffy and red. The itching was so terrible it woke me up in the middle of the night. My skin isn't overly sensitive, but I guess if you have even slightly sensitive skin STAY AWAY."
"I was very excited to try this product since i have some sun damage and was looking for a good night cream to help with that. It left my cheeks, forehead and nose very soft and glowing, however i have bumps on my chin that are drying out and peeling skin between my nose and lips. I don't normally have sensitive skin. Not happy for what i paid for the product and disappointed that it does not work for me but maybe it works for others."
"I have been using this product for nearly a year if not longer. I was very happy with the results, I have problems with skin sensitivity and with fragrances as well. Then the jar I bought about a month ago was different. It feels kind of whipped up, and leaves a film on my skin. I am not able to use it anymore. I am very disappointed. I wish you would indicate when changes are made to products. Then I would know I am taking a chance on buying something I cannot use - this product is not inexpensive."
"I have oily skin, but still wanted a good night cream to reverse signs of aging. I've never been able to use night creams because they all make me oilier and break out. This cream is amazing! It absorbs right in and does not make me oily. My face just feels soft after using it! Highly recommend."
I bought this product thinking it was going to make my skin feel hydrated and help prevent fine lines. The first couple of days were fine then by the 3rd day I woke up and have these red bombs all over my face especially my cheeks. As the day went on they got worse and turned into white pimples and itched! My skin was clear before with no pimples and smooth now I have to deal with this!!! Very upset on what this cream did to my face!
I'm one week in and I can definitely tell a difference with results of smoother rejuvenated skin in the morning! I have dry skin spots at my temples from a thyroid condition. I have been seeking a product that will smooth those areas and resurface the skin. So far I notice a positive difference of smoother skin.
"Since I've started using this (about two weeks ago), several people have commented that I do not look my age! I haven't heard that in quite a long time. My skin feels firmer and looks healthier. It smells good and goes a long way. I love it. Thank you!"
I used this product last night and woke up with tiny red bumps all over my face. I have been using ROC products for 10 years so this was a surprise. Face looks like it has prickly heat bumps all over especially on my cheeks and forehead. Dont know what to do to help it. Disappointed because I was saving money to justifiy buying it.
"This product makes my face feel nice. I have been using it for 2 weeks and see an improvement in the texture. It's no miracle cream, like all other face creams,. I do see a difference and like that I don't have to put on so many different face and neck stuff because this covers 5 problems. Warning, it does have a scent. It is a little strong until you become used to it, but I personally like the scent. I also use the day cream."
"I have been using this product for three weeks. The label indicates 4 weeks to see improvement. I began seeing results within one week. The blotchiness and dark spots are gone, my skin tone has evened out, and feels/looks tighter and firmer. My makeup blends better, and when I choose not to wear foundation, I can do it now with confidence. I have tried more expensive/more popular brands; however, those brans cannot compare to the mult correxion Restoring night crème."
"This is one moisturizer that actually goes deep into your skin, not sit on top in a grease pile! I'll be 65 here in a few days and people tell me all the time I look ten years younger. Can't help but think my night cream is the reason! I'll never be without it unless they stop making it!"
"I have very sensitive skin that is highly prone to breakouts and this product has not broke me out one time. I love it I have used so many moisturizers trying to find a good one that didn't break me out and I have found it, I see me using this stuff for a long time. Please never get rid of this product!! I feel like it actually reduces redness and scaring that I have from previous breakouts as well. A+ product all around for me :) I'm 27 now so I don't really have a problem with wrinkles but I'm sure it will help in preventing them."
The RoC Multi Correxion night serum - no spf (I can't use spf on my face) literally made my skin glow and look easily 8 years younger. It was my go to. I have searched everywhere for it. All of the other roc products are greasy and not even close to being as effective as the RoC Multi Correxion night serum. It is super disappointing. Now I have to pay almost triple the price at a very expensive brand name. Your company is horrible for booting this product.
"First time using any product and I am so Impressed with this Product. Used it only a couple of times so far and already see the results. I have fine line and a little saggy skin under my chin and After using this product I look as if I am 6 yrs younger, back to when I didn't have saggy skin or fine lines. I am going to buy this product for my close friends who also are seeing the fine lines. This would make a perfect gift for anyone. Thank you so much for making me feel better about my skin and face again!"
"I feel the fragrance is a little strong and I get a slight tingling when the product is applied, but I love the way my skin looks in the morning. I have pretty sensitive skin and have had reactions with produts in the past. This is not one of them, Very pleasantly suprised."
"I have been a loyal ROC customer for probably a decade. I will continue to use the 5 in 1 night cream, however, please bring back the Multi-Correction Night Cream that was in a tube. I would have given a “5” rating, but for me, the other works much better. Thank you!"
"As stated I am in fact a Grammie, age 65 yrs. I have been using this product nightly for three - four weeks with exceptional results. My skin looks and feels supple. I have received many compliments that I look much younger than my age and how my complexion looks so healthy. Thank you to Johnson and Johnson."
"I have just started to use this product; about two weeks. I have very sensitive skin and was so afraid the 5-1 night cream would break me out. To my surprise I have not had any breakouts and I think I'm starting to see a change in my skin. I am giving it a little more time. But, so far so good! I do not think the smell is bad at all!! I can tolerate the smell as long as the product is working for me."
"I've been looking in the mirror for the past week trying to figure out why my face looks different. It finally hit me that those deep, deep ""parentheses"" lines from my nose down around my mouth are almost gone! I look 10 years younger. I've only been using this product for about a month. I am very pleased with the results. My skin is more even and the dark spots are lighter. I am 46 years old and I highly recommend this product."
"I have used the 5 in one night cream for two nights and on the third day my face swelled and was burned. It feels so dry I hate to move it. As I am writing this I can feel little bumps forming, almost like blisters. Have used Roc products before with no problems, I have seen that others have had similar reactions to this particular product. My skin is not sensitive. Hope to get my purchase refunded."
"My new best friend! This is a light feeling product, so you don't feel like you are weighed down under 15 pounds of grease. It's great! Your face feels moisturized and smooth and clean! It also absorbs quickly. My skin is very dry, but this product makes it feel very good even when I wake up the next morning. I have noticed a more vibrant appearance in the morning, which is a very nice change from the dull look I had grown accustomed to. And it lasts a long time!"
"After 3 days I've seen a reduction in pore size and redness. My skin looks rested. My only complaint is the horrible old lady scent...gag! I just wish all beauty products had no scent, or all natural scents from essential oils, as perfumes give me a headache."
"I tried this product for two nights. The first night it was fine. By the second night, I woke up the following morning with very puffy eyes ( I made sure the product was not near my eyes when I applied) and the skin below my eyes was bright red. My eyes are very sensitive to any perfumes etc so I am thinking that the scent in the product caused my eye puffiness. Bottom line, if you have sensitivity to anything I would NOT use this product. I am into the second day not using the product and my eyes are still puffy."
"I have struggled to find a product that gives my skin a soft feel, I had puffiness under my left eye for quite some time within 3 days it has reduce to almost no puffiness which I am really happy to see so I think this works for me. No break outs or irritation either. Planning on trying some new stuff soon."
"I used this product for a few nights and it burned my face. I look like I have sunburn. My skin feels extremely tight, dry and itchy. I have now been searching for a cream to restore my skin. I just picked up an avocado cream that seems to be providing a little relief. I am extremely disappointed in this product. I was looking for a cream to help reduce wrinkles. I never expected my skin would look worse after using this product!!"
"I enjoyed getting to try a sample of RoC Multi Correction 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream for free. It was pleasant to use, and had a nice scent. I have used it for a week, and my skin does feel softer and smoother. It seems that some of my fine wrinkles have been reduced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this two nights in a row. After the second night, I awoke in the morning to find part of my face and neck broken out in a bumpy, red, itchy rash. I quit using it three nights ago and my skin is still bumpy and somewhat itchy. I won't be using or recommending this product!"
"I live in Puerto-Rico, where the sun can d some damage to my skin. I started noticing my skin sagging and age spots where noticeably visible. I started searching for products and I brought this one. On my 3rd week or so, I am noticing my skin is looking flawless. I am very glad I brought this product."
I was searching for a moisture and another customer recommended this product.And praised how well it worked for her.I have avoided moisturizer in the past s it tends to cause breakouts.But my face has been very dry and I am noticing fine lines.I only used this product once and already noticed a difference.The deep lines in my forehead look smoother and the fine lines seem less noticeable.I am looking forward to seeing the results of continuing use of this product.
I have spent so much money and time looking for a nightime cream for my combo dry skin. I feel it is comparable to the more expensive creams in quality. I'm only halfway through with the cream but feel it does improve the texture of my skin. I will need to use a little longer to see hownit works on my sun spots. I have my new favorite night cream without spending a fortune!
I LOVE THE WHOLE LINE OF ROC PRODUCTS! MY SKIN HAS NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD & IT'S WONDEFULLY SCENTED!!
High quality product. Excellent price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
great product been using for years good company and trusting sometimes people put fake products out this is definitely the real deal
"I used this product for 2 days, and it completely burned my face and neck. I'm currently itching and peeling, and my skin is visible raised and reddened. I returned it for a full refund. Ouch!."
After using this product I awoke with a burning hot rash all over my face. My eyelids were so swollen I can hardly open my eyes to type this. I would give no stars if possible. Terrible stuff!!!
This cream is okay. In general I like RoC products but I bought this one without noticing that there is no retinol in it. My own fault but that's one of my requirements for a good night cream.
I have been very disappointed with this night cream.
After two nights my skin was red and itchy in the morning.
It remained like this for a while. I have used Roc products before but not 5 in 1. My face began to peel like it was burned.
"I used this twice, and woke up with a face that was incredibly hot, red, and puffy. I'm very disappointed with it as my first experience with a Roc product."
Smooth tighter skin. Diminished pores and fine lines. Dark circles gone and even skin tone accomplished. Since it is winter in WI my face doesn't get much sun exposure. Good product for evening or night time use.
"I love all Roc products. Having 50 years of sun damage, this product has done wonders. Just wish there was more sales on the product. I would use it 24/7. Any chance of making a sunscreen?"
"I used this for just a couple of days and my face starting burning and itching awful. It took a couple of days for my skin to calm down. It's odd because I use the Day Moisturizer and love it, but the night cream is not for me."
I purchased this product to reduce fine lines and increase moisture. The only result I got was break-outs. I experienced horrible pimples and my face didn't clear up for about two weeks after I discountiued use.
"Used 2 nights and now my cheeks, forehead and chin are so chapped, dry and fire red. So sore I have vaseline on my face trying to get it to calm down. Will never use it again."
"These products were not for me, I guess my skin is too sensitive, beca use when I applied the night Cream, my skin burned and turned red. Will not recommend to someone with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My dermatologist recommended this product for follow-up daily nighttime use after a prescribed treatment with antibiotic medicine for Rosacea-like symptoms on my face. I was having breakouts, burning skin, redness and dryness. It has helped tremendously with keeping all these symptoms under control. It really has done wonders for me and I love it."
"I had lot of expectations from this cream after reading the reviews, but I was very disappointed with the results. I have been using this cream since more than one month . and every day in the morning ,my skin looked dark and very very dull, giving some dark spots . Initially I thought may be my skin is not used to the cream , so its reacting and over time it will work. But its still the same , I am discontinuing use and throwing the bottle away. Complete waste of money"
"feels great, must use consistently, reasonable price"
Bad reaction. Burning on face
Great product!
"Was a little disappointed, only used once but wasn't a rich thick cream. I probably wont purchase again."
"Has the color of this product changed? It use to be white, now its a beige color. Did the ingredients change? What color should it be?"
Saw a big difference in my skin on my face after only a few nights of application! I use this every night!
"I am loving the results I'm seeing after 2 weeks but like Jenny, I am having breakouts. I have two bumps on my face."
This is a great night cream. I have been using it for a number of years. It is light on the skin and does not clog the pores.
Been looking for a good night cream had one in mind but my sister said lets try this one so we did.now we are hooked we both love it will never buy any thing else.
"I use ROC products on daily basis. I actually bought the 5 In 1 night cream because the store was out of the other night cream that I use. After using it I woke up with my skin burned. My face was red, puffy and painful. My skin actually peeled like a sunburn. Needless to say I was very disappointed."
I love how it works feels Great
I love it!! Great product!!!
I love how soft and smooth my skin feels. It has never felt like this. Will definitely buy again!!
Top of the line product........must for anti aging
"I have sagging in the jowls and bought this creme to see if it would help. It does help firm sagging, but it is not a facelift in a jar. The key is continued use. The longer you use it the better the performance. It absorbs easily into the skin without a greasy feel and has a light pleasant scent."
"I picked this up at the drugstore after using CeraVe night creme for a while. I like the Multi Corexion 5-in-1 cream a lot. It is lightweight, as stated, and I don't mind the scent. It lasts all night, and I wash it off in the morning. So far, I'm noticing that it plumps up my skin nicely (I'm 64) which is all creams do anyway. Forehead lines seem diminished. It softens my skin and I have not had breakouts or issues of sensitivity."
I had read about the Hexinol technology in Roc restoring five in one night cream so I really wanted to try it. It looks like a thickish white cream but my skin drinks it right up. I wake up with my skin feeling refreshed and looking brighter. As it absorbs I do feel a bit of a tightening feeling which makes me think the product is working against signs of aging. I tested this product for free from the brand but that in no way changes my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream is an excellent multipurpose moisturizer. It hydrates while.minimizing pores and reducing the signs of aging. I use this night cream every evening now and the results are getting better by the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"this night cream is great! when you put it on it feels so nice , a little goes along way! It keeps your skin moisturized and helps with blemishes. I have blemishes and they are going away! I can thank ROC MULTI CORRECTION 5 IN 1 FOR THAT! This is my new Best friend! thanks again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've noticed a big difference since I've starting using RoC Multi Correxion over the last week or so. I'm seeing a major impoervment in my skin texture, and the fine lines on my face are starting to fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream through Crowdtap in exchange for my honest opinion of the product. I like how the routine of using ROC products makes me feel. I have not noticed significant results yet but I have noticed my skin looking rejuvenated and I will continue to use the product and hope for more results over a few weeks. Good product, I recommend ROC Multi CORREXION night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this for about a week and a half now. I can't see any change in wrinkles, dark spots or sagging skin. The moisturizing capabilities of this night cream is very good. My skin feels very soft. I will continue to use this and see if I see any results after prolonged use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using it for a week and I already love it! It goes on very smoothly and doesn't pull at my sensitive skin.. I love the way it feels afterwards very much, not sticky like other creams I've tried. I can't wait to start seeing a difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using another night cream, but not seeing or noticing any results. Since I started using RoC Multi Correcxion 5 in 1 Restoring Night Cream I can see an amazing difference in my facial skin and neck. My husband noticed clearer, fresher looking skin within days. My mother in law noticed improvements in my skin sooner than my husband and asked what I had been doing different. I can't wait to see the results after a month!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These were two very light weight products that did not feel greasy when applied. They left my skin feeling soft and smooth at night. I have notice less eye wrinkles and overall more hydrated looking younger skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this RoC multi correcxion night cream! It is very hydrating and leaves your skin looking vibrant and fresh. It doesn't make your skin feel sticky or oily either which is a huge deal breaker for me when it comes to creams I use on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It didn't make my face greasy or look oily...which has led to breakouts with other night creams. I've already started seeing results in just a few weeks!! I'm so excited to see even more amazing results with continued use!! I knew the greatest results would be seen with continued use so I went above and beyond to ensure I made this a daily part of my beauty routine. I know RoC will work for me so I made sure to work hard to use it every single day!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream makes my face feel youthful and bright. I love the way this cream mouisturizes my skin and makes it glow. I use it every night, and I wake up with the most beautiful skin ever. I love this product!. I would recommend this to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I don't think one week is ample time to see true results with the product. I do like the cream. It is weightless and light, but covers like a thick cream. I've not seen a vast improvement but do notice a smoother appearance. With more time I'm sure this product would receive 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night cream is very nice and doesn't leave skin greasy. It's not heavy and feels light on face and no sticky residue and no weird scents. It is great product and I can see changes in m skin is tone already in just 1 week of use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"it is a good sized product. it will last for a good while, which is a plus. and you don't even have to use a lot. it doesn't absorb too quick though so your face feels a little moist/sticky for a few minutes. i have yet to really see results although its only been a little over a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is amazing!! Over the course of this sampling, I was able to see the aging reversal already. My skin looks more fresh and revitalized. I really love the way my skin feels first thing in the morning. I cant believe there's a cream that proactively restores youth overnight! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far so good. I've used this cream about a week and have noticed an improvement in the look and feel of my skin. I love it and feel renewed. I received product complimentary from ROC through Crowdtap to facilitate My review. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm hooked on RoC Multi Correxion 5 in 1 restoring night Cream. I've only been using it a short time but my skin feels great and looks hydrated and glory! I have recommended this to friends and family [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved having the ability to add a night cream to my nightly routine. The RoC MULTI CORREXION 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream was very easy to use and apply which is great because I don't want a long ordeal while trying to go bed. It's a little weird but I actually really enjoyed the scent. Overall the experience was nice but I really didn't really see the results they claim. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream because its the only thing I've found that dramatically reduces wrinkles and fine lines while making my skin softer and glowing. Its so easy to use, and is part of my evening skincare routine. I've found that with continued use, my skin appears younger and more supple due to high quality ingredients that do what they promise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This comes in a small tube but you don't need too much of it! It goes on smooth and does not leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. I do notice a little bit of a difference since using it. I'm going to keep on using it to see how it goes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thank you Crowdtap for allowing me to sample another product. The first thing I noticed is that the Roc 5-in-1 Night Cream is light - it doesn't feel heavy on my skin. This product is perfect for me to wear in summer, no greasy feeling. I haven't used the product long enough to say it's really ""restored"" anything besides moisture. A light yet moisturizing product is important for my combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using RoC Multi Correxion 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream for several nights. My skin is softer and more moisturized. It appears to look brighter and more even-toned. I also notice I use less foundation because my skin is moisturized and isn't ""drinking it in"". I plan to keep using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RoC Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Restoring Night Cream is amazing. My skin has seemed to brighten up and everyone tells me how great my skin looks I wished I would have tried this awhile ago. So glad I have discovered RoC now I am a huge fan. I received this product on Crowdtap for free in exchange for my opinion and my opinion is my own.#Sponsored#RoC [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I noticed my skin felt softer and more elastic because it was less dry, but I didn't notice any difference in fine lines/wrinkles or discolorations. It really didn't live up to all of it's claims for me, but I've only been using it for a little over a week so far because I only got the sample then. So I really can't give the best review yet, seeing as the packaging says it takes 4 weeks or longer to see improvements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Cream has a nice scent and goes on and absorbs well. I received a full sample of this product to try in exchange for my review and opinions; however, I haven't had it long enough to do a full review and it's due now. Anyways, the short time I have gotten to use this product it made my face feel smooth and softer when I would wake in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've just started using RoC Multi Correction 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream. I received it in exchange for my honest opinion. First off, I love and trust the RoC product name and facial care line. This Night cream did not disappoint. The smell and feel of the cream is pleasant, not oily or greasy. I love that I can use it alone, or under my usual moisturizer. I paired it with my other Roc products. Although I have only used it for 2 nights I am certain that it will deliver as promised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Roc Milti Correxion Restoring night cream for 1 week and i see the difference.I use it before bedtime and in the morning my skin feels so soft.It absorbs quickly,dont leave your face greasy and smells so good. I definitely recommend thia product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RoC MULTI CORREXION 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream is an excellent product. The packaging is attractive. The cream has a pleasant floral fragrance. It absorbs into skin very well and does not leave a heavy greasy feeling. I applied the product at night and could feel my skin tightening. I will continue to use this product and will definitely purchase it in the future. I received a sample of this product for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was so excited to try my 5 in 1 restoring night cream! I enjoyed how my skin feels and the scent but sadly twice I've noticed my skin get irritated by it :( I don't think it's the product just that my skins been more sensitive to products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love RoC Products. They are always light on my skin and lightly scented. My skin always looks better after using RoC products! The RoC MULTI CORREXION 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream does everything it says it will do. My dark spots are fading and my skin feels so soft and smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great cream but not enough time to test out to see the effects. From the time that I tried, 1.5 weeks, it has shown to be good for my skin. The only thing that I noticed that I didn't like was that I started to break out more while using this cream then without. But Other then that, the smell is nice, the moisture it gives is also great. It doesn't leave my skin oily or greasy. I do recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream. I've been using it nightly for about a week now and the skin on my face and neck feel velvety smooth. I can't wait to see further changes over the next weeks - especially to the furrow lines on my forehead and evening out my skin tone more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using this product for a short period of time, but have noticed some pretty awesome results! I normally have darker circles under my eyes (most likely lack of sleep, part of mommyhood lol) but since using this the circles have lessoned, and I feel a lot more confident! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Roc, it is such a great product for any aging woman. I am happy I was chosen to participate in these samples of it. I hate the wrinkles that have come along with getting older even tho I know it's part of getting older, but Roc is making aging a lot better!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this is a complete night cream product so I don't need to worry about using different products . After using the product for a week my skin felt more hydrated , I didn't see any of the other benefits yet since I only used for a couple of days . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this stuff! It instantly made my skin super soft. It did not leave any greasy residue either. It absorbed very quickly and I did not have to use much at all. It has a very light, clean and soft scent. It is not perfumey at all, which is how it should be with facial moisturizers. The next morning when I woke up my face still felt soft and my complexion looked clear and fresh. I loved it and I would definately recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I used Roc Multi Correxion night cream and eye cream for two weeks. I have really noticed a big difference. My skin was well hydrated, my face and neck seems firmer and the wrinkles on my forehead looked diminished. I really loved these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream was rich but light at the same time. I felt like my skin was being protected but not smothered. My face, especially my cheeks, felt smoother.

I've only been using the cream for a couple weeks but I do feel as if my skin is smoother and I've noticed a slight changing in my skin tone. It's a very light cream and does not irritate my skin at all so it's good for sensitive skin. It has a very pleasant scent as well. I'm a fan of RoC products and will be adding this to my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been trying this product for a week. However, RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream had a rich and creamy texture. It makes my face feel soft and moisturized. I am anxious to see the results from long term use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream since I received it a couple weeks ago. I have not really noticed a difference in my skin. I do like that it feel light and not greasy. I do feel that it keeps my skin moisturized. I will continue to use and hopefully notice more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Hexinol is new so I'm not sure of the long term effectiveness of it compared to Retinol. The cream itself is a bit thinner than other night creams and has an almost lotion-like texture, but it absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn't seem to clog my pores. I think my skin does look better upon waking up and it feel soft as well. Time will tell if Hexinol will live up to it's promises, but so far, it's looking good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like how it felt light on my face and went on super smooth. I did not notice any discolorations diminished but I did feel like my skin was always well hydrated. My fine lines felt a little less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Whilst I did forget on a few occasions, it still worked wonderfully at helping to repair my skin.

"I like the whole overall idea of this working overnight, but the scent was a bit too strong. If it wasn't as strong I would've rated it 5 stars. It feels really cold when you apply it then goes in evenly and isn't greasy. I did notice my skin have that tightening feeling though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Silly, but my most favorite aspect of this Multi-Correxion 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream is the scent. It reminds me of being a child and smelling my aunties bathroom toiletries!

"To my surprise this 5in1 night cream was very light in texture and application. It was lightweight and not heavy or greasy . It was lightly scented, which I liked. My skin was smoother, lines and wrinkles appeared less apparent. I found that my skin tone was a little more radiant and the skintone a little more even. I used on my face and neck as directed. With a little more time I feel the results might have been better yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream every night since I received my sample and I must say that I am very happy with the product. It feels as though my skin has been rejuvenated and the restoring elements have taken a visible effect on the fine lines on my forehead. The scent is pleasant but not overpowering and the cream leaves a firm fortifying feeling on my face & neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
RoC skincare delivers results! I tried the Retinol Correction eye cream & the Multi Correction 5 in 1 night cream compliments of Crowdtap. The skin around my eyes looks softer and has plumped up. Reduced fine lines. My skin seems to drink up the cream and without irritation or break outs. I will continue to use these products. Love that they leave my skin looking healthy and smooth. Like that they are non greasy moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream is thick and moisturizes well without leaving a greasy feeling on the skin when used on the drier areas of my face. It feels really good on my neck area, which I didn't think was dry and needed anything until I started using this. This is really the only major change that I see and feel when using the product. My face feels moisturized but it doesn't look any different so I think it really depends on your skin type and what your skin needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel like my face was injected with so much moisture and hydration after just one application of RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream.

RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream smells wonderful. I have used it every night since I have received it but I really haven't noticed much change.

I have the driest and blotchiest skin ever. It also tends to be red when it is dry. I loved this night cream because it was like a drink of water in a bottle.

Light weight and hydrating. This cream seems to firm the loose or tired parts around my eyes while reducing pore size and smoothing my overall facial tone. My freckles seem to fade away also while using this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's my first time I try these products, I really liked the night cream if it helps me have very well moisturized my face and help combat dry side of my nose.

I applied this restoring night Cream right after washing my face. It was so light and smooth. The moment it touched my face it disappeared. The next morning I view my face in the mirror and didn't really see much of a difference. After a few more days I started to notice slight changes in some discoloration and dullness. I tend to have dark circles around my eyes and a dull look so this cream will be perfect. I'm going to give it a few more weeks to see how much more it improves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product. There is a very light scent that you can smell as you are putting the product on but once it was on I didn't constantly smell it. It left my face feeling very soft. It isn't greasy as your putting it on but it's heavy enough to know I have something on my face. I haven't used it long enough to know a difference yet but I'm hopeful :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Well, i've been using this product for a little over a week. It smells great, the texture is just enough to coat, but not too heavy, and it doesn't dry out my face. Do i see i difference in my skin's appearance? Not really. Does it hydrate my skin? Yes. If you need a good moisturizer, try this. Probably the best moisturizer i have tried to this date.

RoC has the best line of skin care products I have ever tried. The 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream has a rich creamy texture that feels silky on the skin and absorbs completely for soft radiant skin.

"Apart from smelling like I am wearing old lady perfume and the slight tingling I feel after applying, I like how my face looks in the morning after sleeping with it on.

I did see a difference in my skin. My skin tone looked more even and smooth. Its easy to just put it on and go to bed and not have to worry about timing it or washing it off. It smells good.

I am so happy to try this product and cannot wait a few months to see the final results. My skin already looks soothed and more even in tone and texture.

Love the way it makes my face feel .No one wants to feel like the have tons of make up on. The product blends nicely and offers a good amount of coverage. You can cover with a light powder and use in day too . I have dark circles under my eyes. I've tried several brands that also haven't worked. This cream is good at moisturizing my eye area. I loved this product! I was somewhat skeptical about suitable for all skin tones but it is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have never really used a product like this before so I was excited to try it. I am 30 and starting to get a little bit of wrinkles around my eyes and I have always had really bad dark circles. The products were easy to apply, the hardest was just remembering to use them. They felt good on my skin, not sticky or thick. After using it for a while, my eyes do look a little more awake, not so puffy and tired. I am exited to keep using it to see more of a change over time!

I would reccomend this product to a friend but I am not sure that I can give it an honest review when it says that it could take up to 4 weeks to see results.

I will continue to use this product as I do feel like it can work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Unfortunatly, I'm not a fan of the Milti- Correxion Night Cream. It works, but I think there is too much added fragrance. I also think its slightly irritating to my skin. I feel a little tingle on my skin for a few minutes right after application. I think if the cream is saupposed to be restoring, it should be more gentle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product has really made my skin feel better. My pores are smaller, my skin is softer, and it looks healthier. I've been using about two weeks and Even after just 1 day of using could see and feel a difference . Def would recommend. Also I did not experience any sensitivity issues or dryness.

RoC Multi Correxion 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream is a great product for my skin. It is light on my face and doesn't feel greasy or heavy. The scent isn't overpowering and the texture allows the cream to be applied evenly quite easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I haven't been using this long enough to notice dramatic results but I have noticed a difference in the way my skin feels when I wake in the morning. It feels so much smoother and moisturized than before I began using this night restoring cream. I am excited to continue to see improvements in my skin with extended use of RoC.

"I absolutely love the fact that this night cream isn't super thick and that the scent isn't overwhelming, it's my newest favorite skincare routine product easily and I would recommend this to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely loved this Product! I'm already a fan of RoC products so I couldn't wait to try the 5 in 1 nightcream. After just a few nights of using my skin looked healthier and brighter. I have major sun damage and the unevenness of my skin looked better. Loved the overall feel and smell of the cream. Didn't feel greasy or oily. After applying my skin felt soft and wonderful. Another fabulous product by RoC. I will definitely continue to use and recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't know that a two week time period is enough to test a product like this. I like the way that it's not sticky as some other lotions I've tried. It dries fairly quickly and does not clump up under my make up. I also really like how the eye cream is in the tube more than a little jar type that you diP your hand into. The one thing I was not a fan of was the smell. The face cream did smell good I must say, however, I don't typically like to put perfumey creams on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It seems to work but I don't think I used it long enough to see the full results. I feel I would need to use for a least a month maybe two to have a good feel for this product. I like how it goes one easy and smoothly. I received a sample for my recview [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a free sample from Crowdtap and Roc Retinol. These are my own opinions. I absolutely loved the 5 in 1 restoring night cream. It made my skin look younger after just a few days. It made my dry skin soft again. It also smelled wonderful. It had like a perfume scent. I love this product and will purchase it in the near future.

My only concern with this product is it is out of my price range! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's hard to review this honestly when I have only used it for about a week and a half - it says you'll see results after 4 weeks. I haven't really seen results but I plan to keep using. It is creamy and goes on lightly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was super excited to try ROC night cream before I heard good things about it. I used it at night after cleansing my face. It helps to reduce the wrinkles and fine lines and improve the texture of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not loving this cream, mainly due to the scent of it. I feel like it's a little too perfumery for me. When I apply it at night and am laying in bed that's all I smell, and has caused a couple of headaches. I really want to try to continue using it so I can see the benefits but I'm not sure that my nose can handle this. I know it's a personal preference and will still spread the word wi friends!

"I love this roc multi correxion 5 in 1 restoring night cream. I have used the night cream, it works amazing for me. It doesn't get greasy on your face and neck. Only after few days my skin is firmer and wrinkles and much reduced which I wanted. It has a nice feel going on and is unsented. I night recommend this product to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am giving it 4 stars because I have only used for about a week. So far my skin does feel smoother. Not so sure about the wrinkles and fine lines though. I also can't tell if the sagging has been helped. I think only more time will tell with that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This lotion is wonderful! The container doesn't look too big, but with how little is needed per application it will last several weeks. It works into my skin beautifully and smoothly. I love that it is made to work overnight, so I can take about one minute to use the lotion (max) and let my skin heal itself while I sleep! My skin truly looks radiant, and I know it will only look even better the more I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream is awesome. I've been using this product for only a week and see a big improvement to the look and feel of my skin. I'm anxious to see what this product will do the longer I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just start using this for a week now, I don't see a huge difference on wrinkle but I did notice my face feel more supple. Another thing I like about this product is this cream is not heavy and easy to apply also absorb fast. I have sensitive skin I always feel cautious for new skin product, but this cream really gentle and no any irritation nor broke out so I am very happy with it. I will continue to use it and hope it really can reduce some wrinkles on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got this cream because of my lightening brown spots. I have tried so many others. But, about a month later I realized my brown spots have been reduce by 80% in color and intensity. I got the night cream and that has enhanced the effect. I love this cream. It's very light weight but hydrates perfectly. I recommend it this cream and the night cream from this line to anyone.

"The cream is very soothing, has a light but pleasant scent, and a creamy texture. It absorbs well into my skin and doesn't leave my face feeling too oily. I have a feeling that it takes a while before one sees huge results as far as correction properties, but it is definitely moisturizing and feels great.

"Roc 5 & 1 multi correxion restoring night cream is great! It works great on my face, I apply it every night before bed and it has my face feeling very soft. The next morning, it's the same way.

"At first I didn't think I could use it because I had red blotches the next morning, but, I just used less and it didn't happen again. That first try showed me how strong this product is. Now I think after using it for 4 weeks or so when you usually see results I will have a significant difference in the before and after pictures. I already feel a difference in the touch of my skin, it's soft, smooth and just feels like silk. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"My first time using Roc Multi correction 5 in 1 restoring night cream, it's very light on the face, very great moisturizer. It also absorb very well and it's not greasy. I cannot wait to see the improvements on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream felt very moisturizing and luxurious going on. It made my face break out though, maybe because of the fragrance (which I try to avoid in skin products). After about a week of use, I haven't noticed any changes in my skin's texture yet. But the cream hasn't made my skin itchy or red, so that's nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can't say I really had enough time with this product since you are demanding a full report within the week. The package says results in four weeks. It hasn't been four weeks. What I do know is it's a nice feeling lotion that makes my skin feel soft. Other than that I don't know. I will continue to use it because I find nothing negative about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't say for sure if I love this or not, as I have not had a lot of time to try it out, but it does make me feel good to use it. I would say, I have to use my regular moisturizer under this to make sure my face doesn't feel dry, this is definitely not moisturizing, at least to me.

I received these products free from Crowdtap in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I dont have sagging, wrinkles or discoloration so I do not know how effective it would be for those skin issues. It does keep skin moisturized the entire following day after applying it at night.

After a week, my skin is definitely smoother in the morning, and I think my skin feels as well rested as I do, which is not usually the case. I wish it smelled a little better, but it does not smell bad. Just like an unscented lotion, which could be better. But other than that, this is a great way to end your day and relax before bed.

Ive tried tons of creams that supposedly get rid of fine lines, dark spots and decrease pore size, but ROC 5 in 1 actually does great! It goes on smooth with no greasy residue. It's very light weight but hydrates perfectly. I recommend it this cream and the night cream from this line to anyone. The price isn't excessive at all and reasonable for all the benefits you receive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this cream! The jar is an excellent size and should last a while. It has a pleasant scent that is not to overpowering. I notice a difference in the softness of my skin within an hour of applying. Each morning after use, My skin is softer, and less dull. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The restoring night cream is pretty amazing... I noticed slight results after two or three nights. My skin is firmer and more supple looking. It is becoming more even and I have a radiant glow. I think this is going to be a favorite, I don't notice too much on my lines yet but it says 4 weeks. I have no doubt that it will work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I absolutely love this night cream! I had been using Rodan and Fields Reverse to get rid of sun spots from 20 years of playing and coaching tennis. RF just made my skin red and didn't fade any spots. Within 2 weeks I have seen a major improvement in my skin all around. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am not a regular night cream user, but this product is amazing and I am definitely putting in my regular routine. It made my skin so soft right away, and in the morning it felt so smooth and my fine lines were less visible. I also was surprised to find that my skin did not feel greasy, which it usually does in the morning, so this helps my natural oil production. The smell is light and floral, so nice.

"I really liked this cream! The smell was nice and the texture of the cream was smooth. I didn't feel like it was too thick and it absorbed quickly which is nice because you want to apply heavy stuff in the summertime. I know the packaging says it can take up to 4 weeks for results, but I definitely feel like the skin on my neck is much smoother. I would definitely give this a try as I don't think you'll be disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Roc is probably one of the best products I've tried for my wrinkles. I've tried numerous other big brand wrinkle products and Roc is the only one that's worked. It has visibly reduced my wrinkles within the first week I've been using it! It goes on and it feels like I'm not wearing anything. It's great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Okay, I LOVE this product!! I swear I'm not imagining this, but I could see a difference from the very first night that I applied it!

I've been using it for almost a week now and i can't wait to see how much better it gets from here! Very impressed, very happy. Man, am I glad I got in on this sample mission. Lucky me.

My first night applying RoC MULTI CORREXION 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream I noticed just how smooth and soft this cream felt on my face. There really was no odor which I like in an aging face cream. The longer time goes on the better my skin feels and looks. it is helping with fine lines and I have noticed less dryness. I am highly satisfied with the RoC MULTI CORREXION 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Using the 5 in 1 restoring night cream has improved the way my skin feels in just the short time I have been using it. Most creams never seem to be absorbed into my skin and they leave a residue on the surface. This seemed to actually go into my skin and not my pillow, leaving me with skin that felt better than it has in years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I thought that RoC Multi Correction 5 in 1 Restoring Night Cream was very gentle. It had good absorption,and wasn't greasy or heavy. It does contain a light floral perfume fragrance. However it wasn't unpleasant. For a night cream,I was expecting it to be fragrance free. My skin felt softer after using it so I will continue using this product. I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels really good, smells good, and doesn't make my face break out. A lot of creams & serums do make me break out so I appreciate it when they don't!

"The 5 in 1 night cream hydrates my whole face throughout the night and evens my skin tone, the scent is mildly pleasant.

I loved trying RoC Multi Correxion 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream! It felt great putting on each night and I actually looked forward to putting it on. The only thing I did not like was the smell.

RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Restoring Night Cream is really fantastic but I would expect no less from ROC! It is light and goes on smooth and has a very light fragrance.

I have just started using the RoC Multi Correxion night cream and so far I am loving it. My skin feels much smoother already. The only complaint I have about it is the smell.

"I have always wanted to try this brand, but was hesitant because of the cost. I knew I was getting to the age I needed to worry about fine lines and early signs of aging.

It's not terrible but I rather it have no scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
