I have been using Swanson's Hyaluronic Acid cream after cleansing my face morning and evening for several years. We live in Colorado where the air is thin and dry. In the winter is even worse on our skin.
"The Hyaluronic Acid cream keeps my face moisturized and smooth to the touch. I am 75 years old, so that is really saying something!"
"This cream makes my face feel so much better than with just moisturizer. I put it on first, then sunscreen, then my moisturizer."
"THE PRODUCT IS WHAT I ORDERED. I AM SURPRISED THAT WALMART CARRIES THIS PRODUCT, AS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A RELIABLE MERCHANT TO ORDER. THANK YOU."
"The hyaluronic acid moisturizing cream is so awesome. It goes right into your skin and not only hydrates it, but it also draws in moisture while you wear it. And it's a whole 4 oz. not just 2! Thanks Swanson!"
just a little goes a long way and it is all natural
I had tried hyaluronic acid serum and liked it. So when I saw this cream on Swanson's website I had to try it. It leaves my combination oily/dry skin so soft and silky without any greasy feel. I use it in the morning as a moisturizer and as a night cream before bed. So happy with it!
"This moisturizing cream will take care of those fine lines. (Don't expect it to get rid of all your wrinkles, as nothing short of surgery will do that.) And it's a great value - I've used similar products that cost 4x as much. The only reason I don't give it all 5 leaves is because it contains vitamin A - probably not in a high enough concentration to have real results, but will make your skin sensitive to the sun."
"I've been using this for about a month now. Not sure I can notice any difference from the cream I had been using. It is absorbed into the skin almost immediately, without a greasy feeling or shine. They say it has no fragrance, but I am put off by its odor. Had hoped I would be wowed by this product, but I am still waiting to decide."
"I signed on today to purchase my second jar. I have used a ton of products over the years but rarely re-purchase. This product is awesome and worthy of more of my money. I use this day and night in winter, spring and fall and only at night during the summer. Product gives my skin a glowing youthful appearance... love it"
"I like it, the only thing that stopped 5 stars, it has a slight scent. I prefer everything odorless."
"Apply this, followed by Avalon Vitamin C cream (also available at Walmart) and a few weeks later you will see a marked improvement in your skin."
I am in my 70' s and have very few wrinkles now since I start using this cream and most people think than I am in my late 50' s or 69 's
rich but not greasy. absolutely no fragrance. moisturizes well. highly recommend. great quality and price.
Such a satisfying cream that melts into your skin! I've ordered more than once and will continue to purchase.
"I use this at night. Feels heavy at first, but quickly sinks in. My skin feel very soft and smooth. Wonderful ingredients. Great value."
Once I learned of Hyaluronic Acid and found this cream I'm hooked. It feels so moisturizing and rich. I have repurchased it. Good stuff!
I love this hyaluronic acid moisturizing cream. It has been an effective moisturizer for my aging and sensitive skin. It leaves skin smoother and with a better appearance than most other products I have used.
"I have not bought this product threw this company. But when i saw it on this web site .I couldn""t beleive it. I have been using this product for 4 wks now and the fine line are less notiices then what they were before. I use it all over my chest, neck, around my eyes, mouth. forward head as well."
Seems to be working well for very dry hands. Like that it is unscented.
It's a really good cream for my face I feel it working as I write this.
I purchased this product for my mother and she told me that she loves it. Now my wife wants me to order it for her.
"Gets absorbed VERY quickly, but might be a bit too heavy for warm climates. Works better when applied at night."
"I've tried many different anti-aging facial products in the past, most with mediocre results. This one is a keeper. It leaves my face feeling smooth, yet not oily or greasy. I use it in the morning before applying makeup and at night after cleansing my face. LOVE IT !"
Rich and creamy and a good value! if review is too short/sorry.
Love this moisturizing facial lotion as I use it under make up as well at night.
"This is a big 4oz, most are 2oz. Works for me. Also I first tried this because its an award winner in natural facial moisturizers."
"Once I decided to add a hyaluronic cream to my facial care regimen, I did some research before selecting this one; it turned out to be the right decision for me."
"I use this moisturizer at night and am very satisfied with its effect on my skin making it feel soft and minimizing lines. It is all natural and fragrance-free, light consistency and absorbant."
"I cannot say how bad this cream smells. I was looking forward to a product that did not have a fragrance. The smell of this product is worse than most fragranced creams. I purchased this on sale, so it is not worth returning. I will stick to using Swanson Cosmetic Science Brand--no fragrance, and no bad smell."
too greasy and it smells like stale grease.
"Having used this product for over 5 years, I am very pleased with it!"
"This goes on silky smooth, and leaves my skin moisturized. I wear it daily."
just another great face cream.
