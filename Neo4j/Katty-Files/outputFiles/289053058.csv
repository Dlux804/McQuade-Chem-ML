I like this cream. I won't say I saw big improvement on my face but I think it's nice for a change. I like the way it's absorbing. But again everybodys skin is different.
"Finally, after all these years, have found a moisturizer that actually works to fight against existing wrinkles while laying a good foundation against new ones...this product is loaded with nutrients, I have dreadful frown lines that within weeks have shown visible improvement. My regular facial cleaning/moisturizing routines have been followed by an additional ""glob of Jason Vit-E"" between the brows....this has resulted in frown lines fading w/no pore clogging, yeah!"
"It's affordable, unscented, works real well under make up (not heavy/greasy), and makes skin soft. I'd recommend it for an age!"
This is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. A little goes a long way. Great wrinkle prevention. Reasonably priced.
This product is wonderful! The best creme i have ever used. It is so nurishing and it does great work!
"I've been using this Vitamin E cream for several years, especially during the dry Midwest winters and it's a gem. I didn't think I'd ever liike such a moisture-rich lotion for my face, but I can't imagine starting the day without it. The pure Vitamin E also protects my skin from the harsh environment. An added benefit is that it's fragrence free!"
"A friend recommended this to help old scares lighten up, I just got it yesterday so I can't say, but my friend loves it!"
Product is not filled to the top of the jar. Like most creams are. Wondering why? Guess I can figure that out myself! Won't be buying it again!!!
"It's thick, heavy to apply, does not dissolve into the skin easily but rather sits on top so that even an hour later it's still there. I used a very small amount on freshly washed, warm face. This is totally unsatisfactory for the face. Perhaps on elbows and knees and feet it will be more suited?"
love this! I've gone thru one jar and ordered a 2nd. does wonders for my baby's cradle cap as well as my skin.
I love this creme and I have been using it for more than three years. It absorbs easily and smooths dry skin
Love this stuff. Quenches skin without feeling oily/greasy and doesn't have a weird smell. Texture is fluffy and lovely. Great for anti-aging and protecting against free radicals/pollution. Thanks JĀSÖN!!!
Seems to be working great. Use it overnight and skin is soft in the morning with diminished lines and wrinkles.
Have been using this product for over five years & find it an effective moisturizer in the dry Arizona climate.
"I've been using this cream for several years. Although I've tried others, this is the one I keep coming back to. It makes my skin feel so soft, and helps smooth the wrinkles on my face. Great skin cream!"
This product works well but it is sticky on your skin.
The skin becomes more smoother and feels great!
I have used many of Jasons creams and have been happy with them all. You can't go wrong.
it leaves my skin alittle greasy but it wont break me out nad the fine lines on my face got smaller.
"I've been using this for several years and love it. It has a smooth, firm consistency, and is totally non-greasy!"
I really like this cream. I use it as a night cream and it works really well to moisturize and improve the appearance of your skin. I used to use the 5000 cream by Jason's but this one is much better.
Best Vit. E cream I've used yet !
