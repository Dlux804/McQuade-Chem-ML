I used L'ORÉAL age perfect hydra nutrition and I absolutely love it! I am 50 yrs old and this product made my skin feel like I was in my 30s again! I can't wait to start adding it to my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's non- greasy very moisturizing for my dry hands. I don't use it on my face because it's too heavy but great for your neck and décolletage. It absorbs er quickly and has a nice scent. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I really enjoyed this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster to used and reviewed. I'm one of those people who have to see to believe.and I'm a believer. First time I used this on my neck I knew I will see visible results. My neck was so soft but at the same time it was firm again but not tight.my face my neck feels more soft and smooth..
I will definitely recommend and buy this again . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free from Influenster to try and I absolutely live it! I used it on my face, neck and hands and wish it came in a vat so I can I mmerse my whole body in it! It made my skin so much softer and added the needed moistire for this desert dweller. It had a nice scent and you can even pick up the subtle honey undertone. Of the three products I received to try, this was my favorite by far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal's All-Over Honey Balm is made to be used anywhere and everywhere. Winter has given me dry toes, dry knuckles. Etc and this product is what the doctor ordered! The scent is a sweet honey, which I actually like quite a bit. It's a good size for slipping into my purse or overnight bag."
I received this product free of charge in exchange for my review. Thank you L'Oréal and Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was provided to me as a courtesy for testing purposes. I've been using it on my hands. They're definitely smoother. A little greasy going on but absorbs quickly. Has a nice light smell. I would definitely buy this in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this in a full-size trial kit through Influenster & of the 3 products in my box, this was by far my favorite product. It's so lush, thick yet smooth as you spread it on your skin. I am using on my face & neck. The neck area has recently begun to get a “crepe-y” appearance that I do not like! My skin seems to just drink in this moisture formula & looks healthier, smoother since I began! Check it out for yourself. I think you'll love it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Oh this moisturizer is soooo nice! It has an ever so light scent of honey which I love. It more of a lotion than a cream but it's not thin or watery. It's smooth and silky and just glides on. I love how it sinks into my skin leaving it very soft. A little bit goes a long way too. I've been using this as my evening moisturizer and I'm very pleased with it. Thank you to Influenster and LOreal Paris for this free sample in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This balm is amazing. You can use it on your hands and still open bottles (I usually have to wipe my hands off or I can't open the shampoo). Feels silky soft and smells beautiful. I got this product free in order to test it, and I'd buy it in a heartbeat. New fave! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am on week 3 of using the All Over Balm and am so pleased with the results. After use my skin feels soft and smooth without feeling sticky. I had no idea the difference Manuka Honey could make. This has become part of my daily skincare routine. So glad I came across it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Many diverse uses.

"I received a complimentary full-size sample of this all over honey balm. I'm over 50 and I have very dry skin. I used it twice-daily after cleansing my face for several weeks and I immediately noticed a difference. My skin was smoother, softer and felt like it did 20 years ago.

The Age Perfect All Over Honey Balm is just right when you are on the go and want silky moisturizing without heavy oils. It smells edible and feels like silk on the skin. I think I will have to keep this Balm around!

"I received this product free for testing purposes. This is my honest and unbiased opinion. My hands are always dry and rough looking. I have my hands in water a lot and it is hard to keep them moisturized. I noticed a huge difference as soon as I applied this product to my hands. My hands felt softer and had a younger appearance. I love that L'Oreal lets you know on the box what to expect after one day, end of the day, and one month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the all over honey balm free from Influenster and I will buy this product over and over. Super light weight but moisturizes so well. I used it on my chest, face, and hands.

I received this product complementary from L'Oréal to try out. I have combination skin and my first use was on my face and neck. The product was creamy upon initial touch but it seemed a little heavier than I expected. Although it immediately soaked into my skin it left my face with a tacky feeling. After a few minutes I went ahead and added an additional moisturizer on top of this one. Although this one is not good for me it could very well be good for someone else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I may be overly-particular in my skin-care routines. I got frustrated and began making most of my own; however. There are products I find to meet my standards. Manure honey IS an excellent addition to May products, but not this one. I found it to smell like shampoo and to be slightly sticky. I didn't feel anymore hydrated or moisturized. All bark, no bite."
"This Balm is extremely moisturizing & doesn't leave a residue. I use it on my hands, neck & chest at night & toss it in my purse for hands during the day. Love that it contains antioxidants & manuka honey! A little goes a long way. Will continue to use & I would repurchase. I received this complimentary for testing. All opinions are my own.

My skin gets very dry patches during the winter and this balm helped immensely. I saw results after 2 applications. My favorite way to use this is on my hands!

I received this product complimentary and was not expecting much since I have been a devoted fan of a different brand that is much more expensive for 30 years. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and am still in shock at the value. This product leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. Which is huge since I just moved back to Wisconsin fom Florida after 11 years. Winters here are harsh and my skin is sensitive. Great product for any age!

I received this balm for free from Influenster. I like because it hydrates without being greasy. It has a pleasant fragrance- but the fragrance is strong.

"So I must say this stuff is the bomb... first thing I noticed is the fragrance. Not overly bearing but pleasant. I loved how it felt on my skin..no heavy oil feeling, very light but intense moisture. It lasted for several hours, however when combined with moisturizer it lasted the entire day, which was unexpected since I have mature dry skin oh and it did leave my face glowing. MUST TRY... I did receive this complimentary but my review is 100% honest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Could I get a family-size? I'm Honey and I'm into everything honey. But this product exceeds even my penchant for everything about bees. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling silky and nourished. I received it as a complimentary product in an Influenster Voxbox, but I'd buy it myself.

"This is my FAVORITE. Seriously. I have a fetish for lotions, lipbalms, handcream, etc--and I am beyond thrilled with this one!! I love the smell (it's yummy!) I love that it's actually *designed* for skin on both face and body. The tube is super--no ""over-dispensing"" by accident, and the texture of the balm is wonderful. I have awful winter hands & this balm is just magical. Quite possibly the best product I've ever gotten sent to review from #voxbox & #Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a full size item in my influenster voxbox and I couldn't be happier. It's not overly fragrant, it sinks in quickly, leaves your skin feeling very soft and hydrated. I just wish that feeling would last longer. Seems within a few hours, or halfway through the day, that feeling of softness and hydration is gone. However I do enjoy this lotion and I keep it on my desk and use it everyday. I do not like overly fragrance items on my hands, and this is not like that at all."
I have been using this for about 20 days and Ilove it. I work with cardboard and money amd my hands tend to stay dry. A little bit of this stuff on my hands and they are moisturized my entire shift. It smells grest and is light weight. Price is right. I received this complimentary from Influenster for reviewing. Thank you Influenster. #influenster

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I have to say, it's pretty good. A little goes a long way due to it being a thick consistency. My skin feels very healthy and supple after using. I do not like to use it if I am not going to wear makeup, however, because as time goes on it feels a little greasy. So I just wear it when wearing makeup and it does very well!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a light and creamy balm that I've been using mostly on my hands and neck. It has improved my severe dryness on my hands with application several times per day. Best part is the scent.

Since turning 50 a few years ago, I have been experiencing dry, flaky skin on my nose, as well as very dry skin on my hands. Not anymore!!!

Very happy with this lotion and between the smell and results I will purchase again.My only problem is that I will run out soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I need the extra moisture in the neck area. I love that it contains honey. Honey is said to be very good for skin and healing properties. I haven't had the product for long so I can't speak of continued use. So far I'm liking it and using daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this to write a review. For me this product is ok. I used it on my hands. It does have a slight fragrance. I work on a ranch so my hands are dry. I applied a small amount of product on my hands I would say smaller than a dime. It initially felt greasy. As I rubbed it in some of the greasiness went away. My hands feel slightly moisturized. Due to my face having oilier skin I only used about a pea size amount. It was slightly heavy but not as bad as I thought it would be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received mine as a sampler from Influenster. I wasn't as excited about this part of the regimen. It's a little thicker than my taste but also doesn't compliment the other Loreal products for skincare as I feel it should. I also feel it would be a great additive if it had wrinkle reducer since its supposed to be good for the neck and hands. Overall, I can say there's no bad odor and it does go on smoothly.

"The all-over honey balm is a paraben and mineral oil free, non-sticky moisturizer for mature very dry skin. That being said, mature I am but very dry on my face I'm not. I enjoyed using this on my hands since I wash them multiple times a day and need a good cream that will work to hold in moisture. This fits the bill, it does have a light fragrance that dissipates quickly. I received this from influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product from Influenster to use and provide an honest review. I've been using a week and it has provided a good moisture barrier against the winter elements.

I got this for testing purposes from Influenster/voxbox but the opinions are mine.
"Dry winter hands, always. In water every day, drier and drier. From the first time I used this my hands immediately felt smoother and softer! Even after all day of my hands being in and out of water they still feel hydrated! This is one of those products I'll have to buy. Im so loving it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just received this product in my influenster box. I immediately smothered my body from head to toe. It is such a nice thicker creamy texture and goes on smooth.

Got this along with the rosy tone mask and moisturiser in my influenster box and have to say this is my favorite of the three. If I just bathe in this I'd be fine. My winter skin is so dry it's actually painful at times. This made it feel better and when adding to the rosy tone moisturizer my face stayed hydrated all day.
