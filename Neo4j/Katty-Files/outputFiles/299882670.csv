"I've only been using this product for a week now but I already have seen much improvement in the suppleness of my skin (It's a facial and body skin product) and improved blemishes I have had from a couple insect bites, making them heal better and now are smoother in that healing process. I like it. Would, most likely will, use it again. The price is excellent, too."
"It's a must have! Huge difference after a few days of using it. I've try HA serums before but this cream is much better. It's big enough to use in the body and hands too. Plump and rejuvenated skin. I definitely recommend this product. This will be the only lotion I will ever need. Great quality, excellent packaging, and 16 oz!"
"This is quickly absorbed- It's a cream, so I was surprised it goes on easily like a lotion, quickly absorbed, slight scent-doesn't linger. Silky feel!"
"I - even as a teen - always had like ""old lady"" hands. I used to compare them to my Grandma's... I been using this about 3 weeks, already see a difference! :) My face is sooo soft also. Good vibes over here."
