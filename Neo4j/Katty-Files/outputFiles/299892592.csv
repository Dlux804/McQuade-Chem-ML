I started using this on vacation after purchasing the trial package. I love it. I noticed a difference in my skin in just a few days.
Very nice . Natural so no skin irritation . Great for sensitive skin
"Nice creamy texture that absorbs quickly and doesn't feel too heavy. Very subtle and pleasant fragrance. I have oily/dry, combo skin and this seems to work well for that. A generous sized jar that will last a long time. Excellent value!!"
"It helps with my dry flaky skin on my eyelid and all over my nose,also bought the cleanser and the toner...so far so good!!! A little goes a long way."
Please read ingrediants. This is not organic Non organic chemicals are toxic to the organs secreted thru the skin. I did buy the product thinking it was organic because of the marketing label but read all ingrediants
