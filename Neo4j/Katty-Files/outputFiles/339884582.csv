This product works great! It also arrives with a detailed book that instructs in how to use the cream and what to expect. Also included is the necessary tape to be used with it. I am impressed.
"Yes, it is expensive, but the alternative is taking the physicians route, cutting for biopsy, grafts and then hoping skin cancer never returns. It worked on several spots for me. You don't need much, it goes a long way. I highly recommend it!"
I gave this only 3 stars because I have only been using this for 3 days. The documentation says it can take 5 to 8 weeks to do its job. I will say this it is definitely doing something. I am using it on two Basal Cell spots. Both are opening up and seem to be breaking down. I was trying a much cheaper Egg Plant Extract that just seemed to hold the progression off but nothing like this stuff is doing. I will update as the treatment proceeds.
