"The customer who wrote a review about ""carrier oil"" was confused. Here is the definition of carrier oil: Argan Oil â€“ All About Argan Carrier Oil. Essential oils are tens of times more powerful than herbs because they are so concentrated. This means that most of them cannot be applied directly to your skin. If you want to use essential oils as a massage treatment then you will need to dilute them in a carrier oil."
Out of all the argan oil products I really appreciate this brand. I have very long blonde hair that the sun likes to dry out. When I use this oil it does not make my hair oily and greasy looking leaves it soft with a slight shine and clean looking. I only have to use a small amount. I'm very happy with this product
The Argan Oil is a wonderful natural moisturizer for your face and skin
Argan Oil is a wonderful natural moisturizer for your face and skin.
Great value and a great price. I use it on my face at night and it helps reduce the dryness and improves skin texture.
Argan oil very good.
"Amazing oil! It has a smoky type of smell, but I didn't order it for the smell I ordered it for the benefits it gives my hair, skin and nails."
Hair appears to grow quickly. So far its promising.
"I love argon oil as I have very dry skin. I am giving this 3 stars because it smells like peanuts. It's still argon oil and you can use it at night to get the same benefits. It's great for your legs, arms and face. When you pay the big money, you are paying for the smell. This works the same as any argon oil."
This is Argan Carrier Oil. I thought I was buying the real stuff but from what I understand it is mainly some other type of oil
