"I recently underwent open heart surgery. I am allergic to adhesive. The barrier had adhesive on it. My neck was dry ""alligator skin "". Itchy, red and swollen. All I had to trust putting on my neck was Olay Total Effects. In two days time, the ""alligator skin "" was gone and the itching had stopped. I am so amazed that I will not have scarring on my neck. I have used this product for years and hard telling what might have happened. Thanks to you, I feel so much better."
"I have used Olay Total Effects for at least 20 years. I always choose one with sunscreen. I put it on my face, neck and down to my chest every morning. My husband says I should send you my picture. I only use eyeliner, rouge, and lipstick, never face make up. I am an R..N. And know that the sun can be our worst enemy. So, Olay Total Effects helps to keep my skin moist and prevents skin damage from the sun. It's been great for me. I will be 70 years old this month. I thank you for a great product."
"I have used olay products for 15 years and get complments on my skin and is often asked what do I use and I proudly reply ""everything. Olay""."
"This moisturizer is perfect for my aging skin. It is thick, creamy and has a SPF of 30!! I have been looking for a good quality but affordable day moisturizer with at least SPF 30, and Olay Total Effects is perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for prevention for a long time. It doesn't make me break out (I have awful chin hormonal acne) and gives your skin a glowing refreshed feeling! Try it!
Been trying to find an affordable light cream with sunblock that does not get me to break out. This really is a nice cream that leaves my skin without a thick sticky coat - instead a nice glow and no breakouts. I have not used it long enough to see any difference with actually repairing sun spots or wrinkles but will write an update once i know. So far thumbs up.

My skin is very dry in the winter and wrinkles a lot without Olay 7 in 1. During the summer my skin is very oily but Olay doesn't make it worse. Yet at the same time it smooths out my skins texture.
I bought this because of the SPF 30 and thought this would be great to wear when I don't wear makeup outside but it smells strongly like suntan lotion. I would have been better off just using suntan lotion.
I use several Olay items and was excited to find a moisturizer with SPF 30. I have used it 2 times now and it seems to be very thick and is not a nice feeling on my face. I would not use this with makeup.
I love this moisturizer. It feels so good on my skin.
Great product for great price! Always buy at Walmart for the best price. I've used for over 15 years with wonderful results!
"I could not find the brand I had been using for years, and the woman at the store recommended this, I went ahead and bought it and oh my gosh! in a week I saw a change in my skin, my neck and decided I was going to stick with the product. Very pleased with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product very much. Had never used it before but I like the feel of it on my skin.
This stuff burns and tingles when applied. Waisted twenty dollars
I love the fact that's it's not greasy . A little goes a long way.
I would recommend this to all men and women
I have not had any results as of yet. Too soon to rate.
"Very thick and heavy, don't really care for it, only good thing is the spf 30"
"I am impressed by the product; but, did get in my eye and stung terribly bad!"
I love using
great product will take years of your face
I fully enjoy this product it helps my face and gives me the moisture that I need.
Loved the way my skin felt using it. I need something for wrinkles on my neck and affordable I can't afford Olay right now.
"Not greasy, but very moisturizing - they've come a long way since the very thick cream my mom used to put on her face! Love this product."
I have been using this product for 2 years and it has amazingly toned my skin and made is soft and supple. Will continue to use olay..
I am very impressed of this product it does really works on my skin. My skin feels so soft and moisturize and I've seen improvement or changes of my skin. Thank you Olay for this great products and to Walmart for selling.
I have been using this product for over a month. Each day my skin feels soft and it so smooth. I will buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Suffering really dry face due to weather and hard water. Tried multiple products for men specifically and they did not work. I decided to give this a try on the recommendation of my wife. It was wonderful. My face was no longer flaky and dry after one use. Plus after a couple days, I felt as if my skin looked brighter and as silly as it sounds, a bit younger, or at least more full of moisture. I would highly recommend this, and I am thinking of getting the night cream and go full in."
"So grateful that I tried this product. I have tried several others to help my skin get back to my youthful years, and this is doing it. My tone and texture of my skin is changing. This is a keeper. Thanks for the great skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have oily skin and I'm outside a lot, especially since its summer, so I was super excited about the ""oil free"" and ""fast absorbing non-greasy formula"" statement on the box. The first day I used it, I noticed how instantly greasy it felt on my skin, but I wanted to remain optimistic. However, day 2 kinda sealed the deal about how much I don't like it: my skin is so greasy, it actually feels more oily (I've had it on for about 6 hours now and it feels like I just put it on)."
"Love this, a little goes a long way,has little to no scent,glides on smoothly and really improves the look of your skin almost instantly not greasy and is ok in high humidity doesn't feel like it clogs up your pores Has become the one I will use forever"
I have used Olay products for many years and they have always been at the cutting edge of new anti aging ingredients which I love.This moisturiser feels light but full cover and has 30spf which is amazing for year round base protection.I would buy this for a friend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a physician so I'm usually skeptical of all these skin care products and their claims (such as that something with a melon extract or some other stuff has some sort of magical anti-aging properties, etc.). This product actually works and made my skin look better than more expensive department-store skin creams. I like it because it doesn't feel heavy and it provides sun protection."
"I got my hopes up for this product because of the great reviews and the price. After first using the product it left a very greasy feeling on my face, almost like it was just siting on my skin. It left my face shiny with a gross feeling. I used it for 2 months before I got a new moisturizer. It did not even have a very nice scent, it was almost chalky smelling. It did however have a good spf that did keep my face from getting burnt"
I love this product and it's a go to for my daily routine. The price point works in my budget although I wish I could pay more for a larger bottle at a time. I'm a face addict so I go through about a bottle every 4-6 weeks. #contest #olayatwalmart @influenster
"I do like this product quite a bit. It's got nice smoothness to it, leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple, however I feel that it has too much fragrance in it for my sensitive skin, and makes me a bit red and irritated. Would love a fragrance free option"
"Yes, I am surprised...it actually works. I like the fact that it soaks into my skin and doesn't feel greasy or sticky. Smells nice, not overpowering. Only used for a couple of weeks and can see improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The best moisturizer I have ever used! I used it about 4 years ago and stopped because they are way too expensive in my country, I have tried many along the way but finally I am back to Olay as my skin regimen and loving it. I love it because it evened out my skin and much more. started using it again 3 days ago and so far so good."
"I am really impressed with Olay's Total Effects 7 in One anti-aging moisturizer. I love the fact it has 30 SPF sunscreen it, yet it still goes on really light and doesn't feel sticky like Most SPF products do. I also think it's great that it helps combat the seven signs of ageing all in one little bottle. I think it's just perfect to take travelling as you can just carry the one item and have the benefits of seven!! I really can't wait to continue using it and see what the long-term results will be! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
When I first received my Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer I was cautiously optimistic. I have tried Olay products in the past that were very heavy on the scent. I was happy that this product was very light on the scent and didn't bother my sensitive skin. I used it faithfully every day and quite like it. It is a heavier than most moisturizers but I think that is based solely on the sunscreen additive. I am very happy with this product and would definitely purchase it in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really like this moisturizer. It feels great on my skin and it is non greasy. It smells okay too. I'm had a dry forehead this year, but I also have combination skin. It is nice to use a moisturizer that doesn't upset the balance and works to correct it. I'm not sure I have noticed any anti-aging effects, but I still love it as a moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This product has little to no fragrance which is what I like. It is a medium to light consistency so it doesn't feel too heavy on my face. It also make my face feel smoother and look a little brighter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Olay is a well known name among family and friends. I was really happy and fortunate to be given the opportunity to try out Olay Total Effects SPF 30 moisturizer. My skin feels a lot brighter and firmer. I have been receiving a lot of compliments on how I don't look my age. Felling simply #Ageless using Olay Total Effects SPF 30 moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried out the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF30 and was pleased by the results. The lightweight cream didn't feel too heavy on my congestion-prone skin and was absorbed almost immediately. The added benefit of SPF30 is a nice bonus, and so I used this cream as a daycream. This moisturizer did reduce the redness I have across my cheeks. Gentle and effective. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think, look there is a million creams to choose from these days. Some of them have worked some of them have made me break out and done nothing. I didn't breakout from this skin cream and I actually did notice a difference after using it for a month my skin texture is smoother. I like the spf level of protection as well. #bzzagent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was so excited to receive this Olay Anti-Aging Moisturizer. What female wouldn't be excited to receive beauty products? I am disappointed to say that I used this lotion for about 2 weeks and my face broke out in several small pimples. I took a break for about 2 weeks and then will try again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Out of all the 7 benefits, the only one I can really vouch for is that it is very moisturizing which is great if you have dry skin, but I have naturally oily skin so it left me looking oily slick by the end of the day. Aside from that, it smells nice, feels great and offers a good amount of sun protection. Would be a lot better if they came out with a version for oily skinned ladies like myself. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm not really that old so showing signs of aging has not really begun for me yet so I can't really tell if this cream has stopped those effects. However I love that it has SPF in it and my face definitely needs a moisturizer and this doubles as a sunscreen so love that! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The cream is very thick, very similar to sunscreen (and smells like sunscreen too). It doesn't feel too oily after it drys on your skin though, which I like, since oily skin really annoys me. Since there is SPF 30 included, that makes it better since I'm the laziest when it comes to applying sunscreen. Two-in-one! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like this anti aging moisturizer. It makes anti-aging easy. This is perfect for someone who is new to anti-- agining products. It does not make your skin greasy and it did not break me out. I like how this includes spf, but it is not the greatest to wear if you are taking pictures. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The Olay Total Effects moisturizer with sunscreen was just as I expected, another quality Olay product. It is very similar to the original Olay day cream/moisturizer in texture. The scent is very light and with just 2 pumps, I've covered my whole face for the day. I was impressed that my skin didn't break out after use since I have oily skin and the sunscreen would make it more oily. It was a great base for makeup, powder, your regular routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Very good product and it compliments my skin. It has been my go to moisturizer and i never felt more soft on my face. It makes my skin glow and and pores not visible. It is a must try skin care product. Worth every penny (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think I've found my new facial moisturizer. Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer, SPF30 is everything I've been looking for in a moisturizer, then some. I typically have combination oily/dry skin and this moisturizer works well to look after both of my skin concerns. Goes on smooth and covers well. Does not leave my face feeling heavy or weighed down. Oil of Olay continues to be dependable. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've used Olay products before and this one didn't disappoint. I LOVE a moisturiser with a good SPF and appreciate the 30 of this one. I find that often moisturisers over SPF15 can get a bit heavy and cause me to break out. This moisturiser did not cause any breakouts and did not irritate my sensitive skin in any other way. The only thing I would have preferred is if it were a bit more mattifying. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think that my skin is rather sensitive as I had a reaction to this product the first time I used it. Moments after applying my face started to feel a burning sensation, and I had to wash it off. I would not recommend this product to any sensitive skinned people. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer works great as a daytime moisturizer. It doubles up as sunscreen too - with SPF 30 added to this formula. It felt smooth and silky to apply and very light. I quite enjoy this product and will definitely use it. Overall, I recommend this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Still lovin the Total Effects Anti-aging moisturizer, bzzing with the girls at work, recommend it to both of them after telling them that I got it from Olay and Bzzagent for free to test out. Explained that I put it on in the morning before work, and that after its on, I don't have to worry about the damage the suns harmful rays will do to my face, and they have commented that the lines by my eyes have gotten much lighter. Definitely going to be one of my purchases (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product kept my hair looking clean and styled after 23 hours of labour! If that isn't an endurance test, I don't know what is! Definitely recommend this to my friends. Doesn't make hair crunchy like other hair sprays, nor weigh it down. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that this product is pretty good. Left my skin feeling soft and fresh. I use is almost every day before I leave for work. It is thick but easy to spread and seems to apply evenly. It smells ok. And the container makes for great ease of access to the product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really liked this moisturizer. It had a light sent that wasn't to strong. The cream itself did not feel heavy on my skin and did moisture my dry skin. I rearly liked how it was SPF 30 to protect my skin from the sun. I did not notice any anti-aging effects. It may take a bit longer and more uses then what I used. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone who needs ano anti aging moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've used Olay cream for years, but this is my first time trying total effects. The packaging is nice, it uses a pump, not too much comes out at once. I liked how my face felt moisturized all day. But, I found it felt quite heavy going on. I'm a fan of sunscreen in face creams but this one smells very strongly of sunscreen. Overall, it's a good cream for the price, but I'll stick to my current face cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I find this product is something that may help be preventative for lines and wrinkles if you keep using it. I currently don't have much to worry about now but it will eventually happen. I will keep using this moisturizer because it felt good on my skin and I feel like it keeps my skin properly moisturized. I can't speak for the anti aging effects but it is an overall good moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have tested this product for 3 weeks and have seen a great improvement in my skin. Its smoother and no dry spots. One thing i dont like is it doesnt soak into my skin very fast.. So i put it on at night only. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I'm not much on beauty regiments and nightly rituals, but I have to say I am sold on Total Effects. I put it on in the morning after I brush my teeth and it gives me just the right amount of moisturizer without feeling heavy and oily. In the month since I started using it, it has definitely won me over. I have never had particularly bad skin, so I can't really see the difference, but I can definitely feel the difference. The one dry spot on my forehead is gone :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product was great. As a fair skinned person, I always ensure I use a daily moisturizer with spf as part of my routine to protect my skin from the sun. I have previously used Olay Moisturizers and like the way they make my skin feel and the protection it provides. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to provide themselves with some sun safety everyday (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received the opportunity to review a real gem of a product. For one week, I used Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 and the results are terrific. My usually combination skin has no dry patches, is softer and actually has a glow. The before and after photos are attached. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'm loving the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It makes my skin feel hydrated and soft. I love that it has SPF 30 in it, as I hate having to put sunscreen and moisturizer on. It smells great and the consistency of the lotion isn't to thick, it goes on very smooth. I would buy this again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I didn't like the texture of this face cream. I thought one pump was way to much and is very thick. It makes your face white if not blended in properly. I will continue to use it to see the end results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love the Olay Total Effects anti aging moisturizer. I am mid 30's and was noticing some changed in my skin and thought i would try this product out through BZZZagent. I love the product and how it feels on my skin. It has now replaced my lotion routine and goes under my makeup. It also makes my face less dry and not too oily as the day goes on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I would probably buy it again. Enjoyed this product a lot, but I wouldn't say it's the best out there. The smell is nice and the texture is great, not thick and not greasy. It does what it's supposed to do, but didn't wow me. I'll probably keep looking for something as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried the Olay cream and was sadly disappointed. I felt the cream was too heavy for my face and I did not like the way it felt.I like a light cream that glides on my face and I can just forget about.Sorry Olay fans;I wanted to wash this off within 15 min.I did like the 30 spf protection.I did encourage a few friends to try it.I did not notice any difference in my fine lines.I really wanted to promote this product but after using it I know it is not for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using Olay total effects Anti-Aging moisturizer and sun screen and found it worked really well. It went on more like a sunscreen, heavy feeling would have liked it to feel more like a lotion but my face did not burn all summer which is great as I spend a great deal of time working outside. I liked how it was an Spf of 30, but did not notice a younger looking face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have noticed I have softer smoother skin. The SPF has kept my skin from receiving any more sun damage or burn. I have even noticed some of my wrinkles are softer and not as defined. I will definitely continue to use this product after my free sample bottle is gone! Great product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love this cream! Olays total effects is my go to after every shower or face wash. It makes my skin feel smooth and moisturizer. After only 4 weeks I'm very happy. Looking forward to feeling and seeing the results of continued use! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I currently use total effects anti aging and absolutely love it. I was curious to try this because I would like to have some sun protection but the addition of the sunscreen seems to have made this cream a little too thick for me. Don't get me wrong it's still very fluffy and mousse-y but my face is very sensitive to creams so this didn't work for me. I have a dry face that gets pretty oily as the day goes. I'm going to stick to the total effects without sunscreen for now (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The lotion glides on smooth and does not feel heavy, which is nice. I love that it has an SPF30! Unfortunately, applying foundation/cover up over top of the lotion results in some cakiness. My makeup sort of off the way an eraser crumbles. Odd. Overall it's a great moisturizer if you are not looking to wear makeup over top. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer is amazing! Not only does it go on smooth and non oily, my skin stays soft all day long. It takes very little product to cover and I love that it has sun protection at the same time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product worked as well as I thought it would. Olay usually always puts out good products. And this one didn't disappoint. Leaves skin soft and smooth. Wrinkles start disappearing almost right away. Makes skin seem younger, lighter and brighter. You look refreshed. I will buy in the near future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is a great moisturizer. I found it to be really lightweight with a non-greasy feel to the touch. The sunscreen is an added bonus for sure. It made my skin feel really light and extremely soft. Would recommend it to anyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Initially the moisturizer is thick when applying, but it soaks in and my skin feels hydrated and healthy. I like that this little moisturizer works hard behind the scenes as a sunscreen, enhancing my skin brightness and minimizing the appearance of pores. My skin doesn't get greasy or oily or feel cakey, even after applying makeup over my moisturizer. Would recommend to a friend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I found this moisturizer to be perfect for my skin type. I have somewhat sensitive skin and need to use high quality products. It didn't leave any residue, left my skin soft and blemish free. It is a light moisturizer which is much better than those heavy ones that don't allow your skin to breath. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was really wanting to like this product, however I found it too heavy to be worn under makeup. Almost felt like it should be a night cream. It also made me massively breakout. I do appreciate the SPF 30, love the pump, and the instant glow it gave me upon application. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"4 out of 5 stars simply because one day while caught in the rain the moisterizer got in my eyes and it stung! Otherwise, great product. Leaves my skin feeling soft, and isn't so thick that it makes me breakout. Would definitely recommend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"really love this cream , it really works. After using this cream over 3 weeks ,I can say that this cream is the best thing happened to me in 2016 ,I do noticed a difference in my skin look ,the fine lines is much better than before,my face look brighter &healthy than ever ,I love it .

"I work as a welder so I work in very harsh conditions and I'm exposed to a lot of UV, so I was very excited to try this product. I'm also about to turn 36 and would like to get a jump on the skin care regimen to avoid wrinkles. I really like the Olay total effect moisturizer. It is thick and rich and creamy. It took a while to learn not to pump too much out, but that's really the only downside. I haven't noticed more youthful skin, but I definitely feel protected with the SPF 30 (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I found that this cream felt a little heavier in comparison to the Olay total effects without sunscreen(which I have tried before). This cream smells like unscented sunscreen to me, nothing overpowering, and the scent dissipates quickly. I was a little worried that it may make my skin greasy over the day (especially during the summer months), but it seemed to absorb nicely. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the cream really does deliver what it says it would. I have been using it for 3 weeks, twice a day, and I can definitely see a different. My skin is tighter and my face more luminous. The pores are also less visible. It is a rich cream so not a lot is needed and so lasts for a pretty long time I would say. It also has a pleasant smell and feels luxurious. The packaging is appealing and the cream is easy to ""access"". I would definitely recommend it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling healthier and softer, without the greasy feeling you get from some moisturizers. Its easy to apply and blends in smoothly. I will definitely keep using this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So after using this cream for awhile now I've learnt a few things, it is a very moisturizing cream but a very heavy cream. So I found this cream is more of a night cream for me I found it a bit heavy for day time wearing. I did notice that it has made my skin look more alive though so that's a super big bonus! I will keep using this cream at night because it does make my skin feel fantastic after my morning face wash! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was so amazed by how much hydration this Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 30 has! I live in the ever so lovely dry area Canada and this has helped my skin tremendously. I love how high of an SPF it has so even when the sun will reflect off the snow in the winter I'll know I'm protected. It does go on a bit thick because of the SPF but I love it! Thanks Olay for making such a great product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Hard to say if the Olay anti-aging is working. What I can say is that the feel of the crream is good, it do not stay greasy. The smell is another thing. There is no good perfume, the product only smell like sun screen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review. I was very excited to try the product. As it has a lot of great reviews and benefits. Unfortunately, it's too rich for my liking. It left my skin with shiny film and I didnt like how greasy my skin felt. It would definitely work better for someone with very dry skin or more mature skin. I will pass it to my mom and will see how she finds it. I'm little over 30 and didn't find this product to be suitable for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried a sample of the total effects that I used at night and I loved it! At that time I was thinking if they had it with SPF! now my dream came true! I love the texture when I put it on. and it smells good too! It made my skin look clearer and felt softer. I would definitely buy this when I'm finished with this bottle! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"It took a moment to get used to, but I love this product. I noticed my skin looks better, it is protected, and my makeup stays on perfectly. This is anti-aging and protects from the sun. This product is a must have. I will be purchasing in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'm a big Olay fan so when I tried the Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF30, I was hugely let down. It was really thick going on and had a stickiness to it as though I was applying straight sunscreen to my skin. After it's absorbed into the skin, it feels fine, but the application process made me want to go back to my normal Olay moisturizer. I'll be passing this one by on my next shopping trip. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I wanted to try this product for a while before i commented and it was worth it !!! Received great comments asking what product i was using as my face seemed radiant ! When i told them that i was using Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer and it even had an SPF30 they were impressed and said they were going to try it !! My skin looks great and i don't need to worry about applying sunscreen to my face which is a great thing when you are a busy mom ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This little bottle will surely last awhile if you don't use the full pump. I found that less is best. First try o used a full pump of the product- skin felt greasy and face was shiny. Second use I used only half a pump and it worked better on my face and neck. Blended in perfectly. Love the fact that sunscreen is in the product. Will definetly purchase in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am super happy with this product - it smells great, it's easy to use and it doesn't clog my pores! Perfect addition to a skin care routine (and great base underneath makeup!). I would definitely recommend to others (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product for free to give my honest opinion. I liked how it felt, it's awesome that there's SPF30 in it. I'm terrible to remember sunscreen. I'm a bit young still to use anti aging, but it was nice feeling to it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I loved that this moisturizer had a great scent and didn't leave my face greasy or shiny like other moisturizers. It didn't even feel like sunscreen and it was really refreshing and hydrating. I didn't notice a change with the fine lines or dark marks on my face that I had anticipated, or any aid on the circles under my eyes but the sunscreen aspect has been more pleasurable than other sunscreens directed for the face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like how lightweight the product feels on my face. It is an effective moisturizer. I received the product and used it over the summer. It moisturizes my face, and doesn't make it oily. The bottle is also very light and I'm able to pack it in my bag to bring on-the-go. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this product is great. It left my skin feeling amazing, went on easily and was light. I really liked how it has spf 30 and was nice knowing that I was protected from the sun with my morning routine. The bottle itself is easy to use and I like that it is a pump to get the product versus others that you use your fingers to get it out which can be unhealthy.

I live this product! I use it every day in the morning and before bed with my face cleansing routine. I have always been a fan of the Olay brand and I find this cream works extremely well. It's light scented and the cream is not heavy not does it clog my pores. I find it keeps my skin looking fresh and lively all day long. I haven't noticed any major wrinkle improvements but I do notice a subtle tightening around the eyes and cheeks. I would definitely recommend this (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now. I really love it on my neck/decolletage area. It seemed to be just the right amount of richness. However, when I use it on my face, it makes my skin break out with pimples. I think it is just too rich for my face skin as I tend to be acne prone.

I usually use an expensive brand of moisturizer that does not have SPF in it. I never would have thought about trying a drug store brand well boy was I wrong! Within days of using the Olay Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer my skin felt smoother and was WAY more hydrated and the added SPF you can't go wrong! This high end brand loyal customer is no longer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
It's a great moisturizer. I can see many trips to the beauty section of the drugstore as the size is a bit small for using daily. I have noticed a radiant look to my skin. On my face Aswell as my hands. Definitely a pleasing product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I feel as a moisturizer it does a very good job. My skin feels rejuvenated and smooth after a week of using it. I don't feel it necessary though to have the spf in it as I usually moisturize overnight. To use during the day, I find it makes my skin very shiny. I usually wear liquid foundation and that would not work over the moisturizer. But strictly as a moisturizer I am more than happy with it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
My skin looks and feels younger ever since using this cream. I'm protecting my skin from the sun while reducing the fine lines. I wish I knew how much more improved my skin would be years ago so I wouldn't have to try and work harder to reduce the fine lines. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product is great for aging skin! My skin has never felt softer or looked younger! I was so afraid to try this sample because I often have allergic reactions, but nothing yet and I've been using the product daily for 2 weeks now! I love it and will replace my current moisturizer with this one! for sure!!! The rich thick texture is deceiving! It spreads on thin and light and does not feel greasy at all! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I would recommend the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Sunscreen to those looking for a moisturizer with great protection. It makes your skin feel refreshed and protected and although the cream is a little thicker than some I have tried, I must say I was very impressed overall. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this anti aging moisturizer is amazing. I feel so young when wearing this. It is easy to smooth over and feels amazing. I have been using this for over a week and can feel and see i huge difference. My foundation glides on over it and makes the morning get ready for work faster. ! #bzzagent #gotitfree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This creme has a thicker consistency. Nicely scented, not too strong. It absorbs well into the skin even though it is thicker consistency. Noticed my face is appearing brighter since I have started using it. Good quality product. #igotitfree thanks to Bzzagent and olay for the chance to try out new products!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Excellent product, I felt the effects from the first week and my surroundings made me noticed that I look younger. The product is easy to apply and quickly absorbed and well moisturizes the skin without leaving a heavy or oily feeling. As SPF 30, I could protect my skin from the effects of the sun this summer. I have sensitive skin so it is very important to me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love Olay, tried tested and true! Olay never lets me down....this really works wonderful. I had a few age spots starting on my cheek and after less than a week of using Olay they are 90% gone. It moisturizes my skin well with a nice scent too. No greasiness or clumping! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It feels good on my skin and I love the scent. The SPF 30 protection is a must for me as I have fair skin and need to have sun protection every day. I see a difference in my skin, it looks smoother. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After using this product I can see that the little lines by my eyes have been reduced a great deal and people have noticed the fine lines on my forehead are reduced as well. its easy to use and easy to find in store , with a fair price. It has not scent i find and its light weight. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like that the moisturizer has SPF in it and it's not awful, I just don't think it's the right product for me. It leaves my face really greasy and I don't like the smell. I think it would be a great product for someone with normal skin but because my skin is oily, it's not a product that I would buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love how light this product goes on. I normally don't like skin cream because it is too cakey. This goes on smooth and absorbs nicely. The scent is nice as well. It is so nice to have sun protection as that is very important to me. My skin feels softer, and is better looking than it has been in a long time! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am a little sceptical about Anti-Aging lotions. I do love Olay products and this one is no different. The lotion is thick so a little goes a long way. As a moisturizer I thought it worked very well. My skin was left feeling soft and smooth after each use. A couple times I did use a little too much and my skin looked a little greasy, but that was because of the user not the cream. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a great cream. It rubs into my skin easily, has SPF30 and makes my dry skin feel so soft. I am really happy with it. At 25, my skin hasn't shown signs of aging yet but I am hoping this moisturizer helps prevent any! I have recommended it to many others already. It is a great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I can't say this product is a 5 because all the characteristics aren't met when it comes to my skin. I am lucky enough to not have any wrinkles that could use some fortifying so I can't judge that aspect of the product. However, this product makes my skin so soft & smooth! It also worked wonders at protecting me from getting a facial sunburn even while in the sun for a full weekend! This product also has such a nice light scent! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a couple weeks and am quite impressed. At first I didn't know if I would like it, it seems a bit thicker than moisturizers I'm use to, however it runs in very Easily and doesn't leave my skin to oily. I also like that it is 30spf, which worked out great with the sunshine we had been having. Overall I do feel like my skin seems more refreshed. I have already recommended to my mom and friends as a great everyday moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have so many skin allergies so I was really hesitant to try something new on my face. But....5 days in and nothing! No itchiness! No hives! No pimples! Wow! And the bonus....??? My skin feels so soft and the wrinkles are minimized! I will keep using...but so far I'm loving this product!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love this product!! i have skin that's prone to breakouts when i use moisturizers and I've always stuck with the same one. this might be my new fave. i have to give it a little more time to absorb before i use foundation but i think it's worth it. The SPF is an added bonus as my current moisturizer has no SPF in it. the texture takes a little getting used to but overall 5 stars. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I love this so far how it feels on my skin already starting to see the difference in my lines by my eyes I will continue to buy this when I done And reviving it free to try out even better thank u buzz agent !! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love that this has a SPF of 30. I often find it had to find a good one that is over 15. I loved that it is not greasy and smelly great. I like the pump but find it hard to know when you are running out until you are out. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand but would buy again and recommend it to a friend.

"I have been using Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer, SPF30 for a couple of weeks now and I love the way my skin feels. It has a very nice texture that absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves me feeling so soft! I also love that it is SPF30. Most creams I have used were only SPF15 and I really like having the extra protection from the sun. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After using Olay Regenerist Multi Sculpting Cream SPF 30 for two weeks I have now started to see a difference in my skin tone. It looks more even toned and healthier. I'm happy with the results so far and will continue to use the cream with the hope of even better results with time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Thanks to Olay and Bzz Agent, I received a full sample of the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer, SPF30. The Olay Total Effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer smells great and leaves my skin silky soft! And it has sunscreen in it so 2 steps in 1 is fantastic and time saving! Love how it makes my skin feel! You will not be disappointed - a must try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I don't use a lot of products on my face because of sensitive skin and, let's face it, an extreme aversion to all thing goopy and greasy. I hate wearing sunscreen. When I first saw the bottle i immediately assumed it would be a thick, pasty texture. I was so excited to find a white, light lotion! For some reason I was expecting it to be tinted; it was not. It was the perfect solution to moisturize and protect in one step before a long walk today. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this product!! It makes my complexion soft and I have noticed a big difference in my wrinkles fading. I have to amid I was kind of sceptical at the beginning because you all the time about company saying that it will diminish the look of your wrinkles but unbelievably it does. It has made my skin softer in a lot brighter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Turning 40 I noticed a few unwanted lines and general discoloration on my face.. Since being able to try Olay Total Effects my face feels and looks much younger.. It gives your face the protection from the harmful rays from the sun and really helps with earsing the fine lines. A must have for any women in 30s and older.. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I'm finding my face feel a bit greasy and when I've been sweating its been running into my eyes and stinging....I can't wear this when its hot outside which to me defeats the purpose as it has SPF in it. Don't know if I will purchase this one. #StrongIsBeautiful, @Pantene, #Ageless, @OlaySkin and #GotItFree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I don't know how I feel about this product for its benefits with helping fine lines because I found the texture to be too thick and greasy for my skin. It caused me to break out and made my skin extremely greasy. I would recommend for people with dry skin, (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've never been someone to use skin care products on my face. I wash with bar soap, and remove my makeup with my 2yo's wipes. But this moisturizer is great so far. It's a little thicker than I expected, but if you use a 1/2 pump you'll have plenty without wasting too much. I love that it's 30 SPF. I always remember the kids sunscreen but never my own so it's killing 2 birds with 1 stone. Thanks Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was so excited when I received this product to try. I have been using it every day since I got it and the results speak for themselves. My skin is noticeably younger looking and I love that it has spf in it. It goes on light and non greasy and leaves my skin soft and smooth. The price is very reasonable and I would highly recommend it to anyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"So far, it's very light to aply. Wears well under my makeup and does not seem oily thought the day. And I have oily skin... so one up there! So far, it seams to start me off with a brighter completion and doesn't clog my poor like other moisturizers. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product has its pros and cons. I'm a huge fan for its pump applicatior, its uv protection, and that it helps fight against anti-aging. I've used it for about a week now. I've found that it is thick and greasy when applied and clogs my pores. I've seen slight reduction in fine lines, although I don't have much to begin with, mainly on the forehead. I will keep using and hope it works better. Would be better if there is a matte version. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I tried out the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer, it is great. Easy to apply and moisturizer my skin. It is not sticky like some other anti-aging cream so it doesn't cause break out. Note that I received free Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try out by Bzz Agent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I wasn't crazy about the smell seems like it's very oily I can't use it much as well the smell I can't stand but also I broke out after using but I will say my face is very wired and I can only use some things on it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using this amazing moisturizer every day for the past two weeks and my skin has been so happy! My skin is so soft and hydrated & the SPF30 means that I don't need to layer many products to get the sun protection I need. Big plus, smells so good and absorbs so well.

I loved this product! It's light and not oily however the coverage is incredible! My skin is significantly softer and visibly smoother looking! I will definitely be purchasing this as a regular product from now on! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I loved the pump, the scent of the product and the cream is thick and silky. I have to admit that the cream takes a long time to penetrate the skin so you can't apply your foundation afer. It also leave my skin oily. It would be a good cream to apply before bed but this way , fps 30 sunscreen is a waste. I guess it would be a nice product for someone with a really dry skin. If you have this skin problem, give it a try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer was great for keeping me protected during a weekend away in very hot sunny weather. But after a couple days of wearing the product I began to break out. This product goes on like a very thick sunscreen, quite oily. If you have a sensitivity to regular sunscreen then I would not recommend this product.

I absolutely love this product. I've been using it for days and love the way it makes my face looks and feels. I have super sensitive skin and it is so hard to find a moisturizer my skin agrees with and this one work perfectly! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have mostly been using this product in place of my normal day cream and it's a good product for those who have non-oily or ""normal"" skin type. As my regular day time moisturizer is a very light water based cream, this felt a bit too heavy for me. The texture and absorbance felt more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer for me. I only ended up using about half of one pump with each use as a full pump gave me too much cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am totally loving the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer, SPF30. I have been searching all summer for a great moisturiser with sufficient SPF. I have finally found it. It keeps my skin feeling moisturised and radiant most of the day. I believe with continued use that it will make my skin altogether healthier. I now feel like i never have to worry again about sun damage on my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

"I really like the Olay Total Effects Moisturizer, although I found it left a bit of an oily feeling on the skin...

I couldn't wait to try this when I received it. It felt thick at first but didn't feel heavy on my face. Didn't leave my face feeling like I was wearing a mask like some lotions do. Smells great. However I unfortunately ended up having an allergic reaction to this product but if I didn't I would recommend it to my friends and family (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
The Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer pumps out thick and creamy but rubs easily on the skin. It doesn't leave the skin oily or sticky which is so common with a lot of the other sunscreens. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this product is amazing. I only had to use one pump amount on my face after my morning shower and again before bed!

"I am trying out the Olay total effects anti-aging moisturizer, I noticed a difference in my skin within the first few days! My skin seems very soft and supple to the touch, my skin tone is much more even and my wrinkles seem less viseable as well.

I've used this product before. I was giving a smaller sample but this time around got bigger sample which I though was awesome. More days to try it out.

As someone who doesn't use sunscreen or moisturizer my mother worries I will turn into an Apple doll since I get lots of Sun. With Olay 7-1 anti aging moisturizer with sunscreen I find that it's keeping my skin soft as well as shrinking my pours which my lovely twin sister has pointed out many times are huge and gross. Easy to apply. Not greasy and the smell doesn't effect my scent sensitivity. I give this 4 thumbs up (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product left my skin feeling soft and supple. The few little wrinkles I could see eased a little and aren't so prominent.also wearing It out in the sun I didn't have the red skin around my nose and cheeks like I do when I'm out without it, no one wants a sunburn on their face!

I was so happy to try my sample of Olay Total Edfects AntiAging lotion I got from #BzzAgent. The first time I used it I noticed how good my face felt. I liked that it didn't have an overpowering scent. It has definitely become a new addition to my everyday beauty routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product does not disappoint you! Just as known as its fame, the anti-aging moisturizer is very soft and absorbing in texture, does not leave any greasiness or sticky feeling while effectively provides my skin with the anti-aging effect. I use this cream at least twice, day and night now to give me an even and complete result! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The product is satisfactory as a moisturizer, but after about 2 weeks of use now, I do not see any of the results it claims to do, such as enhancing brightness to my skin, minimizing pores, or reducing any dark spots, which are sometimes left behind from occasional breakouts. Overall, the lotion goes on smoothly, however don't expect miracles. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Although very soft on my sensitive skin, this cream was just too much for me. Probably better for for mature and dry skin. It felt like I was putting on a very thick sunscreen and not a day cream. Did not enjoy the texture at all but the fragrance was nice. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Cream goes on smoothly and has a nice feel to it. A little bit goes a long way and it smells good. Great coverage for sun exposure. I've got oily skin so I'm particular about face creams. This doesn't leave my face feeling any more oily even with the great coverage. Still waiting to notice the better looking more useful skin. It's been just about a week Haven't tried the hair spray just yet but super excited to give it a shot this weekend (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer is very hydrating, I think this would make a better winter then summer moisturizer for me - it took a very long time to absorb in. It actually felt a lot like my night cream. My makeup applied nicely over it though and seems to be holding on well! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was very excited to try the Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer and started the very next day after getting it. Cream went on nice and left my face feeling fresh and smooth. Though after about an hour I noticed my face was itchy and bumps breaking out. I had this happen 4 days in a row. The moisturizer was just not for me due to the irritation.

"I have very dry skin but this moisturizer makes me look greasy. The cream is thick to apply. Sweating on a hot day caused it to get into my eye and sting. I tried again but the product still irritated my eyes just from being on my face. I have the Total Effects SPF15 and it is much better: thinner, and non irritating.

Before trying Olay Total Effects Anti-aging moisterizer SPF 30 my face was dry and i had brown age spots. I have been using it for a couple of days and i have noticed my face is soft and not as dry. I love this product. I would recommend it. I love the idea it has SPF 30 in it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
The bottle with the cream is straight forward about what it is and how to use it. I liked how it had this small thing that you had to pull of in order for the cream to come out. When the cream comes out its early white and it goes as pearly white on the skin. I like how a little goes a long way and it keeps skin hydrated for the whole day as well as protection from the sun. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product. I have been using it for the past few days during extreme humidity and it did not make my face oily at all. The sun protection is a good SPF for the summer. Definitely recommend this product as it makes your skin feel more fresh! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"While I do like the way Olay Regenerist SPF 30 made my skin feel, there's something in it that made my pores scream! Whether it be a fragrance or oil, I'm not sure. If the ingredient that is causing my sensitive skin's redness/irritation was removed, this would be a prefect product. I love the SPF factor especially! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this product. It goes on so smooth and makes your face feel great. It also has a spf 30 so you do not have to use another sunscreen on your face. I just use daily to keep my skin mesmerized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in one moisturizer for about two years. I have tried both with and without sunscreen and find them both to be a great moisturizer. A small amount does a great job of keeping my skin hydrated for several hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tried probably 5 different kinds of moisturizers the last year, some were terrible and some were okay, but this one is great! It's not thick, or smelly, and doesn't make my face itch like others I've tried. Goes on great before makeup. Only con is it's kind of expensive, but a little does go along way!

"I have been using total 7 for over 6 years I believe and no matter what other product I venture, I always return to this one. It dries immediately so I can put my foundation on and believe me there is a difference you feel and see if you forget the 7. I am always tempted to try the other moisturizers by Olay and I have them and use but I still faithfully use the &. I cant go without it daily even if I stay home makeup free. I need the 7 on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay products for most of my adult life and have loved them. Even when I have tried other products, I always come back to Olay. I love the lightweight feel, the soft fragrance, and the fact that there is SPF in the products. The total effects products are no different, LOVE!

"I love the look of my skin using this product. It evens out my skin tone while providing much needed moisturizer. Also, I chose this product because it comes with SPF 30 protection. I am outside a lot of the day and appreciate the added protection this product provides. I recommend it to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first time I got know Olay products is more than 30 years ago when I was in China in graduate school. My mentor, who was 45 years old, looked like only 30 years old. She told me she used Olay which her friend bought from US. When I came to US more than 20 years ago, I started to use Olay. It works well and save me a lot of money too. Especially the Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 works best for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using total effects moisturizer for a very long time. When I first started using it, it was only SPF 15, now they have SPF 30 which I now use. It makes my skin feel great and use it everyday. I've had skin cancer so I have to keep SPF product on my face all of the time, whether I put on make up or not. It's the only product I use. Thank you for now making it with SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Total Effects for some 30 to 35 years. I use no other moisturizing products. Sometime when I can't find T.E. I purchase Olay Complete until I am able to purchase TE and have had many others ask what I use, because I don't look my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Prior to using this moisturizer , I used one that was very expensive but it would irritate my eyes when I sweat. It also didn't have sunscreen which is very important living in Florida . A commercial came on for this product and I thought what do I have to lose. That was 5 years ago and I have never looked back. I love this product .

"What can I say? This moisturizer is one of the few out there with an spf of 30! Wow! It moisturizes all day without feeling greasy. Plus it keeps me looking my best! I'm 44 and no one can ever guess my real age! Thank you, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great moisturizer & sunscreen protection, all in one! At my age, moisturizer & sunscreen are daily rituals so being able to save time by using one product is a big help. Plus, the coverage stays on throughout the day. I highly recommend! Who wants to multi-task when it's not necessary? Thanks, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am really picky with what I put on my face. I do not break out with this product at all and it isn't greasy feeling which I do not like. What is really amazing is, this is the only product I use for sunscreen. I have tried other sunscreens but this one is the best when I travel to the Caribbean. My husband will even use it.

"I've used Total Effects Anti-Aging Daily moisturizer with SPF 30 for years. I've tried many other brands and types but always come back to this one.

I have been using Total Effects for years. I work in a movie theater and customers everyday will say I look younger than my age (which is 60). I also use this as my sunscreen on the beach etc. I will never stop using Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I decided to step up my skincare routine from basic cleansing, moisturizing and sunscreen. I chose Olay Total Effects, and I'm so glad that I did! I bought almost the whole line! Within just a few days, my skin looked healthier and felt smoother. I love the SPF 30 in this moisturizer because I am very fair, and it protects my skin so well. I am so impressed with this line, and I know I will be using it for a long time."
I was shocked at the things this product does It actually works all the stuff it tells you it does is true all summer long I had beautiful healthy looking skin and it was protected from all those nasty RVA rayes I was truly happy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer is AWESOME! I have fairly sensitive skin, and have recently noticed a few fine lines, and uneven skin tone, oh and some pretty serious bags under my eyes. I tried several different products, from the cheap to the way-to-much-to-be-spending-on-a-jar-of-moisturizer, and didn't think I'd ever find one that satisfied all my needs....Untill I found this. I seriously would recommend this to anyone looking for an all around affordable moisturizer that actually works!"
"Olay!!!What a wonderful beauty creams.Mom always,have.Olay,in the bathroom ,and in her bethroom.I grow up,look at.her,everytime she use the Olay,and soap,all the products are excellent,she still.use,the old one,moistorising cream and the antiage soap.And I start.using,when I was a teen.I know.,I used,this totall effects 7,the soap,cleanser,if you want to keep your.face.looking.young.use.,this totally effects 7,is amazing."
I always use Oil of Olay daily moisturizer. During summer months I change to using the one that includes sunscreen. It is a great way to get full coverage for your day outside. I do find that the ones that contain sunscreen tend to burn my eyes if I get any in my eye.
"This is a great product. Your skin feels moisturized without feeling oily. I have used other Oil of Olay products, but this is the first time I have used this one. I am always being complimented on how young I look and I feel Oil of Olay is a major part of that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ladies this product does it all! It protects your skin from the sun but also evens out skin tone, makes wrinkles less noticeable, makes it softer and more dewy looking, moisturizes and since you only have to purchase one product it's so economical! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay products for 30+ years. It started in college when I tried a sample and I have been using it ever since! I have serious allergies so my skin can be affected. I have never had a reaction to Olay products which has kept me coming back. The cost and availability of the product is fantastic. I just wished you offered travel sizes.
"This is a great moisturizer! It absorbs quickly and makes your skin very soft. I have ""expression line wrinkles"" and concentrated on this area. There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks. Skin dries out in all seasons and this moisturizer replenished my skin in a way I never expected."
"I am over 50 years old and I find that most products do not deliver for my age group. I tried Total Effects 7 and within days my skin felt firmer, had a healthy glow and felt younger. It is now my go to product! Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now. I am in my late 40's and have only a few fine lines. I love how this product feels on myskin. Not grease, soft plump dewy on my skin .

I have used other products but I always come back to Olay. It just seems to help with the look and feel of my skin. It makes my skin feel soft like a babies. I don't know why I just don't stay what seems to work. It also makes my face a little more tighter after I use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My face would be so dry after washing it. I would have dry spots around my nose and my forehead. I tried different types of moisturizers but after 30min. my dry spots would reappear.

"I've used Total Effects blemish control salicylic acid acnes cleanser and Total Effects Anti-Angie Daily Moisturizer for about 5 years. My skin is smooth and clear. I've tried other, more expensive products without the same effects. The reason I did not give 5 stars, I would like a version of the Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer with salicylic acid to reinforce the benefits of the cleanser.

I have used Oil of Olay products for 20 plus years. Through the years I've bought different products to use but always go back to Oil of Olay. There is no other product on the market that is comparable as far as I'm concerned. My skin is soft smooth and young looking. No one believes that I'm 55 years old. When you find something that works as well as Olay you stay with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The very first week of using this product, my skin looked and felt like I was 35 again, and I am 55. I felt beautiful,young and luxurious! I felt so good, that it radiated through my whole being that people even comment on the fact I looked 20 years younger! I will never use anything else again! thanks Olay!

"My mom always used Oil of Olay and that is how I started. Her skin was so soft. That was back when there wasn't so many choices. Just the plain pink lotion.

I love iy and will never stop using it. Thank you. Debbi [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I purchased this product because my 73 year old mother has aged tremendously well and she has always used the ""original"" oil of olay. She has endured years of smoking (she quit 11 years ago, Yea Her!!!) and 6 years of cancer treatments and her skin still looks fabulous. So, I thought.....what the heck!! and I really do love the product."
I love this stuff. I work underground in the NYC subway stations and this product helps keep my skin looking like Im 25 and Im 43.Im in harsh lighting and no moving air for 10 hours at a time. This has never failed me and was even great after I finished my chemo. Mild enough to use without causing an out break. I swear by this product. It never makes me shiny either. VERY light. I think once you try it for 15 days you will be hooked too.
I prefer the one with foundation in it but this one is good too. It is a little more greasier.
So far so good. Helps powdered makeup last longer.
"Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer has worked for me. Kept my face smooth without pimples. You only need a drop. The 1,7 fl oz last for 2 months"

Everyone thinks I wear foundation makeup but I don't. I have used Oil of Olay for years and this new product just ices the cake. It not only feels good but so healthy for my face.
