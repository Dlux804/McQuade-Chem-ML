I was brought up using Neutrogena soap and now enjoy Hydro-boost and was excited to try the spot corrector for a few on my face. Noticed an immediate difference and after one wk.- continue to notice the darker complexion spots are more difficult to see! Feels delightfully creamy on the skin!
"I started using this about 1 1/2 weeks ago and so far have been ""very"" happy with the results. My age spots on my face has really gotten much better and getting to hardly notice anymore. Very impressed so far with this product and wish I would have bought this a ""long"" time ago!"
"I've been using this product since May 15, 2016 on 2 large dark spots on my face & on the dark circles under my eyes. By no means are the spots gone, but they have lightened significantly enough for me to continue using it. My dark circles seem less dark too. I think the word 'rapid' should not be taken literally. But you can't call something 'gradual tone repair' or no one would buy it. I'm hoping for even more improvement by the holidays."
I was weary about purchasing the product but since I have started using it I can see and feel the difference in my skin. I'm in my 40s and I have been using Neutrogena since my early 20s. The Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector is helping my dark spots fade and my skin feels silky to the touch. I'm a true believer of the company and it's awesome products.
"About two weeks ago, I had bought this product online to help with the dark spot on my face. The first time i used it, the product smelled bery nice and it seemed to soak up the oil on my face. After using this product for two weeks, im starting to notice some changes in my skin. The dark spot are slowly fading. I am very excited about this product and highly recommend it to my closest family and friends."
"I have been using this product as directed for three weeks and have seen very little change so far. Had high hopes, but am disappointed with results so far."
I've been using this for around 2 weeks. The box says that you will see a difference in 1 week. I bought this to help lighten dark sun spots on my forehead and checks. I don't believe using the Neutrogena Dark Spot Corrector has made any difference in my dark spots. I am disappointed.
"I'm hopeful that this product will work for me. I trust Neutrogen and I've been using their products for years now because they are hypoalergenic. My skin is oily and I've have these dark marks on my face for years also. I've tried other dark spot removers and they didn't work for me, so...I'll give it a few more weeks with this product, and let you know how well it worked. Excited about the possibilities,"
Michelle
"I keep buying this product in the hope that some day it'll help with the brown spots on my face ... hasn't so far, but I keep hoping... I guess I'm a slow learner. The dermatologist told me that nothing short of laser treatment will remove those brown spots."
"This has really helped with fading acne scars using once daily .I like the consistency, it absorbs into skin easily and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I wish it helped more with my brown spots, but I am grateful it is helping fade the acne marks. I would buy this again."
I have tried many products and nothing helped. I tried this product and not even a week and brown spots have lighten a lot. I think it will be almost gone in a week. I love that it is working.
I have spent a lot of money on laser treatments for age and sun exposure spots. Rapid Tone repair works just as well minus the down time and cost. I love this product!
"I have used this product prior to this last order and find it to work really well on ages spots. Give it a little time, but it will get you there and for the price...well. Good luck finding anything better."
"I am very happy with this purchase. I use it daily, it makes my skin feel silky smooth and glides on smoothly under my regular moisturizer. I recommend anyone with dark spots to use this product."
I found that this product worked well on newer spots. My existing older spots are fading slightly...may need more time. Overall I would recommend this product.
"I have been using this twice a day for the past few weeks & have seen no change in the dark spots on my skin. It might be a decent moisturizer, but it's not a very good dark spot corrector."
This is THE best dark spot corrector I have ever used.You can actually see and feel the results. My skin is so soft and clear.
"I have been faithfully using it for three weeks for two dark spots on my face, and I have not seen any results at all. Not even a little bit."
I have been using this for about 3 weeks . I really think it is helping. It seems like the spots are a little lighter.
"I bought this because I have age spots on my face. Price is on expensive side. So far, I love the product."
"Product nutragena dark spot remover. still have them so what now? I use all nutragena poducts, and have been very happy until now"
"I bought this about a month ago, started using it right away and my dark spots don't appear any different"
I'm almost done with the bottle of Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector and see no difference at all in my skin. I will try another product going forward.
"While spending time in the US during the summer, my dearest friend gave me this product after I removed my makeup and showed her darken spots I was covering with"
"makeup. 3 months down the line, don't need concealer on that part of my face... Fab product, shame you can't get to buy from the stores in the UK."
This has the EXACT same ingredients as the rapid wrinkle repair serum (check out the list word for word) aside from one ingredient that's at the bottom of the list which means it's only 0.0002% of the formula. An ingredient that's at the very top of the list is Dimethicone which is a very smooth silky silicone that temporarily fills in lines and blurs uneven skin texture. I hate layering this with other products bc it pills horribly. It always ends up leaving my face a mess with bits of the silicone everywhere. Absolutely hate this.
"Used for a while, takes a little getting used to. I have sensitive skin and I apply after I shower at night. I do get a good sting when I apply it. For me I use every other day to prevent flaking. I also have a lot of freckles, but I noticed some sun spots and it has helped lessen then appearance of those spots as well as fine lines that were showing up as well!"
"The Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector did nothing for me. I was using it all over my face and neck focusing attention on one dark spot. While it goes far, and feels great on your skin as a moisturizer, it does nothing for fading dark spots. It has a nice light fragrance and works well under makeup. But the name of the product is a misnomer in my opinion. It would be great if it worked, but I think you have to spend more to get more results. My honest opinion for trying this as a Spark Reviewer."
Product works really well is reducing dark spots on my face with just 2 weeks of use
My dark spots are gradually fading. First product that has given me results.
I purchased this product a couple Weeks ago & I truly like it
After just 10 days my skin looks brighter and feels smoother.
Best over the counter product that I have used. Highly recommend
bought this a week ago and haven't seen results but i am giving it time.
Not happy that I did order it. Does not lighten my dark spot
"I bought this product at a drugstore a couple of days ago hoping it would clear up some acne scars, instead I got some ugly looking burns instead. Thankfully I just applied it on the specific spots and not all over my face. Still, they are more noticeable than the initial scars. If you have sensitive skin like me, do yourself a favor and don't buy it. Other neutrogena products have worked great, but definitely not this one."
In a week period I fell in love with this product! The tone correcting color lightens my under eye dark circles.
I am writing this just to end the emails from Neutrogena. It's okay. Nice as it goes on. Really has not helped with dark spots.
I love this product but it does take longer to see results than I thought it would. Need to use twice a day for at least 3 weeks to start to see a change.
"I've been using this product exactly as directed on package for the past couple of weeks, with no change in my complexion at all. When i first started using it, it felt tingly & a bit of a burning sensation. But package stated that this was normal & would go away after continued use. And after I used the product for about a week, the tingling & burning did stop, but still no change in my complexion. Just felt smooth, didn't get rid of any blemishes or dark spots."
"I have one dark spot, but I used it all over my face. I have noticed that the spot is fading and feel that with continued use it will be gone or at least so light as to not be a factor. Whether it would come back after stopping remains to be seen. I have noticed that my skin all over my face is getting lighter as well. I got this for the spot, but once I received the product, it read as being for women, I used it anyway and can't complain about the results so far."
I've tried this for over a year now to lighten the super dark spot on my face but sadly it's still there. I still buy hope hoping it will eventually work. I am hopeful because I like all neutrogena products.
"This dark spot corrector works well and quickly, be careful to apply it very evenly, and I noticed out did dry my face out a bit, I suggest using a very light moisturizer with it. And sun block is a must."
"I purchased this product because I suffered from dark spots. It started working after 3 days, but on the fourth day I noticed burning during application and then woke up to small bumps and rash like texture with dried spots under both of my eyes. I will discontinue use until I see a dermatologist. Maybe my skin is too sensitive for this product. My hydro boost face was works wonderfully."
"Why has Neutrogena added more and more fragrances to their products? This product was so highly perfumed I developed a migraine within half an hour of application. This brand has been perfuming more and more products for no reason. Even the make-up remover wipes are overwhelming. I'm so disappointed in them as they are hazardous to those of us with sensitivities. I started using this brand many years ago and have seen it go from pure, simple and effective to unneeded ingredients that cause serious problems.."
"At the age of 47, my skin is remarkably wrinkle-free- but in the last couple of years my aging has really started to show with age spots that have been getting more numerous, larger and darker. After only TWO WEEKS of using ""Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector"" my skin has really cleared up. The small spots are gone, and the larger spots are much smaller and lighter. Fantastic!"
I have been using this product for about a month now and it is amazing! I have used many other products and have found this one to be the most useful. It has faded my dark spots faster and more effectively than I thought possible. Definitely a recommended product!
"After trying some expensive products to reduce age spots, I took someone's advice that Neutrogena had some great products reasonably priced. Rapid Tone Repair Dark Sot Corrector is a terrific product. I am so pleased with it and it out performed any of the expensive products I tried. I'm also an Aveeno product lover."
"So for the past 3 years I have suffered from annoying dark spots. I blame a battle with adult acne. I have tried numerous expensive products (Clinique, Proactiv, fade creams) and several trips to my dermatologist and nothing has worked…I mean nothing. Not even a slight difference. I decided to try neutrogena and I use the dark spot corrector and the night cream. The results one month in are incredible. My spots are barely noticeable now. Great product at an affordable price!!"
"Thank you for bringing this back! I don't wear make up and normally have clear skin. After turning 30 I've noticed my skin doesn't bounce back after breakouts. I've been looking for a replacement since this was discontinued 2-3 yrs ago. Works even quicker and doesn't irritate at all. My search is finally over since this is the only thing that fades dark spots (post breakout)without making me break out even more. Thank you, again! My favorite product. It works!!!!!"
"I've purchased expensive products in an attempt to eliminate dark spots. After endless disappointments and money wasted.. It seemed like nothing would work. Then by some miracle I decided to give this product a try! The bottle stated "" Rapid tone and spot corrector"" This product backs that claim"" and the amazing results are proof. I am more than pleased. When they say rapid they mean"" results a solution to uneven tone and dark spots "" thank you Nutragina this product is a Gods sent"""
I just started using the product and while I have not seen a lightening of my dark spots I think it might be working. I love the pump as it only squeezes out a small amount at a time. In addition it smells nige and feels nice on my skin. Time will tell if the product does what it said it would do.
"Once I started using this product my skin had to get used to it and when I say get used to it I mean it peeled for a week or two, but I think that means it was working!! And that it did! After about 3 weeks I received a compliment that my skin was brighter and more beautiful!! So iif one has dark spots or post acne discolorations this is the product to buy!"
"Riding through the desert with cowboys, and jumping waves with my brothers on jetskis all ended up on my face. I ravaged the internet in search of resolve, then turned to Neutrogena. Sure enough, in less than the ""week"" warranted, my skin tones began to even out, fine and deep wrinkles reduced. Wow! Who'd 'a thought? Thanks Neutrogena...a lot!"
"I can't believe this product works so fast. In just a few days I could see the spots fade away. I am so impressed that I bought two more packages. On line I haven't been able to find the Dark Spot Corrector, but just a similar product. I just found this last week. Please don't discontinue it. There are many of us who need this product. I am even using this on my hands. It works great!"
"My husband and I have used this product for 2 months now. I believe that the claim that 100% of women saw results immediately are false. We have seen absolutely ZERO results from this product. It does NOT lighten dark spots, or improve overall tone of skin. We are of fairly light to medium complexion. I am truly disappointed."
"I've been using retina-a/retinols, and vit. C for years, plus hyaluronic acid, so I wasn't expecting much, but liked that this was 3-in-one product, so I tried it. It's better than I could have imagined! I'm very happy with it. My dark spots are almost gone. They are seriously faded. Try it, it works! Great product."
"This does work! After I cleaned my face I applied this on some of my after pimple dark spots and the very next day it looked lighter! (I'm not getting paid to say this)! I truely am a fan of Neutrogena, I've Always used the “visbily even daily moisturizer” stop to try something else and it was a big mistake! Also bought the “rapid repair eye cream” Love this brand. (FYI my skin tone is a caramel complexion) good luck and don't give up on your skin!"
"I love this product! I could see a difference almost immediately. My skin looks so much better. It was looking so dry, red, dull and rough. I could hardly stand to look in the mirror before I put on my makeup. Now, my skin looks just as good without any makeup! Even the dark spots are fading! Love all the Neutrogenia products I have tried."
The products says I should notice a difference within a week. To my surprise I noticed the lessening of dark spots the first morning after wearing it to bed! So happy to find something effective that isn't as expensive as all the brands you'll find in department stores.
I'm a 59 yr old AA with dark spots on my nose from wearing eyeglasses. I purchased this product (rapid tone repair dark spot corrector) & used for about a week now; & don't see any change yet. I will continue to use till all the product is gone or a fade in the dark marks....hopefully from what I've read in reviews the product works; as for me nothing yet...will review again in a couple of weeks .
"I bought this 2 months ago, completed 2 tubes and my stubborn dark spots on my face is still there and I am really dissapointed. I took pictures to check the results and I see only a tiny bit of change on one spot. I was really hoping this product will be it after trying so many products."
I bought this product a month ago !!! No results !!! No change in the dark spots been using it daily morning and evening no change what a waste of money ( this tube is up expensive to not show any results ) !! Very disappointed in this product ! There is nothing rapid about it SAVE your money !!
"I bought this product two weeks ago. I have sensitive skin and only apply it in the morning to the area I where I need it. There is a very noticeable difference and my skin exfoliated each week in that area, which lets me know it's working the same way prescribed Retin A worked on my skin years ago. Great product for a great price."
I have been using this product for about 2 months now and have seen absolutely no change in my dark spots. I'm really disappointed because this product is very expensive and I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased it. I will be contacting Neutrogena by phone to find out if they have any better products that actually work for reducing
dark spots.
"I just bought this product 2 days ago so I can't tell if it works or not but I wanted to ask Neutrogena, does this product is non greasy/ noncomedonegic? My skin is acne prone so I wanted to know if it will cause my skin to break out? If not it would be very useful because i'm vanishing some dark spots that my pimples hsve left."
"I bought this product a month and I must say I love it. I have dark spots on my face and I tried everything. Nothing seemed to work. I saw the rapid tone repair dark spot corrector on a commercial and decided to give it a try. To my surprise with in seven days I saw a difference, with in a months time my dark spots are almost completely gone. I recommend this product to any one who wishes to remove unwanted dark spots."
I love this product I am also using tone correcting day and night creams ..after one week of applying spot correcter my skin burns and tingles now for a minute and gets flaky and if I don't put moisturizer right away after washing my face I would feel super stretched and dry and I never had dry skin! Is this normal ? since my skin has improved dramatically ..burning bothers me but if it's normal then it's worth it !
I used this product for a week and saw a difference! As promised! I had brown spots on my chin from a bad reaction to chemical peel and its helped me with those spots!!!! And it smells sooo pretty!! Its not flaky and weird looking when it dries. Buuuut i also have a birth mark on my jaw that i was trying to get rid of and well... that hasnt happened yet! But ITS ONLY BEEN A WEEK! So im going keep using the tube! Maybe it will be rid of my brown birth mark
Purchased and use the entire tube. Did not fade or lesson any of my age spots. My spots look the same as when I started using this product.
"Absolutely worthless. As much as I love Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, this product is garbage. I have an age/sun spot on the side of my face, near my temple. It did NOTHING and in my opinion, spread the spot and made it larger."
"Love this product. It does EXACTLY what it says it will do ""remove dark makrs,"" and it does this without irritating the skin. I've used this product for 2 years now."
I really was very impressed how well this product worked on my age spots. Work better than the cream my dermatologist gave me. I only wish they created a larger container for the price
"Clearly, my skin has shown a great improvement in tone and overall clarity. I've been using this product for about three weeks and my skin looks definitely clearer, spots have faded and no irritation. Thank you Neutrogena!"
I just want to say I used this product and seen result the very next day. It has not even been a full 7 days and my dark spots are completely lightening up. I am very pleased with this product and I would def recommend it.
I love this product. I had red marks on my face that would not go away. Piling concealer on was not helpful.I used this product and they were gone in 3 days. I used a competitors product for the previous month. Buy this!
"Was excited after reading such good reviews to try this. After 2 weeks no change to dark spots. I am usually very happy with Neutrogena products but will not use this again, obviously very expensive for getting nothing out of it."
"Honestly, after only one application, I could actually notice a difference! By the end of the week, I will probably see a complete transformation at this rate. This apparently does exactly what it was meant to do."
I have been using this product for two weeks now. My dark spots have greatly faded already. My skin tone is improved. I would highly recommend this product. Can't wait to see what the results look like after a month of use!
I have been using this product for a little over a month and have seen zero change. So disappointing because the product is expensive and not reflective of their other products.
"I have been using this for MONTHS now. I can't tell ANY difference whatsoever. I followed the directions, applied it a few times a day. I feel like I wasted all that $$ for nothing."
"it definitely works on brand new post acne red /dark spots .just bought my second tube , i used two bottles of the 50$ clinique dark spot corrector and absolutely nothing happened , neutrogena is way cheaper AND it works . will keep using it"
This product did nothing for my dark spots but made my skin dry feeling.
Great product. Works well.
"In just two days, 2 DAYS ONLY, the majority of my facial dark spots were gone. This product is sensational!"
"I've used this product daily for several months and I have seen no improvements on my darks spots, at all."
"I've been using this product for about 4 months and wow! I didnt have acne, but I had post acne scars and red marks... this cleared it up!"
This has worked faster and better than any other product I have used. This is a product I will continue to use. No more searching.
I bought this 3 days ago and this has made my eye bags sore and red! It burns around and pealing skin
I've been using a lot and expensive product but this Rapid Tone Repair dark spot corrector is really effective for me.
I USED THIS PRODUCT AND DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.
ANY CHANGE. I LIKE NEUTRGENA BRAND SO FAIR. BUT THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK. I DID NO RECOMENDED.
"Hi,I just bought this cream last week and i see a visible difference in a week.my spots have reduced ."
I struggle with dark spots left behing from acne and sun spots! Nothing ever works! I use this twice a day under my moisturizer and they have gradually become less and less noticable! I started using it about 3 weeks ago could not be happier
Wonderful product but my skin has been peeling and am not sure what to do about that
"Hi, how many percent of retinol and vitamin C in this product? I love it and i want to know it more"
If you follow directions you will start to see results in a week.
Have been using for over 6 months and no change in my dark spots
I bought the a a month ago and been using it but its breaking out my skin more
Comply with what was promised
"This product does actually work pretty well. I do think I've noticed a difference in my skin and I would say that I recommend this one. However, the packaging isn't my favorite and I do prefer their Rapid Wrinkle Repair night moisturizer instead for my skin's needs. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to read my full review I posted about this product."
"I bought this produce a few week ago, It's make me feel good."
I just don't want to waste money on it if it's not for African Americans.
II really like this stuff. I have seem some slight difference with dark spot and it feels great on your face.
"It worked really fast. Noticed a difference the next day -- it made my pores smaller. After 1.5 weeks, dark spots lighter."
"I have used this age spot corrector for almost 2 months, using twice daily and the dark spots are still visible. The surface of the dark spots have flaky skin over the spots but nothing has changed. Highly disappointed!!!!"
This smells so good and I've seen a difference after one week!
This product is not as good as the Neutrogena Rapid Tone corrector with moisturizer.
Love this
