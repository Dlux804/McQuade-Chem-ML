I have been using this moisture cream for several years and would not consider changing. It is a very good product and relatively inexpensive in comparison to other moisure creams that are not as effective as this one.
After years of wasting money on other brands from Olay to Lanc√¥me to everything! I finally tried this after using the alba face wash and loving it. In short this moisturizes without a greasy feeling and zero possibility of it breaking you out!!! All natural and Jasmine essential oil are amazing for the skin! Face feels smooth all day from 6am until I wash my face at night!
"I realy love this moisture cream, smooth, smells nice, last a long time."
I have been using this face cream for over a month and I love it. It is refreshing and light on the skin. You wouldn't feel like you are wearing anything on your face with the knowledge that your skin is being protected. I wear it daily under makeup and it is great. Great buy.
This cream keeps my skin smooth and well-hydrated. It is great to use in the morning because of the refreshing aroma that starts my day off right.
Feels great and smells awesome! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated.
"This is my daily go-to moisturizer. Didn't want oil-free. Very nice, non-greasy formula."
My face use to be dry no matter what cream I used. Once I started using this cream im no longer dry. I put it on before bed and before I put my make up on.
"I'm satisfied with the effectiveness of the cream but the fragrance is overpowering. I am sensitive to smells, especially in my face products and I was really surprised at how strong this one is. And it's more perfume-y than natural smelling. I have used it anyway just b/c of not wanting to waste it but I will not buy it again."
"I have used this product for 10 years - got it as a sample from someone and have stuck with it! It's not greasy, can be used as a night cream or under makeup, great fragrance that is not overpowering."
"This is an outstanding product and value for the money as you get 3 ounces of cream. As a cream it has all the effects you are wanting for your skin, is very mild and gentle with great moisturizing and smoothing qualities. To top it off the fragrance is yummy if you like jasmine. I have used this product on and off for years and will continue to do so."
"It works great on my dry skin after washed my face , and not cause any pimple . highly recommened"
This is at least $5-6 more anywhere I shop. I have been using this product for years and love it.. Sufficiently moisturizes my face without goopy/greasy feeling or having to re-apply.
"I have extremely sensitive skin and this works well for me. I keep trying other products, just out of curiosity, but always come back to this one. It smells wonderful and I almost always require scent free products, so was pleased to find something I can actually use that smells good, too. I get many complements on my skin and have used this for over 3 years."
"I am in LOVE with this! It leaves my face super soft and all my dry spots are no more! I also use it for my hands, works perfect. It has a nice scent not too strong just perfect"
This moisturizer is fantastic. It only requires a very small amount to cover your entire face. The product does not leave your face feeling sticky or oily.
"I bought this for my daughter, but ""I"" HAD to try it. This moisturizer smells and feels amazing. I have sensitive skin, and it did not irritate my face."
I love the feel of this cream. It really moisturizes without feeling to heavy. The smell is light but is great. Dissipates quickly. Not over powering like some creams are. Love it!
Love it!!!
Love this! Moisturizers my face very nicely.. highly recommend it!!
I have spent a lot of money on facial moisturizers and this is the best value. It makes my skin so soft and it smells great.
A very mild moisturizer which I have used at night with good results.
Love how soft and hydrated my face is after i put this on!!
I love how soft it makes my face
"I love this cream as it's light, smells lovely, makes my skin feels soft, really happy :)"
