my line are reduced very happy with this cream
"I'm 22 years old I wear makeup almost everyday so I use this cream to prevent wrinkles, age spots etc. trying to keep my face nice and smooth. I often get asked my age, when I tell people they thought I was joking they said I look like a teenager lol! So this cream must be doing something right! Better price here $15.99 at Walgreens for same oz!!"
I Love Cicatricure. I have been using it for 1 year and my skin has totally transformed into a soft and younger looking skin. I noticed the change after 1 week.
"this is the best moisturizing cream, i have tried in a long time. It is doing wonders to my skin. Age spots on my face are disappearing, and wrinkles are decreasing. I give it a 5 star rating."
I like it. I feel great after applying it.
Great product
Good
"I've used it several times since purchased. I wasn't all that thrilled with it. It isn't a moisturizer, and I have since purchased a facial moisturizer. As far as it helping with wrinkles, eh!"
