I've been using this product for many years and love it. Thankful that you carry it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Aubrey is one of my fav companies. This moisturizer works well on mature or dry skin. I am 60yrs old. Light fragrance is very pleasant & not overpowering. Creamy texture leaves the skin moist without an oily feel.
SWANSON HAS THE BEST PRICES FOR THE BEST PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET PLACE. AUBREY ORGANICS' ROSA MOSQUETA PRODUCTS ARE EXTRAORDINARY
Very security place where buy products with high qualities .Reliable and trust.
