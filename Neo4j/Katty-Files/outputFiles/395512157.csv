I haven't used Clinique since my teen year but I saw this on sale and thought I should try it. Glad I did. I'm 50 now and need serious hydration. I like that it doesn't feel heavy or greasy. It just sinks right into my skin. Good purchase.
"I used this some years ago, it is just as good as I remembered!"
I bought this after trying a sample with a clinique purchase. Wow is all I can say. This left my 66 year old face feeling so soft even a couple of days after the first use.
I have been using it almost every night. I now don't need any other moisturizer before adding a light foundation. This is a fantastic product. The big plus is that it costs a lot less at Sam's Club.
Great price and product very thick and rich feeling
Love this product under my moisturizer. It's very hydrating.
I love this moisturizer. I have sensative skin but this doesn't irritate it. Love the great price offered from Sam's Club too!
I have used this for many years and it is great. I have allergy to perfumed cosmetics. This is non-allergenic.
I am in Olay girl. I tried ths because I read the great reviews. I've been using it for About two weeks and it held up nicely.
Great price for a great product! Pleasant surprise to find this on sale at Sam's Club.
Great for your skin living in dry Colorado!
