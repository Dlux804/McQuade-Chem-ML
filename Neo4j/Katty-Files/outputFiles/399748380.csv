I bought the smallest jar possible to try. It's absolutely made my neck smoother. The acid test is sitting in my hair stylist's chair. It is right in the front window under the harshest light. I feel I always look older than I am in her mirror. This month I looked better.
Lives up to the hype. Cannot do without this. And seriously do get compliments on my neck and jawline. I'm so glad I started using this. I do neck exercises daily but doubt it would look as good as it does without this neck cream.
Read about this product and decided to try. Really impressed. I am see a difference in skin texture and tone.
I have been using the Tighening Neck Crean for years and I just love it!! It has really helped fight gravity when it comes to my neck!! I really love it !!!
Wow work like is said my neck look firmer and young looking . Highly recommend to everyone to try .
This cream is amazing! Literally the lines from my neck and chest have started to disappear
"Extremely please, I start using this product a month ago."
I have used this neck cream for years and adore it...but right when I think it couldn't be any better they came out with the Plus! I don't need to use a lot and it makes my neck and decollate look so smooth..you'll love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have not seen any results from this like l did from the original. I like the texture of the original better.
I've been using this new TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream Plus for about 3 or 4 weeks and I can really see a difference. Their first Neck Tightening Neck cream was very good but this new one is EVEN BETTER!
"I have been using this neck cream for years; it has improved the appearance of my neck dramatically. I picked this as a product to review, firstly, because I love it, and also because I now have a smaller travel size. I highly recommend if your neck looks wrinkly.

"Your neck cream (the TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream) was one of the few on the market that actually worked. I was using it for years. Why would you change a popular, working formula? This new formula called tightening neck cream PLUS, is nowhere near as good as the old formula. I'm all for new products, and trying out improvements. But why would you not make this PLUS version as a separate product and keep your best selling, most popular formula on the market."
if used regularly (twice a day) you can really see a difference with neck .
I'd like to wait another week for making my opinion. I have used it very few time.
I bought this about a week ago and I can see a difference in my skin on my neck
Reordering the product that I received as a birthday gift.
Bought this a couple of weeks ago and I probably need more time to tell but so far am loving the results...
I've been using this cream for years. My neck looks ok for a 64 year old. No wrinkles but doesn't help with sagging. I'll keep use nt it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I believe this cream has fought off the natural aging process on my neck. I have been using it for a few years now and have no signs of losing elasticity. When I look at other women my age, that's when I really know this stuff works. Don't just use the SD for the face, this is specially formulated for that delicate neck area. Use it religiously and you will sing its praises too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So glad I tried this product. My neck looks so much better, I can actually see the difference I have been using it for over a month."
"This is an amazing improvement to the TL advanced tightening neck cream!!! Have been using the plus on my neck and upper lip twice a day for the past two weeks and it does so much more than the original TL cream!!! Skin is so much smoother, tighter and younger looking..... only wish I hadn't stocked up on the original formula over the holidays!! There truly is a major difference!!

"Don't know if this works yet, but don't see how you could see any difference by the time you made it through the jar. This jar is TINY, maybe will last a week of using on your neck if you're lucky."
"I received a sample of this cream with my order and it started working immediately! Love the results, my neck feels smoother and tighter. I've been extremely happy with all of my Strivectin products so far!"
