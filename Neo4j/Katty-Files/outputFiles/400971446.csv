"I was so pleasantly surprised when I opened this tub of goodness! First of all, the smell is SO fresh and light. I cant get over it. The cream is lightweight and not oily at all. You can apply morning and night time but as a bonus, you can apply a thicker layer as a refreshing mask! You barely need to use any cream at all yo cover your whole face so i could see this tub lasting a year easily. 10/10 would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am addicted to using this product. It instantly makes your skin feel so refreshed - helps me wake up in the morning. I also suffer from eczema and dry skin usually forms around my mouth and chin, since using Garnier Green Tea Balancing 3 in 1 Moisturizer I have yet to have any dry skin ! It also does not leave a greasy after feel on your skin. It's great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first tried this product, wasn't sure if I'd like it. I have been using for over a week now as a daily moisturizer and weekly mask. First of all, it is easy to apply and add into any beauty and skin care regimen. I have to say, my skin has improved. It feels softer and does not dry out. Besides the fact it works, I also love that is formulated with green tea and not greasy. Will definitely keep using and recommend to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how smooth and soft it is. I have sensitive skin, but this did not make me break out. This is my new go to moisturizer. I like that it is not greasy, and that it cleans as well as moisturizes. It has great scent, even my husband likes to use it as his daily moisturizer.

"I started using this 3-in-1 Garnier moisturizer two weeks ago and love it. My face usually gets so dry and crusty during the cold weather, but I finally found the best product for it. I use it every morning and it's not oily and leaves my skin feeling fresh! After using it as a mask one night it left my face soft.The scent is also not harsh which is a big plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have oily/combination skin and most every product makes my skin break out, and this Garnier 3-in-1 skin moisturizer has no harsh chemicals. I love just about everything about this product, to it's super fast absorbing moisturizer, it's light and clean smell, refrishingly cool feeling, airy thickness, and no left over residue. In all honestly the only downside is I wish I had more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The green tea balancing 3-in-1 moisturizer kept my skin hydrated all day and night. I like the non-greasy feel of it. I have oily sensitive skin and I love the way it feels on my face. I like using it morning and night before bed. I highly recommend this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a lot of redness in my skin and it is sensitive. The Garnier SkinActive with Green Tea has been a great product for me. It doesn't leave my skin oily but wonderfully moisturized. My skin look more even and less redness. Friends noticed within days of me using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think Garnier Skin Active works like it says it does. Now days it hard to find a product that is for your skin care that actually does what it says it will do! I really like the fact that you can use it as a mask or just a moisturizer on your face. I also used it on my neck and hands. Works great!!! I also like the fact that it does NOT have an overpowering scent! Some things on the market are to ""smelly"" for me to use due to my sensitive nose! lol I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using the product already for four days and I love it. It is a light cream and it does not leave my face all greasy at all. I feel that it moistures my face and now that winter is coming, I need a face cream like this because my face gets too dry and now it will be very moisture. Also when I take pictures or selfie, my face does not look all greasy like before. I also love that is 3 in 1. I can use it all the time; day, night and use it as a mask. I save money and it is super convenient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This green tea moisturizer is very beneficial! In the fall and winter months, my face gets very dry and irritated, but this moisturizer helps with all of that. I have noticed that my face feels very soft, smooth, and hydrated. It also helps to even out skin tone and reduces/fades redness. I like that I can use it as a day/night moisturizer or I can use it as a mask. Definitely a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion is absolutely amazing! I hate and I mean hate when any lotion leaves your hands and fave oily or greasy feeling. For that reason I NEVER use lotion. I wanted to try this because it says it's not oily. It is absolutely not oily at all! It leaves your face feeling smooth and clean! The texture is smooth, and does not leave any oily feeling on your hands from applying it to your face!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the moisturizer at night after washing face, and it left it feeling soft and smooth all night and the next day. Does not leave skin oily. I will definitely keep using Garnier SkinActive as a daily moisturizer! I would recommend this to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier's SkinActive 3-in-1 moisturizer is a great addition to any skin care routine. I preferred to use it as a night moisturizer, as it felt a little heavy for daytime. It absorbs fast and is non-greasy. After using for almost a week my skin felt so much softer and well hydrated. I do have sensitive skin and it did not make me breakout. The only thing I noticed was the green tea scent was very strong, I didn't mind it but some people might. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this face cream, its a great moisturized, I love using it in the day because it get absorbs super quickly and I can apply my makeup right away. the texture is really amazing, is not too heavy and not too greasy so its perfect for my skin type I highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have troubles acne and combination skin. I struggle finding a face moisturizer that fits my skin needs. This product works wonders! It smells great and feels very smooth. It isn't taky or oily. Its thicker than other lotions but it drys matte. I would recommend anyone to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have oily skin and usually don't like how moisturisers tend to make me feel even more oily. This product is actually mild and non-greasy. I like the clean fresh scent it's not too overpowering perfumed. Leaves my skin feeling so soft. Totally loving this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

For years I have suffered with sensitive skin and any product I used either irritated it or was too oily. This Garnier Skin Active 3-in-1 seriously exceeded my expectations. I have been using it as a mask a couple of times a week and a moisturizer twice a day and I can already notice a difference! Officially my go-to skin care product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great! I have been using it for 2 days and can already tell and feel a difference in my face!!! The fragrance is a bit strong but it smells amazing! It glides on smooth and dries instantly to a soft finish which I love [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Smells amazing and awesome moisturizer. Very light on my face and doesn't leave my face feeling extra oily. I haven't used it as a mask just yet but i'm sure it will be just as great as using it for a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A little bit goes a long way, even as a mask this awesome cream will last for quite a while. It has nice cooling sensation as it permeates the skin. It is not greasy at all and keeps the skin hydrated but not oily even throughout wearing makeup on top of it all day. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I even have my mom trying it out with me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very impressed with my Garnier 3-N-1 moisturizer it smells amazing! After using this product, I have to say it is convenient... day /night and mask works for all purposes and leaves your skin feeling, looking and smelling wonderfully! My only complain would be that my skin is very sensitive and there was a slight tingling for 10 minutes or so after you but very minor overall great and efficient product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As soon as I got in my Garnier SkinActive Balancing 3-in-1 Moisturizer I had to try it. As soon as i opened the jar there was an inviting smell of green tea. I decided to start with doing the mask. I applied a thick layer of moisturizer on my face and left it on for 10 minutes. Afterwards, I noticed that my face was so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It feels light, has a pleasant scent, and makes my oily skin have a matte look. Don't let the thickness of this cream fool you, its not heavy at all. This jar will last a long time as just a tiny bit goes a long way for daily use. I love that it's a mask as well. My face has never looked or felt fresher! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With face masks, I always look for the ones that help my dry skin, has natural ingredients, and smells good. Garnier SkinActive 3 in 1 moisturizing mask is possibly the best I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Just with the first use my skin feels very moisturized and way less dry. The vegan formual and naturally derived ingredients makes me love this product even more. Best part though? The green tea scent is amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the Garnier 3 in 1. Not only is it a morning moisturizer it is also a night moisturizer and Mask. It's vegan and naturally derived and doesn't have the harmful chemicals I don't like in my products. I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that isn't too greasy. This product wasn't greasy at all and I am able to use it morning and night. It also has a light delicate scent that isn't too over powering! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer is great. I have tried several different kinds because I have combination of oily to dry on different parts of my face. I used this and it kept my face balanced all day with a nice finish. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Garnier SkinActive 3-1 moisturizer is amazing! At first glance, i wondered what the 3-1 in part was about. Well, it means you can use this product in the morning and night plus you can use it as a 10 minute face mask. After one day's use my skin feels so much more hydrated, soft, and a lot less oily than it usually is. The smell of this product is refreshing and the fact this product is vegan makes it all the better. Definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was on the market for a new moisturizer. I'm trying to get into a new skin care routine that has ingredients good for your skin. Coming across this 3 in 1 moisturizer has really been a miracle! It's VEGAN! Doesn't have the fillers and chemicals I don't want on my face. And the smell! It smells so dang good! Any moisturizer that can also sub as a mask is phenomenal in my book. Garnier is really stepping it up on its skin care line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product!! The fist day I saw it I was excited about it being Vegan formulated, and it didn't contain parabens, oils, or dyes. It is also unique that not only can you use it as a daily/nightly moisturizer, but a mask as well. I have combination skin so I wasn't really sure how well it would work for me but 1 week strong and my face feels fantastic everywhere even in the tough oily areas. I would highly recommend Garnier Skin Active you will love it too!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer isn't like other products I've tried. I have very sensitive, dry flaky skin and it is hard to find something that works for me. This product has a very pleasant scent and absorbed right away. My skin feels very smooth and took care of the flaky dry patches, without it leaving it feeling oily. I will continue to use this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing. Easy to apply and my face feels so soft and hydrated! I also found out that it really makes your tattoo pop! I will definitely be recommending to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product What schooling had a pleasant smell and was absorbed into my skin very fast. My face was less oily this morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just bought Garnier SkinActive 3in1 cream. I love the product however the packaging is deceiving. When I opened the content is only half full as before. I can't even upload a photo to show. A bad marketing strategy - they even increase the price but the quality and quantity suffers.
"I bought this a couple days ago as my first mask. First of all, it was amazing ahhhhhh. What more can I say? Definitely cooling and very refreshing and as someone who has oily skin, it made my skin not oily and very healthy looking. 10/10 gonna buy more."
I bought this a few weeks ago and it is a lovely moisturizer. It has mattified the oily T Zone area on my face and isgentle enough to nourish the dry areas of my face also. This is AMAZING for people with combination skin. It has a nice light scent. It isnt harsh or greasy. I didnt have any breakouts or bad reactions to it. Also...it doesnt stink like most moisturizers. Im weird about smells so I was pleasantly surprised about the nice light fresh scent of this moisturizer. Also my skin looks great!!!
"Garnier Green Tea Balancing 3-in-1 Moisturizer is awesome. My first thought was that it would be too heavy and rich. I was pleasantly surprised that it absorbed so easily and did not leave my face looking or feeling greasy. Perfect balance of richness and absorption. Even better, it did not cause any breakouts. Let me say that again...No breakouts. Winner. Yea! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The moisturizer smells great and leaves your facing feeling wonderful. My only complaint is that I have combination skin and while 75% of my face feels wonderful my poor forehead is super oily a few hours later. I'm still going to use it to see if it clears itself up or not. For anyone else with normal skin I would totally recommend this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the only facial moisturizer I've found that doesn't cause me to break out. I've tried tons of other brands, including Neutrogena, for every skin type and they've all cause blemishes except this one. I'm not particularly fond of the scent, but that's small potatoes."
I bought this about six months ago. I use it morning and night. I have mature skin . My skin usually gets extremely dry in the winter especially. Since using this I havent had dry skin at all. My skin looks smoother when applying makeup. The scent is amazing.
"I gave this thing several tries. Didn't really work for me. It leaves my face very greasy and shiny. No ""balancing"" whatsoever. Also the smell... can't stand it. Way too oppressive. I guess it's time to say goodbye."
"I really like what this product did for my skin. I used it at night time before going to bed and when I woke up, my skin felt fresh and had a nice matte look - no more shine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Best moisturizer Iâve ever tried! I have oily/combo skin and this really does balance my skin out so I am hydrated but not too oily. Will always repurchase
I am really leery about using moisturizer due to the fact I find they clog my pores and break me out more. I did not have this with Green Tea Balancing 3-in-1 Moisturizer. I definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So, I tried the Garnier Skin Active 3in1 face moisturizing cream. I like the fact this is a vegan formula as it is hard to find known brands which are affordable that cater to the health conscious. As the season continue to change my skin becomes dry and irritated. This cream can be used day or night. I used this twice a day and has made my skin feel more soft and smooth. Absolutely no irritation. This is a great + trying to find something that actually works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the cream for a few weeks now and I can honestly say at this point I haven't had a real change in the moisture of my skin or appearances. The green tea is nice in the morning to invigorate and wake yourself up but other than I was not overly impressed with the product as a whole. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination skin and after using Garnier Skin Active Green Tea Moisturizer my Skin was still dry in some patches and the rest of my face was very greasy feeling. I personally did not like this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best moisturizer for combination skin that i have found in quite some time. The jar is huge ( which i wish i whould have realized before getting it) and will last a long time. Its non greasy so afterward i dont have a layer of film on my face. The only thing that is a little off putting is that it smells a little bit medicine-ey. However the smell does fade pretty quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that I don't have to use two different moisturizers for day and night. It was very light and did not make my skin feel or look greasy. It also smells really good too. I had to hide it from my teen daughter because she liked it for her face too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is very sensitive to perfumes, lotions & dye. But this product has not cause any adverse reaction to my skin. As a matter of fact it has helped my sensitive skin. It feel wonderful. My skin is softer. No redness. I love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for about a year now. Doesn't upset my acne and leaves a great moisturized surface for my makeup. A little goes a long way!
"Garnier's green tea moisturizer does exactly what it promises! It is very light so my skin doesn't feel greasy at all, but it definitely feels softer and kind of lightly dewy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face becomes really dry after I take a shower and I always need to use a moisturizer to hydrate my face . Since using the Garnier Skin Active moisturizer with Green Tea on my face , I notice my skin feels silky and smooth. I'm glad that I can use a product that is parabens free and ingredients like Green Tea is an added bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little hesitant to try this moisturizer because it's not a brand I usually go for. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. It was nice and light with a very mellow fragrance. Light and fresh-just what I look for in a facial moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this moisturizer works very well. It moisturized my dry spots and did not leave my skin oily like some other moisturizers. It smells really good and my skin feels much smoother now after using this for the last couple of weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the Garnier Skin Active Moisturizer for the past two weeks in the morning and at bedtime. I like the non-greasy feel of the cream. It does absorb well and I like the clean smelling fragrance also. I can tell my skin is not as oily and feels more supple and soft to the touch. I would definitely recommend and purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive and relatively dry skin, but when I say adding this 3-in-1 moisturizer to my daily routine has done wonders, it has truly done wonders. Normally I don't moisturize my face after cleansing as I was always afraid of appearing oily, this product gives me just enough moisture without the extra grease. I have completely changed my regimen due to this product alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is so smooth and smells so good. It makes your face feel so smooth, I actually put some on my legs as well because I loved the way it felt. I have told my family about this as well. You don't get the greasy look, it gives you a slight gleam without the shine to it. Only downfall is I don't like is that it doesn't have any SPF in it for the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for about 3 weeks now I love the way it makes my face feel. I use it twice a day morning and night and my skin feels very hydrated and soft. Also my face never feels oily. I just wish that it would tighten up my face. I also use this 3-1 moisturizer on my hands because with the weather changing to cold and dry my hands were so dry. This Garnier skin active green tea three and one moisturizer has a very mild scent that I like. Overall a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day and night mask has been a welcome addition to my beauty routine! My face both looks and feels great, and it doesn't look oily after. I appreciate the fact that the product is 97 % derived from natural ingredients. Wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin feels amazing! Seriously, I have not put this cream down since I got it. My face is softer than it has been in years and my skin tone looks more even. I don't feel the need to cake on my foundation to disguise the red spots. My husband has even commented on the softness of my skin. I love the smell, it's not overwhelming and I don't feel like it was made for my 70 year old grandma. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way it goes on, not greasy or sticky. Small amont on face and next is enough. I don't like the smell and this would make it for me not to buy be product. Have been using it for a while and don't see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With my sensitive skin, I have been only using this cream at night. It feels great & even smells good! It reminds me of my mom's face lotion, she used to take make up off with & moisturized with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best moisturizer I have used yet! It's a great size for what you would pay for it. The formula is a consistency between lotion and a paste. Absorbs instantly, doesn't feel greasy and makes your skin soft as silk. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product didn't really seem to help with moisturizing or cutting back shine. It left patches of dryer skin which was more irritating. Only bonus to this product was it didn't cause my face to break out like other moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tend to break out with moisturizers, but I was pleasantly surpised by this one. I used it in the morning and it didn't make my skin greasy or shiny. It absorbed quickly and made my skin feel silky. I also tried it at night and woke up with skin that felt the right amount of glossy and hydrated, but not greasy or saturated. I've always thought moisturizers didn't work for my skin, but this one is actually working wonders. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Garnier's Green Tea Balancing 3-in-1 Moisturizer. My skin has been so soft since I started using this product. It's light and smells good too! Only downside is that it doesn't contain any spf for daytime use, but I make sure to put it on everynight before bed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I will admit I am not the best at moisturizing because it delays putting on my makeup. This helps me so much bc it dries and feels good so fast. There is no oily feeling after the fact and I can put it on before make up and then when I go to bed and not feel greasy. It is a very easy moisturizer to add to a routine because it does not add any hassle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this is multifaceted and is able to be used in more than one way. Absolutely would recommend. My favorite use was as a mask! I loved that my skin was actually a lot less noticeably oily the next day after using it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that Garnier SkinActive makes my skin radiant and glow but the smell of this product could smell better. I love that it gets deep down and really moisturizes my skin and the cool feeling that it has when I apply it. I'd say overall, it's a must to have, for men and women. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is wonderful! It smells great and feels great! I've noticed a difference in the hydration, elasticity, and overall appearance of my skin. I love using the mask at night. My face feels so smooth afterwards. I use it everyday. Usually in the fall my face is so dry, but not this year! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is an excellent moisturizer. I have dry and sensitive skin and after using this product for a week I can definitely see and feel the difference. My skin feels soft and moisturized and I can apply without problem my makeup. The reason I give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have sunscreen so I can only apply it at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like how smooth the product is. It goes on easily and absorbs fast. I also enjoy the smell, very clean and refreshing. Overall I'm happy with the product, it helps my skin feel clean and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with the way my face looks and feels after using this for one week! At 48, living in the deep South exposed to the sun a lot my face needed help. This was just what the doctor ordered! I am happily hydrated with Garnier Skin Active Green Tea Balancing 3 in 1 Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier knocked it out of the park with this product. Seasonal transitions have always been rough on my skin, but this super moisturizing cream has kept the irritation and flaky skin away. I love the scent! Each day the smell transforms my bathroom into a spa. I will definitely keep this product in my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I think of moisture I think of shine. This product does what it says! With the cold months ahead I am so excited to have a product that helps with moisture while eliminating shine!! It has been well over a week and my skin looks and feels amazing! Every day has been a good skin day. And that is something I haven't said in a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer is an excellent product. It was very light and smooth to put on. It absorbs into the skin quickly. I even used this product on my elbows and within 3 days they were so smooth. My face hasn't been this smooth in years. This is an excellent moisturizer!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I'm loving it thus far. I have combination/oily skin that is sensitive and I have to be careful with trying new products. I use about a dime size at morning and at night and my skin looks amazing. My large pores are becoming smaller and smaller and my skins looks radiant. I think I will keep this as part of my regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, this moisturizer smells amazing! And second, it makes my skin feel so soft! I've been using it every morning and night for a week now and my skin is much less dry and looks brighter. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great moisturizer you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. I was skeptical at first but after using it for about a week I can tell a difference in the look and feel of my skin. It didn't make my skin feel heavy or greasy. The product glides on smooth and absorbs quickly feeling almost weightless. It doesn't have a strong smell to it like some facial products do and a little goes a long way. I look forward to continuing the use of this wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so glad I tried Garnier Skin Active! It smells amazing and just a little dab goes a long way. At first when I saw that it was suggested I use it morning and night plus a mask twice a week I figured that it wouldn't last long but boy was I wrong. Not only does a little go a long way but it also smells amazing! My skin looked better than it has in a long time and even my teenagers face is clearer, smoother and less oily.

"my experience with this product was amazing! I don't usually try different products on my face,I was impressed,I noticed a real diference in my appearance,excited to know,that it didn't have any dyes in it.Also liked the idea of a face mask at night.Thanks!!

"This lotion is very nice. It smells really refreshing, is cool and nice to apply. It also absorbs well. The only factor i didn't like was its effectiveness. I applied it twice a day and with winter conditions, my skin still felt really dry mid day. I may continue to use as a night time lotion, but not for the day. Maybe in summer time it will have a longer lasting moisturizer. That being said, it comes with a huge amount in the bottle and I still look forward to using it every night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My first initial thought was WOW. With in minutes my face felt the softest it's been in years! 2 weeks into using this product and it still feels amazing. Best part is my daughter who has sensitive skin hasn't had any break out with it either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is doing wonders for my skin. I have rosacea, and my skin is easily inflamed. Not only does this moisturize without clogging my pores, but it has a calming effect on my skin. I feel a soothing sensation when I apply it that I just don't get from other brands. After using this morning and night for several days, I've noticed my skin feels hydrated and fresh. It makes a nice base to foundation application as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really enjoyed this product. It had a great texture that wasn't too thick to clog my pores but moisturizing enough to make my skin feel great. It smelled really nice as well. I love the green tea aspect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just started using it. Seems to be very good for my skin. It's not greasy to the touch and goes on really well. What little time I have been using this, I can tell a difference. I am expecting great things before I finish my first jar. There will be a second jar in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never used a facial moisturizer before and I love this one! It made my skin feel so good! I used it every morning and every night before bed. Love that it was an open container and not a pump. Very easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love using this product! As Fall weather has kicked in with the dry air, this moisturizer has made my skin feel soft and hydrated. I used it as a mask too and it helped to make my skin look fresh and clean. I really like how light it feels and I can't tell I am even wearing product. I definitely recommend this moisturizing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Green Tea Balancing 3-in-1 Moisturizer is a good general use facial moisturizer. It has a nice texture and a pleasant green tea fragrance. It works well as a light daily moisturizer and didn't seem to irritate my sensitive skin issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Natural ingredients, pleasant smell ... but it didn't work for me. I have aging combination skin. This didn't absorb well for me, hours later my face still felt oily. If you have all dry skin, this may work for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the fact that this moisturizer is not made with oils so it doesn't make my pores feel clogged and sweat. I can use it everyday and my face does not break out. It also smells great and has a bit of cool/tingly sensation when first applied. I have used it everyday for 2 weeks now and I have done the night mask two times. So far I absolutely love it and will definitely keep it in my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a hard time find a moisturizer for my face. With winter time now my face feels like it is dry and gets itchy. At the same time I also have oily skin. So using a moisturizer is hard because it causes acne very easily. I have used this on my face every night now for 12 day before bed. There have been no acne breakouts from it and it is keeping my face hydrated not feeling dry and itchy. I will definitely get this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was great for my skin. I have sensitive, combination skin and the ingredients weren't harsh on my skin at all. After using it for about 2 days, I could already tell a difference. It did not dry out or break out my skin which is rare. It has a relaxing spa-like smell and feel to it. My skin felt balanced and smooth. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the fact that the ingredients were mostly derived from nature. This gave the lotion a smooth natural feel and left my skin feeling soft. The lotion was great for morning and night but I didn't like using it as a mask- it wasn't thick enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Good moisturizer especially with the cold weather coming. I generally prefer a lighter moisturizer but even though this was a bit heavier than I normally use it went on smoothly, didn't leave my face feeling greasy and it was great to wear under make up. The moisturizer was refreshing and made my skin feel good. It had a nice fresh scent and attractive packaging. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only been using the Garnier green tea for 2 days and i'm loving it. I put it on last night and my face felt so hydrated and smooth when i woke up. Will definitely recommend to friends and family. It also has a nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is hands down the best face moisturizer I've ever used. It dries quickly on your face and does not leave any type of sticky or oily residue. My face gets very dry in the winter time and this really combats that not to mention is excellent to rejuvenate your skin. It's very light, absorbs great with no oily base at all. The fragrance is minimal. No irritation to my skin at all. Just a dime size in your hand goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first thing I noticed about this product was the lovely scent. I also like that it didn't feel heavy or sticky when I put it on my face. It absorbs rather quickly so it doesn't slow down my morning routine and it leaves my skin amazingly soft. This moisturizer is definitely a keeper and I will continue to use this product. The only thing negative I can come up with about this product is the lack of SPF protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this moisturizer. First of all, it smells amazing! It so refreshing. And it makes my face feel incredible. I'm someone who tends to buy moisturizer and then never use it because it makes my face feel heavy or oily. Not so with the Garnier Green Tea balancing moisturizer. It really is balancing, and works perfectly with my combination skin. I definitely recommend this face cream to anyone who likes a lighter feeling moisturizer, and wants to smell yummy all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is absolutely a great product, I just wish it had spf included. This goes on super smooth, absorbs quick and doesn't feel greasy. It feels very moisturizing though at the same time. It feels and smells like a high quality product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always hesitant to use lotions on my face because I feel like they cause me to break out. When I first put this on, for a few minutes afterwards it did feel greasy. And I got scared. But after a few minutes, it all soaked in and dried, it really wasn't greasy at all. My skin felt smooth and well-hydrated. And I didn't experience any breakouts! The lotion had a refreshing green tea scent, making it feel clean. I'm definitely adding this to my nightly face routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a huge fan of lotions because I don't like the greasy feeling I'm left with. And facial lotion/moisturizer has always been out of the question because my face is already oily. This moisturizer leaves my face soft, but doesn't leave an oily feeling even after applying my makeup over top. Hands down, the best face moisturizer I've come across! Within a day I could already feel the difference in my skin! It smells very clean and fresh too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product changed how I feel about skin care. I never thought I could like a moisturizer. I was skeptical when taking this on but I was willing to give it a shot. My skin produces oil like crazy, practically running off my nose and forehead. Since using this product that output has decreased significantly. I can wear glasses without them sliding off my nose! Plus it smells great! I would definitely recommend this to someone with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using green tree moisturizer by Garnier for 7 days now. My skin has not been nearly as oily as it usually is. Also, I've noticed my makeup going on smoother then it used to, which is fantastic! I plan to continue using it as well as recommending it to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually dislike a lot of moisturizers due to their greasy, heavy feeling. Garnier Skin Active wasn't greasy nor heavy. I used it 2x a day and my dry skin cleared up within a few days. I enjoy that it is Vegan and naturally derived. No dyes or parabens made it my must try. It was even safe to use on my sensitive skin! I enjoyed the affordability of this product compared to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Garnier green tea moisturizer is absolutely wonderful. It really made my face soft and was not oily. I used it in the morning and at night before bed. I would definitely buy it again. I little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the new Garnier green tea moisturizer. It goes on smooth and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. This moisturizer is thicker than most, but for me I liked that because my skin tends to be dry. I really love the smell of the product, it isn't overwhelming, but more of a light, fresh smell. I also really like the way the product is packaged. Unlike traditional pump or squeeze tube packaging I know I am getting all of the product out of this package. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way this makes my face feel after a shower. after washing my face, it gets very dry, but putting this on after I get home, helps it feel so rejuvenated. after working a 10 hour shift, I feel very gross, that I will actually go home and put this on, just to feel relaxed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A little bit goes a long way! When I put it on my face, it almost felt like water it was so hydrating. I have seen a difference in the dryness of my face for Sure! I love this stuff so much! I even forget to put it on at night and in the morning and my face is still really hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far this product is Ok, Have not really tried it as a mask yet. But I realize that it may not work in a couple of days. Good thing is that most products like this cause major break outs to my face and this one hasn't, so for that 2 thumbs up!! Does not have any harsh odor, or cause weird tingling to the face. I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I've been using Garnier Skin Active for a little over a week now and I really like it. It leaves my face soft and moist. It smells great as well. I love that it didn't feel heavy or make my face feel oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't often use products on my face, since I have such sensitive skin. I easily break out so I usually just stick to soap and water. But since I got this I thought I'd really give it a shot and it was not unpleasant. It was gentle on my skin and not too oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product. It does everything it claims too. The cream goes on so smooth without leaving a heavy feeling behind which I hate. I've only been using it for about a week but I think my skin looks and feels better. It does have a noticeable fragrance which some may not care for. I really like the multi use options. I usually put it on before bed but can also use it as a mask if my skin is feeling dry. Overall I really like this product and I will definitely continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not greasy and it sets in quick! It has a great smell, but its not overpowering. I love that it 97% plant derived as I am trying to find more natural products to use. Would recommend to friends and family [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I really like the Garner Skin Active lotion. The packaging is very nice. I also thought the smell of the lotion was subtle, nice, and not overpowering. Many times when I try a lotion, the smell is so strong I can hardly stand to wear it. I struggle with dry skin on my face and after using this, for about a week, my face feels very smooth and my dry skin is almost gone. I will definitely use this product in the future and will recommend it to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the scent of this cream. It feels like silk in your fingers. Applies smoothly and soaks right in. .I tend to be a little oily but with this My skin hasn't been at all. I would suggest it to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is great! It is naturally derived. It is natural so no worries about putting bad antigens on your skin. After just one use my skin automatically felt smooth. As a person with oily skin, this moisturizer worked fantastic. It did not create more oil and made my face smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is an awesome product. It does wonders for my face. I have super dry skin and this makes all my dry spots disappear. My skin isn't rough and flakey anymore. It's so smooth and hydrated. My makeup goes on and stays in so much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The new Garnier SkinActive Vegan Formula is the ABSOLUTE BEST facial moisturizer I've ever tried! I never used any other moisturizer daily because they always made my skin feel oily and dull, but this stuff is the bomb! I love it! It's light, non-greasy, and doesn't make me feel like I just lathered up with mayonnaise! I use it in both the am and pm and am still amazed by how much better my skin is feeling and looking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a really great product for your face. I use to go between a greasy and dry face all the time. This green tea balancing 3 in 1 moisturizer hydrated my skin, and even brightened it up! My face no longer looks dull and greasy, but now bright and hydrated... oh, did I mention it doesn't clog your pores like others Do? I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great moisturizer! Have been using this for about a week and can see a noticeable improvement in my skin. I have excema and very sensitive skin so it's hard for me to find lotions that work without side effects. Loving this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a new mom, I've loved using this product. It's easy to use, smells great and most importantly leaves your skin feeling amazing. I love the multiple uses for this product and that it can also be used as a face mask. I will definitely buy this product again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product since day 1, in the morning and night. I gotta say that I like the formula because it's not oily at all and sets very well on my skin. The scent is soft and what I like the most about this product is the fact that is made with natural ingredients. My face looks more renovated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really do like this product. I love that just a little goes a long way. It is not greasy. It does not dry out my skin. My face looks and feels smoother and not dried out. I will know more when winter come and my skin is usually drier. I only use it at night as it doesn't contain sunscreen. One of the reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is I can't use it in the morning alone. I have not tried it as a mask yet, so i can't comment on that use. User friendly packaging as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to try the Green Tea Balancing 3-1 Moisturizer for at least 2 wks. before reviewing it. I really do enjoy this product. The scent is soft, fresh and a tingle cooling effect. I have pretty balanced skin, no trouble zones. But, after using this product my face feels so hydrated. It isn't a heavy cream that sits on your face it absorbs nicely, which also allows for nice makeup application. I love the product. I only wish it had some sort of SPF for day application [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think Garnier SkinActive is the best moisturizer I've ever used!! I put it on everyday after my shower and it wakes my skin up and leaves it extremely soft. It doesn't leave a greasy feeling at all! This is now my go to face moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like that this can be used on my sensitive skin! I like that it is not greasy, so my skin does not feel oily after. I like using the cream more at nighttime because I like something with SPF during the day. I have combination skin, so it feels like Goldilocks - not too thick for oily skin and it takes care of dry spots at the same time. Only two complaints, no SPF and not ""Anti-Aging"" as I need now in my 30s. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing I noticed was the light, clean, fresh scent. It felt silky and luxurious and I was reminded of being a child and sneaking some of my moms expensive face creams. I could hardly believe this could be bought in a drug store. I used the moisturizer in place of my regular day and night creams and was pleased by how lightweight it felt on my combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this product!! It smells amazing and what it does for my skin is nothing short of amazing!! I have been using it a few times a week for a 2 weeks and i already notice how much better my face feels(soft,smooth,hydrated). I will definitely be buying this product and recommending it to all my friends!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful moisturizer that makes your skin silky smooth, moisturized and leaves a matte finish. My skin is oily but sensitive, so finding products is a struggle. I love that this product is fast absorbing, has a fresh green tea scent, and will last for a long time - you only need a small amount. However, there's salicylic acid (anti-acne) which makes my skin peel under make-up. But I love using it on days I don't wear make-up! Definitely give this moisturizer a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far, I am in love with this product! I use it as my daily moisturizer. I have combination skin, so I have to walk the fine line between moisturizing and greasy. I am happy to say that's garnier is a perfect match! It's smells amazing, goes on smooth, and doesn't make my face feel oily at all. Plus- a little goes a long way. It will probably take me a year to get through this whole container! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really appreciate the effort to have this be for day and night as well as thicker application for a mask. It is hard to always keep track of my many containers. I liked the fresh feeling as well as smell because I don't love the greasy lotions that tend to be more organic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this moisturizer! I like a matte finish on my face. I'm not sure how they make a moisturizer that delivers moisture yet stays matte but they have! I love the fact that it is mostly naturally derived and I like the green tea smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Using this product day and night as directed I can definitely feel a difference in my skin. Immediately my face is soft and ready for makeup. Cream absorbs nicely and does not leave any greasy/oily residue. I love that the tub is so big so it will last awhile as you only need a very small amount. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cold weather has my skin so dried out and after one use of the green tea moisturizer I felt a magnificent change. It's so light and creamy and left my skin feeling soft, smooth and rehydrated not oily or greasy like my initial concerns. My skin felt completely refreshed! I also like that the scent isn't to overpowering. This quickly became a product I didn't want to go a day without! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first, I was a little nervous to use this product because I have extremely sensitive skin; but I went ahead and used it, and am so glad I did! The texture is very light and does not leave my skin oily like similar products have; it has a very relaxing scent to it; I had no reaction to it; and, best of all, I saw improvement in my skin after only three uses! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't make my face super greasy, but after trying this I don't think I'll ever use another moisturizer again. I also have very sensitive skin and usually break out when I try anything new but I didn't with this. Also love the light scent, it's not too powerful. I will definitely continue using this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product in the evenings as a nighttime cream and my skin definitely felt more moisturizer than usual. It doesn't have a heavy fragrance and even with my sensitive skin I didn't have any problems. I will continue to use this as part of my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this. It does exactly what it says. I'm picky with skin care because I work in a dermatology office. I've worked in derm for 7 years and I have full access to tons of products that are only available in a medical office. This made my skin feel just as good if not better. I've only used it as a night moisturizer so far but I'm excited for its other uses [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Talk about an amazing, refreshing, and hydrating moisturizer! At first I got a little greedy and put on a lot more than I needed, when really all you need is less than a dime sized amount to make all the difference! It dries quickly so your face doesn't feel damp after applying. I have very sensitive skin, but this moisturizer was perfect and dint give me any problems. In fact it seemed to have helped my skin clear up some! Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great face moisturizer! Living in the desert I'm constantly fighting dry skin and Garnier's Green Tea 3 in 1 Moisturizer provides soft and silky skin without feeling greasy. A little goes a long way, using too much gives a heavy feeling, but the outcome is still healthy looking skin that's baby soft to the touch. I didn't care much for the fragrance, but it was easy to see past that. I would highly recommend this green tea moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked using this product and I love that it's a 3-1. I gave this 4:5 stars because it felt a little heavy on my face which is something o normally don't like. But overall I really liked it and it kept my skin moisturizer all day without getting too oily. It's perfect for day:night use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love how my skin feels from this product. It was light but so moisturizing. My skin didn't feel greasy at all. Just soft and silky. The only thing I didn't love about the product was the smell. I felt like it had too much of an alcohol undertone. It's not super strong though so it didn't bother me much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this product. I have oily skin and I am always skeptic about trying moisturizers because they tend to make my skin look and feel oily but I was pleasantly surprised! It melted right into my skin, made it feel super smooth and refreshed. It smelled great and wasn't think. I loved that it's a 3 in 1 product that you can also use as a mask. I will definitely be recommending this product to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For starters, this moisturizer smells great. It's a clean and refreshing scent. The cream isn't very thick so I'm not sure how well it would work for a face mask. I apply this in the morning and evening. A little goes a long way. It absorbs nicely leaving my skin feeling and looking balanced. I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried the Rose Water version of this product before, but this is my first time trying the Green Tea version. I was much happier with the Rose Water version. The Green Tea version doesn't seem to have much scent and was nowhere near as thick. (Since one of the ""3-in-1"" options is a moisturizing face mask, I think thicker is definitely better.) It wasn't bad overall, but I don't think I'll be trying it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product, I had been experiencing dry skin I guess because of the weather changing, and I was just using body lotion and it wasn't really helping, but garnier skinactive really helped since the first use, my skin feels soothe and soft. But not oily. I'm really happy with this product. I definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin so I was a big apprehensive to try this out, however I actually like it a lot! I will say it feels a little heavy at first but it seemed to keep my skin hydrated all day, which is the goal, considering I have very dry skin. I like this a lot better than other drug store brands I have bought and like that it doesn't make me feel greasy by the end of the day like other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about a week now and am really happy with it. My face feels great! I haven't used it as a mask yet, but will definitely be trying it soon. I like that it is not a heavy moisturizer and I can use it both day and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizing/ mask combo is actually really good. It feels heavy but applys light. I suffer from pretty oily skin and I was surprised how much of a difference it made, Day after day my face truly appeared more matte! I even was able to substitute it for a primer. Very impressed!

I have been using the Garnier skinactive 3 in one and I absolutely love it. It is Vegan formula so it is all natural. My face feels so soft and looks healthy already and it has only been a couple of days. My daughter with moderate acne has been using it too and loves it. You have to try it. You will not be sorry.

"Garnier SkinActive smells so clean, I love it. It's the first thing I noticed. I've been using the moisturizer for about a week now and let me tell you, my skin feels so soft! The vegan cream is a bit on the thicker side so I would suggest using a small amount at first to see what you like. 97% naturally derived ingredients makes me feel good about using it. So happy with this, it will defiantly become part of my nightly routine!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a little hesitant about this product thinking it would make my skin super oily but it did not. It made my skin so soft I loved how it made my face feel. I have combination skin so I will be using this product this winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I suffer from really bad dry skin. I was hesitant to try Gariner skin active, but was pretty impressed by the moisture that it gave my face.

I really love this moisturizer. I have dry skin and live in a dry climate. This formula works pretty well with my skin type and the climate. The product absorbs pretty quickly and leaves you feeling hydrated with a nice sheen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually don't use face lotion because my skin is combination oily and sensitive. This lotion worked well, it does make your face look matte which I liked. It is very fast absorbing, when you first put it on it feels thick but it absorbs in seconds. My face didn't break out with this lotion like it does with others. And it has a nice scent- not too strong. Overall a nice face lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This 3-1 moisturizer is amazing. First the smell is great. It's like a fresh light clean type of smell. I have combo skin and I use this after I shower and it gives my skin the prefect amount of hydration. I don't get that too-oily feeling at all. It's very light and I still feel like my skin can breathe after I apply it. Definitely loving this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is great day or night. Was not too heavy like some creams can be. A little bit goes a long way and leaves skin moisturized but not with a greasy feel. Balanced my skin texture but wished it did a lttle more for tone as i tend to have a natural rosier cheeks. Also has a fresh light scent which I like.

I absolutely love this product. I have never used any moisturizing products but this one is amazing. I have really oily skin in places after the first time I applied it I could a difference in my skin. I am usually picky about the smell of things this has a clean smell aboyt it not over powering. My face feels as smooth as a baby's botton.lol. I would recommend this product and have already recommended this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wonderful product. Leaves skin very soft. Non greasy. And knowing that there is no dyes, oils or parabens is a comforting factor knowing your not putting anything on your son that's full of questionable ingredients . It's vegan as well. Use as mask and day and night moisturizer . Nice base under foundation for all day clean look and feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this daily for some days and I must say it feels weigthless, no greasy which I love because I had some acne in the past, so I need a daily moisturizer free of oil, this one is great hydrates my face, leaving it so soft, and I really love the fact that is Vegan formula which means all naturally and the green tea is a plus, a very great product. Even my husband love it for his face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"On initial trial of this product, the lotion stayed wet for more than 15 minutes after I put it on my face. The second day, I used less (much less). You need only a teeny amount of moisturizer. When used correctly, the benefits were tingling cool skin and moisture through out the day. I went two days with no makeup, my skin felt so nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I couldn't be happier with this product! I have dry, flaky skin so daily moisturizer is a must. This goes on silky and weightless, with no greasy or sticky feeling. It really hydrates my face leaving it soft and smooth all day long. And the smell is amazing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this 3 in 1 face cream. It left my skin moisturized without that oily after feel. I can use it in the morning right before I put on my makeup no wait time required. Also I feel like my face is more balanced and clear. Best part my husband likes the smell of it. Definitely will continue to use this product in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is amazing! It leaves my skin very well hydrated and feeling so soft! I have a dry patch of skin where it's prone to breakouts, when I use this moisturizer the dry patch is no longer dry! Another big plus is that it doesn't have an over powering scent!!!

"First off, I love the scent of this 3-in-1 product. I have sensitive skin and did feel a slight tingling sensation after using it as a mask. Admittedly that had me a bit nervous, but it was fine afterwards and my skin felt softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When applied skin feels immediately refreshed and as time passes Definitely mattified my skin love that it is vegan and contains natural ingredients the only thing I have to complain about is that it's a little too thick for me other than that would use it everyday even as a base for makeup !

"I have used the garnier skin active for 2 days now. I really like the smell, it's clean and fresh. As far as the product being a match for my skin, I don't think so. I have oily skin and prone to breakouts and I never use any kind of lotion or moisturizer on my face because of it. And my experience with this product is the same. I think it would be great for dry skin maybe in the winte time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product now. It comes on so nice on your skin. I would recommend this to the whole bunch of people because it's so good. It also deals with acne to and ingredients are so nice and natural. And this is my first time trying it so I'm really impressed how the outcome came out.

Using Garneirs new moisturizer has definitely been a breath of fresh air. I have very sensitive combination skin and have been looking for a moisturizer for years that evens out my skin without leaving behind oily rashy spots! After using for just a couple of days i have received numerous compliments on how soft and young my skin looks! Thanks Garnier for giving me my confidence back!

It felt super smooth when I first applied it! It absorbed really fast into my skin so my face wasn't shiny or oily looking. I see that the redness in my face went away after using this.

"Wow, do I love this product! Using it daily in the morning and at night has really re-hydrated my skin completely. I was a little wary that it looks a lot heavier than most skin creams I usually use, but after just one use I knew this one was different. There's no heavy feeling, it absorbs beautifully, and I can definitely feel and see a difference in my skin. I love that it has 97% naturally derived ingredients, and it smells like green tea, which is really refreshing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE using this product for morning and night time moisturizing! It smells so good, not too strong at all & didn't leave my face oily after I used it. I wasn't a fan of the mask part because it was just like putting a thick layer of cold lotion on my face then wiping it off after. I would rather use it as a moisturizer and let it soak into much skin. I also have sensitive skin and it doesn't bother me at all, it just soaks right in and makes my face silky smooth!

"I have been using Garnier SkinActive 3-in-1 moisturizer for a few days now and I definitely notice a difference in my skins appearance. Normally very oily, now my skin has a more matte look and it is softer and smoother. I would most definitely recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Garnier Skin Active 3 in 1 Moisturizer for less than a week and can already tell the difference in my skin. My face feels smoother and softer. It does leave my fingers feeling slightly greasy after application but nothing major. The benefits of how my face feels outweighs a little greasy feeling fingers. Overall I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was refreshing. It has a light feel and it is invigorating. When I applied it around my eyes for the morning application it made it feel like I could open them wider. It has a nice smell also. It did leave my fingers with a very slight greasy feel but overall I would recommend it. My skin is softer and more vibrant after just 3 days of use.

"This moisturizer feels creamy and smells great. It really hydrates your skin. I have combination skin, so it really moisturized my dry patches. It however didn't control shine all that well. But I love the green tea in it. And I also love the way it felt on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely amazing! Most moisturizers make me greasy and feel very heavy. But this one kept me matte all day and felt like I just rubbed water all over my face! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has greasy skin and wanting it to be controlled! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love that this is all natural and a 3 in 1 product. It helps reduce the redness and dry skin from my acne. It's light and gentle and not greasy or sticky. I like to use it in the morning and it keeps my skin soft and more even-toned throughout the day. There's no acne medication in it but it still seems to help and I love the fact that I'm not spreading chemicals on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product spreads very easily on the face and also feels super lightweight, smells super clean and makes my face feel fresh.

Left my skin feeling amazing and healthy! I'll definitely buy it again in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off I would like to say I have combination skin. It's very hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't leave me feeling oily and my face feeling heavy. This did an amazing job. I also feel like since I've been using this product I have been less oily. I really like the idea that it's all natural too! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the smell is a little weird, I'm sure this is because of it being all natural [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is dry and sensitive so I was reluctant to try this but to my surprise it works wonders! A little goes a long way and the smell is amazing. I'm left with no dry skin and the softest my face has ever been. Made with green tea and it's vegan! Need I say more? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After a long day at work I get home to oily skin but after I tried this amazing moisturizer my skin does not get oily. I was truly amazed at my results. The best part is the smell , and that it's vegan free. You can use it in the morning, at night, or as a mask. I must say when I would use it as a mask I felt very refreshed. This product deserves the 5 stars. I will definitely keep on using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love garnier skin active personally! All my life I have suffered from dry, sensitive skin. This stuff makes my skin so soft with no sensitivity! Every time it works. The smell is different but good! It feels cool on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask left a lot to be desired. It has a strong perfume smell that lingers after application. The mask felt heavy and sticky on my face and would rub off in chunks more than an hour after applying it. On a more positive side, the packaging is nice. I like that it has a screw on lid so that you are able to access all of the product. It is also a large container and a good value for the amount of product received.

I tried Garnier Green Tea Balancing 3-in-1 Moisturizer with a little hesitation because I have sensitive skin and a lot of products give me red spots. Not only did I not have any red spots but my face has been silky smooth and has stayed that way. Everyone should try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Not only that it works as a face mask as well! You pay one price for so many different qualities and it's great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This 3-1 moisturizer, Is a day cream, a night cream, and a mask. The green tea smell is so pleasant and it leaves my so skin silky smooth. The fact that it is vegan and 97% naturally derived is a total plus. My only complaint is the fact that as a day cream I would like an SPF, so I don't have to layer creams. Garnier is an affordable brand and this is high-quality product 10/10 would recomend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm in love with this product! I apply in the morning to hydrate my skin throughout the day. The results are immediate! It glides across my face with a silky feel and absorbs quickly.

"Garnier's SkinActive is a great product. It has a light scent. While the moisturizer is thick, it rubs in easily and does not leave a greasy or heavy feeling. I feel my skin was visibly less shiny yet well hydrated. Product is very versatile as well (AM, PM and mask) & is 97% natural, so gentle on my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used Garnier SkinActive Balancing Moisturizer for the first time yesterday and I really like it. True to it's claim, it is fast absorbing and my skin has appeared less shiney. It does not feel heavy and it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. My makeup goes on nice over it as well. The only thing I don't care for is the smell. It's just a little off putting, but maybe I just don't like the smell of green tea. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great moisturizer that goes on smooth and keeps make face from getting oily during the day. My makeup went in smoothly and my skin feels great. It is a large bottle so I can get many uses out of it for both day and night. My only drawback was the scent. I didn't love it but it did not affect how it felt on my face.
