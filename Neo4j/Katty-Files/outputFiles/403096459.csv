So I have oily acne prone skin with a lot of acne scarring. When I first started using this there wasn't a big difference but I kept using it because I liked the cooling feeling. I'm now 3+ months into using this cleanser and my face is much clearer than before and soft. It has reduced a lot (not all) of my scarring as well. I use this with the neutragena fight and fade toner followed up with the hydro boost gel moisturizer because the toner can be drying but because it's water based doesn't clog pores!
"I had a different product from Neutrogena that was AMAZING, for some freason it was discontinued so I got this product because of the similarity. Boy was I wrong. The smell is really strong, when I put a small amount on my face, I feel a burning sensation. Within 2 days I stopped using this bad scrub."
"So I usually never do reviews but I have to say that this product is the worst I've used ! After using this for 2 days my face started burning and getting red rashes , then started to get white pimples that burn and hurt ! It's literally all over my face ! I've read many reviews and it happened to everyone ! Neutrogena needs to take this product off the shelf !"
"I wish I would have read the reviews first as it seems many people had the same problem. I started using this product and by day 4 my fave had bumps and Whitehead's (unusual for me) all over. My skin is dry and burns if I even try to put anything on it. I'm so disappointed neutrogena, this product is trash."
"I recently bought this product because I love all Neutrogena products. I used for two days (washed face twice) and my skin broke out in so much acne, dry skin and red all over. My face is completely ruined and I am unable to put make up on for a few days. I would"
Not buy this.
"I only use Neutrogena products and when I saw this new one I had to try it. I currently use the Grapefruit scrub, which I still love but this feels more refreshing!"
"Looking online i seen amazing reviews about this product but once i bought it and used it i was very disappointed. I know its not their fault not everyone reacts the same to skin care products. After 3 uses i noticed my skin feeling itchy, raw and tight followed by redness with bumps. Just be cautious, i would recommend doing a patch test on your skin before using."
"I bought this 3 days ago and after 2 days its left some of my nose scabbed, left my mouth and under my nose red and burning, and hurts to wash off. I can't wash my face for a couple days and I was left with more acne than I started. I WOULD NOT get this product. I usually use the orange burst cleanser but looked up and down and could not find it. If you've taken it away please bring it back it was the only thing that worked for my face."
I just bought this and I love it! It feels so clean and exfoliated so well! I highly recommend this.
I bought this a week ago from Walgreens. I have used this 3 times. I have acne problems. This made it worse. My face has become really itchy and red now.
I love this product..it feels like a cool tingle and refresges every time u use..makes u feel like u jist got up and ready for the day all refreshed and clean!!
"I bought this hoping it was similar to a product I used in the 1980's that worked amazing. It definitely comes close! Makes my skin feel clean and smooth. My only complaint is that it needs more or larger scrubbing beads, that would make this product perfect."
"Purchased the cooling gel scrub, washed my face with it and immediately broke out in hives and a huge rash. Thought maybe it was the body soap I was using that irritated my skin. Tried it again today and once again I broke out in hives all down my neck and on my chest. Face is slightly swollen. Had to use eczema cream to stop the burning and irritation. Always used Neutrogena products. Very unhappy customer."
Really helps with skin breakouts and leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed.
First time I used it my face immediately broke out and was super red
"Worst product ever...Face is ruined from this stuff...Dry,flaky and acne now..It threw in the trash and will never buy again..."
I'm In Absolutely Love With This Product! I have such a hard time finding a facewash that works for my skin then I tried This And Woolahh! Everything Started Disappearing! I Highly Recommend This Product&lt;3
Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub is amazing! I trust that Neutrogena is great for my skin. I never use any other brand. Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean.
I love This product and I have to say it makes my my appearance very noticeable and it's affordable and not harsh on your skin like other brands. I LOVE IT.
I thoroughly enjoyed my free sample of Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub from Home Tester. Works very good at getting all the impurities out. Only downside was the scent wasn't my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had never tried a cooling scrub before so I was very intrigued to try this one. I must say, at first the cooling sensation felt a bit weird, but the way it feels when you scrub your face with it feels super soft and freshening. After I'd wash it off, my face felt super soft, clean, and awake. Definitely a good scrub to wash your face with in the morning to give you a little energy. 10/10 recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face felt clean and my makeup was removed without drying out my face. The cooling sensation was a slight tingling that made me think my face was getting really clean. My face felt soft after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the Neutrogena Deep Cleaning Cooling Gel Scrub for my face because after using it about a week, i have started to see results throughout my skin. Not only does it keep my skin very clear but also it helps keep my skin smooth. This is a product I look forward to using in the future for better results.

"I am delighted with this product has a cold and menthol effect, leaves the skin fresh, clean and renewed. It smells very refreshing. Also my husband used it and was happy because it cleaned his face in depth."
A recommendation; use very little amount and not put in the area under the eyes because it is strong.
GOOD PRODUCT!!! 100% RECOMMENDED [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Cooling scrub. It reminds me of the Proactiv MD deep cleansing face wash except more minty and way less expensive! It has tiny exfoliating particles that lightly and gently scrub away dead skin. The salicylic acid did not dry out my skin at all. My face felt clean and ready for the day. I used it day and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the cleanser. I felt that my face and neck were clean and soft. The scrub was so gentle a little too gentle. I'm saying that compare to other scrubs. But I would say gentle enough to use daliy. I really didnt notice any kind of ""cooling "" sinsation, not enough for it to be in the title of the product. The smell was nice, light, and fresh. Over all it was really nice and gentle, I would say it would be great for sensitive skin people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was blown away with this Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub by Neutrogena! The smell is great plus the feeling after you clean your face feels clean!

I am in love with Neutrogena and especially with this PURIFYING GEL EXFOLIATOR OF DEEP NEURROGEN CLEANING. My son is only 13 years old and he starts having acne problems and this gel helps him a lot to clean his face and leave it soft and fresh without causing irritation.

"I think this is a pretty good product, I was pleasantly surprised. I usually don't like scrubs because they're rough on my skin and makes my face red after using it. Thankfully, this product didn't do that. It was gentle while still giving a deep clean. My husband likes it too, but dont tell him I told you (haha). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a fantastic face wash. I really appreciate that it was not to harsh of a scrub, so much so that I can use it at least 3 times a week. I also included salyicylic acid to help with acne. It smelled very nice and was cooling and relaxing. Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
All I can say is wow! My face feels great and the cooling feeling I get when using this is incredible! My face has never felt more clean. I feel like I scrubbed off my old face and got a new one when I use this. I'm definitely going to buy another bottle when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this gel scrub. It smells great. Something like soothing cucumber scent. The cooling sensation is great to fix random acne pop up. It's soft on skin and after 2 week of continuous use I definitely see a great difference on my skin. It looks much great. I love Neutrogena products and this impressed me equally like others :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The exfoliating beads are gentle and leave your skin feeling soft. The cooling sensation you recive while applying the gel scrub is very refeshing. The out come for acne is good i had a few existing pimples that went away with the scrub. The only thing i really didnt like was the smell. But the over all product is good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never used anything with cooling gel on my face before so I wasn't sure on how it was going to be. But I actually really liked it. The scrub cleaned my face nicely and it had a nice fresh smell. Overall a really great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First off this cooling gel scrub is amazing. It feels so good on my skin making it feel so fresh and clean. I also love how it smells like cucumbers. The cooling sensation is really my favorite part of this scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's helped to clear up my skin in just a weeks time! I love that it's not harsh like most scrubs, in fact I've been able to use it once a day and not have any other issues! The one thing I do not like is that it tends to dry out my skin a little more than usual, but I believe it's partially to do with the weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a decent scrub, but i never noticed a cooling effect and it made me a little on the dry side. But, as far as the scrub side of it it easy enough on your skin for daily use. I would recommend to friends that have normal to oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the scrub affect it has and especially the cooling feel. Its a great product and has my face feeling super soft and smooth after using it, I would definitely buy this product and recommend it to friends. Just great all around [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have a combo oily and dry skin so finding a cleanser that works well with both types is hard to do. This neutrons deep clean purifying cooling gel scrub. Not only leaves my skin super clean and smooth but the menthol in the cooling is super refreshing for your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The most important quality I look for in a face wash is that it isn't over drying--this one left my skin feeling moisturized and my acne was noticeably diminished after only 2 uses. I hope that eventually, it will help with my stubborn blackheads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i tried Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub. and I liked it., it does provide deep cleaning with a cool minty after effect which is so refreshing but after few washes, it makes your skin very dry.. good for hot weather [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely loved the Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub that I got to try. I love the cooling sensation and the texture.

"I was selected to sample Neutrogena's Deep Clean Purifying Cooling Gel Scrub and I love it. Not only does it remove excess oil and makeup from my face, but it leaves it feeling smooth and nourished. After using it for a few days, I noticed my acne blemishes weren't that noticeable and my face was less red. Although this product is on the pricey side, I'd say it would be a good investment and worth trying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved everything about this scrub. The first thing I liked was the cucumber scent that was so refreshing! It was to harsh on my skin when I scrubbed it either. My favorite thing about this scrub is the awesome cooling affect it has when you rinse the scrub off. It was like nothing I felt before! My face was so refreshed after using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Neutrogena is my favorite face wash, so I may be a little biased, but this cleaner is a little different. It exfoliates while leaving your skin tingling, cool and fresh. My face feels tighter and softer as well. I will be purchasing this again. I recieved this product complimentary from HomeTestetClub and Neutrogena. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried the neutrogena jel scrub and really liked it. It left my skin feeling really clean and it didn't leave it feeling dry but nice and soft. I would recommend the jel to anyone.
"I bought this two months ago and it has made my acne go away and my skin smooth. My skin gets very dry and oily when there is too much acne medicine in it, but this has just the right amount for me."
"I used this product 3 times. The 3rd time I used it my face started to burn, and I woke up with a huge weird, dark, dry patch on my skin like it literally burned."
"I like the way it makes my face feel but can't get past the smell. I imagine if you are stuffed up, this will help you breath. Unfortunately that's not why I bought it. The scrubbies in it are too small. Not a lover and won't buy this again."
It works wonderfully! Love the soft light clean scent. My face looks and feels clean and soft. I love it and use it all of the time. GREAT for deep clean!
"This one in my opinion probably isnt the best out there , But it definitely does the job thats forsure ! I would highly recommend this product you will not be disappointed and myself wouldn't mind purchasing it again as well !"
