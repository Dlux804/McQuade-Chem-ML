"After trying the free sample mask I just had to try more products. I bought the hair mask and eye cream. The hair mask left my curly frizzy hair super soft, like silk, and the eye cream instantly took the puffiness and darkness away. Even my husband wanted to try it."
"I have been using this product for the better part of 8 months and could not be happier with the results. I use it alongside much pricier products from Rodan & Fields - but L'Oreal's Eye Expert holds its own with the big guns in age redefinement and wrinkle repair. Bravo, L'Oreal!!"
I keep this in the refrigerator and put this on in the morning and evening. It reduces puffiness and discoloration. I feel like my eyes have gotten brighter!
I bought this about 2 months ago and I haven't really seen any dramatic changes under my eyes but that could be because I forget to use it sometimes. I do love the scent of it and also how smoothly it goes on. It feels so lightweight and soft.
I received this as a free sample from @Topbox Circle. It applied very smooth with no irritation. This could be a welcome routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have purchased this product a few times and it works really well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
