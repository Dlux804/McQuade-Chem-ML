"The scrub is awesome. Very gentle on skin unlike other scrubs that tend to be too harsh. It has no perfume-like smell like other scrubs. I like the fact that there is no real scent. I noticed a change in my skin within a day or so. Brighter, clearer and more even-looking skin. The moisturizer is great as well. Its lightweight and absorbs very quickly into my skin. I would highly recommend."
"The Aveeno positively radiant scrub rubs on nicely, it feels like little grains in it, I put it on before the shower, rinse it off, towel dried my face.. It made my face feel real dry, so the cream is a definite must right after.. I also have severely sensitive skin and didn't break out to this at all.."
"So the daily scrub just smells so fresh, sorta reminded me of cucumbers. A little goes a long way with this daily scrub. I've only used it for 3 days so I can't comment on even-tone results. The daily moisturizer has a very light scent. You'll need to apply generously since it's texture is a bit thick like sunscreen. I see these in my future."
"I've been using the Aveeno Positively Radiant facial cleanser for the past month, and it has made my face so soft! My skin is healthier, and I do notice more of a glow. The scent is light and pleasant. I highly recommend these products!"
Aveeno Positively Radiant Scrub & Moisturizer Daily the Scrub was light exfoliating left my skin feeling soft and bright I was Please And the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer was smooth and left my skin even softer and brighter this Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Scrub & Moisturizer Together was a winner i Recommend these Product to all who want a Clean and bright radiant face .
I love this set. They're both easy to use. The daily scrub is easy to apply and wash off. It left my skin feeling silky smooth and clean. It feels like all the impurities are gone. I apply the moisturizer to my face and neck after each wash. It also leaves my skin feeling silky smooth without the heavy greasy feeling got some moisturizers leave behind.
"i love this duo set, i had the scrub a long time ago and i liked it then , but now it comes with a scrub which i love , it seems to have improved it really makes my face feel so so smooth. My mom used it also and she lloves it also and she is 76 and her face is a little rough but when she used the duo set she felt like her skin was super soft.. thank you spark review"
"This scrub truly can be used on a daily basis. It is mild enough so that it does not irritate your skin, but you can tell that it is helping to slough off the dead skin cells that can make you look dull, especially in the winter. Follow it up with the moisturizer included and it is the perfect finish !!"
"At any age,taking care of your skin is important. Being a senior I thought having silky skin was a thing of rhe past. Boy was I wrong!!! I have never used a body scrub before now and what a difference it makes to my skin. With little effort it gently washes away dry skin flakes and makes your skin smoorh and rejeuvenated. I just patted my skin dry then applied the mointurizer. My skin is smoorh and I swear it almost glows. This is a must have for all ages."
The Aveeno positively radiant daily scrub and moisturizer are great. They have a very light scent.
"The scrub granules dissolve and are not too rough. The moisturizer feels very light on my face and lasts several hours. I would recommend this product to someone looking for an affordable, gentle product"
"This is a very simple, but fantastic skincare regimen. Anytime my skin looks dull or my pores appear oversized, I can use the scrub and follow up with the moisturizer, and my skin is instantly calmer and brighter. I'm also one with highly sensitive skin, and this doesn't cause any reaction. So I'm very pleased."
Good stuff better then the high dollar stuff
I use this product every day it is awesome. The moisturizer is easy to pump an you get just the right amount. The body scrub is the same way it is great. Will continue to use this product.
The Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Scrub & Moisturizer is so great for your skin. My skin is so soft. My face doesn't feel oily at all. The moisturizer is great smelling and not to strong. This is a great product.

i really like the way this product makes my face feel and it has a light pleasant fragrance.
it is light and not at all greasy feeling. the exfoliant is just right and does not irritate my skin.
I can't put it on my skin because it as fragrance in the moisturizer and could not find any for sensitive skin.
