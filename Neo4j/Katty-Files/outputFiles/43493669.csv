I usual don't write reviews but I was so impressed with the results. I'm soon to be 63 and had lots of sun in my years along with stress and I'm a smoker. I have used it about two weeks and I'm pleased. Would highly recommend!
I saw amazing results in only two days. In the morning I use this in coinjunction with the retinol eye cream. At night I use Roc Retinol Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.
My only fear is that Roc will discontinue any of these products.
Roc - You Rock!
"I started using Roc night time in gold tube two years ago on advice of a fellow nurse. My skin texture, resiliency, coloring has changed so much for the better. I get stopped, asked what I use on my skin. No one believes I am 70. I rarely use makeup. I moisten my skin with rose hip oil then apply Roc at night. My skin is dewy, glows. Love this product."
I just bought this system and read the directions..It said to use at night so what do you recommend using during the day. I'm 69 and have deeper wrinkles..I love the way my skin feels after using this product. Very soft..
LOVE THESE PRODUCTS BEEN USING THEM FOR ABOUT 1O YEARS MY SKIN LOOKS AT LEAST 10 YEARS YOUNGER. I HAVE ALL DIFFERENT PRODUCTS BUT WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE JUST THE RESURFACING SERUM. CAN'T FIND IT ANY WHERE. PLEASE HELP? THANKS RENE
Loved max resurfacing cleanser. Why has it been taken off the market ? Are you going to make something similar? I can't find anything that works as well.
"I started using the pair about 2 weeks ago, and I can not believe how wonderful my skin looks already. Skin tone is brighter, and has already reduced fine lines."
Smoothens my face
"It took 2-3 weeks for me to see a definite improvement in my skin's appearance, and 2-3 months before people began telling me that I looked noticeably younger. It blew me away! Make sure that you use the #2 Resurfacing Serum liberally, or you won't get the full effect. Finally, it's great that ROC sells these two items together at a substantially lower price than buying them separately. It's by far the best deal out there. Highly recommended."
"I am confused, I use the max wrinkle resurfacing system and love the way it makes my skin feel, does it work as well on deep wrinkles as the deep wrinkle night cream. I have deep wrinkles on the sides of my mouth and some around my mouth. Do I use the deep wrinkle at night and the resurfacing in the day and the deep wrinkle at night?Your sight shows pairing these together and if you do use the deep wrinkle at night do you put a moisture cream over it? I am 69."
I've been using this product for a week and I like the texture of both step 1 and 2. I also like the way my skin feels after applying both. It's too soon to see improvement so I can't say it doesn't work. My only concern is if I'm using it correctly. The instructions don't say how long after step 1 should step 2 be applied. I don't want to waste product and I want and I would like results in the shortest amount possible . Proper instructions would help.
"I love Roc's Wrinkle Resurfacing System, I have lines that criss cross under my eyes and many smile lines/wrinkles. This is the only product line that I've used that makes good on its promise of reducing lines and wrinkles!. I use this system as part of my night regimen and after finishing the product ( a few weeks), I rotate it with Roc's Deep Wrinkle Night Cream so my skin doesn't get too used to the same product. My lines are barely noticeable now. Thanks Roc!"
Have used the ROC products for years but not aware how well they were working. Family and Friends would tell me that I look good but they will say anything. I got proof the other day when the Doctor came back to verify my birthdate. She could not believe my age was 70. So I guess it is working and I will continue to use and add all new products.
"I just realized that the reason my skin has gotten worse lately is because I had stopped using this product. I bought the entire line of deep wrinkle products , used it religiously to rave reviews from friends, ran out and forgot to buy more. After 2 days, I can see the benefits again! I combine it daily with resurfacing discs, serum and day moisturizer and eye cream. And wrinkle filler if I remember ."
"I'm 48 years old.... I have sensitive skin and rosacea (or as I like to call it - Rosy cheeks), so I use the expensive creams and serums ... because I'm sensitive I was extremely anxious about trying these products. I can tell you I've been using it religiously for a little over a week now and I love how my skin feels and looks... I'm starting to notice a difference in my lines and my skin feels so good when I put it on at night. I'm a convert...."
"I use it for over a month now. My skin is smooth, no redness, no irritation ( I have very sensitive skin ). Fine lines around my lips and eyes almost gone. I have a deep line on my forhead and I'll see what happens with that line. It looks like it's getting better, but I can't tell for sure. Besides, my skin is alive. I don't look poofy and tired in the morning."
"I love it, worth the money invested."
I have used this for 3 days now. My spots on my face are gone. My skin feels tight and soft. I love this!! I have never seen a face cream work this fast. I'm 53 years old. The fine lines are already disappearing. I can only hope what more time will do. I usually do not write reviews..... But this works so well and fast I had to say something about it. I will come back at the end of the week and report. THANK YOU ROC!!
No instructions in or on the side of the box. Is this to be used at night/under makeup or both? Alone or with other serums? Have been using for 2 weeks not seeing a difference yet. If someone with Roc could post some instructions it would be appreciated.
I am a 28 year old woman with very bad hyperpigmentation and acne spots I did peels that only made the problem way worse . thank GOD this worked my skin in peeled off baby soft and not irritated I'm going to get all the products and stick with this line
I have been using this product twice daily along with the resurfacing scrub and pads. I use this treatment to slow down aging. I am 32 years old and I truly don't look it at all. This product does perform!! I have really fallen for this product. I recommend this treatment.
I have been using the night cream for awhile and the eye cream. Wanted to try this....first night using...makes my skin feel soft. So far I like it. But curious to see after 1 week of using it. But I have a question....is this intended to replace the night creams? I should not have to also use the night creams after this system right?
"I gave it a good review, pending results. There are no directions as to when to use it, morning? night? Or for how long. I just bought it yesterday and will use it at night until it is gone and see what happens. Should be more directions on packaging."
Roc really needs to improve package labeling for directions for this product. I had no idea how to use it and had to call the number on the tube. Then located website and it has been very helpful. Have been using this product for about 6 weeks at night. I have noticed a difference in my skin...it is smoother and fine lines have diminished. I use three other Roc products as well - the deep wrinkle filler seems to be a really good one too for the morning.
55+ with sun damage and dark spots on cheeks below my eyes have improved drastically with use of this product nightly for 4 weeks. Milia (2 little white spots) have almost disappeared at the crease of my nose. My skin is dry and sensitive-have not had any problems with this product. WIll continue to use the R.O.C. line. Better results than products I've used that cost at least twice the price!
I am almost 65. I have been using the anti-wrinkling treatment (cream and serum) for over a week and feel there has been improvement in the fine lines. I am hoping for them to diminish even more and for the deeper wrinkles to be less noticeable. The serum leaves the skin feeling absolutely velvety! I'm anxious to see the results in a few more weeks.
"I'm in the UK so can't phone you.... I've been using roc for years but just discovered this system. Used for 1st time tonight as per the instructions, I put the white cream on first and then the grey. Should I have waited between applications? It feels very nice on the skin initially and once absorbed my skin feels really soft. Hoping I see good results soon. No tingling or irritation so far."
"I am a 44 year old male. I already look very young for my age, and I have always taken good care of my skin. I was beginning to develop a few lines and creases and decided to give the Roc Resurfacing system a try. All I can say is after only 5 days of applying the system after showering in the evening, my skin already looks amazing. Don't let the expense and size of the bottles scare you. A little really goes a long way with this cream/gel."
"I bought this product after much research, I have used it for 6 nights and I am totally amazed.After the second night I could tell a big difference in my sun spots.I am an avid tanner and had a lg, amount of sunspots on my face.my coworkers are suprised how light, smooth, and shiny my face is. It feels younger and tighter.My deep forhead wrinkle has much improved.I love this product."
I've been using this product almost every night for a month. I wasn't noticing a difference until the fourth week. I quit smoking 45 days ago and wanted to revamp my skin. I am 49 years old. My skin looks brighter and my crows feet and lines around my mouth aren't nearly as noticeable. So happy with this product and glad I didn'tstop taking it after not seeing immediate results.
Found this at a discount store for 5.99 and figured I would not lose anything to try it. It worked better than any of my expensive creams. Haven't been able to find it at that price again but even at this price its cheaper and better than most creams.
"Will give it a good review for now, until result are shown, or not. There are definately not enough instruction/directions for using the Retinol Correction MAX Wrinkle Resurfacing System. No instructions on how long to leave products on before washing off."
"After being a ROC user for many years, I decide to try the Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle serum because the advertisement said it was better than ROC. After using it for a month, I've switch back to ROC. There was no comparison between the two products. ROC leaves my skin soft & smooth without experience the peeling and dryness of the Neutrogena serum. I will never switch to anything again."
"I am totally amazed with this product. I have only been using it for 1 week and already I'm getting compliments on my skin. I have used very expensive products and have never gotten the results I have from this product. My skin is much smoother, softer and my wrinkles are already looking smaller. Can't wait to see the results in 12 weeks. Roc truly ROCKS!!!!"
"I have been using this product for a couple of years and have been very happy with it. When I could not find it in North Carolina or Kentucky recently I was very dismayed. I have been very happy with the product and will continue to purchase it as long as it is available. I am not interested in other products as this one is effective. If I cannot find it, I will no longer purchase RoC products. I hope that it will be available in the near future as I would like to continue to be a loyal customer."
"After losing 60 lbs at age 54 my face was a map of fine lines and wrinkles. tried several things but the one that worked the best for me was roc max. after few days use fine lines started fading, wrinkles not as deep. My only problem now is all local drug stores are carrying roc but unable to find roc max. almost out, the serum esp gives your foundation a smooth look. Also use Max facial scrub 1-2 times a week and have bedtime serum also. I will order on line, this product isnt being fazed out I hope!! Vicki"
"I have been using Roc for a few yrs. Now at the age of 57 I have come workers asking what do I do to keep my skin so nice? my sister in Florida just asked me I told her what I use, she went straight to the store and bought it said she was all Roc'd out. it's amazing I love my skin. Thank you for such a great product."
"I have used Roc products for many years. I am 44 years old but look to be in my 30's. I have religiously used Roc products and my skin is velvety. It is smooth, soft, very few wrinkles and I am thrilled with the Roc products I have used. I tell everyone about this company!!!"

"I love this product. I am 40 and I struggle with occasional breakouts but salicylic acid washes were really drying my skin out and leaving it looking dull. I've been using this duo for just over a week and I'm amazed at the results. My skin is brighter and more even, the texture is better and so far no breakouts. I use the retinol cream at night and the grey resurfacing serum in the morning under makeup as a primer. I love them!"
"I have been using this product for a year now but recently ran out. I was lazy to get to the store and took a month off from using it. To my horror, I noticed my pores getting clogged as if I was a teenager and fine lines more visible. I was surprised to see such a difference from Saturday to Monday (3 days of use). My skin is back to normal and the fine lines, surface, and brightness restored. No more clogged pores! Yey!! I had to write and review and thank you ROC..you definitely rock! =)"
Loved your facial cleanser; why don't you make it anymore?????
Visible improvements [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved. Help my face skin. I will use always. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this so much. My skin feels very, very smooth. I just started it but have a question: Do I use a moisturizer with it? And if so, can that also be a ROC retinol product?"
I used serum and 5 in 1 moisturizer yesterday. Got up this morning and face is very swollen. I am hoping it doesn't get worse as the day goes on. Have been applying ice and am on the way to emergency care. I am very upset.
"After using ROC Retinol 1 & 2 in 2 weeks, my skin glows and I look half my real age younger and I feel younger too. I recommend these products to every woman my age, I'm 50."
"Once I turned 40 I started to notice my skin was changing. I started to see wrinkles and fine lines appear, making me look and feel older than I was. Using this product has made my skin appear younger! Absolutely love it!"
With in the first week my skin felt smoother and by the 2nd week my wrinkles were less noticeable. I am on my third week and I cant believe how much my skin has improved prior to using this product. Remarkable results!
"I love this product. After just the first use, my skin was smoother and more youthful looking. I was looking for a product to boost my skins dull appearance."
"I love the MAX system paired with the MAX exfoliating cleanser. My new eye doctor commented on how impressive my skin looked, that I looked 10 years younger. I can see a big difference myself. Thank you."
Are you suppose to wear a moisturizing cream on top of this? And what about sun protection? It doesn't contain any. Also I don't feel a tingling sensation at all . Does it mean its not working on me?
"After using for one month, I have noticed my skin looks better. The lines appear diminished and my skin tone is much more even. Not only have I noticed, but the best part is others have noticed too!"
"I found this website in a search for directions on how to use this product. I agree with the previous posts that there should be instructions on the tubes. Love the product, though!"
"work in a matter of time, SAW lines diminish and elasticity of skin was amazing. my mother and i use this product and is within our budget, definitely worth its weight in gold!! thx ROC"
"Took about 8 weeks until I really saw improvements, but I am very happy I stuck it out!! I also use the Roc Retinol Deep Wrinkle Serum, as well as clean my face with the Roc sesurfacing pads as my nightly routine."
"After trying many high-priced products, finally I have found something with a visible difference. If you're feeling iffy try this use it every night and you'll see. ThankYou ROC‼���‼️"
Y'all discontinued the face wash but with no reasons why
This face wash worked very well. We should at least know why you discontinue a product that actually works. Can you give a more clear answer to why you took this off the shelf?
Have been using this for several years and it makes my skin feel silky and smooth. Love it!
"thought this was fake at first, firgured i got nothing to lose, so i tried it and wow! just minutes after installing it, i looked younger, felt better, and smiled bigger because my confidence was through the roof! Thanks Roc Retinol Correxion Max wrinkle resurfacing system!"
great deal both are good
I think it is overrated. It made my pores on my nose larger and I didn't see any visible changes in the lines in my face. I saw no difference at all.
I have used Roc for about 12 years and love it. I have often been mistaken for 10 years younger... my age is 66.
Great results after short use. I loved the feel on my skin. Not greasy. Really helped with my dry skin.
"I bought MAX Wrinkle Resurfacing System step 1 & 2, is it efficient for milia under eyes? If yes how can I use it?"
"Just have a question, maybe someone can answer. Are you supposed to wash this off? It doesn't say on the box. Please help"
"It makes my face getting red i dont like it , I definetely dont like this product, I will return to tge store"
I took a picture of my skin 30 days before I started to use this product and what a difference it made was astounding! It really works!!
used just a few times and loved itAnd would use it again. I also would tell all my friends to use it
I have just been using it for a week and my skin looks and feels great! I also use it on my neck also.
This is the best product on the market for skin care I love it and have already saw a big change in my face3 after only using for a week.
"Love this stuff. Was recommended by the PA at the dermatologist's office. Had large pores that caused me to have a lot of ""white heads"". Took care of that problem + some wrinkles!"
I have been meaning to try this forever but tried all the expensive ones instead big mistake. Tonight is my second night and I got a great deall I think I looked a little brighter this morning Lets see what happens
How much retinol is in cream. is retinol the grey colored cream?. I like it thus far. have been using for about 1 week. no noticable changes but I didn/t expect any. talk to you at week 4. mary k
Help !! Do i leave on overnight n wash off on morning
By far the best product I've ever used. I'm 48 but was told I look 10 years younger!
It was not clear to me how soon after the step one should I apply step two.
"excellent results, after three weeks, I'll try cleanser also. I give it 5***** and highly recommend"
Definitely all ROC product i highly recommended to all women out there! These product is amazing!!!
awesome this is incredible..totally cool...works great
Helps minimize age lines. Used everyday I have noticed a difference
"I've been using this product for 6 months. Sceptical, at 1st.but me"
This eliminated wrinkles and made me look so much younger
Great product. No longer have dry patches under eyes.
reducd wrinkle. your looks will be good. make your skin 10 years younger
love it i am sixty for years old and it helps all the wrinkles on my face i love this .
"WOW, I love this, I wish I would've found it sooner, I'm 37 and have wrinkles on my forehead, and bought something else from costco but that irritates my skin, so I only use this Roc product and I already see results on my forehead, its smoother and less wrinkles, definitely worth the money and love that its on sale =] will buy more just to have =]"
It is very good at keeping your face looking young.
"Great product, however, do not think because it has Retinol will erase your wrinkles, it doesnt work like that. It smooth your skin and leave it nice and radiant."
"Hi,"
""
"I started using step-1 and 2 daily 2 weeks ago. I believe it is reducing fine lines and smoothening my skin. I love it but, my question is does metallic grey serum make skin tan? my skin tone is not white or brown or black but more towards white, I feel my face is getting darker after started using the step-1 and 2. Is this tested on all skin types? What does resurfacing serum exactly do?"
I purchased this expensive product hoping I wouldn't have to have any more face peels...mine r a 30% acid...these r painful.. using this product for a month has caused my skin to break out with keratin seeds.. I will not recommend this product or b purchasing anymore..
I'm uncertain if I need to wait between applications between step one and step two. Also I'm unclear on how much from each tube to use. I've seen the company respond to others reviews by saying call the customer service line but they are only open for a limited time on weekdays- when I work and I don't have time to make that call on my short lunch break.
It works! I'll be 50 & I look great!
"THE RESURFACING CREAM LOOKS LIKE SOME TYPE OF GREASE YOU WOULD USE TO LUBRICATE A RUSTY DOOR HINGE AND IT SMELLS LIKE IT, TOO! I am almost afraid to apply it and cringe every time I put it on. PLEASE fix it."
The finishing serum is used up quickly. I would like to purchase it separately and cannot find it.
makes my skin so soft and soft I would totally recommend
I love the correxion max system but the fragrance gives me headaches. Will there ever be a fragrance free system?
"There are no instructions that I can find ANYWHERE! I want to do this correctly. Please post directions for all. Thank you, Stephanie"
Love Roc products!
Product works well on my skin.
I really like the product. It makes my skin feel like silk.
theses reviews cant be real this stuff is a joke. i seen no difference at all.
I Love this cream
