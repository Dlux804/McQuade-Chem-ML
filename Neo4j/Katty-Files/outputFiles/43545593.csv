"I ordered this product for my mother who swears by the product, but we will never use walmart.com again. It was the absolute most horrid experience we have ever gone through ordering anything. Never have received a notification that it has been delivered and is ready for pick up."
Love it. I have very dry skin. Makes my skin feel fresh and glowing the next morning. Not sticky and a big pot that would last you many months.
"I've had very oily skin most my life, now I'm in my mid 40s I'm noticing some changes I wasn't pleased with. This product literally is a blessing, you can feel it doing it's magic almost immediately, & when you wake up your skin is absolutely glowing! Olay knocked it out of the park with this one♡ I will definitely be repurchasing-♡♡♡"
"Been using olay (total effects)for years and people would ask me whats my skin care and that i look younger my actual age. I picked the luminous one by chance and that time had this pimple scar that never goes, tried everything, vit c, tea tree, etc. but when i was using this luminous i noticed one day its gone!"
I have been using this product for years. It made my skin so soft and pearly. I cannot find it anywhere. I miss it so much!
"I have been using this gel for about 2 years now ( at least) It feels amazing, it smells amazing, it's so moisturizing, while so light. This product says it's for overnight, but I love it so much that I use it during the day at times too This is the “must have” item for ever woman. I keep in my nightstand, as part of my evening skin routine. It's the last product I put on my face. Then I also use it on my neck, and back of my hands. Love it so much ."
I have been using this product every night for about a month now and I love how my face is so soft. This product comes in a big container and so I know it will last awhile. I love how it has a great smell and cooling feeling when put on. Myself and other people have noticed my skin tone is getting better. I have a big discoloration mark on my cheek and it has faded. I love the Olay products!
"I have oily skin that is also sensitive and can easily breakout. I have used many skin care products and moisturizers over the years and this one is hands down THE best. You only need to use a tiny bit and the product glides over skin, leaving a wonderful silky feeling, while also keeping my oily shine at bay! I use it day AND night, and it is amazing. I rarely have a breakout since using this product as well! And as a bonus, it has really helped to lessen some dark spots I developed from some past sun exposure."
This mask help to moisturize my skin to the full potential at night while I am sleeping and my skin is regenerating. I was able to see changes within the first 3 days of using this product and my skin has never had so much glow. #Sponsored I received products from Olay in return for this review.
I love this product. When i used the last of my Luminous mask i thought i would try other products. I tried alot of other brands and nothing even compared to Olay Luminous Mask for helping my skin look more even tone and looking more refreshed. Thank you for making an amazing product that helps older skin look a few years younger.
"I am fixing to turn 29, I have combination skin but often get hormonal acne. This product hydrates my skin without being heavy. It truly makes my skin feel amazing. I can't say enough good things! I've used high end brands and other department store brands and this has been the best find! I apply this moisturizer to my skin at night after cleansing and in the morning I have soft radiant skin with no dry patches."
"Absolutely love this product! I had been searching a while for a good overnight cream that would also brighten my skin, and this mask has went above and beyond my expectations. First, you get a lot of product for the price, which is very helpful, and putting it on my skin feels so relaxing at the end of the day. I have been using the mask daily for about 3-4 weeks and I have noticed a significant change in the brightness of my skin, even after working out."
"I received products from Olay in return for this review. The Olay Luminous line is an easy way to ensure that your skin is both cleansed and moisturized. As someone who deals with hyperpigmentation and has combination skin, it's rare that I find an entire line of products that works for me. The Overnight Mask is my favorite of all the Luminous products. When I apply it, I wake up with skin that is soft and moisturized without being oily."
"I have combination to oily& sensitive skin. This didn't really absorb into my skin as much as I'd hope it would've. It left my skin more of a greasy and oily feeling but when I woke up, my face was bright&not oily anymore. But since I applied it at night, it's oily all throughout the night till I wake up. So Idk how I feel about this product. It hasn't given me any breakouts but I feel like it has more of a heavy texture than a light texture. It might help w dry skin but i don't suggest for oily"
"I'm 23 years old. My skin is pretty much flawless except for the fact that it gets really really dried out. I never battled severely with acne but I do know that my skin is sensitive. My mother was using the cream and when I was cleaning out her bathroom I decided to take it because my more expensive masks weren't working. I love this product it's cool, lite, and easy to apply. It seems thick but it's not. I use it several times a day since I don't wear much makeup and it works wonders!"
"I have older, fair, dry sensitive skin & probs w/occasional deep cystic acne. I've tried so many Products w/no long-term luck. On days 3-5 I got surface pimples, but I think my skin was just adjusting. Since then, no issues, no more deep bumps, and discoloration are fading. I decided to try it in the morning too. I now use less makeup altogether because I don't have so much to hide!! I think I just cut my skincare routine in 1/2 & will save so much $. Could this be my miracle one step product?"
"This gel mask is definitely a treasure for having a younger, more vibrant, supple, and brighter illuminent even toned skin. At first, I was reluctant to try new products, because I am allergic to very many products. I had problem with adult acne, my skin was terribly dried out. My skin no longer feels dry anymore. It also helped with wrinkles that I was getting due to dry skin. I now use Olay Micro-sculpting cream with SPF 30 during the day and at night I use this gel mask. THANK YOU, OLAY!!!!"
"I love the feel of this mask and how easy it is to use - nice that I don't have to peel or scrub it off. However, I haven't been using it nightly because I'm not sure it will mix with my other treatments. Can I layer this product with Retin A and keep the effectiveness of both? If so, which should go on first?"
"First of all, I am a huge Olay fan. I have tons of your products in my daily regime, and this is a favorite. This mask has a good texture, and a little goes a long way. Leaves skin just Glowing. I really really wish, however, it was not in jar packaging; hence the not quite perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I apply at night after washing my face and when I wake up in the morning, my skin looks so much brighter and vibrant! I don't even wash my face in the morning when I use this the night before because my skin is still so hydrated! I have post acne scars and blemishes that i noticed started to fade after about a week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After I cleanse my face, it's nice to know that a moisturizing mask will keep my skin hydrated while I sleep. I like the gel feel of it and the quick dry feature makes it so I can go to sleep knowing I'm doing something for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for almost 2 months now and I love it. It goes on smooth, never oily, and brightens my skin overnight! I've noticed in the months I've been using it regularly that my skin has evened out remarkably. It lasts a long time, too. I still have over half the jar left. You only need a little every night. I have found my new favorite overnight mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this products, as well as the entire line, once it was released. I love the mask, you don't even feel it is on. I enjoy the entire line. People started noticing my skin glowing within weeks of starting it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful product, it goes on so easily and smoothly at night. I use it every other night. It is readily absorbed, and leaves my face and neck feeling so soft and supple. I love it, as much as I love all the luminous products. How did I live without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using oil of Olay for 37 years. Started with the original okay and now I use the regeneration and luminosity lotions and serums. My skin feels so soft and I get complements on how great I look. People cannot believe I am 57 years young!!! I tell anyone who ask me what I use that I have been an olay user since my 20's! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This gel mask soaks in totally and almost leaves your face feeling dry; however, when you rinse your face in the morning, your skin is smooth, satiny, and brighter. I have aging, dry(er) skin, so I was a bit put off at first thinking that it should feel creamy or sticky on your face like most facial creams do. Not sure how it works, but it doesn't dry your skin. I like to rinse with warm water most mornings after using it, but on 2-3 mornings I use a good scrub product to exfoliate."
"This comes in a generously sized jar, and a little goes a long way. The gel is cool to the skin and glides on effortlessly and smoothly. All you need is a little (for me, one finger-tip portion). I have VERY dry skin, so I will continue to use this gel and making observations. Definitely recommend this product for generous size, application ease, and how it feels overall."
"I LOVE this mask. However I am confused. I always wash my face FIRST, then I apply the serum, but after that, do I use the over night mask & then my night moisturizer? Or do I use my moisturizer & then the mask? I'm just not sure how the steps go. Please let me know what order to do this. Im a HUGE fan of Olay. it actually does what it says it's going to do, & it's also Animal Cruelty Free."
Could someone comment on a review I read that explained that the ingredients in the product begin to breakdown and lose effectiveness once the jar is opened and exposed to the air. There also is concern for contamination in the product because it is packaged in a jar that you could introduce germs from dipping your hands into the jar.
"I'm 51 and have very dry skin! I've tried everything, including the expensive Korean water masks, but Olay has far exceeded all of them! My skin is so dry from the summer weather that I've been using this in the mornings too, under my foundation, without any problems. My skin looks so soft and moist without looking greasy. It's amazing and I am so glad I've found this product!"
"I use this product a few times a week, and I have noticed immediate results. I wake up in the morning with my skin feeling hydrated and glowing. I am trying to be proactive about my skin, and this product is truly helping me prevent wrinkles and increase hydration so my skin glows all day long."
"I am exhausted with trying to find products that work on my aging skin, but I think I have found it with Regenerist! Olay has been trusted since I was a child, and now I know why. Thank you for a great over-all skin feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I wake up in the morning my face feels tone and firm. Looks very bright as well . The description and result written in the container is true. Since i started using it, I never go to bed without it. I will continue using it and tell my friends and relatives to use the same. This is an excellent product . Thank you Olay for making us beautiful and young.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I began using the Olay Regenerist Luminous Bright Sleeping Mask on 5/8/15. I'm a 44 y/o African American and I needed something to improve my overall complexion. It's been a couple weeks and I do see subtle changes but I also use it along with the night recovery cream and I do see subtle changes. My skin is improving and my makeup looks amazing/ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product leaves your skin feeling luxurious and soft. Fine lines and skin discoloration are less noticeable after only one month of using.

"THE TEXTURE AND WEIGHT OF THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT. IT ABSORBS QUICKLY AND EVENLY. IT DOES NOT IRRATATE THE SKIN ON THE FACE OR ON THE NECK, IN THE AM IT RINSES OFF EASILY AND UNDERNEATH YOU HAVE BRIGHTER, TIGHTER AND HEALTHY LOOKING SKIN. I FEEL THAT IT IS EVEN STARTING TO DIMINISH THE DARK SPOTS ON MY FACE. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Trying this line of products, too soon to know if they will improve skin as advertised, but it's nice to have a product I don't have to remove, and will be a welcome addition to winter hydration."
"I love everything about this moisturizer, the gel texture works perfectly for my oily skin & my skin looks brighter every morning. The scent is also very pleasant & you get a generous amount for the price paid, Love it!"
"This product seemed to have a drying effect on my skin. Feels hydrating when applied, but after washing my face the next morning, it felt and looked drier. Guess I need a creamier moisturizer."
"I received this gel moisturizer as a gift. I love how it makes my skin feel refreshed. After one use, I could tell a slight difference. After a week, others were telling me that my skin looked amazing. I also love the clean smell."
"I have combination skin and this product is good, I get the glow without the oily feel. The only thing I don't like is the bottle. I think is good product for its price."
Love This! Made my skin feel soft and moisturized after the first time. It has been about a week or so of usining it. I don't see a big difference of how my face looks. But I absolutely love how my face feels after using this product.
