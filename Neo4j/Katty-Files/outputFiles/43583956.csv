"Very effective product at reducing under eye puffiness. Works quickly. The low price makes this a tremendous value. Only negative, I do not care for the scent but it dissipates quickly."
"It softens my skin beautifully--I'm 84 years old, and my skin, of course, is very dry--not badly wrinkled, but uncomfortable with the dry itchy skin--!! But---Burts Bees renewal night cream has made a definitely PLUS!!"
1st time using BB and was a little hesitant with so many other options out there. Not even a week into using this night cream and I am extremely happy with the results and how my skin looks and feels. I am definitely hooked and want to try their other products.
This cream is fantastic! I have oily skin so I was skeptical about using it but I have been pleasantly surprised! It doesn't feel heavy and I have seen such an improvement in the condition of my skin. I have even gotten multiple compliments on my complexion!
"I just started using this cream, so I can not fairly judge its effectiveness, but I have been using another night cream from Burt's Bees, and I like it a lot. It does feel great on application, and it's full of botanical goodies. My skin is very sensitive, so it's a big plus that it feels good after one night."
"This is the first time using a product from this company. I was looking for a new Night Cream and was attracted the packaging and the mission of the company. The cream has a nice texture, but the fragrance is too strong and unpleasant to me."
"I had a lot of hope for this night cream since I usually trust Burts Bees products. But this cream is quite greasy and it ends up on my pillow. Plus the smell is very unpleasant. I wish I could return this product but I don't have the receipt. After two months of use, I haven't seen much improvement in my skin's firmness. Back to the drawing board."
"I guess i'm allergic to this. I started using it and at first I was breaking out all over my forehead which hasn't happened in years...i'm talking 10 plus years! Anyway, I continued on thinking my skin was just getting use to it but nope I look like i'm in jr high again."
"I love this cream! I use during day as well because I have dry skin and eczema. I have not had any eczema occurances with any BBees product. My only suggestion would be to change packaging to pump for portion control. And most importantly, sanitary reasons. I use q tips right now, but a pump would be nice."
Thank you for the amazing products!
"I have been using the entire Renewal line for about a year. The night cream makes my skin feel moist and it looks healthy. It doesn't take a lot to cover well, so the jar lasts. I do wonder if the scent has changed - I just opened a new jar and it seems different. If so, I liked the previous scent better!"
"I have been using this for 30 days now. I love it. I had several spots of damaged dry skin that would never completely go away. But, every day with this product another layer of damaged skin sloughs off. My tiny lines are almost gone & the deep ones are much better! Can't wait to see what another 30 days will bring!"
"Contrary to another review, this product DOES NOT contain aluminum, to say the least. What it does contain is ""white clay"" which is labeled as Magnesium Aluminum Silicate. Again, this ingredient is NOT aluminum, it is white clay. This cream offers a light and fresh hydration to complexion. I've noticed a noticeable improvement to the sun damage on my face."
"I have tried a lot of night creams and this is by far the best! I have a very simple skin care routine, so adding this at the end of the day is a bonus product that my skin loves. I have been using this cream every night for a month and my skin is brighter, more supple, and the small lines around my eyes (crows feet) have become a lot less noticeable. I am looking forward to adding the Firming Serum soon!"
It's hard for me to stick to a skin care regimen because I'm lazy and tend to forget. This one is great and I just bought my second one because I'm actually about to finish my first one! I love the scent and it feels great. I look forward to using it every night. I also just bought the day lotion. I've been used the Renewal cleanser for a while now and love it as well.
"This stuff leaves the skin feeling so moist and smooth. I can't wait to put on my P.J.'s and clean my face and load my skin up with this light night time moisturizer. The scent is gentle and relaxing, And it doesn't leave a spot on my pillow case. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this is the best night cream I have found for firming! I am in my 60S and my skin looks great on my face of course! all of the renewal products are what I use now! I love the natural ingredients esp. I highly recommend this night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I know that smell, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. I tried this for the first time last night. Then I kept getting a smell like my kitchen cleanser. I thought it was on my hands so washed them thoroughly. Still smelled. Had to be Burt's."
"I won't use this product again. I can kiss that $6.00 away. (Yes, $6.42 at Walmart)"
"I love this night cream! I've been using it in combination with the other products in this line (cleanser, serum, and eye cream) and they have been making a big difference. My skin is much softer even though the air is getting colder and drier. Fine lines are lessening. I feel like if you were planning on purchasing only one product out of this line, this would be the one to choose. It's so thick and creamy and amazingly hydrating! This entire line smells amazing!!"
"Having moved to AZ, it has been a challenge to find a hydrating cream. It was frustrating since nothing seemed to give results and my skin felt dry and dehydrated. I tried this renewal night cream and have used it for a little over a week and I'm thrilled with the reslts. I use it under my makeup during the day and overnight too. Love it!"
"I bought this cream today and used it for the first time. As for half an hour, no negative symptom. Only my skin is oily and shiny. Is it normal ?"
This cream seems ultra moisturizing to me. My face is smoother and plumped up in the am with a dewy feel. It goes on with a nice non greasy thick consistency and has no smell. I love it!
"I use Burt's eye cream, day cream, and night cream. Best facial creams I've ever used. Totally refreshes and brightens my skin. I absolutely love all their products."
Great price for a night cream. I have realy dry skin at night and this helps. Not heavy and not too thin of a texture. I just dont like the medicated smell.
"I recently started using this night cream and my skin soaks it up. I wake up with soft, dewy, firmer skin. I plan to use it every night."
This night cream is so creamy and my skin loves it! My skin texture looks more healthy and my wrinkles less visible. Highly recommend it!
"I've been using Renewal Firming Night Cream for 6 months and I'm really impressed: even in winter, the cream keeps my skin hydrated and glow! I would also like to know if the cream can be used during pregnancy"
"Nice, does soften skin. Haven't noticed any wrinkle difference.LOL"
Love it! Blends into the skin well and doesn't feel heavy on the skin or greasy.
This renewal firming cream feels so good .....put it on right before I go to bed & in the morning my face is soft & really does firm up nice! The smell is awsome too!! Would recommend it highly!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is fantastic. It's rich creamy texture makes for a dreamy night product. I now use it every night and now wake up with the softest feeling skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one of the loveliest firming, moisturizing creams I have ever used. Not at all greasy, a little goes a long way, it makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and it absorbs beautifully. I would recommend this to anyone with mature skin."
"I have tried several Burt's Bees products, many of which I love. The Renewal Firming Night Cream, however, has caused me to breakout on my chin and other areas on my face. I do wash my face every night before applying, haven't had this happen in years. I like the feel/consistency and the smell of the cream, but I am afraid to use it other than on my forehead."
"I've been using this lotion for almost a month, and I'm already seeing great results. I might add that it's not only great for the face and neck--I've had three children, so I figured why not try it on my tummy as well? The skin there is definitely firmer than it was at the start of the month! Also this lotion is not greasy, and it smells great! I'd highly recommend it, and I'd definitely buy it again!"
I love that this night cream doesn't include nasty chemicals while providing my face the nightly moisture it needs. I also like that this face cream absorbs quickly and has a pleasant scent that isn't overwhelming. I made the switch to this night cream over a year ago and I am happy.
"I have been using this night cream for a few days now and so far I am loving it! My face feels very fresh and smooth in the morning and the smell is amazing! I am really looking forward to seeing the results after using it for a little while, but so far so good!"
"oh my, my skin felt so good after I used this. thank you for such wonderful lotion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Use every night. This cream firms and keeps my skin moisturized through the nightt. I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
is this safe to use while your pregnant?ive been using this product for almost 3 years now i live it but i got pregnant i wasnt sure if it safe to use it during my pregnancy
"I used this product once and it sort of broke me out, which is really rare for me. It caused small bumps all over my forehead and I immediately stopped because I thought it may get worse. It smells a little too strong as well."
"My skin has been really dry all winter. After trying other products, I decided to try this new line of Burt's. I love it! My skin looked and felt better after one night! It was just what I was looking for."
although its nice the product did not break me out but its just not for my skin i woke up the next morning in hives and also the smell of this is just very odd..im not sure i will be buying from burts bees again i just dont trust their products anymore.
I love this cream and feel it is really helping it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've never had a firming cream! I thought I'd give this a try and simply love this!!
"This is the only brand I can use,came on time and exactly what I expected and a good price"
LOVE this product! It REALLY works. The Burt's Bees Renewal line is my favorite.
"Love this night cream - light, non greasy, smells great. Once again Burt's Bees has hit a homerun."
It's really disappointing to see aluminum included in your product ingredients.Burt's Bees really has changed!
