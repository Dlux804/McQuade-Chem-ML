I just got this product I have been using for a few that it seems like is working very well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have gotten months of use, applying this every other night, in rotation with my Rx Retinoid. My skin is VISIBLY smoother and clearer in the morning after using this, and my pores appear smaller. My only hesitation in repurchasing would be the price. Paula's Choice and Alpha are competitors at a lower cost. Olay would have a unique drugstore home run product if they were to re-release this at say, the $20-$25 mark."
"Please don't discontinue the Nightly Purifying Micro-Peel. I have been using it for years, and it's the best night cream/anti-aging serum you have. It is also free of fragrance and parabens, which many knowledgeable customers are looking for these days. It has many great reviews on many sites/magazines, so I can't be the only one who will miss it! You will lose me as a customer once this goes, as I see you are adding fragrance and parabens to your newer products. Please reconsider."
I was able to use this at least 2 times a week and my skin really started to look terrific! My overall skin appearance looked fresh and fantastic and my make-up has never looked so good! I'm going to be a frequent buyer of this product. I loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love! Highly recommend this product, it will bring all the 'yuck' to the surface rapidly so turning the rate your skin renews from 28days to (I'm guessing) to a 14 day turn over but the end results are worth the, possible break out , but after it clears your skin in all fresh, new, firm, &looking youthful! ;)"
"I've experienced fantastic results with this product. I've never used a 'peel' product before, but there are noticeable (and very positive) changes in my skin over the 6 weeks I've been using the product. My pores are smaller, fine lines diminished and my skin is much more radiant. I'm thrilled with the outcome! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this micro-peel product! I am on my second bottle of it, and my skin has never looked better! I live in Florida and have a convertible, so my face gets a lot of sunshine. This product evens out my skin tone and leaves it very healthy looking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've noticed that the bottle is manufactured differently, depending on where you purchase (Amazon, Target, Walmart). Don't know which is the newer one. One shows actual dropper bulb on bottle, where the other one is hidden. Don't know which is newer. When I find out, I will rate properly. Why does this say I'm 12. It gives option for Birth Month... When submitting it says age 12. I'm 54."
"this product has worked wonders and now my face is acne free and spots are faded.I tried other products, but non of them came close to this. Thank you for providing great products that actually work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the Pro-X Nightly Purifying Micro-Peel for 3 nights I have noticed less visible pores and a smoother complexion ...I'm sold! It is great to find a product that stands up to its claims, the results can't be denied. I have used Olay product for over 15 years and while I have tried other more costly brands I ALWAYS come back to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. My skin feels so clean and fresh after use. I love the way my face looks after I use it. It feels soft and firm. There is nothing I don't like about Pro-X micro-peel. My skin just keeps improving over time. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product so much that I gave some to my son's elementary school teacher who had just turned 40. I had put a lot of different skincare items in her gift bag, but the next day she was so excited to tell me that the Pro-X Nightly Purifying Micro-Peel had transformed her skin overnight! She too noticed a difference upon waking up like I do each morning after I use it. It somehow smooths and plumps the skin while you sleep. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After just one week of using this product, my skin is smoother, remarkably softer and brighter. My coworkers are asking what I am using so they have noticed the change in my skin. This product is a keeper. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this for almost 2 weeks, I noticed a definite difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I just looked younger and more rested! My skin tone was much more even and the lines in my face were much less noticeable. There was a plumper appearance to my skin as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"so far I like it. I have not seen any immediate difference but the company was pestering me for a review the very same week I got the sample.I was trying to wait till I had used it a while. it feels good on the skin, I have very sensitive skin, it doesn't burn and I have not broke out. the dropper was a bit of a learning curve but its fine now. I will continue to use the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Skin feels softer and fine lines are lessened.I also have a nice glow to my skin. I am 54 and I was at a dinner last night and a gentleman told me I looked like I was in my early 40's. Love the Olay product line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product every night for the last two weeks and I love the way my skin looks! Every morning I wake up to fresh, younger looking skin. My pores look smaller and skin tone more even. Fine line don't exist anymore! My 12 year old said I look like I'm 20 not 46! Thanks Olay you have done it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for several weeks. I do a slight difference in my overall tone of my skin. I am not really sure what improvements I am to see. But I would like to see with continued use, if there is more changes. I am a faithful Olay product user. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this product! My skin is softer and clearer..and I had a brown spot that has lightened considerably. I will certainly purchase this product once I am out of my sample! Thank you, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about two weeks now, and my skin texture has noticeably improved. My skin is smoother, more even, and feels plumper, somehow. There is a slight stinging sensation when the product is first applied, and it can be a bit drying. I use a night cream over this, and it feels great. The packaging for this product may be my favorite part: the cap measures out a perfect amount for each use, which takes all the guess work out of it. Such a great design! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am still trying to find the right product that ""works for me"". I used this daily for 2 weeks and did not see significant results. Its very gentle. I had no tingling, redness or exfoliating effect. Packaging/pump was unique and a good feature. The main thing I am trying to target is hyperpigmentation. I have not seen any improvement using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been blessed with pretty good skin to begin with, but the fine lines and wrinkles are starting to show. In 5 days I did notices an improvement to the texture of my skin. I can't say that I noticed the softening of any lines. I will be interested to see what a month of product use will accomplish. Worth trying if you don't want to go to the dermatologist, but it's not photoshop. Have realistic expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The peel was easy to apply, and dried quickly. Certain area tingled/stung a little upon application, but it subsided quickly. After washing with Olay cream cleanser to remover the micro-peel, skin was noticeably refreshed looking, as if I had a professional facial. This was after just the first application, improved results followed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love it excellent product.I would tell everyone to use.I have used all your product sence I was 27 I. 45 and my friends ask me what I use because I look so young. My Friend told me about Olay one day I looked at her face,She's 50 and asked her why she glows she told ma about Olay and I been a keeper ever seems. Love my Olay"
It's still pretty early but I think this project will work well. It does not burn or itch. Goes on smoothly and works well in between my nighttime routine of facewashing and applying of Olay facial moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great non irritating overnight glycolic acid product. I loved the moisturizing benefits and the fact that after a week my skin looked brighter. I have high hopes for continued improvement. I would like to see Olay follow this up with Glycolic Acid pads to further improve my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The appearance of my skin is actually better. I was skeptical at first, but the pores on my nose and forehead look much clearer, and my cheeks feel and look moisturized. I have combination skin: t-zone with really dry cheeks, and I see improvement in both areas. I was afraid it would dry out my cheeks even more, but I was wrong. I recommend giving this a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that it seems to tighten my skin without the skin feeling tight. I have only just begun using it so I have not seen long term results yet. I have been an Olay gal since I was 21 so thanks for the free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Packaging- I thought I boke the top off at first. But I like the concept of measured out for you. I never know if I am using too much or too little. Product- After first night of use my skin was super soft and my blush stayed on all day! Day 7 - my skin was super soft and it looked a bit brighter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this for maybe 10 nights.. I wash my face at & then follow the easy directions, using 2 drops & I don't even need my nightly lotion... I've noticed my 2 age spots are fading & pores are shrinking... I really love it & appreciate the full sample! Thank you Olay.!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product felt like it was really working but my skin was very dry. I really had the need to apply my nightly moisturizer on top of this specific product. I believe that I still have to use it more to be able to see better/more noticeable results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's OK but if you have some where to go the next day , you will be all red .You felt tingling right after you put it on. I do not know if that is a good or bad thing . I love Olay products and have been using them since I was a teenager. I do not look my age by far thanks to Olay , but I'm just not sure on this product I will give it another shot.

"I just got my sample a few days ago, but my face feels and looks smooth and refreshed. Loved the bottle design. the product absorbs very quickly. Just need more time to see the results but I'm sure they'll be great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using this for less than a week. I've seen some brightening in my skin, so will keep using. There no dramatic overnight effect, but I wasn't expecting any. I do like the applicator. It provides a consistent amount, that is just enough to provide an even coat with wasting any. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has the right balance of gentle exfoliation. I do use a moisturizer afterward, and I can see it helps the moisturizer to get into my skin better. I wake up with glowing, even tone, and soft skin from first night using it, and it continues to improve over the next few night of usage. I love just adding one step in my skincare routine will have such good result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Although I have only had this product for 4 days I see a difference in the lines in my face. I am 34 with the usual aging…mostly my frown line between my brows and smile lines on my cheeks. Using this product for just the past 4 nights has shown improvement on these lines…a lot actually. The product is slightly stick at first but is not a problem wearing to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pleasantly surprised how smooth my face looked after just one night of use. The fine lines around my eyes even looked more diminished. My skin tone also seemed more evened out. I will definitely purchase this product in the future. The one very small drawback was that my face a little tacky upon application, so I would recommend giving it some time to dry before bed and not using your favorite pillowcase. Still would not give up this product over that!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many different face serums and this one tops them all. I noticed results almost immediately after I began using it, my fine lines were not as noticeable and my skin has a younger softer appearance to it!! I also love the way it leaves my skin feeling so soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have used it many times. I love it. My face feels soft and looks young. I have gotten many compliments on how I look younger than i really am! I'm 55 and I have few wrinkles.
This has made a big difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I have noticed like fine lines under my eyes and my skin feels hydrated and healthy. So impressed!
This is amazing!! Made me feel younger after just one use. I love how you get to peel it off. While you are removing it from your face you are also peeling away all those dead skin cells. I willl definetly purchase more.!!!!
