This is the best face cream I've used. And the scent is light. I have had complements on how good I smell. The only thing different is I started using this produce.
I love this product. It is very creamy and goes on so nice and it smells nice. For me it is a very nice primer if I want to put on foundation. Love it. I have left the house for work and turned around to go all the way back home because I forgot to put it on. Cannot go a day without.
"Love it! I use it more than I use my expensive Shisheo cream. It's so creamy and feels good and nourishing on my skin, and of course, I love that it has SPF . As always, Walmart ships quickly"
"I've been using this brand since i was like 18yrs old. Today i'm 40 and and will still be asked to show my id for me to buy a drink or enter the club....lol..... I started using Whip Regenerist about 2wks ago, with a collaboration of the way it smells and feels, i can't help but look at myself like i'm still 21...Thank You Olay...from me and my 70yr old mom that can pass for 50!!!!"
I was hesitant about buying this due to the high price in drug stores... but finally caved in. First off the way it's product looks is worth the money. It's a good amount of moisturizer and has a cap to seal as well. It's a moisturizer and primer in one.. as soon as you put this on it goes right into your skin and dries instantly. It has such a good scent to it but doesn't irritate skin at all.
My my skin super soft and glowing. Very refreshing. But I don't feel it does much for fine lines though.
After applying it has a more powder like texture which I did not like. Other than that it is good
"Claims of evening your tone and reducing pores didn't really work for me and I thought well at least it is matte and has 25 spf, but the ""matte""-ness also fell short. Forehead still a bit shiny (not sheen unfortunately), although better than their regular face cream in terms of its less sticky feel just don't expect matte. I've had better products for a matte finish. It smells good though and fun to apply. Overall, it claimed to do many things but spread itself too thin."
"Application is smooth, but balls up on the skin when it dries, instead of absorbing."
"I have been using this product for the past month in hopes that it will help minimize my enlarged pores and the texture of my skin. It did not. Although it did not help with that situation, the product did feel light on my face and had a nice smell. It kept my face hydrated (I live in Hawaii, where it's SUPER HUMID). This product was alright. I will not be repurchasing as it was a little pricey, too."
"I got a sample in a magazine and thought it was great bought the full size and it was not scented like the sample. You have to use a lot of this product because it dries so fast and you can't get your makeup on without feeling like you have Elmer's glue on your face. My pores aren't any smaller and my non tzone areas are now more dry now, with no decrease in oil in my t zone."
I'm really liking this product because it's very lightweight but moisturizes well. It also has SPF 25 so I'm not using another product. Most moisturizers with SPF don't blend well but this one is light as a feather. My makeup looks great since using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product leaves my skin smooth and soft. I like the light creamy feel of this product, but I LOVE the results I see from Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizer. After using it for a month, the small lines forming below my lips were gone and the lines above my lips were less apparent. The results from this product are not as dramatic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, an excellent product. Loved the texture and quick absorption on the skin. The resulting hydration? Absolutely outstanding! My skin felt soft and looked radiant. However, product has a VERY strong fragrance. I prefer a skin care product with a more subtle fragrance, if any. Might not be suitable for those sensitive to strong scents.Consider making a fragrance-free version for them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Luminous Whip absorbs quickly, so there is little waiting time to apply make up. It did not moisturize my face well enough. During December in New York, my face needs more moisture than Whips provides. This would be a great product to use in warmer weather. I currently use Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream SPF 30. There is an Olay product for every skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product absorbs quickly leaving your face with a fresh feeling. A definite plus was one I didn't feel the product could deliver on, but it definitely helped minimize large pores. Would buy this produc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay's luminous whip with SPF smells good, feels great and the texture is amazing - so soft, super light and moisturizing. It helps even my skin tone, making it look better & brighter. It quickly absorbs leaving no residual ""sticky"" feeling. The dry patches I get at the end of the day are nowhere to be found as my skin stays hydrated and smooth. This is a fantastic brightening moisturizer and you don't need to use much - a little goes a long way. Love, love, love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved using this Olay Luminous Whip face moisturizer so much! First of all the texture is very light weight. It has a light scent and smells good. My skin is always so much drier in the winter. My skin instantly soaked this up. My skin was so soft after applying it. It didn't wear off during the night or the next day. It's better than my high end name brand favorite moisturizer. The only problem I had was removing the cap off the bottle inside the lid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great addition to my current skin care regimen. The feel of Olay Luminous Whip is just what I need for the cold weather. It smells really good. The best parts of it? I didn't have any breakouts (major points!) and it's great to layer with makeup. Yay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Luminous in the pump bottle, and now tried the Whips. Whips seems even lighter, goes on smoother AND is 25 SPF rather than the 15 in he pump bottle. I use this during the day, and the Regenerist cream at night for the wrinkle battle. So I get the best of both worlds. My skin does seem brighter since using the Luminous line. And the Whips is even more ""spa"" like, a treat. Best though, is the 25 SPF for daytime use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was curious to see how something could be both ""luminous"" and ""matte,"" since those terms seem contradictory. However, the Whip feels fine going on and does not give a matte mask. This product's greatest appeal is its contribution to a radiant complexion. Don't underestimate the value of that SPF25; it's important because most new foundations coming don't include sunscreen. This Whip has the right active ingredients and 25 is a perfect number. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this moisturizer. its smells very nice. It absorbs into skin leaving it soft and hydrated. I love the matte finish. it can be used with or without make up. I will repurchase and recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first saw this I was wondering if you would need a lot of product to get full coverage as it looked whipped and airy! It's actually a great combination of whipped and creamy, much thicker than it looks. It feels wonderful on my skin, soft, and silky - it seems to have a pearl-like finish, leaving your skin feeling powdery smooth! It works well on my face leaving it moisturized and hydrated but not at all sticky or greasy - absorbs very well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the feel on my skin. It goes on a light cream and absorbs quickly, leaving a smooth matte finish. I appreciate the spf 25 feature without any greasy or heavy feel. Another great addition to my Olay skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product seems to immediately help my skin tone giving it a beautiful even brightness, even on first application. Seems like continued use may provide even better skin tone results. Love the way it feels. Perfect primer for makeup. Nice clean smell. Great moisturizer with an spf. Feels like silk, not greasy. This was a free sample provided by Olay and an honest review of the product after one weeks use. I will definitely purchase again and highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the light smooth texture of this product. A little goes a long way, which is always appreciated. After the first week I really noticed that my skin was looking healthy and bright. Usually with no makeup it can look pretty dull and tired. I even left he house without any makeup, and that is a rare occurrence. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very smooth and does slightly reduce appearance of pores and even skin tone. However, it does not moisturize as well as Olay Complete. I found that combining the two products reduced the effectiveness of the Whip's intended benefits of reducing appearance of pores and the ""brightening"" effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Olay Luminous Whip Face Moisturizer SPF 25 for about 2 weeks now. I love the way it feels from the start, it is very light and fresh feeling, it covers easily and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I really appreciate the matte finish for days that I go make up free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the second time I'm doing this review. Don't know why they didn't receive my first one. Since using the Olay Whips moisturizer, my skin feels so smooth and soft. It is light weight and absorbs quickly and doesn't leave an oily feel after. I don't think I used it long enough to see how it works on my freckles yet. But I hope with continue use my freckles will be lighter. Overall, this moisturizer is a very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is the best I have ever used in your line of cosmetics. I have used many of your products over the years, but have never been impressed by any of them the way I have been with this one. The moisturizing effect is fantastic and the feeling stays with you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer feels light, is not greasy. Matte finish makes my oily skin look less shiny all day long! Skin looked and felt smoother after one day; evened out skin tone and slight redness associated with Retin A. I would highly recommend Olay Luminous Whip moisturizer!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really needed the Regenerest whip, but it was unavailable. However, I asked for the luminous whip and i like it, but I really need more moisturizing. I want to thank you for the free Whip. I love Olay products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Whip feels very light and silky on my skin. It does not feel sticky or oily and my skin feels soft and hydrated all day. I like the added benefit of SPF 25 and also has a nice fragrance. I like the luminous line for their brightening and hydrating products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This new Product (Olay Luminous Whip with SPF25) is light, feel like between lotion and cream. It makes my skin soft and hydrated. It has a pleasant scent, absorbs quickly. My skin looks a little brighter after application. I like the fact it has SPF25. I haven't used it long enough to know whether or not it will improve my skin tone. But As a daily moisturizer I like it a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall the product is good. It leaves the skin smooth with a matte finish and is breathable and lightweight. The only issue I had is applying foundation after this cream. I could not spread it in. This moisturizer is good for days when you do not wish to use the makeup. It leaves the skin soft and supple but matte. So it is good for people with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a delightful new product. It is light and fluffy and feels very smooth on application. The fragrance is delicate and not overwhelming as in some creams on the market. I like this Olay product and will definitely buy it in the future. I have been using the Olay Regenerist cream for several years on my aging skin ( 69 years) and really love it. This Olay Whip makes a perfect companion to my Regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is lightweight and moisturizing. I love the lightweight feel and how it makes my skin feel smooth, soft and moisturized. This product has a light fresh sent. I also love the SPF 25 to protect my skin from sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always used Olay 7, and love it. But I'm definitely sold on Olay Luminous Whips. From the first day my skin glowed, and I got so many compliments. I've only used it for about a week and can see the difference in the color of my freckles and the tone has definitely improved. I will recommend this product to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I just received this product in the mail last Friday but prior to getting the email, I was not aware of this product. I have tried it a few time and it feels very light and smooth on the skin and I love the fact that it contains SFP 25, higher than the other Olay products I use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
From the first use my skin felt smooth and silky and gets better with each use. The redness has diminished and my overall coloring is much more uniform. By far the most effective product I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the lightweight of it. I've been an Olay user every since I can remember, I remember seeing my Mom use it when I was younger and her skin is flawless. I tried using other products but nothing gave me the Olay experience #Fan4Life [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I unfortunately could not use this product because of the perfume smell. I am highly sensitive to fragrances and could not use it. If you come out with a fragrance free version I would love to try it. I wanted to try it so bad and just could not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is like satin on your skin. Visible results almost immediately. One thing I would like to see is a fragrance free version. With my allergies almost any scent no matter how light can be annoying to my head and nose. I love this product but do wish it cost a little less. When your on a fixed income this is a little pricey. But it is a wonderful cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is light, fluffy and airy. Perfect for summer but thick enough barrier cream to where in the winter. I've always loved your products and have been using them since I was stationed in Germany in 1989. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like his product because it is light. I currently use your Olay Regenerist at night and it's a heavier cream. I have only used the Whip for a week so I can't attest to any changes yet. Thank you for my free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this feels and it goes on very smoothly. I would definitely buy this product. It feels very light on my face and it's just another great product in your line. I have been using Olay for years and no one thinks I look my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've recived the Olay luminous whip sample product to try out for free, now when I tried this out the fragrance was just right not to strong, it went on smooth (be sure not to use too much because only a small amount will do) I couldn't even tell I had applied Olay whip the second time . Overall this is so far another great product from Olay. Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product smells amazing and feels really nice on the skin. It goes on very smoothly without any rubbing and a little bit goes a long way. I am 75 years old and having been using Oil of Olay since I was 17. I love this new product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product is so great when you are applying it, it goes on so smooth and silky feeling, but so light weight, plus it leaves your skin feeling so nice for hours and hours. I would recommend it to anyone. I am so glad I got a chance to try this as I will be purchasing it from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how the top of the cream has a little notch in it to lift it off to expose the product. It makes it much easier to grab that thin piece of plastic. The cream itself is nice, not too thick, not too thin. I like a day cream that has SPF protection and this one has 25, which is good. I also like a day cream that is smooth and easily soaks into the skin, which this does. The last feature that makes this a great choice for a day cream is that it smells fresh and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how quickly it absorbs in my skin. very creamy and gentle. doesn't feel thick on the skin. makeup went on very smoothly after application. felt good all day long. love that it has SPF. I did a toys for tots motorcycle run and did not get wind or sun burned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product failed to live up to the Olay standard. Olay, is my go to regarding beauty products so I'm familiar with the quality. Although, the Luminous Whip smelled amazing the cream itself failed in quality. I moisturized after washing my face and each time was left with an unexplainable residue: product was not used long enough to determine effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Olay Whips moisturizer. It's light weight, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a shiny look on my skin. My skin feels very soft and smooth. I only used it 3 days so it didn't lighten my freckles yet. Hoping with continue use they will be a little lighter. Overall a very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"What I love about this is that when you apply it to your skin it absorbs instantly. My face feels so soft and looks amazing. Softens the fine lines and brightens. I use little makeup on a daily basis, Just a little blush. This is a moisturizer I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is very light. It doesn't feel heavy on your skin. It brightens while providing moisture. I wish you had a men's line my husband likes every olay product of mine that he sneaks and uses (winking eye) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Luminous Whip is the Product I would have designed for myself! It is much lighter than Olay Luminous Brightening & Protecting Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30. A little goes a long way so it is budget friendly, and it melts into the skin quickly. Be careful around your eyes; do not use it as an eye cream, as it may sting. Use an Olay Eye Cream designed for that thin, delicate skin around your eyes.Great job, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The feel of the product is amazing and it never feels heavy despite the 25SPF. It's light and feels silky on the skin. I gave a lower overall rating because of the scent. It is overpowering. The suggested price is a great value, but I would not personally use it because of the strong scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using play since I was a teen and Inhave very bad allergies to perfume and other smells, I actually love this one it's so smooth when I put it on my face, I put it on at night and next day my face still is smooth especially when I wash my face. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
