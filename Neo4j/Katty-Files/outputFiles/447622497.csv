I'd tried so many things with no luck. After having my second child I developed horrible cystic acne and I tried this after almost a year of dealing with it. Decided to try something different and saw this in the store with collagen written big on the front. Id heard that collagen is good for skin and hair. So I bought it and within 2 weeks my cystic acne was GONE. Pictures attached are 3-4 weeks apart. Have noticed my scarring is also improving. So glad I found this.
"This is my first week of using this product, and I'll never go back! I was able to replace 3 other products with one jar of the Collagen moisture filler."
Two weeks in and my forehead lines are barely noticeable and the lines around my eyes are gone.
"Love this product for several reasons, one being that it can be used both daytime and nighttime. It does the job on my senior complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer and there's not a better price anywhere than here on Jet (THANK YOU JET!) I have very dry skin and this gives me the moisture I need to keep my skin smooth and supple without feeling greasy. Pleasant scent too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this at the start and end of my day to keep moisture in my skin.
I have used this product a little over a week and I already can see the difference.

Purchased this the day before yesterday. Applied as the directions said. it has only been two days. but yes it is helping a lot! I didn't even say anything to anyone. My husband noticed its well as a friend saying how great and young and well rested I looked. Very satisfied with this product. I would recommend it to everyone
"I purchased this product a week ago, not for my face but for my hands!!! I'm 40 years old and my hands have been the first to ���show my age”. This product has been amazing! I could tell a difference the very first time I used it. Looking forward to using this daily as skin care for my hands (and will definitely be using it for my face as well). Thank you so much!!"
"I bought this cream about a month ago and have been using it night and day. I feel this cream is a bit towards sticky side. Smells mild which is good. I am a loreal person, and was a bit disappointed after using this particular product. Since it's just a month, not sure yet if it does what it claims."
"I came across this product a couple of months ago. Previously, I was a long time user of a moisturizer that was only available online but has now been discontinued. I am very happy with this product! I noticed results right away. The lines around my eyes and mouth are gone and the lines on my forehead have really diminished. I use it on my neck as well. I have difficulty finding it in the stores sometimes so I am hoping it is not going to be discontinued. Thanks for a great product!"
Honestly this filler has definitely improved my skin within days. My face was so so so so dry. And as soon as I started putting this on..it was like wala! Nice smooth supple. I'll let you guys know if it reduces any line or wrinkles but this is for sure one of my go 2 ..and favorite products now:) I absolutely love it. And it smells so go0o0d!!
"I bought this about a week ago and I absolutely love it. I use it as a night cream since it's too heavy to wear under makeup. I start by using an exfoliating face wash then this. It makes my face so smooth and hydrated. I live in harsh winters/sit in a dry aired office, so this moisturizer has been a lifesaver!!"
"Best moisturizer I ever used. Plumps wrinkle immediately upon use. Dissolves quickly. I have sensitive skin , but this cream does not bother my skin at all. I have been using this product for 2 years now. Love it! I would like to try Collagen Lotion, but can't find it on drugstore shelvs. It can only be bought online. Please never discontinue this product. Thanks Loreal!"
"I have very very dry skin. No acne, but nothing seemed to moisturize my face enough and my wrinkles were becoming more noticeable. This product has been amazing! I never feel or look oily. My skin does not dry out throughout the day anymore. And maybe I'm crazy, but I could swear my wrinkles are less noticeable! I love this product and can't believe how inexpensive it is. I can't imagine what their more expensive products are like, but I'm sure I'll be giving them a try this winter!"
"I am about 2/3 of the way through my first jar. The only positive is that it does add volume. The negatives: doesn't hydrate, my smile lines are now prominent whereas they weren't before, bleaches the face to a white and the texture is very off putting and hard to work with. I don't understand why they replaced the original rich cream formula and replaced with this failure."
"I use to use expensive creams, and they have done nothing for me. I started using this loreal"
"Collagen, cream and its only been a month and I have seen a big difference, that even my coworkers are sking me what I'm using on my face. I truly recommend this cream. I even have my husband using it as Well."
"I have been using Collagen Filler every day and night to reduce wrinkles. My skin responds very well to collagen. L'Oréals collagen cream is affordable and works great! My wrinkles are greatly reduced. I use this product first and then apply Rosy Tone. My 50 year old face looks beautiful, fresh and so much smoother! Thank you L'Oréal!"
I have used alot alot of different kinds of face lotions this is the best I would never switch it took me along time to find a goood one and this is the one it diminished completly all dry spots on my face without leaving it oily it feels like I just left the spa so clean so fresh I recommend it for everyone its for all just try it if you don't like it I will be surprised cause I'm very sensitive about my face so for me to absolutely love it just wowed me thanks loreal for another great product
"I've been using this for about 3 months now , I cannot say enough good things about it ! I have combo oily and dry skin and it makes my skin feel so smooth and moisturized and beautiful , I use it not only as a moisturizer but as my primer under makeup , looks so flawles . If you haven't tried it your missing out ❤️"
I absolutely adore this product! I'm writing this review because I'm having a hard time finding this and the age perfect cleanser in any stores. Please tell me these products are not being discontinued! It's amazing when a person finds something that truly works for their skin it gets discontinued without anyone knowing. Please someone let me know.
I love this product. I bought it 2 months ago and apply it at night it hasn't improved my skin tremendously. I used to have dry skin and excessive dry patches but this moisturizer has helped my skin get back to normal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this product and since using it have seen a significant difference
in the creases around the eyes.
I could not believe the price on this 3 pack of coiiagen cream. Less than the price of just one jar with other brands. A Deal
I have been using this for a few weeks. The appearance and texture of my skin has really improved. It is lightly scented. So far it has not caused any itching or breakouts.
I absolutely LOVE this product. I have purchased it over and over again. I love how light it feels and smells good compared to others I have tried. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
I ve been using this cream for a week now. I can see huge difference. My skin is radiant and plumped. Wrinkles are disappearing. Price is very reasonable. My dermatologist told me I have beautiful skin. Thank you again L'Oréal.
I purchase this product on a regular basis and it absorbs quickly and reduces the fine line around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wife loves it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Works well and is non greasy for a night cream.
"My thirsty skin basks in this moisturizer. I wish I had found this in 2009, when I realized my skin was needing moisture. A Clinique specialist sent me to the Elizabeth Arden counter for help back then and little help it was as I had to layer two expensive products that seemed to disappear quickly. I now use Collagen Moisture filler twice a day, layering it with Revitalift Face and Neck cream."
Nice hydrating cream. I use this both day and sometimes night. For day use I apply it under my Youth Code spf 30 lotion and they work great together. One of the very few creams I can use without my skin breaking out and I have tried many! Thank you Loreal for using quality ingredients!
"I HIGHLY recommend this product especially for women over 40. It's absolutely amazing and I love it! I can't say enough good things about it. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but it is amazing how my skin looks after using it. I'm so glad I tried it because I have purchased several times now and will continue to do so."
"It's almost winter in the North, and walking to class each day in college really takes a toll on my skin. Every year around fall my skin starts to get red, blotchy, and peely. I went into the store to buy another product L'Oreal had, but couldn't find it. Skeptical I bought this one, as it was in my college level price range. I loved it! My skin is no longer flakey, and it is very soft. I have sensitive skin, but don't have a problem with this product, or breaking out from it."
"I've used this cream for three months now and it is the first cream of many that I've tried that I actually purchased a second jar of! I usually break out from everything even sensitive face creams, this is the only cream that does not do that. A little gos along way and I avoid the chin area because its a thicker cream. thank you loreal for making a simple cream for my dry skin!"
Always use it!!
"I bought about a month ago, and it is wonderful I have noticed a difference in my skin, softness, and how well my skin looks"
I've been using for a month now and I can tell a difference especially under my eyes. Will definitely continue using. Thanks
I've been using for several month and I really like it. I love this moisturizer.
"I'm 31 and needed something for some fine lines I'm starting to notice. This product smells and feels great when applied. I've only been using this for a few weeks, but like it enough to continue use and hope to see positive results soon."
This has really helped to plump and soften my skin. I have noticed a difference in just a few days. I'm in love! Please don't stop making this!! A little goes a long way.
"it is tack/sticky and stays that way. I bought it to use on both of my arms which have some creping and it does do a good job there. But it does not work into the skin and I had to put long sleeves on. I'd never put it on my face unless a super thin application. thought of throwing it away, but I'll save it for the winter"
"I have been using Loreal since I was in my 20's I am now in my late 50""s and this product is the only one you should trust for keeping your skin at it's best! Everywhere I go someone will ask my age when I tel them they are speechless....! I have always used this product and will contiue to use...I tell all my friends and family use this one and you will be amazed !"
"my absolute favorite cream. i'm in my 20's and i was looking for something to hydrate my skin day and night and this just does it. it makes my skin so soft i cannot stop touching it. it smells beautiful. the only thing i do not like is that it comes in such a small amount. other than that, i love it."
"Great Product for both genders...Accountability, Reliability & Dependability..."
"Looked and felt like a very bad sunburn, and I had not been in the sun."
Really love how it makes my skin feel I can't go with out it.
I bought this 2 weeks ago I am 51 it is to sticky my face is sticky all day. The other day I was outside and it was windy my face got dirty from dust sticking to it. You definitely can't wear it under make up you will sweat and I use bare minerals. I bought ROC after couple weeks so much better. I do have other liberal products that I love just not this one.
"I purchased this product thru another site that reviews mosturizers for aging skin. I am however, just seeing the results. When I started using this product, my sking around the ( ) around my mouth started to peel! and my skin on my cheeks became red and my skin became extremly dirty! So I stopped washing my face in the mornings , using only a toner and the Loreal Mosture Filler, Day/Night Cream, so far its has stopped the red, dry patches that were occuring and the redness has subsided!."
"I have absurdly tempermental skin, but I've been using the Day/Night moisturizer for about 6 months now, and am a huge fan. I use it day and night during the dry New England winters, just at night in the shoulder seasons, and only a couple of times a week during the summer because it is a little thick. It works a tiny miracle any time my face is looking a little... haggard... definitely helps to plump up those little wrinkles that can make me look ""old and tired""!"
"Being from the northeast and as the fall and winter seasons hit I needed a moisturizer that kept my skin soft, supple, and also worked on my wrinkles. (I'm knocking on forty's door!) This product really stepped up to the plate. Even my husband is using it for himself after he began complaining about his skin. It absorbs quickly and I can use this moisturizer for day or night cream. And I don't have to pay a large amount of money or sign up for a monthy billing program. Great Job Guys!"
It's really good moisturize keeps my skin soft all day. Plus it could work like a primer.
It helps smooth your skin and is a great pre-makeup base during the day and a nice textured night cream at night.
"I love this product and would have given it a 5 except for the smell. I cannot wear heavily perfumed face creams as my skin is very sensitive, and for this I am very sad. I have tried several L'Oreal face products because they are wonderful for my skin, but I cannot wear them for more than a day or two. Please, please L'Oreal make a hypoallergenic version of your creams!!!!"
"i have been using these product for a year, i like it cause is light, and you can use day and night, my friends have notice a difference on my skin, they ask me what i was using , acctually the same day we went to target , and my friend bought 3 jars . i love it."
Called Customer Service and found L'Oreal Wrinkle De-Crease was discontinued. Asked for the closest alternative. Suggested to try the Collagen Moisture Day/Night Cream in the Blue Container. It works fine... lots of moisture if your skin is dry. I still miss the Wrinkle De-Crease product though.
"I have been using this products for two years, and I love it. Also the price wise very reasonable and it works same as an expensive products."
"I bought this product a month ago and I'm very happy to the result of my skin, especially now it's winter."
Very light. skin feels fresher and looks somewhat brighter after using. This is always on my face and goes well under makeup. K
This is the best cream I have ever used for my dry skin. My skin is in better condition at 59 than it was in my 20s!
I bought this cream and thought it would make my skin feel great. I used it and my face didn't feel soft and hydraded it felt dull. i didn't like the way my skin felt so i returned it.
Have used this product for three months and love it!
I like to use Loreal product always I feel confident regarding that.
Goes on smoothly
