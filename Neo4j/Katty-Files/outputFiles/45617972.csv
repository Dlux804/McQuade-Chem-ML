I love this! There's not too many things I can put on my face but this is definitely one thing I can! Love it!
"I love this product it is the only product that makes my skin feel plump and healthy. I have been using it as a moisturizer on my face, neak, and hands for a year and it does wonders."
"Very thick, it feels like it kinda blocks my pores. But it works wonderfully when I mix it with my normal lotion. I will be buying more Of it or a similar cream."
