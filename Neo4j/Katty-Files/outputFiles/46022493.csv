"I had a dermatitis breakout for 5 months that none of my prescriptions would work on. After 2 days of use, the breakout stopped itching. After a week of use, the breakout was gone."
"This stuff is outright amazing!!! I have seborrheic dermatitis and upon the first time using this it cured my skin. I couldn't believe it. I have tried many, many creams and lotions and nothing worked until I found this. I have a presentation from my doctor and this works so much better. The price is so low that you wouldn't think it works as well as it does but do not let that fool you. It packs a big punch. I will keep buying this forever! I use this only at night as my evening moisturizer and I couldn't be happier!"
I was skeptical considering it's higher cost and primary active ingredient being merely hydrocortisone. The difference however was night and day in comparison. It's clear the junk additives in the major brands have played against optimal effacy in over the counter treatment of eczema sufferers.
It has helped a half dollar size excema patch that is on my cheek shrink. Is better than most other stuff I've used. Nothing will rid you of it but has helped shrink for now n
My husband has severe excema on his legs. He says this product works every bit as well as prescription products...
This is my second time purchasing this item. It has really helped my 6 year old son who has eczema. It helps with his itching spells in less than 2-3 minutes
"I was sceptical because of the low price, but thought I would give it a try. Heals my dry cracking knuckles usually overnight. Sometimes, it takes a little longer, but it moisturizes well and stays on."
