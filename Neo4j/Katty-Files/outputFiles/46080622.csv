I love all Cerave products. They are gentle on my skin and has helped my skin look clearer and feel softer. I have been dealing with rosecea for a long time and find this product very helpful.
"Let me just start by saying that I am a Skin Care Addict! I am 40 years old with Combination/ Acne Prone Skin. I have tried so many skin care brands and products from high end to drug store, and I Believe that CeraVe is the best Skin Care Line out there. Way Better than High End! I love this night cream. It is loaded with peptides and skin loving ingredients and it feels so good on the skin! I pair it with the Cerave Gel Oil and I wake up with soft smooth glowing skin! It really is an amazing product that I love using!"
"Only been using this cream for a week, but I really like it. Soaks in rapidly, moisturizes nicely. My face feels clean after application....not greasy at all. The lines on my face even seem to be diminished. I will buy again."
The hand creams are great but this stuff stinks. Hard to sleep with that smell rubbed into my face! I was also disappointed in how little was in the jar. Very misleading. I think I'll scoop it out and put on my kitchen scales. Doubt it weighs what huge container lists on label.
"This is my favorite cream for years now. But this time my new jar was only 1/4 full, really just a dollop at the bottom. The very small quantity makes it more expensive than the usual half-full jar I expected."
I've heard such great things about this product but why is my jar half full? The formula is amazing but I won't use it for it being less than an ounce for the price. This product is very expensive and for it being less than half full is really upsetting. I have to return it tomorrow.
"I was excited to try this product after using expensive salon type products. I wanted to save money while still getting a great product. Well when I opened it, it was literally half full. So much for saving money. I'll return to something I've tried that I know it's worth it's money."
"Yikes! My container was nearly empty when I opened it! I went ahead and tried it, and absolutely love the product. Skin is moisturized and soft even in the morning. However, I feel like the size of the box/container is terribly misleading...there must be 2 weeks of product in there. (at best)"
"I enjoy the micellar water, the sa facial wash, and the body cream. So, generally the CeraVe brand works well for me. For context I have normal skin, with a combination T-zone, early thirties, no significant skin concerns or issues. This moisturizer left my skin sticky and uncomfortable. Must have finally dried during my sleep. Fortunately, I did not have any adverse reaction. But, my skin was not any more moisturized than if I applied no moisturizer in the morning. Will return."
"Very happy with this product, works great and is reasonably priced!"
Goes on very thick. Feel confident that it's moisturizing as long as I've wet my skin first.
not sure yet.... too soon
"So rare to find a fragrance-free moisturizer that doesn't have any noticeable smell. This stuff absorbs amazingly smoothly into my skin and leaves it so soft, never greasy or sticky."
This product has been my go to for anytime my skin is acting up. Ive been on various precription retinoids and acne treatments so my skin is usually in need of something soothing and fragrance free. Thank god for this. Its like the PM lotion but thicker and heavier. Like a blanket of comfort for your face. Im obsessed. Please make larger tubs with more product!
"I have tried a lot of night creams and I think this one is the best. It's thick, it's nourishing. You can feel its hydrating effect the next day. Your skin feels plump, hydrated, and refreshed the next morning. It also helps fade acne scars. This is a savior for dry to normal or combo skin."
"I was looking forward to using this Skin Renewing Night Cream. When I opened the small jar with 1.7 oz, the jar was only half full. Why would I want to pay the price I paid for the quantity I received? I'm totally disappointed."
It feels good on the skin. It has a little fragrance it would better for me if it didn't. Like many said it does come with less product than it should. The product is already set when is filled so it didn't happen during shipping.
"I absolutely love this product. I have tried many creams and like a lot of them, but this one is the best for me. I love the consistency. I find that it is thick but sinks into the skin well. If I apply at night over my entire face, I do so liberally. My skin is soft and smooth in the morning. But I also often apply it in the morning, being careful not to make the layer too thick. And I use it daily as an eye cream. It softens the crow's feet really well. This has become my holy grail moisturizing cream. Highly recommended."
Not enough hydration for me. Kinda waxy feeling and thick. Gentle on the skin but I didn't care for the results. Kinda sat on top of the skin and didn't absorb well. I switched to Aveeno and got much better results.
Pros very moisturizing not greasy at all. Cons I totally agree with reviewers bottle is half filled!
"So I purchased this to compete with my now $70 Murad night cream. Knew CeraVe was dermatologist tested so gave it a try. And wow do I really like it! I put it on before going to bed and What I like the most is in the morning, when I rinse my face with water, my skin feels clean! Not greasy like I have to wash something off my face. For me, this product sinks into my skin and hydrates it without any greasy feeling whatsoever. Highly recommend!"
I began using this product about a week ago. I have sensitive skin which gets really dry during the winter months and with acne to top it off. This cream has soothed my irritated skin and has even helped to improve my acne. I love this stuff and I will be trying the serum soon for daytime use!
"This stuff has a thickness like petroleum jelly, but it melts on your face and ends up not being too heavy. Does a lot for me in helping my face night dry out at night, and seems to help with fine lines around my eyes/forehead. All-in, when I use this I wake up looking better rested and in better shape, which makes it worth using. The ingredients are solid and what you'd expect, and nothing in it seems to irritate my skin. Really pleasant stuff. Having bought a number of other products, this is the one I've settled into."
"I have very sensitive skin and this product works wonders for me. I was very nervous at first because it is a very thick cream and I was afraid it would clog my pores like many other products. However, CeraVe has proved me wrong. Like I said, it's thick, therefore a small nickel size amount covers my entire face and neck."
"I am very pleased with this night cream . I'm 67 years old and it has minimized wrinkles . Friends have complimented me on my complexion many times since I switched to using CeraVe night cream. I use many CeraVe products including that day lotion, serum, and night cream.and have not been disappointed with any of them."
"I'm almost 60, my skin has a tendency to be oily in the tzone and needs moisture on the neck, eye and upper lip area. I was hoping to LOVE this like all the other people with the glowing reviews of this product. It definitely helps with the wrinkles but it just feels opaque, does that even make sense? I feel like it sits on my skin and is not absorbed. I like the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream much better."
"I absolutely love this cream. Two things I swear it works as: moisturizer and clears blackheads (on my cheekbones). I have two annoying blackheads on my cheekbones and I Noticed that they return if I'm not consistent at applying the cream or when I run out, but two days after I catch up and apply, they just disappeared. I will continue to buy it as long as I live."
"I love this product, it is a must have for every skin care routine!! I had eczema on my jaw and by my mouth and using this product helped clear it up!! Ever since I've started using it, my skin has become clearer and softer. It does leave a dewy feeling but definitely not greasy. Highly recommend this product,would not change a thing!"
"This cream works very well on my dry skin. Don't be fooled by the light texture, the moisturizing lasts for hours. I use it day and night because it makes my skin feel so good--dewy but not greasy. I have used products that are three times the price that aren't as good. I also love that it is not tested on animals. Perfect."
I have fairly normal skin. I'm 60 years old. I wanted something a little heavier at night for the colder months since winter can be so drying. I use Cerave PM and LOVE IT. Yes the night cream is thicker that's why it's a cream. I mixed it with a pump of the Creave PM. It doesn't take much. It was just perfect. I'll just use the pm in the pump now that the weather is warming up. But will definitely use the night cream when the cold weather returns.
"Have been using the Renewing Night Cream for several months, absolutely love it! Notice the texture, clarity and moisture in my skin has improved will continue to use. To note I also use this in the day applying just a light amount under my cosmetics. Night time I apply a heavier layer wake up the next day and my skin looks so fresh."
"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It's rich and thick and almost paste-like or balm-like but it keeps my retinol-treated skin deeply hydrated without feeling greasy. It's especially great during the harsh Canadian winters. Please Cerave, never change this product... it's perfect!"
This stuff is golden! I absolutely love how well it really works! I have been using it every night for a week now.
Love this nightly moisturizer. My face stays moist and plump through the entire nigh and wake up to healthy looking skin more so than any of the other many creams!
I've been using this for about 3 month and my skin has gotten noticeably softer. it seems like a good product that is worth the money.
This is my new favorite! It costs far less than the $30 and $40 creams I was using and is way more effective. My 70-year-old skin looked smoother and brighter after the first time I used it. I'm very impressed.
"Thought I couldn't find another CeraVe product I could get hooked on and then I tried the Renewing Night Cream, wonderful!! I totally love this product along with almost all CeraVe products. Everyone give it a try you won't be disappointed:)"
This is my favorite moisturizer and I use it night and day (under my sunscreen). Please consider selling it in a larger package! Nothing else keeps my skin feeling as hydrated as this cream.
This product came half full. I dont think its fair. why did a pay for a product thats half way?
"The best for my skin, fragrance free. Great price!"
"Couldn't twist the cap open, was on so tight as if it was glued on, Didn't get to try the product, sad.. was looking forward to trying it."
"I love CeraVe products, so I figured I would try the skin renewing line. I was excited at first, but quickly disappointed on the amount of product in the container. Only 1/2 full? is it really 1.7 oz? Too light product for the price. Seems like a ripe off."
"I do like the product. However, for the price and as little as I get. It is not worth it. Not to mention the container is only halfway filled. My container had so much space in it that I could of got twice as much of the product. I do not understand for the price and as little of the product I am getting it is not worth the money. It is frustrating that CeraVe only fills the container ONLY HALF WAY. It's robbery."
I love this brand and the night cream feels great on the skin!
Rich and luxurious.. great for overnight moisturizer
"Didn't know if it is working on fine lines or not, but my skin didn't break out and it absorbs quickly.... So it's just fine nothing amazing"
Not worth the money...Ive used other cheaper products that did a better job moisturizing my skin. Wont use this again.
This has made a difference in my fine lines disappearing. I put it on after my shower and awake with less wrinkles!
"I didnt really care for this. It is very thick like vaseline and lotion mixed. I have oily, acne prone skin and this broke me out after the first night using it. I did however finish the container as a eye cream."
1. container only 1/2 full; definitely not worth the price although Walmart is priced well compared to other stores
2. very greasy
3. takes forever to soak into the skin; if you apply at night do a couple of hours before going to bed
"I returned this product, because the jar was only half full of the product. Originally I was just going to exchange the jar, because I thought maybe my jar was just a production mistake. It happens. I get it. However, when I was doing the exchange I asked to see how the other jars on the shelf were filled and to my surprise all of them were half full. That's when I opted for a return, because it's not worth the money you spend on it."
"I love this brand, I love all their products!"
It is a really good cream. It help me with my acne. In the mornings my face looks really good.
I love this brand. I like the price point and how moisturizing this is.
Was excited to try this out tonight. I was instantly disappointed after opening up the jar. The jar is only filled halfway with product! I feel ripped off! Especially for the price! Will definitely be looking for something else.
This product is my holy Grail for my face! I have searched for so long for a good moisturizer and this exceeds ALL ! Provided instant relief of dry irritated skin from winter weather... Definitely will keep using!
It's ok didn't do much for my skin.I'm almost done with the product will not buy again..
Yes it dose what it's says
I love it
Smooth and make your skin young and fresh
