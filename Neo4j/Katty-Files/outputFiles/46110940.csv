THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES I USED TO BUY AT A LOCAL PHARMACY. THE PRICE IS A LITTLE LOWER BUT... I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. WAL-MART DELIVERED THEM FOR FREE. I CAN'T BEAT THAT. SAM
"LOVE these wipes. Work marvelous, key to them is let it dry before applying bandage. I have horrible paper like skin and these are a God send.."
Just what we needed.
