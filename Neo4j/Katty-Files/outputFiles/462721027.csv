"I really love this. It blends in so nicely with just a touch of color, I never see an edge. It evens out my skin tone just enough. Doesn't cover completely like a foundation, which I like. It's very natural looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of my favorite products it is light and goes on smoothly. It is moisturizing without feeling greasy. I highly recommend trying it. It is also great for sensitive skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this stuff and have been using it since bareMinerals started making it. I love that I can get it cheaper on Jet!
Love it good coverage all day does not get greasy or change colors. I live in Florida so that is important in the summer when it is smoldering hot
I haven't had a breakout since using this product. Gives a glowing natural look.
great natural looking coverage. A bit expensive but wouldn't want to do without it. I love the fact that it is non irritating to my sensitive skin. This will keep me buying the product.
Great natural looking coverage and non irritation to my extremely sensitive skin. A bit expensive but worth it.
