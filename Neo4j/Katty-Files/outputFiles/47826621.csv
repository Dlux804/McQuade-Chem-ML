I have been using Loreal wrinkle expert 45+ for 3 months now. Im 47 yrs old. I have 4 grown children & 7 grandkids. People tell me all the time how beautiful my skin is & how I dont look my age. Thank you Loreal ‚ù§
"While this product moisturizes without feeling greasy and does in fact help reduce wrinkles and ad in firming, I was more impressed with what it doesn't have. Many of these products with retina-peptides also contain sunscreens. While that might seem to be an advantage to some people, for anyone with minor skin problems like Rosacea this can be an irritant even in the more expensive products. So for a mature woman with delicate skin, this product is in a class by itself."
On my 2nd bottle on and don't see a change whats so ever would never ever repurchase again
I choose this product for my mom and she really like this stuff. It is one of the few moisturizers that doesn't cause any problems for her. It doesn't ball up under make-up and it doesn't cause any break-outs (her skin is pretty prone to that) she have also added it over the top of make-up because the furnace makes her skin feel dry and it doesn't leave a shiny sheen. It soaks in fast and feels good to her.and not over scented either. It has a good sent but not to a point that it smells like a perfume so she likes it
To me the L'Oreal Paris Wrinkle Expert 45+ Day and Night Moisturizer Is a little on the heavy side..........All though after you have it on for a while it's not to bad.......As far as seeing the winkles gone.........Not going to see that in the time one uses a jar of it..........Only time will tell
"My wife uses this product just about daily, although the sample for this review never arrived."
"The scent is excellent, with just a modicum of greasiness, so it is just about perfect!"
"It smells very well! But, my type of skin is very oily for use in the day under makeup! I prefer to use it only at night and it works perfect! And it is easy to apply."
I was using another anti- wrinkle skin cream but then I seen this. The moment I put this on my skin was smooth and it stayed smooth all day. Even after I washed my face. I've been using it for about a week so I can't comment on how it helps with wrinkles but I'm sticking with this one.
"I have extremely dry skin and bought this product out of desperation for relief. I have only been using it for five days and I use it every morning and every night. I cannot believe the difference it has made in just ga short time. I look forward to putting it on every day.  My skin stays very hydrated and smooth, and I can already see that my fine lines and wrinkles have decreased!! I've even had compliments on my skin from a few of my friends"
I have very dry skin and this formula is highly effective on my skin. Pond's is not good enough now that I'm aging so I tried Loreal Wrinkle Expert45+ and it keeps my face smooth and moisturized all day and night. It works great under makeup (foundation); not oily. It smells terrific; love it.
"I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I have noticed my ""crows feet"" ease up. I'm a guy and have bad crows feet because I squint a lot from the sun because my eyes are sensitive and this product is reducing those lines. I have not noticed any smell that some others have stated. It is a tad oily but that isn't noticable to others. I would recommend and I will keep buying this great product. You can purchase at your local Walmart like I did, which is convenient."
Finally a product that delivers! Perfect for my sensitive skin and I saw results immediately. Thank you!!!
It really does moisturize well. It makes the texture of my skin smooth and soft. I love it. It could use less fragrance however.
"I have been using this product for several days now and I can already see a difference.My face and neck are becoming so much more softer and hydrated. So long wrinkles,hello great skin !!!"
"Saw this and decided to try it, I love it! Only been a few days and I already see results , skin feels firm ,and eyes look more lifted. Definitely a keeper"
I love this product! It was my first time using it and I saw results in less than a week. My skin is soft and the faint wrinkles I had became even fainter. I even used it on the tops of my hands! The skin became firmer. Thanks L'oreal!!
Exceptional product to be used at day time and night time. Skin feels smooth after a couple of applications. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is definitely better than what I previously used. It makes my skin feel soft and radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for almost a month and I am truly loving the results! Fine lines on my forehead have disappeared and the fine lines under my eyes are almost gone! I am very pleased with my results!
I just started using this product and am very disappointed in how much fragerence is in it! It is very strong smelling do I guess back to the drawing board for me
"Seems to work about as well as any other wrinkle cream- no better no worse. I don't like the scent - usually use moisturizers with no scent. It's ok but, as I said, just about the same as any other wrinkle cream and probably more expensive."
I don't like this cream too much alcohol parabens and fragrance these ingredients need to be eliminated
I have been using this for about 3 weeks and can tell a difference in my 46 year skin! Just wish it had some kind of sunscreen
This product smells like witch hazel. It smells horrible. This product can not do anything for your skin.
"I love this stuff! And the price is unbelievable. I have tried all kinds of high end skin creams and this is awesome! I used it for a month and went back and got 2 more. Hope they never discontinue this product because it is absolutely fabulous. Every skin is different but this really works for me. (I never write reviews unless I am totally impressed. And believe me, it takes a lot)"
been using this product for a week now an can tell its working ! Love it an the price !
I have not had any improvement in the appearance of my skin since using this cream.
I can't offer my opinion on how well this works because I could only tolerate the smell for two days. When will skin care product companies accept that we don't need fragrances wafting off of our faces?
Don't like it smells. Like old ladies
