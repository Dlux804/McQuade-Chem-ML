These came as an extra with some Olay eye cream. They are very nice and seem to really remove dirt and makeup from your face leaving it soft and clean.
Really liked these when a friend allowed me to try some of her wipes. Decided I needed to order them also!
"I have tried many other makeup removers before stumbling on these. These whips get makeup off with the first use! They are amazing!! The only downfall I have with these is that they leave an oily residue but I get a wet cloth and whip off, no big deal. I would recommend these to everyone. They do not have a smell to them and they are very soft on the skin."
Gentle wipes that remove makeup and dirt without drying skin. Leaves skin feeling soft
Works fantastic! I purchased Publix brand and they dried out fast and I could remove all of my makeup.
"I have problem skin, a lot of products cause irritation to my skin but this was very gentle and it didn't make me break out. I use these to either remove my makeup or excess oil on my face throughout the day. The price point is pretty good and I would definitely reccomend this to a friend."
I used a wipe to clean make up off my face. It worked well. It has a very soft feeling with no harsh smell. After wiping my face all over I could see the make up on the wipe. I then wiped my face with a wet white wash cloth. I only saw a tiny bit of make up on it. That might have been some I had missed with the wipe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great for tegular makeup and is not irritating...however, still need mascara remover so might as well just use one product all over."
"I would be satisfied with these, but I do prefer the yes to cucumbers face wipes better. They feel better on my skin and don't cause the burning feeling on my sensitive skin. But if I couldn't find the yes to cucumber wipes in stock, I would be ok with purchasing these instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I normally do not use wipes to wash my face. I purchased because the local grocery store had them on sale at a very good price. My main complaint is the odor of the wipes. For fragrance-free, they smell terrible! Reminds me of rancid oil. I also thought my face was left with a slight greasy feel. I had to wash my face with my usual soap after using a wipe. I use Olay sensitive skin foaming cleanser, which I like and will continue to use. I would never buy the wipes again!"
"Play is a product I have used for years, and this product was very effective. When I purchase a new product it must be made by a company I trust with ingredients that will not harm my delicate skin.....success [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't usually use make up removing towelettes, but I definitely am going to start. It's just not something I thought of, but I really need it after a long day, especially when it's hot and I get sweaty and my skin feels gross. These are very refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These wipes are a good size. Lots out there are way too big and these are decent for removing eye makeup and not feeling like you have to throw away a bunch of unused areas on cloth. Scent is light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the Olay make up remover cloths I received from pinch me. I love how convenient they are and I really love how well they worked. I even used them on water proof make up and they worked great. I would definitely recommend them [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The material of these wipes are great and so soft. It makes my skin feel very refreshed and clean after using it. I really like the travel sized package because it fits in my purse and allows for a quick freshen up while I am on the go. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pleased with the Olay Makeup Remover Towelettes. I already have a cleansing towelette that does the job, so I'm not sure I would add this to my regimen. It worked great though, and Olay products in general are very good quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is convenient, easy to use, and efficient at removing basic amounts of make up, off of my face. I typically wear smudge proof and water proof make up. So, I had to use additional wipes, to go over the made up areas a few times, before my face was totally clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have extremely sensitive skin, but these wipes did not cause my face to burn or breakout! I will be keeping stocked up on these. They are the best after a really long day when you still need to clear your face, but are extremely tired. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These are so quick & easy to use without sacrificing quality. I recently went on vacation & these were perfect to pack in my luggage since they didn't take up any room in my suitcase & didn't require packing multiple bottle of cleansers or remembering to bring cotton swabs. The best part was at the end of a long day all I had to do was quickly wipe over my face with the towelette and I was ready to get my beauty rest for the next day's adventures. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently got wipes from a high end subscription box that I was really impressed with but was too pricey for me. These wipes matched up at taking off my dark eye makeup and was gentle as well. Superb product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes (or their store-brand version) and absolutely love those! However I was excited to try Olay as I use their Beauty Fluid lotion and really like it. However, I hated these! They didn't do that great at taking my makeup off (had to use two towelettes versus one of my Neutrogena) and they left what felt like a soapy residue on my face. I love some of their other products, but these just didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This would be wonderful to keep in your purse in case you need to take your makeup off and don't have your regular cleanser with you. Perhaps for those that travel a lot and don't want to use soap that can dry out your skin. This is a quick and easy way to make sure your makeup comes off without damaging your skin.

"I loved the Olay wipes. I found that they removed ALL of my makeup easily - and I wear longwearing foundation and waterproof eyeliner & mascara. Typically I have to use a separate eye makeup remover, followed by a wipe, and then a final cleansing. These wipes were able to take off all of my eye makeup as well as my longwearing foundation. I was very impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used these wipes one evening after work. They did a great job at removing my ususal makeup routine. They left my face feeling smooth and clean and I wasn't concerned about leftover makeup residue on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I decided to try this out over the past weekend on vacation, I wear a rather heavy full face of makeup and this got all of it off. Even the waterproof eyeliner!! I think these would be perfect for both light and heavy makeup application. I definitely recommend to try this out! ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Makeup Remover Towelettes are so easy. If you don't feel like washing your face in the basin, or if you're going to bed and a washroom isn't around, they're a great alternative. Gentle on the skin, effective, and light, pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I gave this to my wife and she loved it. She said that it made it easy for nights when she just didn't feel like doing a full routine on taking her makeup off. This was easy and simple for her and she thinks these would be great for vacations! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love these facial wipes. They take my makeup off with just one wipe. They are also very moistened which great, others I have previously tried were too dry. I will definitely be buying these! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am currently using a pump-type facial cleanser that I ordered online. It is sort of pricey and I have been thinking about changing to another brand once my supply runs out. I have always loved the idea of the towelette cleanser but the two I tried previously I did not care for. I really liked this one when I tried it and since I trust the Olay name, I will be looking to purchase it at my store soon to try again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These were really great. They do what they say and take off any makeup on your face. I have really sensitive skin though and it's a little too rough for my face I can't use them and then go out anywhere because they leave my face a little red but thats only because of my skin not a bad thing on their product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I normally use a cleansing cream to remove my makeup each night before I go to bed. I decided to try these Olay Make Up Remover Towelettes and I must say I did not like them. I do not feel that they performed as well as my normal cream remover and felt that I had to apply pressure to enable them to remove the make up from my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! The wipes are convenient and easy to use. I just swipe one over my face at night before bed and done! I like products that are easy to use. I like the smell too....very fresh and clean. The wipes make my face feel clean and refreshed. I like the Olay brand and feel like I am loving my skin when I use this product.

"The towlettes worked relatively well in removing my eye make up (even my mascara), but they had an unpleasant odor that made using them rather unsatisfying. I had to re-wash my face to remove the odor left on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
We went on vacation (camping) and rather then take all my normal face cleaning things for make up remover I just took these. It worked great. They took off all my make up and I didn't need a bunch of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

is is a goodbprodust as for getting make up off your face. It does make your skin softer. But I did break out from it. Maybe from the oil or lotion in it. I would recommend this product to someone who does not break out easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i love olay products and was so excited to try these wipes from them. but when using them the felt dry and when applying to my face the cloth material felt scratchy and uncomfortable making my face red and irritated. also the most disappointing part it barely removed my makeup.

I have found that some of the easy to use facial cleansing towelettes don't perform the same as the regular gels and cleansers but that is not the case with olay makeup remover cleansing towelettes. They work really well removing your makeup and leaving your skin feeling clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Olay makeup remover cleansing towelettes removed the makeup as I expected. They did a great job. It didn't take more than one towelette to remove all of my makeup. It works just as well as others that I have used in the past. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product did a great job of cleaning my face but after cleaning I did need to rinse with another cloth. that's not bad, because rinsing is good after cleaning. But I would like to feel cleansed after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay has created another high quality product with the Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes. They effectively removed all types of makeup while cleansing my skin. There was no burning or irritation created by this product. Also, I was impressed with the experience of using this convenient method of facial cleansing. I would definitely recommend them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love these facial wipes... they are easy to use and convenient and they are the right amount of wetness... Most other wipes I've used are either too dry or sopping wet. These are a happy medium. Love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used L'oreal for years but everyone complained about the perfume smell this has a very mild if not nothing smell which I really like much better and I feel it does a much better job removing makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the Olay makeup wipes as a single wipe is powerful enough to remove any residue of makeup and make my skin feel light and refreshed. I like using these wipes on a daily basis to remove residue of oil and makeup from my skin thus ensuring that my skin feels light and cleaned well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These wipes have a nice texture. They are a little bit bumpy which seems to help them get the makeup off. They don't burn or irritate my skin. I love that they clean and condition my face and I do not have to make a mess in the sink. They also stay moist all the way until you're done with the pack which is a common problem I've had with wipes in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received these makeup remover towels from Olay as a free sample. They were absolutely wonderful! I found that they remove makeup from my face easily and quickly. The wipes are super soft! Other brands that I have tried typically have rough towels to remove makeup, but these were certainly much different and nicer! I really do recommend this product to other people! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I frequently trave overnight and wanted to try the towelettes thinking this product would be more convenient. Although it was convenient the towelettes didn't seem to remove my makeup as well as regular cleanser and washcloth does [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tend to pack light and carry on all my work travel items on the plane. These wipes were great. They cleaned my face and I didn't have to worry about liquid in my carry on. I will continue to get these for my work trips. As home, I think I would stick to my normal liquid cleaner as I feel it is less wasteful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't wear heavy make up but if I don't use a towelette, I get it all over my cloth towel! This Olay product worked very well. I don't need for it to be so large a sheet and there is really no way to save the other half for the next day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Olay make-up remover towelettes took off all of my make-up. It was also hypo-allergenic, that is a must for my skin. I have gotten hives from using other towelettes. It is nice to have other options to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These cleansers work very well at cleaning my makeup off and cleaning my skin. They are a wet formula, versus the dry formula of other wipes, and I like that. They slightly irritate my eyes, however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Also, they actually make my face feel clean when I'm done using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the wipe but not the smell! They remove makeup really well and I like how moisturizing they are but the smell is overpowering. It's a chemical smell that stays on the skin. I really wanted to like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

i liked how it removed my makeup and also made my skin feel after like a clean feeling not a dull like some other cleaners feel sorta dry feelings i dont know how to explin but some always makes my skin feel dry and feel sticky not this one i loved how it made it feel clean and fresh i didnt have to wash my face after if i was in a rush.

I loved using these towelettes to take off my make up.

"I was very excited when i got this product, having never tried a make up remover wipe, but disappointed once i used it. It did a good job of removing my concealer and foundation, but not my eyeliner. Still ended up with raccoon eyes. After scrubbing I gave up and used my regular face wash. If I was packing to travel id buy it. But not for everyday use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Usually by the end of the day, I'm too tired to bother washing my face. I rely on cleansing wipes to take my makeup off, and get my skin clean. These Olay wipes do a really good job of removing makeup, including mascara, without irritating my skin. I think these are some of the best that I've used, and would recommend them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These cleansing wipes left a horrible, nasty, waxy film on my face that broke me out. The next time I used them, I tried to rinse with water afterwards, and it was waterproof and wouldn't come off with just water. I had to scrub it off with a separate cleanser, which completely defeats the purpose of these ""cleansing"" wipes. I threw the package away and I will never purchase these. I dislike Olay as it is, but I didn't realize that they could screw up cleansing wipes too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As I have gotten older, my skin has gotten more sensitive. I have tried several products but many of them cause irritation. The Olay product not only removed every trace of makeup, it left my face feeling soft and clearn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What a pleasant surprise these wipes were! I'm usually not a fan of makeup wipes because they leave a greasy residue and then I end up breaking out. These wipes left nothing but a clean feeling. To top it off, they actually take off makeup. Definitely going to buy these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It doesn't leave your skin feeling clean. After using the wipe, I still feel like I need to wash my face. If you want a good makeup remover that actually works, use coconut oil. It will ""melt"" the makeup right off, then use a normal face wash to cleanse off the melted makeup and coconut oil. I would only use this product if I were in a hurry and don't mind waking up with breakouts because it didn't cleanse properly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay's Makeup Removing Cloths easily removed my makeup but left my skin feeling slightly slick / tacky. After using them for several days, I started breaking out in the way I do when products irritate my skin, so I can't use these any longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Sample received worked really good on removing makeup daily. My daughter got into the makeup one day and was covered in it. The sample was soft and effective enough to take it all off without a struggle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't wear makeup often so this would be an occasional use product. Because of that it is worth the price. It removed all my makeup. I had to scrub a little to get the mascara off. I still felt I needed to wash my face after and use my normal moisturizer although my face felt soft after just using the wipe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The towelettes were very easy to use and convenient. It only takes 1 to remove daily make-up. Not harsh on my skin. Enjoyed using it but I really couldn't tell a tremendous different in these towelettes from the ones I use all the time. Not sure I would change unless they cost less than my current brand or my brand is no longer available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the okay cleansing wipes. I'm already a fan of cleansing wipes because it removes all of my makeup quickly.

"I do not wear make up everyday but but I do wear makeup at least a few times a week. I loved how easy my water proof mascara came off and all of my other makeup came off really easy and the towelettes left my face clean and soft.My face felt less dry, I have very dry skin so my face felt moisturized.I will recommend this product to everyone who wears makeup..

"I like the fact that this is a towelette. It makes it a little bit easier to remove eye make up that is waterproof without having to scrub. I also like that it doesn't sting or burn while I use it. I have tried other products and I would have to scrub to get the waterproof make-up off and when I was done, my face/eyes would hurt from the scrubbing.

"Olay Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes are a great product. They took off all of my makeup with ease, and they also smell nice which is always a plus!

I brought the sample with me to Las Vegas while traveling and it was amazing how clean these wipes made my face. I will definitely switch to this brand over the more expensive wipes I've been using that don't appear to get as much makeup off as Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this brand and the product. I have actually used it before and it's perfect to put by my nightstand on nights when I am too tired to wash my face. I use this to clean off my make up while laying in bed. This is the ultimate lazy girl hack! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was okay with removing my make-up, with the exception of my eye make-up. I don't like having to rub my eye in order to remove eye make-up as that causes wrinkles, and this product was not as good as my current eye make-up remover (Mary Kay eye make-up remover), which does not require me to rub at all. For that reason I would have to use another make-up remover to take off my eye make-up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am a frequent user of the Neutrogena Makeup remover towelettes, this is all I would purchase for years now. But I think that the ingredients in the Olay brand are better or should I say less harsh. The Neutrogena ones make my eyes burn and this one didn't do it as much as my regular brand does. Again, still a little burning but definitely a better option than the Neutrogena brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"These ROCK! I had used a baby oil to remove my mascara, and a regular facial cleaner to clean the rest of my face afterward. These are SO worth purchasing! I cleaned my makeup off in seconds.

"I normally buy facial towelettes from the discount store, off-brand and dry quickly. However after trying these towels I believe I will buy them from now on. Aside from the great smel, I truly felt cleaner and they did not dry out immediately, letting my get my whole face and pay attention to problem areas. I would definitely recommend to others.

"Olay Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes are soft on my skin, removes makeup/mascara and doesn't cause my skin to break out. I use Olay moisturizer too, so this was a natural pick for me.

"I've been trying makeup remover cleansing wipes so the timing of receiving this sample was perfect. I was able to try it on half my face and use another brand on the other half. Both did the job but I think the Olay brand towlettes removed my non-waterproof mascara with fewer wipes, less time and also the ingredients did not bother my sensitive skin. Some other brands irritate me so much my eyes water and I have to rinse afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really loved these Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes. They didn't feel harsh against my skin and did not irritate after use. I cleans the skin very good and removes all the make up and residue. love it and will definitely purchase in future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay cleansing cloths were very good. I thought the cloths removed my make-up thoroughly but I could feel a slight tingling when applied to my face. I'm not sure if this is natural or not. I will try again. Olay is a very good brand with a very high reputation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a good facial cleaning product. I thought it compared to my current facial cleaning products. It did the job about the same and compares in price and quality. I would buy it depending on price and availability at my store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked these wipes. They got all of the makeup off my face without me having to rub my face raw. Some people have compared these makeup wipes to baby wipes, but they are not created equal. With a baby wipe I have to rub my eye areas to get the makeup off, not with these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"That being said, I wear makeup about 1/2 of the time. Since I can't wear it at work, I look for products that cleanly and gently remove all traces. These towelettes worked well and are incredibly convienent. Something I will purchase to carry with me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed using this product.It seems to clean very well even using heavy eye makeup.I did not sense any residue left on my face after using the towelettes. I found that it had a nice clean scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I've gotten older, my skin has become more sensitive. I still like to wear makeup, but worry about what I'm doing to my skin when I remove the makeup. I love the gentleness and effectiveness of these makeup remover cloths. They took off my makeup and left my face feeling soft and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pretty disappointed with these face wipes. While they removed my face makeup well, they were very rough on my skin. The wipes were also drier than I was expecting. It did not remove my eye makeup. I use waterproof mascara and eyeliner and it was barely removed with these wipes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love that this takes my makeup off fast and you can even wash your face with them.i loveee that I can use them for more then just removing makeup.they have a gentle smell thats not overpowering which I love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm always looking for a good make-up remover towelette and I found a great one with Olay! I've been using Olay products for years but this was my first try at their towelettes. I love them! My skin is left clean and silky feeling. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not a fan of make-up removing towels, and these reminded me why. I find it hard not to get the solution in my eyes when removing eye make-up, so this has never been my preferred method. Perhaps if you like to use towelettes to remove make-up, you would like these. They did not leave my skin irritated, and I have very sensitive skin, so that was about the only plus for me. I wouldn't deter others from trying though, just based on my experience! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using make up remover in a liquid form from a high end company. The ease of the Olay wipes was incredible! They smell great and did a great job without a greasy residue like I get from the liquid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the convenience of this product and how it easily removed my makeup. By the time I go to bed I'm really tired and just pulling the wipe out of the pack and running it over my face makes me less likely to skip washing off my make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
is very good. i used on my face to clean my makeup and cleaned my face without rubbing too hard on my face. in the morning i double checked and yes face was very clean and not harmed during cleaning.. thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The one thing that keeps me away from cleansing cloths, is that the packaging doesnt always stay sticky enough to stay closed, but the packaging here was great! I had no problems with that at all. I decided to try these on my daughters faces to help teach them how to wash their face, and they were perfect! Took off all of the dirt and grime, and were gentle enough for their sensitve, younger skin. i will be buying these for them soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wear a full face of makeup every single day so at the end of the day it is important for me to really get a good cleaning of my face to remove all of the products that have been clogging my pores all day. I also wear a lot of waterproof makeup and this worked well in my eye area as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I look for two things in a makeup remover wipe:1) removes eye makeup well without having to pull at my face and scrub. 2) doesn't sting my eyes. If my eyes sting that's a bad sign, I want to keep my eyesight. This product met both requirements better than the rest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Having tried other facial wipes to clean my make up from the end of the day, I can say this product is trustworthy! It has a clean feeling to it, without drying out my skin. Even an hour after using it, I still feel the lotion and smooth texture working. Thank you for letting me try this, I will buy it and use it as part of my routine of taking care of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love these Olay facial towellettes! They are so convenient! They are thick too so I can scrub away without worrying about them tearing halfway through my face washing. I love putting them in my gym bag so that I don't have to worry about needing water. They are also great when we are traveling or camping for the same reason. I will continue to purchase these!

I loved the Olay Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes i recieved from pinchme. It works really well. It removed my liquid eyeliner very well without making much of a mess on my face.

"This product not only removes make up, it removes the dirt, and moisturizes the skin. Other beauty wips have left my skin feeling dry, immediately reaching for my moisturizer. I was not able to find my moisturizer the other day, and had to wait a while, shocked to feel how soft my skin was even hours after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am only using this product as an eye makeup remover as I don't feel like my face is clean enough without using soap and water and I have sensitive, acne prone skin. That being said, it does a decent job at removing my waterproof eye makeup, but not as well as my eye makeup remover. It is definitely more convenient than eye makeup remover, though.

"This product was so super simple to use and it really removes the makeup. I like how convenient it is and it did not leave my face feeling oily like some makeup removers.

"I've used a slew of different facial cleansing towelettes and these were by far the best I've tried.

And it actually removed all of my makeup too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like this as a makeup remover; it definitely got all of my makeup off.

I was also surprised at how many of my friends and co-workers are already using these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love this Brad and I wish I could give it 5 stars but unfortunately as hard as I tried I could not remove the last of my mascara and eyeliner.

This did a great job of cleaning my skin. I used this to take off makeup and also on what I thought was already clean skin. It took my makeup pretty good.
