This AM lotion would work perfectly for any morning routine. I put this on every morning and allow it to soak in for just a few minutes (2-3) before applying any makeup. This product blends well into the skin and does not leave a white appearance from the sunscreen.
"This feels pretty rich when applying on the skin but actually reduced the amount of oil on skin, which is normally pretty oily. Contains a sunscreen so it's a little difficult to apply. But don't be discouraged."
"I am mid seventies and continually look for decent moisturizer. My dermatologist recommends these products. O finally purchased am facial moisturizing lotion. To my amazement, this has done more than moisturize my skin. It has reduced pores sizes by leaps and bounds. Also, I put under my makeup and it gives a dewy look. Some of my wrinkles are beginning to diminish. I know this sounds over the top, but I cannot say enough good about this lotion. Normally, I don't write reviews, but this is worth the time."
"I've used this product for a few months already. It's an amazing deal in that it contains some excellent, and pricy ingredients for anti-aging and healthy skin for a very small price. You cannot beat it at any price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Won't clog your pores and it contains sunblock.
"I don't usually do reviews but this product is the worst. I have used many sunscreens and I have never had sunscreen turn clumpy/flakey on my face. I have to get a tissue and wipe it off cause it's A LOT. I always wash my face, add a toner and moisturize before adding sunscreen. Whoever is reading this, please save your money and buy a better sunscreen. Trust me."
I wanted to love this product (since I love Cerave other products) but this was a waste of money. This product pills on my skin whereas other sun care products do not pill (I'm using the same regimen of products when I use Cerave AM Facial Moisturizng Lotion vs. my other sun care products.
"I had this same moisturizer, but the nighttime version and i absolutely loved it. when i put this on my skin it looks and feels exactly like sunscreen and is so hard to rub in. i feel like i'm doing more damage dragging my fingers across my face just trying to get the product into my skin! also, i can only use this right after cleansing and toning. if there's any other cream on your face and you put this on top then it starts clumping up"
"I just started buying CeraVe products because I heard and read good reviews. My first purchase were both the AM and PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion. While I love the PM, I was so disappointed with the AM version with SPF 30. It leaves countless white beads all over my face. Reading the reviews, I see that I am not the only one experiencing it. So, I bought the ultralight version, and it does work well. It does not leave white beads as I rub it on my face."
The product feels good on the skin not too grease. When I first use it the white part wasn't blending with the rest and I thought it was because it was new. But after using it for a week it still does it. Like many have said. You are basically mixing it on your face.
I have incredibly sensitive skin I'm allergic to what feels like everything skin care wise. This is the only sunscreen I've found that doesn't make my face itch and it rubs in really nicely. Please never change this Moisturizer!!!
"I was expecting good results after reading the product details, however this product is only ok. It definitely doesn't release moisture throughout the day as suggested. My skin is dry again after about 30 minutes of application. I like that it as a spf which is why I rated ok and not bad, but for all you who wear make-up this lotion leaves a white film on your face so you will need to wait about 10 minutes before applying your make-up."
"I so wanted to love this product, unfortunately that is not the case. It pills on my face no matter how many different ways I apply. It does not work well at all under make up. I don't recommend this product and it makes me sad."
"I just used this every day for a week in sunny Spain and for the first time ever finished a vacation without a sunburn. That alone is reason to celebrate. It gets a little thick feeling on my face by the end of the day, which is why I knocked off a star. I suppose that's just a reminder to wash my face at night! However I'll continue using it happily because the benefits far outweigh the minor inconvenience!"
"Male here with neutral skin. I use this every morning right after showering, leaving my face feeling moisturized and non-greasy. Never had problems with white flakes/residue or breakouts. I tried several other moisturizers that either made my skin become super greasy throughout the day or cause breakouts. Lots of other reviews say that exact opposite to my experience. It appears you just have to find something that works for you -- glad I found mine."
I bought the daily moisturizing sunscreen hoping to use a cheaper alternative to what I usually buy. I absolutely LOVE the cerave body cream so I had high hopes for this product.
It feels very thick to me and it caused me to break out in tiny bumps all over my face. I'm very disappointed that I spent the money on this product. I'll be going back to my tried and true.
"I have very sensitive skin. It didn't cause acne after several days usage or leave a noticeable white cast, which is great, but it also completely failed to offer any sun protection. I thought maybe I wasn't applying it often enough, but even when applying more frequently than directed it did not work. Sadly the search continues - this product does not work for sun protection - do not use it. Look elsewhere."
I was very disappointed with this product and wish I had looked up reviews before I bought it. I also bought several other CeraVe products and thought they should all work well together. This product leaves a thick white reside and pills leaving a mess on my face
"Love this moisturizer, because it has sunscreen that my husband will use every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Dries quickly preventing a good smooth application. In order to apply smoothly, I wipe down face with Micellar water on a facial pad before application. And, mine arrived with a defective pump so I have to open the bottle each time I want to use it, very inconvenient. I have been using the PM product for quite a while and love it. A little disappointed in the AM."
I got this after a recommendation and I do like the amount of spf but I have a hard time getting it to sink into my skin. If I don't rub it to the point of my face turning red it will rub off my face while I put on make up.
I have rosacea and always break out with sunscreen. This is the first product that didn't break me out. I use it even with my foundation daily and it gives me a smooth finish. Love it!!!
"I've tried lots of facial creams and sunblocks over the years, both from department stores like Macy's and retailers like Walmart. Cera Ve products are absolutely the best for both moisturizing skin and providing adequate sun protection (with zinc and titanium dioxide, which are required for the best protection), and they are affordable. The daytime facial lotion is creamy and smooth and is made for sensitive skin (without fragrance). I highly recommend it to anyone with fair skin who needs to protect against sun damage."
"I love Cerave products. I have rosacea and it's great to be able to get quality products at a reasonable price with ingredients to help repair the skin barrier but minus irritating ingredients like fragrance. I wanted to love your AM moisturizer with sunscreen, but it pills up badly. Trying to put any foundation over top is a losing battle. I was really sorry I couldn't make this product work for me."
"I love CeraVe just not this one. It""s like wearing sunscreen. It doesn't blend well and is very oily. When I was on vacation, I bought the Ultra Light. That was great. When I got home, the store didn't have Ultra Light so, I bought this one. Bad choice. I wish that I could bring it back. buy the Ultra Light."
"I just bought this lotion yesterday hoping that it would help my dry skin in addition to the sun protection but I was really disappointed. When I put it on, it didn't absorb easily and left a white cast on my face. It didn't matter if I rubbed it in, patted, or put it on freshly cleaned skin; it would still pill."
This product has helped my skin improve greatly. I have suffered with dry skin and sun spots for a long time and have noticed a great change in my skin. My sun spots are at a minimal and barely noticeable. Accompanied with my Doctor's recommedations and prescribed medications my skin is back where I want it to be.
"I have the original moisturizing lotion for face and body and love it but wanted to add spf into my routine. This facial lotion made my skin dry and peel. It didn't work for my skin at all. No matter how much, or how little, I put on, it would get flaky and peel."
"I've been using this lotion for about a week and have noticed such an improvement in my skin, which is great because I've been having a hard time with my complexion lately. I'm happy to finally find something that is working and helping to clear it up. So much so, that I will switch the rest of my skin care products to ceraVe"
"Cerave was recommended to me by my dermatologist, I purchased it and now it is my go-to moisturizer. It goes on very light and once you allow it to penetrate it is invisible. I have used more expensive products and they are no better. I have recommended this product to my friends & family- thank you Cerave!"
"I do not recommend this. It leaves white residue on my skin and it is very greasy/oily. I don't have very sensitive skin, but it gave me a rash on my face where I was exposed to sun after washing it off. It is somewhat moisturizing, so it isn't completely bad."
This is a moisturizer and sunscreen supposedly but it does not moisturize at all. I do not like this product as much as I thought I would. It will be facial sunscreen once I run out of my Neutrogena sunscreen. Does not do what it says it will. I'm disappointed.
"I've purchased this several times. It does pill, but there's a bit of a technique to putting in on and it can be minimized. Also, I wear it on days (which is most days) that I don't wear make up. A nice finish, not dry, not shiny. Call me weird but I also love the unscented 'scent' of this product. Will continue to repurchase."
"I bought this about 4-5 months ago and have been using it daily. The finish is decent, not overly oily or slick like other moisturizing sunscreens I've tried."
"My main criticism is that it leaves behind little white flecks, almost as if parts of the bottle dried up? If this wasn't the case I'd like this product a lot more."
I just don't understand why the ON-Line ingredients show 3.5% Zinc and my bottle shows 6.3% Zinc. Maybe that is why this sits on my face like toothpaste. I just can't get the white haze to go away even when using small amounts. I'm a man and it makes me look like I'm wearing makeup! I have tried competing mid-range facial moisturizing products with the same SPF and not had this problem.
"Great stuff. Dermatologist recommended m, but was already using! Price has gone up some, but found coupon on line. Also, Target runs specials"
This is my favorite face moisturizer and sun screen. It goes on well and has the necessary UV protection. Good price and speedy shipping from JET!
"Tried this and so far I don't see any visible difference. It feels a little sticky on my face, too. Will probably not buy it again."
It's a mild cleanser but cleans effectively without drying and is soy free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this moisturizer so far. It doesn't feel greasy and also dries clear. CeraVe is amazing for people with eczema or rosacea prone skin, and I have both. I do layer more sunscreen on top of it, but this is a wonderful product."
This product is too thick for an a.m. moisturizer. I applied it to clean skin and it didn't spread well and has left a heavy feeling on my skin like it didn't quite absorb all the way. I would not recommend this product to a friend.
"Like another review, I also wanted to like this product. It does not absorb into my face and rubs off no matter how little I use. I have tried adding water which helps initially but later it still balls up and comes off."
This is the BEST DAY CREAM I have ever used...and I have tried many products...from HIGH END to DRUGSTORE brands. It goes on sheer and protects all day. I give it 6 STARS...not 5!!!
"CeraVe products are wonderful. This moisturizer creates moisture without being oily, protects your skin from harmful sun rays and blends well with your makeup. CeraVe is a name you can trust. Try it!"
Did not like this at all. It was too thick and did not spread easily. It felt very greasy and really never absorbed. I prefer to use a different brand sunscreen over the Daily Moisturizing Lotion instead.
"I've been using it for several years now. It doesn't cause breakouts and it is effective. It absorbs well, but if your skin is damp then you have to massage it in for a wee bit longer. Not a negative in my mind. It's a great product. I recommend CeraVe to my friends because I'm so impressed. I wish retail stores wouldn't mark it up so much."
"Since I'm such a big fan of CeraVe cleansers, I decided to give their moisturizer a try. I have oily skin. I've only had it for about 2 months and I want to love it, but I just can't. I put on serums in my skincare regimen and when I put the moisturizer on top of that, it instantly starts peeling like it doesn't want to absorb into my skin...even if I don't do a serum that day it'll still peel."
Great product. Repeat customer.
"I have used it before, then stop. I am glad I came back to it. It moisturize as well as protect from the sun."
This is creamy without being too thick or sticky. My doctor recommended this over Cetaphil because of the additional ceramides and of course the SPF
"I'm a male in my early 60's. This has been my go to morning mositurizer for over a decade, and my face looks at least 10 years younger."
"Love CeraVe face wash, AM and PM moisturizer. I've been using for years."
"CeraVe works as a great moisturizer, not greasy and spf 30 protection. I've used it for years."
I have sensitive dryer skin in winter. I tried this and it goes on too dry. Only feels like sunscreen. I'll save for the summer.
Hate this. All it does is pill all over my face even when I wait ten mins after applying other creams. Does NOT WORK. Not moisturizing at all.
i have sensitive skin and I have not had any breakouts. I use this bran everyday and I trust this brand.
"Easy to apply, not too thick, and it has an SPF of 30. Living in southern Arizona so I need the sun protection"
"I bought this product two month ago and it makes my combination skin, which is prone to breakouts, smooth, healthy-looking, and with a nice glow. I love these products; they really work for me."
The biggest problem I have with this moisturizer is that it balls up and pills when you try to rub it in. This makes it difficult to re-apply during the day as well as you're supposed to.
"I have acne prone oily skin. This moisturizing lotion with spf balanced everything. I didn't breakout, my skin is moisturized but not too oily, and I'm protected from the sun!"
CeRaVe has been my go to moisturizer ever since my dermatologist recommended it. I use it daily and let it absorb before applying face products. I am a super senior and have great skin and like to think that this products helps keep it that way.
"Smells more like sunscreen than I was expecting. Plus, the hyaluronic acid in it makes it a little tacky for about 30 mins after application. BUT so far it's doing an amazing job. Skin feels so soft later in the day"
Only facial sunscreen that works for me. Pills but I don't wear makeup so not much of an issue
Tends to flake a lot more than high end sunscreens.
"I really liked this product because it had SPF, so I used it everyday for about three weeks. I don't wear face makeup often, and would apply this post-shower. Around week four I noticed that my face was drying out around my chin, nose, and eye brows. I stopped using it for about two week and this cleared up. Every time I try to go back to using it regularly the same thing happens. I have combination skin, so it would clear up the oily spots, but that went straight to dry spots."
I love it. Clearing up my face
"Just ok, I have been using the AM/PM and Facial Scrub and it's nothing great."
This is really good stuff - not greasy and absorbs quickly.
"I love this moisturizer! This is just the right size to pack and take along during trips! The moisturizer is light and creamy, not greasy!"
I'm sure it's doing what it's supposed to but I don't like the feel. It's kind of sticky and pasty. Not a good base for foundation.
I have been using this product for a year and Its the best moisturiser in the world! It makes my skin glowy
"Love the night cream, but the day cream with spf is not moisturizing enough. Makeup doesn't go on smoothly with this product. Product doesn't have a strong perfumey smell so I am keeping it as a hand moisturizer."
Flakes off if I apply this before my usual BB cream. This does not happen when I use any other moisturizer with sunscreen (Aveeno with SPF). Quite disappointing as I like all other CeraVe products. I wish I kept the receipt- I paid full price for it
"This moisturizer did a decent job as far as keeping my skin hydrated, but there's room for improvement. You need a lot of it to feel like you covered your face well so it runs out quickly. It's sticky and doesn't sink in nicely unless you use a very generous amount, but be careful because it will start to pill. I switched to the Cetaphil spf 15 daily moisturizer, and am already much happier. If you like the way that this product moisturizes, but don't like the weird consistency, give the Cetaphil a try."
"I think this product is good, I haven't gotten sunburned since using it. But it only works well on days when I shave. If I have any stubble, it doesn't blend into my skin and looks really obvious. On those days, I use a different sunscreen. I'll still use the bottle I have, but I may not buy it again."
"I love this product, I have been using this for years, It just doesn't do it's job moisturizing my face but it also doesn't break the bank. I used to buy those expensive moisturizers and it does the same job. I also use the pm and it works great too."
This is my third bottle of CeraVe AM face moisturizer. I particularly like the SPF 30 sunscreen as it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. It also acts like a primer for my foundation while providing moisture for my skin.
This moisturizer keeps my face hydrated and doesn't leave a white cast on my tan skin. It isn't oily or too thick. You can wear the moisturizer under makeup. I hope in the future Cerave will make this moisturizer with a higher SPF.
"I cannot express enough how much I absolutely love this product. I used high end skin care products for many years and never got the results I have from CeraVe, now I won't use anything else. Thank you for this amazing product!!"
"This is the only facial spf that I have found that doesnt break me out, wears well under makeup, and actually keeps my dry acne prone skin moisturized all day! Thanks cerave!"
I love this moisturizer! Its a little pricey for moisturizer but a lot goes a long way. Its not too moisturizing but its just enough.
"I like this daytime moisturizer. It is a little hard to rub in, but it isn't greasy and my face hasn't been burned at all this past summer."
A good sunscreen -- and I do wear a hat. Perfect for the face -- especially since it does not sting the eyes.
Most sunscreens irritate my skin and break me out but I've been using this for months and it's been amazing.
Does exactly what it says it does!!!! What I don't like is how your writing colors are so light I can barely see them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dermatologist recommended and I love it
I love the cerave line products. It gives my skin the moisture needed after I applied the product. It works for me
This is too expensive. I purchased it as i heard its good for skin in but my skin is feeling too try after applying it.
To me this product smells like sunscreen and has that heavy sunscreen feel to it as opposed to a face or even body moisturizer.
It has the highest spf that my face tolerates. My skin stays smooth and non greasy.
Good stuff!
