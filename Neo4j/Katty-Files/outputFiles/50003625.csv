"I have very sensitive skin and finding a moisturizer is a challenge. Almost very products I used to cause adult acne. ""Yes to Coconut"" all natural ingredients not only moistures quickly, my skin started to look healthier and younger almost immediately! No more breakouts.! And it smells heavenly. My husband finds it romatic."
"Along with using coconut oil as makeup remover, this moisturizer completely rid my skin of acne!! Okay, so not 100%, because that's just a health issue, but my skin hasn't been as clear as it is now in 10 years! So happy to have found this, makes me want to try more & more products."
"So to start, I have dry super sensitive skin. I've tried a few products people recommended but they either made my face look like I got a chemical burn, or totally dried it out. I was on the verge of giving up when I decided to try this on a whim. The natural ingredients is what made me want to try and IM SO GLAD I DID! I've been using it (with other say yes products) and my face has never been more moist! Thanks for saving my skin!"
"My great friend reccomened this product to me. She had me use it while staying at her place and it's warmed up my life! It smells AMAZING! I can always count on it for a deep moisture, using it most at night. I can't see myself without this in my beauty routine. I love it & most importantly for me, it has great ingredients"
when I open the container it's almost nothing inside
"This is a really great moisturizer, but unfortunately the strong scent makes it a deal-breaker for me. I am sensitive to fragrance, and although it is not a bad smell it is just SO strong and does not dissipate in a short amount of time. It really lingers. I don't understand why companies have to add fragrance to products made for the face when it's not necessary."
"I would like to say upfront that I have sensitive skin. I use coconut oil regularly on my skin and it helps moisturize and calm. That being said, this particular moisturizer did not work well work with my skin. Within minutes of putting it on, my face became hot and red (like I had a horrible sunburn). I washed it off immediately but my skin is still red and experiencing discomfort a day later. I'm glad that this works for some people, but I'm really disappointed with the degree to which it irritated my skin."
"Amazing product!!! first time user and I'm in love with the benefits and how effective it is. I have oily t-zone and super dry skin everywhere else. This product does wonders and is so silky, soft and not greasy like others. Used it after applying the Yes to Coconut Cream Cleanser. It smells amazing and I recommend it! :)"
"My home has forced hot-water heating, and in the winter my skin, especially my face, gets very dry and feels ""tight."" My previous moisturizer worked well for a couple of hours, but the Yes to Coconut Ultra Hydrating Facial Souflle Moisturizer keeps my face feeling smooth and hydrated all day and all night - I've been using it before bed, too. When used during the day, it doesn't feel greasy at all, and my makeup glides right over it. I think I've found a new favorite!"
Moisturizer is very hydrating to my skin....it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.
I love the moisture! My face looks younger...
I will keep buying this product.
"Smells delicious, lightweight easily absorbed affordable!"
