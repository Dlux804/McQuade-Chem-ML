The cream is very smooth. A little goes a long way. Very safe for babies and scores outstanding with EWG. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried every face cream available. None took away bags under my eyes but THIS did the trick. I am 51 and people say I look like 40 since I started using this.
I love this cream for my kids! I like that it's thick and that there's no scent!
