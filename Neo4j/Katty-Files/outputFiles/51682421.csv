I was started on this face cream when I was 19 yrs. old by my girlfriend who was 32. I used it for many years and then changed to a more expensive cream. Since I am living on a much lower income I went back to the cream I knew worked and found it at a great price and it still works just as good as it did when I first used it. I do have excellent skin and have to give all the credit to the cream I used for so many years. This cream is wonderful and you don't need the more expensive creams to have great skin!
"something is better than nothing. I was in COSMETICS for years; mineral oil, parafen, alcohol in the first line of ingredients NOT good for skin. I too in my 20's used this product on my feet, knees, elbows and hands. Mineral oil not your friend when it comes to pores alcohol very drying. Something Is Better Than Nothing."
