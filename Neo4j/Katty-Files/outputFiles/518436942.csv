"Since I have very sensitive skin, I am careful about the products that I use on my skin. This is a wonderful product since it addresses many of my skin concerns. I live in Las Vegas so my skin gets dried out under the relentless sun. In addition, I have fair skin so I worry about getting sunburns and sun damage. This is a great product because I did not have any negative reactions after applying it on and I was able to apply makeup over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is wonderful. Feels great on the skin not greasy at all, it moisturized my skin great, not sticky feeling like a lot of SPF products, all in all I am very impressed and pleased with this product. Also there is not much of a smell or fragrance which is wonderful with face products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is great for those days when little to no makeup is wanted - beach and run around town days. It has a light, fresh feel that moisturizers beautifully and gives a soft base for just blush and mascara. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Lightweight and absorbs quickly. It worked well under make-up and kept my face moisturized without feeling greasy. The scent was pleasant, though I usually prefer fragrance free products. I would definitely use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the first moisturizer that I have tried with hyaluronic acid and I am very pleased what it has done for my face in a very short time. It provides a lot of moisture and helps to remove or hide the less youthful skin cells. Thank you OLAY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This oil of Olay advanced makes my skin feel amazing! Within one week I saw a difference in the brightness in my skin. I received several compliments and co-workers asking me ""what are you using on your skin?"""
My skin also feels tighter!
Highly recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really appreciate how lightweight, non-pore clogging it is-I typically feel wrapped in 'Saran Wrap' while wearing moisturizers in the summer, the fact that it has a dash of SPF (15) is a bonus-thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer went on smoothly and absorbed quickly. While applying my foundation over it, I noticed it seemed to glide on more easily than before. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy at all. The pretty scent made it even more enjoyable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed having the opportunity to try the new Olay product. I have often wonder if a product that contain hyaluronic acid would flood my extremely dry face with dewy moisture. I love the fact that the moisturizer has anti-aging qualities. I have very hard to please dry skin and it gently moisturized and softened my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It works well, sinks in fast just like the original, makes my skin soft and glowing and contains SPF. All wonderful elements for a day-time lotion. But the scent of the SPF is rather strong. I would prefer it if it was not so strong like the sensitive skin formula the original SPF lotion has. Other than that, I would highly recommend.

"This went on smoothly and did not feel sticky or heavy on the skin. Foundation went on easily and did not get greasy during the day. Most lotions with SPF included start to feel greasy throughout the day. The scent is slight, but I would prefer unscented. If Olay can increase the SPF but still remain light that would be great. Only negative is that there is no pump on the bottle. Because I use this twice daily it lacks the convenience of a pump I am looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Olay products but please stop putting sunscreen and fragrance in your products. I have rosacea and scents and chemical sunscreens are not good for me. I would of given this 5 stars if it didn't have these 2 products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It smells so fresh, not overpowering. I've been using Oil of Olay since I was 17 years old. Over the years I've tried different brands but I always go back to your brand. People tell me that I have beautiful skin, and I tell them that I use Oil of Olay. They like the way it smells too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product is amazing, it seems like I felt a wonderful difference in my skin almost immediately. I love this product, just like the all my other super products from Olay. Only skin care products I use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These should always go together, and I love your products! I've been using them ever since my mother introduced them to me as a teenager and I love the light feel on my skin. You've been keeping me looking young for years, thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very good moisturizer- very hydrating without being greasy; light texture that absorbs very quickly; great value (3.4 oz for less than $15!); pleasant scent without being perfumy. I have sensitive skin, and this moisturizer didn't cause any problems. Where Olay could improve this product is increasing the SPF to at least 30 and putting a flip top cap on it instead of a screw on cap. Other than that, it's a great product.

"I loved that this product had hyaluronic acid and aloe added. I always use a sunscreen with and SPF and this is something that I would purchase. I initially received a ""sample"" from Olay but was thrilled to receive a full size product. Olay really knows how to take care of their customers.

It is great to have the convenience of a moisturizer and sunscreen together. It smells great so I don't have the worry of putting on sunscreen that smells funny and now can be protected all the time. The only thing I would improve is putting a flip up cap on top so you don't have to take the cap off all the time to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love it! Light weight and moisturizing without looking greasy or shiny. Foundation goes on great and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. SPF 30 would be great as well with exact same ingredients. Thank you Olay!
