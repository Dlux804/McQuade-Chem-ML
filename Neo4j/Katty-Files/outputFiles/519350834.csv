"Smooth, pleasant smell- great texture, blends well. Saw results in the first few days around the more thin eye skin!! Perfect to layer CC creme over; makeup then goes on flawless. My skin tends to be on the ""sensitive"" side & Cicacream has been a godsend for my face, especially living in this humid climate, dealing with sweat and cold temps at night. It maintains the sensitive pH balance of your individual skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about two weeks now, and I really enjoy it. It's thick, which is great since I travel a lot, and am constantly in dry climates. It's got a nice thickness to it, but doesn't feel too heavy. I can't speak to the anti-aging yet, but so far, I'm really enjoying this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary sample of L'Oreal's CicaCream from Influenster. This product is amazing! My skin feels smoother and softer and I've only been using it for a week now.

I received this complementary as part of a contest, these are all my personal opinion and thoughts on the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for a couple of weeks, while I can't say it has fully got rid of wrinkles or lines, it has plumped my skin, and diminished them.

I recieved this product complementary from influencer and I really like it. I've been using it about a week and a half. I've noticed my skin seems to be more hydrated. I can't say I've been using it long enough to see a dramatic result with the wrinkles but my skin feels good.

I have Korean brand Cica creams. So I was excited to compare them with L'Oreal Cica cream. I'd say it's an excellent version of Cica cream yet a little thinner than Korean Brand ones. I love the packaging and price point for the size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've been using this Revitalift Cicacream from L'Oréal for 1 week now and loves I see a huge difference in my face. With the cold weather is always good to hydrate your skin! I love to try new products and this one hasn't been the exception! I can wait for the upcoming weeks to see even more results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had never heard of Centella Asiatica but am always up for trying anything new to wage a war against wrinkles and dryness. It's too early to tell if it's making a difference on fine lines as I've only been using it for a week but it absorbs easily, smells good, hydrates the skin (even in Winter) and allows for smooth makeup application which means you can skip the primer. Excellent value for money."

I received this product from Influenster and decided to give it ago. First impression was it made my face feel revitalized and soooooo smooth.

"I planned to use this product for a month to test it out. It used to burn when I would apply it on my face, especially after exfoliating. Still, I kept trying it as it instructs on the tube itself. After 3 weeks, I noticed, it had started to make my skin feel extremely tight, dry, and flakey. I finally stopped using it and am now on a mission to rehydrate my skin. Definitely would not recommend this for dry skin types."

I received this item complimentary for testing purposes. I like that there is a use of different ingredients. The cream is a little thicker/heavier than I prefer. It's good during the winter. It may not be my favorite to use during warmer weather though. The packaging is easy to use. I have sensitive skin and had no problems using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using LOREAL - Cicacream Face Moisturizer Pro-Retinol & Centella Asiatica 2 weeks ago. My fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes seem to be lessening I am very happy to have come across this product! I do wish it was fragrance-free but the fact that I look younger without makeup makes up for that. I was lucky enough to have received this product complimentary for testing and will buy it for myself in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have noticed an improvement in the expression lines. I do not give it five stars because I would like it to be more moisturizing.
Awesome product...I used this in conjunction with the triple action serum...my skin looks so amazing...will not be without this product...btw I also use the eye cream with cica. That too is amazing!!!

I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. After using a few times I quickly realized this was not for me. I have naturally oily skin and it always has a “shine”. This product seemed to make it worst for me. Luckily I did not experience breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't like this product. It didn't help my fine lines.All it did was make my face super greasy. I couldn't put on makeup after applying it because my face was so slippery the makeup would barely blend and looked awful. I received this product from Influenster to test for free but these opinions are my own. I love Loreal haircare products, i just didn't like this product.

Definitely going to stay in my morning evening routine. **I received L'OREAL'S Revitalift Cicacream complimentary from @Loreal and @Influenster for my honest and unbiased review.** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I would have loved to have seen the benefits of this product, as I'm very passionate about skin care products. But I cannot get past the smell, it reminded me a lot of Nair hair remover. Unfortunately I wont be using it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary from Influenster to try out solely for my opinion. Packaging was nice. It went on smooth and didn't feel oily. Was gentle on my skin but the smell turned me off of the product maybe others could deal with it better than me but I will not use this product again. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for about 4 weeks after receiving it as a sample from Influenster. I honestly did not see any difference on my skin. My main concerns are the expression lines under my eyes and around my mouth. My lines around those concerning areas did not soften at all. The only pro I found from this product is that it didn't break me out and acted great as a primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this cream in a VoxBox courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes. Unfortunately there wasn't anything I liked about it. It was too thick & heavy for my liking and it did not absorb into my skin and left my already oily skin feeling greasy long after applying. And I didn't notice any improvements to the fine lines and texture of my skin. It's probably better suited for someone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this in a Voxbox last month and am so happy that it was brought into my life! It's so amazing my skin has felt smoother, more moisturized and all around better since I've used it nightly. Highly recommend it does not leave your skin feeling oily or sticky at all and has a nice smell!"
I got my L'Oréal cicacream face moisturizer pro retinol & centella asiática from Influenster as a full size free sample to give my honest opinion and I must say it's amazing you feel a slight tingling sensation so you know it's working but what I love most is that it doesn't dry out your face or make it oily I use it under my makeup everyday and my face thanks me for it I have my glow back. I'm very satisfied with this cream it's now part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this through Influenster... it's not and, but I didn't really see results. I felt like my skin got a little drier. I am only 30 and don't have any wrinkles, so that could be why I didn't see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this from Influenster for free to try and I do like it. I've noticed that I've gotten some slight wrinkles between the eyes from stress and I believe this product has helped smooth those out after about a months use. It's creamy and does tend to take a while to absorb but no awful smell and feels good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as part of a Influenster Voxbox which is why I tried this. I don't buy this type of cream usually because my skin is usually too oily for it. these types of creams are usually greasy, but this one is just right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample from Influenster and I definitely liked it at first, but as I continued using it I noticed it wasn't doing anything for me. The formula is a little too thick for my liking. It definitely smells good and the packaging is nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I reveived this product for review from PINCHme as a complimentary item. It is amazing, lightweight once it's on your face, but substatial enough in its formulation that it feels rich and smooth going on. I use an acne medication and this works amazingly to help regenerate that top layer that begins sloughing during treatment. Already purchased another tube! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to @influenster I got to try this product out for FREE! I'm glad I did. I have dry skin, so by the end of the day, my face feels dull and flaky. Since using this cream, not only does my face feel hydrated, but my makeup is staying on longer, and my skin feels smoother as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is one of the most hydrating and cooling I've ever used! I have been using it for about a month now and I can say that it is really a quality product. Its non-greasy formula is truly moisturizing and I would definitely recommend it for dry -combo skin like mine. The only down size is that I is not cruelty free. Price is decent also, especially for the amount of product you receive."
I received this product for free for testing and review purposes. These are my honest opinions.
This is my first time using a CICA cream and I'm in love! I love it that it is think and very moisturizing so it works perfectly as a night cream for me. I received it thanks to Influenster for testing purposes and I'm definitely buying it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary a few weeks ago and have been using it twice a day since I've received the product. And honestly I have seen no changes in my skin. It doesn't look brighter, or seem to have less wrinkles, and my pore size is the same. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this a few weeks ago, and I gave it some time before I decided I needed to review this! I have noticed a huge difference in my forehead (my problem area) since I started using this! I've used tons of different products before, and never wanted to have to spend the money to replace them. With this price point and how well the product works, I'll definitely keep this in my routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not crazy about the fragrance of this product. It goes on the face fine, but I wasn't blown away. I am pretty picky about my skincare and I like to see really high quality ingredients high up on the list. This one isn't going to make the cut for my personal skincare routine. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like and use L'Oreal Paris, and I have to try this for sure when it came out. So, I've only been using this for a couple of weeks, so the results aren't that extreme for me. The texture is perfect it's not too greasy and not too heavy, it is just perfect and remarkably moisturizing. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review from Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this gem complimentary from influencer to review! I have sensitive skin and using this was not a problem! It helped moisturizes my skin along with making it look brighter and wrinkle improvement! Perfect for my wedding coming up! After using it a lot I did need to take a break because it started giving me some acne. Overall I would buy this product and recommend it to friends and family! #circacream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this product because it moisturizes my skin amazingly. And It isn't to thick or oily so it works really well with my makeup. It doesn't have an overpowering smell which is a plus.I haven't really seen much of a difference with fine line but maybe I need to use it a little while longer. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is exactly the type of product you need to fight signs of aging! It firms and hydrates your skin and leaves you feeling young and radiant! The fact that it is allergy tested really made me happy because my skin is so sensitive. I had no reaction at all and felt really good about it! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary to review by influenster, and let me tell you; I absolutely love it! It made my face feel nice and moisturized before bed, and in the mornings as well for my foundation. I would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this as a sample free from Influenster, but I would continue using this once my tube is empty! I am notorious for buying a new moisturizer and then using it randomly and then ending up tossing it out. This cream, however, I put on every day like clockwork -- I love the smell, texture, the non-greasy feel, and the moisturizing power it has. It soaks right in and doesn't leave any odd film or residue and it has helped my skin balance out where it's dry. Great cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent this product to try from Influenster and was super excited to use it. I like how thick the cream is and how it makes the skin feel. It smells nice and not too fragrant. I have been using it morning and night. I have not noticed any changes in my fine lines but I might need to apply it more consistently. Maybe using the other products in the line would help idk. I don't know if I like it enough to buy though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received Cicacream Face Moisturizer complimentary via Influenster. I am always weary of trying new products on my face but noticed my chest was starting to get wrinkly, so I applied it there instead of my face. Overall, felt like within a couple days of use I noticed a difference. Probably wouldn't buy it again, but glad to have been able to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the product complimentary to test for a review. This product is spectacular. My skin feels so soft after applying this. I can tell a difference when I forgot to put it on. The weather is not always consistent, but this product is. I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this a month ago and my asking has never looked or felt so smooth in my life.
It didn't leave my hands of face feeling / looking greasy and it can be worn under my makeup . I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this cream complimentary and I have to say, I love it! It has a nice scent where you can tell it's working but not too strong, since smells tend to bother me. I waited a few weeks to write this review to ensure I could get the full effect, and I have noticed an improvement of my skin. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Throughout this horrible, never ending winter, I've been using products containing Tiger Grass to combat my dry, late twenties skin. Though I prefer a Korean Skincare brand over this L'Oréal Revitalift Cica cream, it is a great option offered at almost 1/4 the price of my daily go-to. Cica cream is a life changer...NO JOKE. This product specifically is super moisturizing and works great as a primer. I received this product for free from Influenster to test out and honestly review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary to test. I don't have any complaints about the product. I don't have wrinkles, and honestly have a really nice complexion already so I didn't notice much of a difference in my skin. I'm sure it does what it's supposed to do for those who need it. It's not thick, which is nice and it does have a light scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was given the product courtesy of Loreal and Influenster. This cream is phenomenal and has equivalent quality and results of creams with prices more than double or even quadruple the cost. I found it to be deeolu hydrating leaving my skin smooth and toned without leaving behind any greasy or heavy residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't really love the texture of this moisturizer. It was creamy but not in a. Easily absorbing way. I also have large pores so I'm always a little nervous with a moisture cream feels like it may be heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really wanted to try this product! So I was thrilled when I received it in an influenster box to review. This cream has honestlyrics worked so well for me. I could tell a difference in my under eye creasing after only two days of use. It's amazing and I recommend you give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I receive this product via Influesnter. Overall the presentation is good, goood size, no smell, soft texture and retail price is great. I haven´t noticed yet the reduce of fine lines but the moisturizes, leaves your skin soft and not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprised when the cream was as light as it was. I have very sensitive skin, so I typically have a hard time finding wrinkle-fighting products that can accommodate it. I currently only use it at night, but you could definitely use it both day and night for even better results! I received this product complementary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this to try for free and I was pleaseny surprised. It is a thick cream but I can rub it in with no issues. It's extremely moisturizing and my face fet like a baby booty! So far not a huge difference with my wrinkles but I have only used it for about two weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Cicacream Face Moisturizer with #CentellaAsiatica is superb! I have used it several times under my eyes and it has not created an allergic reaction in me, which has happened with other face creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream for about a month now underneath my makeup and I love it! My skin has been very dry lately and it has brought my skin back to life! My makeup applies better, and since I have combination skin, it doesn't make me break out. Definitely in my current skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Got this a month ago, compliments of Influenster and I was definitely skeptical of the claims it made at first...but after using for a month, I can honestly say I am so happy I gave it a shot. My skin is clearer and more radiant, and my makeup has been applying like a charm! Thanks Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this free through Influenster and have been using it consistently every evening for 4 weeks. It's a thick cream but absorbs nicely and doesn't leave a sticky feeling or a lot of residue. Makes my skin feel really soft and gives it's a plumped up effect, have noticed a reduction in fine lines on my forehead since I started using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this through Influenster and really enjoyed it! It made my skin look and feel great, without any of that great film a lot of creams can leave. It was a fantastic base under my makeup and really made my skin feel firmer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from influenster vox box. I love the smell of this product. After using my makeup goes on smooth, I also apply at night as well. I like the ingredients and I see improvement to my skin barrier [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer has a pleasant smell, aborbs quickly, and feels nice. I didn't see any improvement with my skin, but it didn't make my skin any worse. It may work better for dryer skin than mine! This was a complimentary product provided to me for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has made my skin feel great from the first day I tried it! I received it free from Influenster to try and review. I have been using at night after I wash and exfoliate my face. I Have oily skin but it does not make it any oilier. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who really wants to take care of their skin
"I received this as a free sample in exchange for a review as part of the Influenster voxbox program. This feels great going on but for someone who has uneven skin, it does make some areas more oily than I prefer. Definitely recommend for anyone who has dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a free sample in exchange for an honest review from Influenster. I have added this to nightly skincare regimen and and honestly haven't noticed any differences in my skin. I have found that the product does apply somewhat oily which I do not particularly care for. It's ok but I'm not i n love with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a free sample in exchange for a review from Influenster. I have added this to nightly skincare regimen and when I wake up my skin looks so refreshed! Goes on smoothly and absorbs I'm incredibly quickly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I only gave this product a 4 out of 5 because although I liked it I can't say I saw much “improvement” in my skin. But I also didn't have much to improve on at this time. I did like how it glided onto my skin, it felt like more of a primer and my makeup sat nicely on my face for the day. With that said I never felt the need to use it at nice I preferred to use it in the morning for the above reasons. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this new cream! It leaves my skin smooth and not greasy as others have done in the past. The size of the tube is also great for packing, it doesn't take up much room! I received this product free for testing from @influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Moisturizer was the answer to my prayers. It helped after a few days of use to smooth away fine lines and I noticed I wasn't breaking out as much. I'm not that old but I felt that my skin was as young as a teenager with Cicacream Face Moisturizer. I received this free for an honest review, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I had to stop using it when we started trying to have a baby (retinol.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in an Influenster voxbox and I am glad I have it in my rotation. My skin is noticeably more moisturized after only two weeks. I make sure to take it down to my neck since its anti aging and that's where women can show their age. I let the product sink in for a bit before putting on makeup and the smoother surface it creates makes a great canvas for a flawless finish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product for free in my Influenster voxbox and it was wonderful! The texture is nice and it feels nice on the skin. Unfortunately I have sensitive skin so I found this to not be as hydrating as I had hoped with my regular moisturizer. If you have normal skin though I think you'd love this product. It doesn't have a strong smell and it made my skin soft.
I received this product free from Influenster. I was skeptical because L'Oréal products usually cause my face to break out. I have dry sensitive skin. I'm 43 and moist and fine lines are my focus. This is a great product. I had no allergic reaction and it hydrated my face very well. I have been using it for around a month twice a day. I still have about a quarter of a tube left. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved your presentation and packaging in the form of pipe which makes it more hygienic and durable. The new presence of centella asiatica helps regenerate the skin. Especially in my case that I am assiduous to makeup. In the mornings before my makeup makes radiant fairway and in the evening comforting my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free compliments of Influenster to review! I love this moisturizer! It's smooth and weightless but provides great moisture! I've noticed my skin has a more even tone, feels refreshed and less breakouts. I don't have much as far as wrinkles go but being 30, I do like to use anti-aging products as a precautionary measure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product to try free from influenster Voxbox. I love this product. First face moisturizer- wrinkle cream that is non greasy. You skin soaks it right up!

This was sent to me to try for free (opinions are my own) and I love it. Soft and smooth skin! I read something about it helping your makeup go on better and was skeptical but....it actually does. I still use primer but I've had issues with foundation applying correctly prior. Overall I great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the Revitalift CicaCream as a complimentary gift from Influenster for review purposes. I been only using it for about two weeks and I already notice that it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, the smell is amazing, and it helped lift my skin. The most thing I loved the most is that it left my skin feeling hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this moisturizer as a sample to try out. It smells really good but it's thick. my skin didn't feel as hydrated as I would've liked for it to be but it might be because of the other products that I use before applying the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free for testing purposes from Influenster and while the cream feels nice, smells nice & definitely hydrates and smoothes, I HATE that it's not cruelty free. I realize this is a personal preference and if this cream WAS cruelty free I would likely repurchase, but because L'Oreal tests on animals, I will not be repurchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product from Influencer and am so happy that they chose me. My skin stays so dry during the summer no matter how much I moisturize, drink water, and exfoliate. This formula did not make my face greasy and my skin looks so supple. DEFINITELY recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was able to try the Cica Revitalift cream for FREE thanks to Influenster. To my surprise the Cica cream actually works. There are so many creams out there claiming to help lift and revitalize your skin, but this one actually worked. Its a light cream, not heavy and suffocating. Within about 2 weeks I noticed the difference. My skin is glowing, and definetly firmer. I will be adding this to my daily skin regimen and am excited to try the other skin products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It took me a couple of tries to enjoy this cream. I have oily skin and suffer from breakouts often. I notice it does sink into the skin (instead of just sitting on top of it). So far, no breakouts! I like that it has retinol in it (a proven anti-aging ingredient). I received this tube complimentary and will be purchasing it after my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free to try and give my opinion.

"I have received this moisturizer to test on the part of influenster, I have tried it for two days in a row and I have seen a bit of the results, when I place it I feel a little warm my skin, then it passes, it is applied easily, it has no smell which is nice, although neither skin is fat I have felt the hydration and a fresher skin, and it has dollar protection although it does not indicate how much, I would like to know, I will continue using it to see more results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't noticed a difference in my skin, but it seems like a decent product. It's smooth and does not have a scent so that's good. I received this complimentary from influenster for review purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved it. I'm super particular about my skin care so of course I was skeptical about trying something new. I am pleased to say my skin loves this! My skin is extra glowy when I use this product. Since relocating temporarily my skin has been all crazy and this really helped it. It's not greasy, it smells, good and it works. What more can you ask for? I received this product complimentary for testing, but I will be buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Over all I love this product. I have to switch moisturizers occasionally because my skin gets oily and that's my only complaint. I like how soft it made my skin and that I was able to put makeup on and not have that “caked” feeling. I also like the light/no scent. And the anti aging part is awesome as my 3 kids have really started to age me! Would definitely by again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this cream for free in return for a honest review. I have no major faults with the cream I just have seen better results with other creams. It's very nice for the price but I'd rather spend a little more and get more too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face felt hydrated after using and soaked into the skin nicely. My makeup applied smoothly and it didn't make my face feel oily. It's a decent size bottle and you don't have to use a lot of product so it will last you a long time! this was sent to me complimentary for review testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Such a thick and soothing cream. I swear it's making all the difference in my post partum days. I've had so many compliments and it has to be because of this moisturizer. I love that the scent is light too. I can't stand overly perfumed stuff [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved the Loreal Cicacream complimentary from Influenster,I wanted to use it for three weeks and then review it, the first week my skin looked more or less the same, by the end of the second week my face was not any different, by the third week I had all but lousy interest:( sorry din nt make too much of a difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this Free through #Influenster about 4 weeks ago and I really like it. I haven't used it long enough to see dramatic results but I've noticed my skin looks alot smoother and nourished.

I've been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can definitely tell the difference in how moisturized my face is. I've been using it on my forehead a lot since that's where I've been getting fine lines. I have seen an improvement. I will keep using it, I hope to see improved results soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from Influenster for my honest opinion. I loved this cream, it goes in smooth and left my skin hydrated and line free.

I would recommend this product to anyone no matter their skin type [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review via Influenster. With consistent use I've noticed a dramatic change in my skin tone. Makeup is also easier to apply and goes on smoothly since using cicacream. I would recommend this product to friends looking for an antiwrinkle cream!

Received this complimentary from for testing purposes and what a great product. Both my mother and I have tested this and it's a great moisturizer and helps make up go on smoother and for my mother it's approved the appearance of her wrinkles and under eye bags. Will buy more for her to use in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this cream as a sample from Influenster and after 2 weeks of daily use I can honestly say it's amazing! My skin is fuller, brighter and feels so soft.

I got this product free to test and I must say I am impressed! I love how light it is and the scent but especially how smooth my skin is. It makes my makeup go on much better and I feel like there is a notable difference in my
"Skin barrier. I do wish I could see more tightness after the month I've been using it, but the other benefits make this product worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using this new cream for a while I can definitely say it was even more amazing than I expected. I had high hopes but they were exceeded. This cream is doing great things for my skin barrier. It's great morning and evening for my sometimes finicky combo skin. Good ingredients and things are just looking better and better as time goes on. Would definitely recommend.

"I have had this product for about a month now and I have to say I really like the idea of it. Unfortunately, my skin is way too sensitive to use a product like this. It is not the products fault. I have too many allergies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"You cannot beat the price of this anti-aging cream. I have fairly sensitive skin and it didn't irritate mine at all. I definitely see some difference in the fine lines I have. This is such a great product I would totally expect to pay more for it, however, I received this free for testing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this cream in the morning right after I wash my face and again in the evening before bed. It's thick, but light on my face. A little definitely goes a long way.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this free and for review purposes from Influenster. I really loved this product because it moisturizes the skin with just the first application.

I received this as a free product. I just passed the age of 30 and I'm just starting to see the different signs of aging. Especially on my skin and face. From first application I felt the difference. My skin started to look younger and more hydrated. I would completely recommend to anyone trying to fight the first signs of aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is very effective, my skin felt alot more moisturized, supple, and firm the first week I used it. I love that it doesn't have a strong smell. The only downside, in my opinion, is how thick the cream is. It's kind of hard to apply it without tugging or pressing, however, the cream doesn't clog my pores and the packaging makes sense for the thick consistency of the cream. I received this product complimentary for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this about 2 weeks ago from Influenster's and I've been using it every morning and every night before bed ! ITS AMAZING! Before my skin was so dry and flaky and now it's been like Viola ! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the L'Oréal cica cream complementary from Influenster to try. I am all about skin care right now, so I was super excited.

"Loreals #CicaCream has left my skin feeling smooth and silky. Before using this product I faced issues with extremely dry, scratchy skin and I couldn't stand it anymore.

I received this product complimentary for review purposes. #CicaCream #influenster #reviewer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its not often that I come across a cream that is light like this one, while also being super moisturizing. I liked that it gives a full blast of moisture without just sitting on top of the skin, it actually sinks in. I also like the scent, it's very faint and not too overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this from #influenster to try out and I am happy with the results. It goes on smooth and doesn't feel heavy. My make up goes on evenly on top of it. It smells nice and I feel like it does a good job making my skin look a little more youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like and trust loreal, so I was happy to try this product. I'm not sure that it will work as far as ant-wrikling, as I have some deep lines. But, I will continue using it and see what happens! I do think that this is a great moisturizer- does not clog my pores; feels good on my skin; and the smell is not overpowering. Note: I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a promotional item to try in exchange for my review, all opinions are my own. I love this product! It is thick and creamy but doesn't clog my pores (which clog easily).

I'm definitely hooked and I'll be buying this again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have really dry skin and it really accentuates my fine lines on my face I haven't been able to find anything that really helps long term. I got asked to try this in a voxbox and I absolutely love it!

I received this product complimentary for review purposes.

I've been using this for almost 3 weeks now. It goes on smooth and non-greasy which is great for people who have combo/oily skin. My skin felt a lot softer after a few uses and works great under foundation. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary from @influenster about 2 weeks ago and so far I am loving it. My skin feels fresh and hydrated.

I've been using the Cicacream face moisturizer for the last week and I'm really liking it! It's a thick consistency but feels light on your face.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm 27 so I don't have a ton of wrinkles but I do have one on my neck and my skin has been inflamed lately from cold weather. I introduced this into my skincare a week ago and my neck wrinkle and skin texture already look a little better. The only complaint I have is that it is a little heavy and I have oily skin, but an easy fix is to only use it at night instead of AM and PM [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This moisturizer feels almost exactly like the super expensive anti-aging moisturizers from Arbonne! It feels really smooth going on and absorbs quickly. It is creamy and moisturizing and my primers go on top of it very easily. I waited until I used this product for a full week before writing my review, and my skin has definitely improved! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have used a few times and have noticed a remarkable difference in my skin texture. I was concerned that putting this on before putting any moisturizer or makeup would be too much layering, but you can't even feel it except for the soft skin. Can't wait to keep using and see how it works on my fine lines. (I received this product complimentary for testing). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i received this in my Influenster VoxBox and have switched my skin care routine for the better! The texture of the cream is thick enough to feel like it's moisturizing, but light enough that it penetrates through the skin. I have been using the Cicacream day and night for a week and my skin feels soft and supple. The first day wearing it I definitely could feel my skin tightening when I applied it. The price point is just right for a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I'm hopeful that in a few days I'll start to see a difference with lines. I received this product for complimentary testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream works wonders ! For me I'm not into heavy creams but this one was far from that ! I wore it alone or with makeup and it performed flawless ! I couldn't say more amazing things about it !

I will most definitely be throwing this into my regular routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My skin definitely looks better and feels amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product last week. My skin lately has been driving me crazy! It's been way too dry and all my make up as ending up flakey and cakey! Since I've started using this product my skin has been coming back to life it's more moisturized and the visimple fine lines are so visable anymore. I am starting to become more confident in my skin!

"I recieved this product for free through Influenster to test at home. I like the way the cream smells, the texture of the cream and the lightness of the cream. I have only used the cream for about a week in the morning and before bed. It seems to making my skin around my eyes and in my throat area smoother. I look forward to continuing using the product and see if the product really revived my skin."
"I use moisturizer daily, so I was very excited for the opportunity to try this as a complimentary gift from Influenster. First of all, the fact that it doesn't have a scent is a huge plus for me because I am super sensitive to strong/different smells. I have to be very careful about the products that I use and I have been using this daily for 2 weeks. It hasn't given me any skin issues, in fact, I really like it and I would buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using for three weeks and seeing my skin get a bit more supple and soft! My smile lines and forehead wrinkles have diminished a bit and less prominent. Dries to a nice matte.

I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this high quality cream for FREE for testing purposes. Thanks Influenster! Let me tell you guys I used to use another face cream (Ponds) and that stuff is ok but this is WAAAAY BETTER.

NO DYES, NO COLORANT, NO ALCOHOL.. which is excellent for my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I need to apply to for a few weeks to see its results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this since the first day i got it. P put it on right after my serum before my day cream and when i tell you the difference is so clear it's amazing. The product is not greasy because i have really oily skin so it is absorbs instantly and doesn't leave me shiny. It does have a light scent to it like flowers kind of but it does the job. I received this product complimentary for testing.
"I recently brought this with me on a weekend getaway. While we were out in the cold, our faces got quite chapped and wind burned, and my sons (7 & 11) looked to me for relief. I offered them some of my cream, and they LOVED IT and have even asked for it since. And I agree, not only is my skin feeling smooth, it's not left with a greasy feeling that I have from most moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product in a VoxBox, and I am impressed. I've used L'Oréal skincare in the past, and it hasn't really worked for me, but this product has been real so far. It's thick and moisturizing but not greasy and absorbs into the skin nicely. My only complaint is the smell."

"Received this cream a few weeks ago in my Vox box to try complimentary- I am already noticing a difference in my skin. It is less red, the texture feels smoother..it just looks healthy.

"I received this product free from Influenster. Althlough, I was a bit skeptical because I have sensitive skin, I am pleased with my results thus far. I've only been using this product for about a week, and I don't have wrinkles so I cannot attest to those features. However, I can say that I like this product as a moisturizer. It has kept my face hydrated for hours without making my face look shiny at the end of the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"#cicacream I loved it. The cream has a soft texture and a very delicate natural aroma. From the first application you feel a lifting effect on the face with immediate hydration. My skin is delicate, and with certain products I feel irritation, but when applying #cicacream it was very refreshing. I can not wait to see the final result since in 4 weeks it promises to attenuate wrinkles and add more luminosity to the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the promises given about this products, but as a nursing mother I'm not comfortable using and it. I'm afraid that the retinol isn't safe for me to use when nursing, since everything we put pin our skin goes into the blood stream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oreal products. I'm obsessed with their revitalift line. I was excited to try this new cicacream. It makes my skin feel soft, hydrated and renewed.

I received this product for free through Influenster to try out. I am starting my 30's and I definitely am learning to take care of my skin better. I was excited to receive this product due to the claims. I will tell you that it definitely has made a difference in my skin texture and fine lines. I have a smoother appearance overall. Minus one star because it leaves me a little more oily at the end of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What a great product! Although this moisturizer has retinol, it did not irritate my skin at all or leave it feeling sensitive. My skin feels deeply moisturized but not greasy at all. It does not leave a sheen that a lot of moisturizers tend to do on me. My skin feels softer and looks smoother. Since I have been using it for only a week or so, I have not seen a noticeable difference in my wrinkles or firmness yet but I am hoping that I will soon!

I don't know what the Cica in Loreal's Cicacream is but it works. This product smooths my dry skin and doesn't irritate it. It goes on after washing and before daily/night moisturizer. I like the smell too - clean not floral. I have started to put it on my dry patchy elbows and knees to - just to try it. I did recieve this product to try for free.

I have been using Cica Cream for a few days now and I love it! Cica cream leaves my dry skin feeling smooth and radiant. Does not feel thick or heavy. It does not interfere with my makeup routine. I feel it works as a primer and makes my foundation look dewy without looking greasy. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I will continue using it.

I received this product a week ago and really wanted to test it out before reviewing... I absolutely LOVE it! My face feels so much smoother and softer... not strongly scented... not heavy... very moisturizing... not oily... works great under foundations... convient squeeze bottle... OVERALL A GREAT PRODUCT
This cream is really lightweight and leaves my skin feeling smooth. Works well under make up as it doesn't leave your skin looking or feeling oily. This is especially important for me living in FL. I received this product complimentary via Influenster but I am going to purchase another tube once this runs out as most creams make my skin oily and shiny.

"I received this complementary through Influenster. I love the tiger grass component. There's also no alcohol (I won't use facial cream with alcohol because it dries your skin). Overall, I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this two days ago, I suffer from dry skin particularly in my t-zone and mouth area. This moisturizer is a heavy enough to keep my face moisturized all day. Usually I have to put moisturizer on my face twice in the morning and at least once throughout the day due to peeling. My skin also feels firmer. I strongly recommend this product. They give you a good amount of moisturizer for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the Revitalift for a couple days now and can't get over how smooth and soft my skin feels. I can't wait to see the results after using it for 2 weeks!

I received this product from Influenster free for an honest review. I have been loving this product! The cream is very lightweight and has almost no smell.

I just started using Cicacream and I am very pleased with how moisturizing it is. This winter has been tough on my skin and I do notice s difference in my skin texture since applying his under my moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i love this cicacream! One thing i love about it is how it comes in a tube rather than a jar so its easy to bring along when traveling and i don't have to worry about it breaking in my luggage! The light scent is wonderful and isn't too strong, and its super light where it don't feel like its weighing down my face which i LOVE!! For being a drugstore product i have to say it really is great and the price isn't bad either which is a bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from Influenster. I'm on my 3rd day of using this and already I have received compliments on how nice my skin looks.

"My skin feels great after just 2 uses, and my makeup goes on quite a bit smoother than before. I love that it doesn't have added fragrance.. It has a very mild and slight grassy scent. Very nice. I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love my sample I receive #voxbox I've been using it for about 3 days morning and night and so far it feels amazing. I have the most sensitive skin and I have yet to have a reaction. Time will tell if it does the job but so far I love it. No smell which is good for my skin and feels so good, not greasy at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given this complimentary of @Influenster to review, and give my honest opinion on. I haven't been using it for very long, but at this point I can say it's a great moisturizer. I can't lay claim to what's it's suppose to do just yet. But so far I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oréal Revitalift Cica cream my skin is softer ,smoother and firmer.My skin feel healthier and hydrated. I like that is fragrance free, paraban free and colorant dye free. Also my fine line are less visible. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I saw this on Dr Oz. The results were unbelievable so I ran out to CVS and bought some. In just 24 hours after two applications, my fine lines are way less visible. I woke up this morning with a fresh new face. Even my husband noticed the improvement. For the price, this stuff is amazing. I am only using this one product and not the entire line either. Today I will be applying with my jade roller in hopes that this works even better. I'm really impressed."
"I started using this about 3 weeks ago and my skin hasn't looked this good in years! I love that this cream is light weight and is fragrance free because I have very sensitive skin. My skin looks clearer, more radiant and firmer too. I will definitely be repurchasing the Cicacream again. I've tried a lot of face creams, even really expensive ones, and I think this is the best :)"
This is a fabulous cream that I'm so excited I got to try. It's not oily and I really feel like my skin is starting to look less wrinkled after one tube. I would definitely buy this again and recommend to friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm 41and have been using this cream the last month, mostly in the evenings, but some days in addition to my normal skin care routine. This cream is gentle and really hydrating. I was impressed with this cream the most of any middle priced name brand cream so far. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a very nice packaging, it smells pretty good, and it glides well on the skin. I used it for two weeks, and it kept my skin soft. I only used it at nighttime, so I am not sure how it would be throughout the day with makeup. I did not see much difference from using the product on my fine lines, although I am giving this product another week to compare with pictures."

I received this cream free in my Loreal voxbox to test in exchange for my honest review. It was a good cream and made my face feel smooth. I feel that it worked pretty good on my fine lines but I love how soft my face feels now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product to review compliments of voxbox and L'Oréal. I have been using it now for almost a month. I do feel like it's made a difference in the fine lines that started to appear after age 30 hit. I like that there is no smell and it hasn't broken out my sensitive skin which is always a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product in my Influenster box to sample and honestly didn't expect much. I have had a large milia bump under my eye for months now and nothing would make it go away. After less than a week of using this cream the bump disappeared; and now after approximately a month of using the cream I can see a visible difference in the crepiness under my eyes. Will definitely keep using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I wanted to love this product but it feel short for me. I didn't notice any difference in my skin after about 3 weeks use. I did like the feeling of it on my skin and it did seem to help my makeup be smoother but then left me shiny later in the day. I would be willing to try another product from this line, I just wouldn't recommend This exact one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At the end of your review, mention that you received this product complimentary for testing, didnt expect much but this really smoothed my face and gave it an energy boost.

I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my review. I was excited to try it because I have some fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes and lips.

"I absolutely loved this product! I noticed a difference in fine lines on my face, and also loved how it mouisturized my face. Also, this really is a great value for the product, and you get a lot! I received this product complimentary for testing through influenster, but I will be buying it and including it in my skin care regime. Thanks Influenster & L'Oreal!

Thanks to Influenster I was sent this Cica Cream from L'ORÉAL PARIS for free. It is an anti wrinkle and skin barrier repair! I have tried it a couple times and I like it. The formula is a little too thick for my liking but it feels great on my skin! I've been hearing more and more about Tiger Grass so I'm excited to see the benefits on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this to review for free from Influenster. I gave it a shot for awhile but didn't notice a difference in my skin. I have a very strict skincare routine of high end items that I use so this would've been nice to find a cheaper option, but it didn't make the cut sadly. It's nice that it's not heavily fragranced, and it feels nice. Not greasy or too heavy. It just doesn't do enough for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary tube of the Cicacream and I'm so glad I did! I'm a redhead with pretty fair skin, which can be a little sensitive at times, but it has been LOVING the Cicacream. I apply it every night before bed and love that it leaves my skin looking and feeling refreshed. I definitely think it's helped a little with any fine lines and I look forward to seeing even more results as I continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this cream — the application is easy and smooth. It didn't irritate my skin or cause me to break out, so I used it morning and night. I can't say that I noticed significant wrinkle reduction, but I can't say it didn't do anything at all either...I'm just not sure from the time period i've used it. I DO know that it felt nice on and I plan to continue using it to see what kind of long term anti aging benefits it can offer!"

"I received this product from Influenster and was really excited to try it. After about a week of use, I noticed my skin looked much dryer than usual. I had kept the rest of my skincare routine the same so I was disappointed. That being said, the weather was in the single digits so the cold may have been a factor also. Once the weather gets a bit warmer, I'm going to retry the cream to know for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product in exchange for a review from Influenster. The cream smells fantastic and goes on really well. I found it moisturized my skin perfectly and did not need to use a ton of product. I didn't really notice if it improved any lines or not, but maybe I need to give it more time than was allotted for testing. Otherwise, this is a great lotion and worth using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for testing purposes. I used it for 4 weeks and my honest review...it's ok. I didn't see much change in my skin. I also felt like it left kind if a filmy residue. Maybe I was using too much product. It smells nice but I think it's just a little too heavy for me. I do use other L'Oréal skin care items and like them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product to to test from Influenster. Seems to be a nice face cream, I used daily to see if the ad holds true. Unfortunately I did not see any change in my skin appearance but really did seem to moisturize well during these cold Chicago winter months without being greasy/oily. Seems to absorb quite nicely, but really, that's about it. All in all, a nice product but I didn't see any significant changes to speak of. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this free for testing purposes. While I liked the product, I did not notice a great difference in fine lines. This product also worked more as a base for my skin, in the winter and cold, I needed additional moisturizer to protect my skin. Overall, I would recommend it is worth a try, especially if your 'fine lines' aren't too many or too carried away yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed this cream as a simple moistuizer but i do not think that it's anything special. I did not see many anti-agings benefits or brighter skin, but it did do a good job at making my skin feel hydrated and a bit plumper (in a good way!). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I actually really like this moisturizer! It has become part of my daily routine and taken the place of a department store line that I was using previously. I received this product complimentary for testing, and I'm so glad I did. I don't think I would have stopped using what I was using had I not! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how my fine lines are so much harder to see. I really love L'Oréal Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle. I will buy more. I received a free one for testing and I will be using more of this. Worked great in my opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I actually use Loreal skin care products quite a bit so I had high hopes for this product. It felt great going on and upon immediate application, skin looked great . It seemed to work like a primer. That part was great , however long term results seemed to be minimal I am sad to report . I received this product complimentary for review purposes."

I received this product for free to test from Influenster. My initial reaction was that the cream was thick and felt very luxurious. I have very oily skin and this product did not do well on it. It was much too heavy for my already oily skin. I powered through using anyway to get a full “test” but did not notice any other benefits (fine line reduction). Overall the product is an “OK” moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I have tried quite a few products from the RevitaLift line and they never disappoint. I did enjoy the Cica cream and it did diminish the appearance of some of my fine lines. I just found the cream a little heavy for Florida weather! It was perfect for the cold snap we had and kept my face supple and moisturized! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After 4 weeks of use, my skin overall looks smoother and brighter - like I've had rest, It feels matte on the skin, it doesn't leave my skin oleosa yet it's still hydrating. I haven't noticed a difference in my sun spots at all, and a difference in FIRMING my skin UP, it has smoothed out some wrinkled lines. All in all, If you don't have dramatic loss of elasticity or sagging in your skin, I'd say this would be a great product to add to your regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a thick and creamy moisturizer that has very little scent. It absorbs very quickly and doesn't leave residue. My skin does feel more hydrated and does look better compared to before. I can't tell how much anti-aging benefit there is yet but my skin does feel more supple and youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this cream for over a month now & have noticed a significant difference in my skin. This doesn't irritate my combo/oily skin that also is battling the beginning signs of aging. I notice a big difference in the crepe / fine lines under maybe eyes especially. I received this item complimentary for review purposes, but will continue to purchase this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try the Cicacream face Moisturizer. It smells great and my skin just loved it. Was not greasy and the smell was amazing. After using it for a few weeks, i notice my skin was a bit firmer. You have to use it as directed to get results. I received this complimentary from Influenster to try out solely for my opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary moisturizer from Influenster to try out and give my opinion on. I can't say I've noticed any differences in my fine lines on my face after using it for a month. My skin is quite sensitive and I did not like how it felt on my face. I know some products work for some people but this didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this for free from Influenster to try and review. I didn't use every night and every morning like it said because I'm lazy with skin care. I did use it each time I put on my makeup. It smells so good. Clean and fresh. It is a lightweight moisturizer that dries fast. I would recommend it to anyone as it would be good for dry skin or normal to oily. I love it and will definitely be purchasing more in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. It is a nice thick moisturizer, but doesn't leave my skin greasy.

"I really enjoying having the opportunity to try this face moisturizer. The texture of the cream is really smooth, and it absorbs relatively quickly. I didn't see any major differences in my skin, but it maintained my current skin progress. I would recommend as a nice alternative to expensive department store retinol creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a month now and love it. It is light enough to not interfere with other products or my makeup routine but is incredibly moisturizing. My skin feels and looks firmer and fine lines around my eyes have been reduced. It's also helped even out my skin texture. I have very dry, sensitive skin and really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this face moisturizer for over a month in the harsh cold and dryness of the Midwest. I have been really pleased with how soft and smooth my skin has felt.

"I was kind of afraid this moisturizer would break me out because of the strong scent but it surprisingly did not! It has a pleasant scent but for sensitive users, that can be kind of scary. It did the job moisturizing my skin well for overnight without making my face overly greasy .. I would use this again! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.

"I received this product from Influenster to test for free. It's a great product overall, and has left my skin feeling better, but I am still waiting to see amazing results. My skin looks slightly firmer and more vibrant, and I feel with a few more weeks of use, I will see more of a change! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the second time for me testing Loreal skin care products, this brand never let user down. The Rivitalift Cicacream does the hydration work my skin face needs, it feel soft at the very first use and some of my stains had started to disappear; besides that the smell is so soft, although it claims being fragrance free. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
#Influenster sent me this over a month ago to try and I love it. I enjoyed using it and looked forward to my nightly skincare. I noticed my skin was plumped and hydrated after use and my fine lines appeared less noticeable. Make sure you use sunscreen when using this cream as retinol can cause your skin to be extra sensitive to the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for almost a month now, and so far I am loving the results! I get really dry skin in the winter, and this hydrates, and I haven't had any dry skin issues at all.

"I received this as a sample over a month ago and was astonished by the changes I saw with my skin. I have combination skin and was happy to find this product was not oily or greasy and has a lovely clean fragrance. My skin feels tighter and my fine lines are not as visible prior to use. Similar products have caused my skin to break out, but I have not with this cream. I am in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster. Overall, it was okay, but I wasn't impressed. It was a little heavy for my skin, but had a nice smell (smelled high end). After continued use, I did not see any drastic changes in my skin that would make me repurchase, but I will say I gravitate towards gel moisturizers and ones with hyaluronic acid.

"I've been using for about a month and love it! It's super moisturizing, and is heavy enough to wear to bed as a night cream, and light weight enough to wear as a day cream and makes a great base under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary several weeks ago and I have been enjoying it a lot. I have oily skin so I was worried that the thick creamy texture would make me greasy, but it does not at all. At first I only used at night, but once I realized it wasn't going to break me out or make me greasy, I started applying morning and night. My skin feels hydrated and firm.

"I received this product in an Influenster box. I felt the product was a little thick for my liking, however I typically use gel or hydro/water type products.

"I was given Cicacream through Influenster to try. From the firs use, it made my skin feel soft and hydrated. It refined the texture, making my fine lines and pores seem less visible.

Didn't notice any difference in my skin at all. Maybe I didn't use it long enough but after 4 weeks it would be nice to have seen SOMETHING!

This is a good moisturizer. My skin doesn't feel thirsty when I have it on and it sets into the skin nice. I feel like my skin is a bit more radiant when I use it. I don't know if it lives up to the claims but I have gotten compliments that my skin looks nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Have been using this cream as my nighttime moisturizer for the past couple weeks. Winter weather usually takes a toll on my skin and leaves it dull. This product has worked to bring life back to my skin. It moisturizes, has brighten my skin and it feels smoother. I have not seen a difference with wrinkles - maybe longer use is needed. The cream is thick so a little goes a long way. I have oily/combination skin. *Received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using cicacream for the past month and have seen great improvement in my skin. My skin is brighter, softer and smoother.

"I was very pleased with this cream! I instantly felt my skin smoother and visibly protected without a heavy or creamy feel.

The plus was how well it agreed with my makeup and did not cause patches or weird spots. I received this as a sample to test and review through Influenster, and I will be buying and adding it to my daily regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product through Influenster. I really saw all the difference in my skin and it reduced my lines into weeks. It has many anti-aging ingredients so some natural ones. I am very impressed by this product and will use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved this product! I'm at that age where lines are definitely starting to show and using this cream for the past month has diminished them quite a bit! The texture of the cream is fairly smooth, and makes my skin feel really soft and healthy. Can't wait to see the affect this cream will have on my skin when I continue to use it for a couple more months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent a free sample from Influenster - and i LOVE it!! It goes on so smooth and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or tight or anything. I have noticed my skin looks smoother and softer since using it. I was using a VERY expensive skincare regime so it's nice to know there is something affordable that works so great! I high recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this as a free trial a month ago and I'm now HOOKED. I use this two times a day - morning and night - after I wash my face. I put this on first and then follow with my facial moisturizer. I've noticed a huge difference - especially around my eyes and mouth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this a month ago from Influenster. I have been using it everyday, at least twice a day. The results have been amazing! My skin is so much softer and younger looking! It gives my skin an amazing dewy quality. I love the way it feels going on and it works great as a primer under my makeup! I will definitely be purchasing this and using daily!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the idea that Cicacream has retinol. I found the cream to feel rich, creamy and really like the texture. Given that it is winter, it was a nice extra barrier from the elements. Didn't really see any difference in my fine lines. I received this product complimentary to test and comment on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I receieved Cicacream Face Moisturizer Pro Retinol & Centella Asiatica complimentary from Influenster. I took the 4 weeks challenge and the results were fantastic. My face appears hydrated and my very fine lines are not very visible. Will continue to use this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this cream! It's a smooth rich cream. Smooths our fine lines. Goes beautifully under make up. Layers well with other skin care steps!! Absolutely a great cream for anyone looking to better their skin! I received this product for free to review.....which makes it a win win for me with this great cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for testing and I LOVED IT! Super smooth, it does not leave a greasy look. The texture is not too thick and very refreshing. The tube it comes in is very easy to carry around and apply, instead of the bulky round/square containers. I could feel my skin hydrated after the first week of use, no doubt about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a complimentary sample to try. I LOVED it! I saw a dramatic reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looked more vibrant and made me feel younger. I would recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster for testing. I've had it about a month and have not noticed any difference in my fine lines or wrinkles. This cream however is a great moisturizer. Helped with a couple dry patches I had Ben dealing with this winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
#CicaCream #TigerGrass #complimentary #contest @Influenster @lorealskin I did the 4week challenge and let me just say I'm so glad I did just in that time I noticed a difference in my skin and the way my makeup goes and stays on! I don't see harsh under eyes and my skin has a nice natural glow! I think it is a great and affordable product and would definitely tell anyone looking for a good product to check it out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this cream complimentary from Influenster to review and all my opinions are my own. I have been using the cream for about a month. It goes on smooth and does a good job moisturizing my skin, but I can't see any noticeable difference in lines and wrinkles. I also don't love the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have had no irritation after using this for a week as directed, but I do not have sensitive skin, either. My skin does look plump and hydrated, which causes fine lined to appear diminished. Over time, retinols can diminish lines and wrinkles even further so it's good to remember that no skin care product is an overnight miracle. It takes time and regular use to see complete results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this cream complimentary through Influenster and I am glad I did. I love the way my skin feels and looks after I use it. My skin doesn't feel oily after I use it although I do have oily skin. It doesn't make it more oily. Unfortunately it doesn't make my skin a little more matte but that's ok. Use it at night mostly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was sent this for free to review and I'm in my early 30s. I've recently started caring more about my skincare and trying to prevent signs of aging but still get the monthly breakouts so it's hard to find something that isn't too rich that breaks me out. This stuff does the trick! I've seen a small change in my smile lines which look a little smoother. Good stuff so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This gets the job done. I can't say I noticed a huge reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. But it smells nice and my skin is soft, so it does the job a moisturizer should. I received this cream complimentary from Influenster to review and all my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product, made my skin feel smooth and moisturizer especially in the brutal cold we've been having. Can't beat the price either, if ya going to help my dry skin and help with anti aging it's perfect for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for a few weeks now. I haven't noticed any change in the fine lines on my face, but it has made my face feel smoother. I like how lightweight this is, and it goes on very nicely and evenly. It makes for a great first layer morning or evening. I received this product complimentary for testing via Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical at first if a new cream for my face but had to give it a while! I am so glad that I did! In the first week alone my skin feels replenished and looks refreshed. After two weeks it's gotten even better! I can't wait to buy this product and add to my every day regime :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary product from influenster. This product felt soo good on my face, this cream made my face feel soo hydrated. I did notice a difference on my fine lines.

I love this product- I am always buying products that never seem to work and I am on to the next. With this cicacream- I already see a noticeable difference in my forehead fine lines with two weeks! Can't wait to see the continued results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as a trial and would like to tell you about my experience with it. I loved the feel of the cream. It was not sticky and did not have too much scent. All that being said, I really did not notice a difference in my skin tone or lines. It felt good on my skin but I didn't see a big benefit from using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was chosen to review this product as a product tester, and it's one of the better face creams I've ever had the pleasure to use. The scent is light and it is not greasy or heavy on the skin. After one week of use, I noticed my skin felt smoother and softer. I will definitely be purchasing this product to replace my more expensive face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product via Influenster free to test and I absolutely love this product! It doesn't make your face feel oily or like it has too much product on it. It felt lightweight and left my face feeling soft and hydrated. It also helped to reduce some of the fine lines on my face. I will be buying this product regularly and would highly recommend this product over most similar products out there! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this for free for to use and review from Influence. I've been using it nightly for about 3 weeks and can definitely see a slight difference in my skins texture and tone. The tiger grass really seems to do the trick. Great stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my Cicacream complementary (Thank you!) from Influenster as part of a Voxbox campaign and could NOT wait to try it. I have not been disappointed! Right away my skin was much more supple and hydrated, and the longer I go, the more my skin is improving. It looks and feels smoother and more clear, and I could swear the lines in my forehead are becoming less and less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I absolutely love this product! It has made my skin feel considerably better. Very hydrated and supple. I also have sensitive skin so I was worried about about added a step to my routine and having breakouts. I saw no break outs! In fact my skin looks better than it has in months! Smooth and clear. I will 100% be adding this to my routine! Thanks to Influenster for sending me this complimentary product that I will be buying over and over!
"My skin is so dry and the cold, winter months aren't helping. This cream feels rejuvenating, even in the morning, after putting it on at night. It's hard to say yet if it's helping the beginning of my wrinkles, but I am loving it and will keep using it to see. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Immediately drawn to the smell (not chemically, but floraly and pleasant) unlike some other wrinkle creams. The packaging is crisp and fresh, and the cream itself a nice consistency. Time will tell if my no-sleep mom wrinkles are packing their bags, but I'm optimistic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Incredible stuff! It glides on easy and the smell is light and non-greasy. Tip- a little goes a long way. My skin has definitely seen the lines decrease and I feel so clean wearing it! So happy I got to try #complimentary for testing :) from Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is a savior to my dry skin! It's gotten colder and dryer where I live and my skin had been looking dry, tired and uneven. This cream is nice and thick to coat over my skin at night. I wake up to soft supple healthy skin. It's been a long time since I've been this happy with my skin. Highly recommend.received this as a sample from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was shocked by how much I liked this product and how quickly I saw results. My skin appeared brighter and more even in about a week. I used it as a second to last step in my morning and evening skincare routine. It lays well under makeup, which can be hard to do. I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. And, I stand by this review and will most likely repurchase it when this tube is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way it smells and you can feel it working its magic. It has a pleasant slightly tingling sensation. I use it mostly on my neck and crows feet area. I recommend trying it for yourselves! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.
I've been using Cicacream for about two weeks now. I have noticed a more rejuvenated look in my skin. The weather has been dry and this product has helped keep my face from drying out. I use it day and night!
I received this product free for testing and honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a complimentary for testing. It's light weight, not too greasy feeling. Love the fact it doesn't have an scent for those who have sensitive skin like myself. It make my skin feel soft and well hydrated without feeling like something heavy plus fighting the signs of aging [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for a few weeks I did notice my skin feeling softer, supple, and more smooth. I did notice my skin was also more luminous as I kept using the product. While I didn't really see any improvement on my lines (I have terrible forehead lines or my stress lines). While this might not be a great anti aging product I do think it was great for my dry skin. I would give this a 3.5 instead of a 3. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. I wanted to use this for a period of time before writing my review. Like most women, I don't get enough sleep and it shows, especially under my eyes. I've used several products with much satisfaction but this is a game changer. I'm so happy with the reduction of the fines lines and the bags under my eyes. This is my new go to! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this moisturizer through Influenster...I really wanted to like this product, but I prefer a more moisturizing moisturizer, especially since it is the winter where my skin is a bit dry. I can see this working better for those that have oilier skin. I will definitely use this up, maybe as an extra step before my foundation. It just did not fit my needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a skin care junkie and I was very excited to receive this in the mail. I have to be honest and say I didn't really notice any difference in my fine lines or wrinkles. I will say if you are looking for a solid moisturizer this is a good choice. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and I had no breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product day and night for 3 weeks. I noticed results in the first week and continue to see results. My skin is glowing and bright. My fine lines have reduced and my skin looks and feels firmer. I love the texture. It is thick and creamy yet absorbs immediately. The first few times I used it there was noticeable tingling which I enjoy. I received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster. I will purchase when I finish this tube.
I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Anti Aging Ciracream thanks to #influenster. I LOVE this cream. It is a thicker cream that goes on very smoothly and soaks in nicely. It does not have a scent or leave your face oily. It leaves your face feeling very soft. It works well with make up layered on top of it. I can tell a difference in my skin firmness and wrinkles on my forehead. I will definitely be continue to use this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this free from influenster to try and review. This product has a really good thick consistency and applies nice and evenly. The smell is pleasant but nothing to rave about. It leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have dry skin, so I need my products to work well together and moisturize at the same time. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.

I received this complimentary product via Influenster. I was pretty amazed. The Retinol feels amazing on my skin. My face is nice and firm when I wake up. It works really well with my oily skin. It did not sting or burn at all. I think after a little more time using it my results will be even better. I would buy this for my friends and myself. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product a few weeks ago. I'm only 29, so my fine lines and wrinkles are just starting but figured this would help prevent them from growing and getting deeper. It works as a great moisturizer too. It's small enough I can keep it in my purse so I never go a day without using it. I did receive this product complimentary to test from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for 4 weeks and noticed a huge difference in my skin! The cream is amazing for adding moisture back into the skin and reducing the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles! I use it at night and gently pat it into my problem areas after cleansing and toning, before I put on my night cream. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from influenster.

"I started using this cream regularly 3 weeks ago. At first, I only noticed that it is very light, absorbs easily and smells good. I knew that it has unique ingredients like Centella Asiatica, but I did not hope for the miracle. After three weeks my skin became brighter than before, and I think some of my fine lines under the eyes are lesser visible now. I am using this cream twice a day, as a regular moisturizer. I received this product complimentary for testing from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the first “wrinkle” type cream I'm trying out. After the first use I immediately noticed the fine lines around my mouth were going away. The second day, gone. Overall I Love it. Can't wait to see my results when I'm done using this. I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this item complimentary through influenster and as I'm growing older I know I need to start working on preventing my skin from aging. I currently don't have a lot of wrinkles or anything like that but I love the way this cream feels and I've added it into my skin care regimen before I use my serums. I really love how it feels and how fresh it makes my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first started using this, it made my skin slightly reactive. My face felt slightly warm and tingly and my cheeks were flushed. After using for a couple days I noticed that my skin was more glowy and any fine lines id noticed were no longer visible.

I have very sensitive skin and I was so pleased when I saw that this product was for sensitive skin! I applied at night and woke up to beautiful soft skin with slightly diminished wrinkles.

Thank you L'oreal and Influenster for letting me try out this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never used a Cica product and wasnt sure what to expect. The cream is scentless, and blended into my skin with little effort. My skin felt moisturized and not greasy in any way. I saw my pores diminish and also my skin looked more radiant. This cream worked well for me as a makeup primer as well. I can't say I saw wrinkles improve but there was an overall more healthy appearance to my skin. I received this product complimentary for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this item for free to test I'm always on the look out for a great retinol face cream. I have tried various brands, and I was pleasantly surprised on the texture of this cream. My skins feels well hydrated and bright. I have been turned off by the texture of retinol creams in the past especially after you put it on your face. Not this one. This one is spreads smoothly and a little bit goes a long way. I will be re-buying this item. Love that Loreal added this item to is line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that this product has no scent and it moisturizes great. I think it may be too moisturizing for my skin because it does not absorb completely. I would recommend this for people with dry to combination skin. It did not irritate my acne prone skin which was great! I received this product for free to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and think I will be adding it to my regular routine. I have dry skin and live in a dry climate (which is even worse during the winter) and the Cicacream has been helping to lock in moisture and make my moisturizer work better than it normally does. While I haven't yet noticed a reduction in fine lines (I've only been using it for ten days), my skin is very dewy when using it, which I love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free to try from Influester in my #voxbox. So far I'm loving how it's helping my skin even out and it is very smooth. Can't wait to see what it looks like once the 4 weeks is over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've really enjoyed this moisturizer. I've been using it every day for a few weeks and it's been really good for my skin. The scent is subtle. The product is a great consistency.

I received this product complimentary for a review.

"I received this complimentary from Influenster to test out. At first I was skeptical. I typically only use Korean skincare. This cream is nice though. It goes on smoothly, doesn't feel smothering, and it feels like it locks in the layers of moisture that I apply at night time. I look forward to seeing how it will transform my skin once I've completed the tube."
"I love this cream! It smells so amazing, made my skin silky smooth, and I can even see a deduction in my fine lines! My skin felt moisturized which helped through this winter weather!

"Loveeee this product! I've only been using it for a week and it's helped so much! My skin is so dry, flakey and itchy in the winter and this product has helped make those almost non existent!

"I received this item FREE in the mail from Influenster to give it a try, and boy am I glad they picked me! Cicacream provides an instant barrier for my skin- protecting it against pollution, make-up, not to mention cold windy weather.The best part? My skin feels firmer and more elastic. Hard to believe the huge difference in just 3 weeks of use. A total WINNER - 2 thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product feels good on skin. Not greasy or pore clogging, but I can't see how it really made any difference in the overall appearance or hydration of my skin. Overall, I wasn't super impressed and would not really recommend to others. There are so many more effective products on the market. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.

"I got this item complmentary from Inflenster, all opinions are my own. I do like and enjoy that this product is paraben free. I like the overall softness and texture of my skin while using this product. I've been using it for about three weeks but haven't noticed any difference yet in my fine lines. I do believe that Retinol takes some time to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream as an anti-aging product with retinol during the winter months. Unlike other retinol products, it is hydrating while delivering the age fighting results. I have also noticed a reduction in some of my adult acne while consistently using this, which is an added bonus. It has a creamy consistency and absorbs nicely. Overall, I recommend it. I received this product in a complimentary VoxBox from Influenster, but my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I started using this cream about two weeks ago and have already noticed a dramatic difference in the appearance of my skin. I use this cream only in my problem areas- which for me is my forehead! The appearance of wrinkles has definitely decreased since I started this product. The product is light and has no harsh smells and with the size of the tube this product could last several months. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster, and after using it for two weeks, I have noticed a reduction of fine lines, especially on my forehead. There really isn't much of a smell to it, which I like. It seems to soak into the skin pretty quickly, which I also appreciate, especially when I'm in a hurry to get ready in the morning with my Makeup application. I'm excited to see the end result after four weeks! So far I do like this product."
I received this about 3weeks ago in an Influenster Vox. It is super hydrating and works best under a daily moisturizer. I've been using it day and night and have noticed a change in the texture of my skin. My skin is smoother and has gotten more moist and brighter. I have also noticed a slight difference in some of the old acne scars I have on my face.
"I really like this moisturizer, I've been using it daily in the morning and in the evening. Haven't seen results just yet but so far so good. It's very light weight but still leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I"

"First impression was, this stuff is THICK! I needed more than the pea size amount I'm used to. This product says it can be used twice a day, but because of the thickness, I found it too heavy to wear during the day. I did not notice much difference in my fine lines on my forehead, but overall a good moisturizer before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt a big of tingling and it's definitely not moisturizing on enough on it's own for my dry skin but I did feel my skin looked tighter and more youthful. I did have to reapply moisturizer halfway through the day so I wasn't flaky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free to test out- it's super thick and dense cream, but goes on super smooth and light. It is not greasy in anyway, and it soaks right into my face after I shower! I have only been using this product for about a week now, but my skin is so soft and I am hoping to see some lines disappear as I continue to use it. There is no smell to the lotion which is nice, and it's extremely hydrating without being heavy at all. It's a great lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this for free from Influenster. Have been using this for three weeks now every day and am pleased with the results.

"I have been testing this product for two weeks now. I do see some of my fine lines becoming less prominent. There is a nice light scent to it, and it soaks into the skin quickly. I usually apply this instead of a moisturizer before I apply makeup, and it creates a beautiful base for makeup application. My occasional break outs are also becoming less frequent. I'm very impressed. I did receive this product in a complimentary VoxBox from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given the opportunity to try this product out for free and was quite pleased with its results. It feels light when put on my skin. I noticed that my skin felt more hydradated, firmer, and softer during the first weeks. I look forward to checking out the difference in any fine lines after a couple of more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer smells amazing. The scent is subtle and clean, not over bearing like some that I've tried. The cream left my face feeling soft and offered an all day protection from dryness. I used it before I applied my makeup and it seemed to help my makeup last throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just started using my Cica cream a couple of days ago and just love that my product is non greasy & doesn't leave my face oily! I love the way it goes on smooth! Will continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this from influensters and was so excited to try it out. I got this item free to try out and I'm glad I found this gem. Super moisturizing and I have noticed reduction of a scar I have from the chicken pox when I was little. I will purchase this item and highly recommend. Great price point and it works.

"I received this product free from influenster! The product is in nice packaging, goes on smooth, and doesn't have a nasty smell. I haven't noticed much difference in the wrinkle department, but I don't have many to begin with. Overall, I'd say it's a quality product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product twice a day for a week and so far it's doing a good job of firming, toning, and moisturizing my skin. My pores are minimized and skin feels more taut. Can't wait to see what happens by the end of the tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free to test from Influenster. I am turning 30 next week and am trying to keep my skin looking young and wrinkle free. I love the thickness of this moisturizer, it really feels like its doing its job when I use it. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, so I cannot say I see any drastic differences yet, but I really enjoy the consistency and texture, and this leaves my skin feeling super hydrated but not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream feels absolutely lush on your skin and there are quick improvements with skin hydration, smoothness and softness. After one week I see and feel the benefits and look forward to experiencing further results with continued use. I did receive this product complimentary for review but my opinion is unbiased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my L'Oreal Revitalift Cicacream from Influenster to try for my honest opinion. I have been using it for just over a week and although I haven't seen major changes yet, I do like the light feeling the cream has when applied and how it has helped with seasonal dryness. I'm sure with more time, the changes will be more noticeable... fine lines didn't appear over night! #almost 50 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm very picky about face moisturizers. I have dry skin in the winter, so I really need something that keeps my skin vibrant and youthful, but isn't heavy. This does all of that! I love the texture and smell of this cream to start, but it also works wonderfully! I noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. It's nice and light and makes my skin glow. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this through Influenster and I was super excited to try it! I'm 31 years old and I'm starting to see fine lines and wrinkles so I'll pretty much try anything I can get my hands on to reduce the onset of age. I thought for the price point that this product was great and would certainly buy it once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It had a pleasant fresh smell and went on fairly thin. I mainly applied in trouble areas because the instructions were vague about that. Unfortunately, it did seem to exacerbate my forehead acne (caused by postpartum hormones). But other than that I felt the skin around my eyes and around my mouth seemed more taut. I will try to use again when my hormones level out, it seems worth it. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free two weeks ago to test. I like how smooth it goes on, how smooth it makes my skin, and the packaging. It does my skin a bit oily, but I'm also 7 months pregnant, so it could be because of that. I do not notice much difference in the wrinkles on my face, but I have only been using the product 1-2 times a day for two weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product complimentary courtesy of Influenster, and have been using it about 2 weeks now. I don't have fine lines or wrinkles to begin with, so not sure this was really the best product for me to be testing. For me, it's just an average moisturizer, and looks like it does the job. Just don't notice if it's all that different from any other moisturizer I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from Influenster. I have been using it for 3 weeks. I added it in with my usual routine with other products. I like how my skin is looking, however it's not nearly hydrating enough during the winter months. My skin has felt tight and dry which isn't something I like. Maybe in the summer when I'm produing more oils naturally this would be better for my skin type. I'm usually combination/dry in the winter and just t-zone oily in the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free to try and test. I've been using it morning and night as directed on the package for a week now. I have not seen any major change in my skin. If anything I noticed my skin drier than normal while using the product compared to when I'm not. I have lines under my eyes and a little on my forehead and they have not diminished since I used this product a week ago. I will continue to use and update if it will give any changes with longer use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product as part of my Influenster package. And was pleasantly surprised. It's a nice consistency. Left my skin feeling soft and not dried out like some anti aging products do on my skin. No crazy miracles were worked. I do not look 19 again lol but it was a nice product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been looking for a good moisturizer and I am seeing more and more fine lines and wrinkles now that I am almost 40. I love products that have dual purposes so I was thrilled when I was chosen to try this product. I have been using it morning and evening for a few weeks now and I LOVE It! My face feels so moisturized, but not greasy and so soft. I am already seeing some of my fine lines disappear as well! I will definitely purchase this product again when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this for free to review and it came at the right time. I've only been using it for a few days but my skin feels more moisturized already. I've been able to use it and have not to the. Any breakouts or pimples. It has a light scent to it. The bottle is a good size and a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the Cicacream through Influenster to sample. I'm 3 weeks in and I can already see the fine lines around my eyes starting to fade. I feel like if I continue to use it daily, the results would be huge. You get a ton of product for the price. I'd recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a full size of this product for free for review via Influenster. I was skeptical at first because it was advertised as being a new skin care step before your moisturizer (though you can use it alone). However it seemed to make a difference when I use it! It is a thick cream that seems to absorb into your skin and when paired with my normal moisturizer, my skin seems to be less oily, softer, less textured. I'm going to use it all and will consider buying if I continue to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have received this product for free through Influenster for a review. I started using it and instantly feel in love. One big factor in wrinkles is dehydration in our skin. This product helped hydrate my skin and started seeing a difference by the second week. Great product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free to test, and I'm glad I did. It's a nice cream that really feels like a good barrier for winter. I think it might be too heavy for my skin for the summer, but the timing is perfect since it's quite cold where I am now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my first day using this product. I got complimentary from Influenster and I'm impressed! I'm a total skin care junkie and the ingredients in this skin cream are truly exceptional! So far my skin feels crazy soft and have a noticeable difference in skin texture already! We'll see how the next week or so goes with it but I'm hopeful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this from influenster for sampling purposes. I have to say I'm quite impressed. An anti-aging cream that is not too heavy to cause breakouts and is not drying. I've seen results more in my dark spots caused by previous breakouts. Since using this cream, the dark spots have dramatically decreased. Really happy with this product, will definitely repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Normally I don't like most anti-aging creams because they feel heavy on my skin and can easily make me break out, but this is super lightweight, absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't make me break out. My skin looks healthier (not dry and blotchy like it has been) and definitely more youthful. L'Oréal Revitalift Anti Aging Cicacream is definitely a keeper!"

"I started using this product the second I received it! It's been about two weeks now and I notice a huge change in my skin! It's softer, brighter, and my fine lines are becoming less noticeable! I love this product and will definitely keep buying it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this for free from Influenster, and I'm so glad I did! It's been hard to notice any firming benefit since my skin is so dry right now due to the winter, but it's extremely hydrating and such a great base for me to layer other moisturizers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for a few weeks and it's very nice, not too heavy or greasy-feeling. I wear it underneath moisturizer during the day and underneath another serum at night. My skin looks a bit smoother, brighter and my smile lines are less pronounced. The change is very subtle but I'm sure the longer i use it the more noticeable it would be. Overall i like this product a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Influenster, and so far I am not disappointed. Most drugstore skin care either irritates my skin, feels too thick, or has an awful scent. However, this Cicacream is none of those things! As far as skin benefits, I've only been using it for about a week, but I'm starting to see a slight improvement in tone. I'll keep using this product for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Right away I notice that my skin looked and felt smoother and more hydrated. It's only been a week so I'm eager to see what results come with more weeks of use. I tried this cream complementary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I got this about a week ago and I'm truly impressed. I thought ""oh this is just going to be another moisturizer"" I put it on and I couldn't believe how refreshed I looked. I have a newborn so looking refreshed isn't something I'm used to. It's lightweight and smells so good!"
"I started using this cream about two weeks ago, I love the consistency and feel of it. It immediately refreshes my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and not greasy at all. It may be too soon to see extreme results but I do notice my fine lines looking less visible already. I am glad I received this complimentary to try and I am sure to purchase again.

"I've been using Loreal's Cicacream face moisturizer Pro Retinol and Centella Asiatica cream for about two weeks now. It feels think out of the tube but goes on smooth. It appears to be tightening up some of my finer lines, but may take more time to see more dramatic results. I'm was very happy to be chosen to try this product for from from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Thanks Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received the anti aging Revitalift Cicacream from Influenster absolutely free for product testing. After 2 weeks of using it in my daily and nightly routine, I have seen improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, some improvement in skin firmness, my skin after use feels soft and very rehydrated! After seeing results this quickly, I will be adding this to my skin care routine day and night! #Lorealskin, #Cicacream, #Influenster, #honestproductreviews"
"I have been using my anti aging cicacream for a week now. The cream is very smooth and very easy to apply. So far I'm not able to see huge changes as I'm just starting, but it's very gente to my skin and feels really nice as well. I'll be posting my after results.

"THIS STUFF IS GREAT, I was looking to get something to help my 32 year old skin and prevent from serious wrinkles from forming. This product took about 2-3 uses for me to see the effects and they make you skin look sooooo good. Not to mention that now I use less make up bc my skin looks that great. I did receive this product complimentary for testing and am so glad I did! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical about this product at first but after just only a few days of use I was in love. This product is now a staple in my skin care regiment.

"I am really enjoying the product, it applies very evenly and smoothly. I have been applying the product day and night for a little over a week now and I can already notice a reduction in fine lines!

I got a complimentary sample through Influenster. I don't usually use anything beyond moisturizer and witch hazel after cleansing but I figured i'd give it a try since I'm inching further into my thirties! I noticed a big difference in how my skin looked almost immediately AND it got rid of a lot of my fine lines. My girlfriends at work complimented me on how great my skin looked today and I've been using it for about three weeks now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I received mine about 2 weeks ago from Influester and started using it immediately. I love to use it after my serum, the moisture it's just right that I don't even need an extra moisturizer after. I can't wait to see results in the next 2 weeks. I received this product complimentary for review purposes."
I was sent this for free from Influenster but these opinions are my own. I've been using this for 2 weeks now and can already see a difference in my skin. The area around my eyes looks less dry and feels softer. I can see the fine lines getting less than they were!! I love this and will continue to purchase on my own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
WOW!! This is one great moisturizer. I have noticed a difference in the texture and moisture of my skin already and have only been using for a week. It soaks into the skin and great for under makeup. So happy the drugstore is coming out with products we can afford that really work!! Way to go L'Oréal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very happy with this product. I use it twice a day as recommended. The first thing that I noticed very quickly was how well my makeup went on after applying this cream in the morning. And, I'm using less makeup! It feels as though it's keeping my makeup from soaking into my skin and disappearing! My face is smoother, too. Time will tell on fine lines disappearing but I intend to keep using to find out! I received this product free to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recevied this product for taste It and I really very happy with the results. I have pigmention problems in my face, because in my front you can see a double tone.

"I received this complimentary from Influenster and I've been using it for about a week now. It's nice and thick but soaks in well and leaves my face feeling refreshed. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my problem areas but I expect it might be too soon to tell. It doesn't have a scent which a lot of people like, I would like a little more scent myself."
"I got this for free from influenster. With that said, I was unsure I even wanted to try it out since I love my current moisturizer so much. But, I was happily surprised that it's holding up to the super dry Minnesotan winter. I even noticed my skin brightening and looking more youthful on top of being moisturizing. Give it a try if you're looking to reduce the look of fine lines! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had always used the same face cream for years but I am really enjoying this new one and would definitely consider switching! This cream is super rich and perfect for the winter season! I also love the light scent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product complimentary from Influenster and was very skeptic at first. I am 31 years old and have pretty good skin to begin with and didn't think it would make much of a difference. I was wrong! My smile lines are already smoothing out after 10 days of use (morning only) and I also notice my skin to be more radiant and plump. The product is also very lightweight and feels great on my skin. I have acne prone skin and haven't had any flare ups since beginning this product.
"I got this moisturizer free from Influenster for review about 2 weeks ago. I have normal/combination skin, and this is a very good moisturizer. My skin feels very soft and hydrated after I use it. I have not, however, experienced any reduction in fine lines/wrinkles, etc., as I do not have any to reduce. (THANKS, ANCESTRY!) If I did have those problems, I suspect that this cream would work well due to how hydrated, soft, and supple my skin feels after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Influenster. Ive been using the product for only a week now, so not sure if should be seeing results right away, but my skin feels so smooth!

"I have oily skin, so it's hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't add to the issue. This one makes my skin feel so soft and after about 15 minutes, it's fully absorbed. I can wear it day or night.

I started using this product at night and I like how light it is so it didn't weigh me down with my toner and essence that I apply. I like the scent and it doesn't make me break out either. The only thing is that this product has retinol so beware in case you're getting laser hair removal treatment like me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have some awesome results with mu skin from using Loreal Cicacream Face Pro Retinol and Centella Asiatica. I noticed a reduction in my fine lines and the barrier had a big improvement.

I received this product to test out from Influenster and L'oreal. I use L'oreal revitalift producta regularly and was excited to try this product out as well. I am very happy with the results so far. My skin feels smooth and lines look less visible. Totally recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is just the right consistency. I felt it was thick enough to go on smoothly and never left a greasy layer on my face that some creams do. It absorbed quickly and had a pleasant smell. I liked to put it on right out of the shower in the morning and right before bed at night. I have definitely noticed tighter skin. I received this cream complimentary for testing.

"I just gave birth to my third baby and the day we came home from the hospital, I had this L'Oréal Cica Cream Face Moisturizer in my Voxbox from Influenster waiting at the doorstep! I started using it right away, because the lack of sleep always does a number on my face and eye puffiness, and have seen great results so far! It's only been a little over a week, so I am excited to continue using it and seeing the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Cicacream Face Moisturizer Pro Retinol & Centella Asiatica cream for 2 weeks mostly at night. I have in between oily and dry skin but it makes my face slightly greasy, and thats why I wear it only at night. The claims are great! I love how it protects your skin from pollution and harmful things in the air that's constantly going to be an issue. I got a pimple on my face as well but am not 100% sure if its from this product. Overall, I like this and am extremely happy I got this for free for my honest review."
I have only been using this product for a week but can already feel a difference! My skin is so soft and supple and after I put it on I have a sort of glow and radiance to my skin. I typically buy expensive products but honestly I like this product just as well even better than some that I have spent $50+ on! I received this through a campaign and typically wouldn't have tried it but I am so surprised! Can't wait to see what my skin look and feels like in another week or 2!

I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. It's only been a week so I can't tell any long term benefits but it's a nice product.

"Winter weather started to take its toll early this year, so I was excited to try Cicacream. After using it for a few weeks, I can honestly say that my skin feels softer than it has in a long time! I've also noticed a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles which has been a wonderful bonus! Although, I received this product complimentary for testing, I will definitely be buying more when I am finished with this tube! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a tester and honestly....it's meh. It's not amazing, it's not bad. It's just a standard ru of the mill face lotion. My skin texture never got better or worse, it's just totally average. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this complimentary for my honest review but am so thankful I got to check it out! It comes in a HUGE tube which means hello less having to shop! It leaves my eyes feeling super soft and after a few weeks of use I can see it working on my fine lines better than what I was using! Not a fan of the smell but love the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just got this a week ago, so I am still waiting to notice any results. I am going to keep using this product though because a little bit goes a long way!

"My skin gets very dry in the winter months and this moisturizer has done a really great job at keeping my skin supple so it doesn't get dry and flake in the cold weather.

I recieve this item free to try from influenster ...so far I like it but I also started using a bunch of other products before this so I'm not sure if this is the top notch product I would spend millions on it but for a moisturizer I enjoy it ....not to thick and not light ....just perfect for the winter and it comes in q great size too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this in a VoxBox, and it's not bad. I generally used Korean Skincare, and when I received this, I was excited to try it out. It seemed to moisturize well enough, but it wasn't a match for my usual routine and didn't seem to add quite as much moisture. Still, for the price that it normally runs at, it's not a bad option for someone who doesn't want to run through a lot of steps. Also, didn't bother my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Most wrinkle creams I have tried had strong scents which also irritated my skin. This cream was a nice consistency and no heavy scent. I immediately felt tightening in my skin around my eyes and forehead. Also no excess greasy feel from too much oil. I love it. My cream was complimentary for testing.

"I love this product! I was a little nervous the first 48 hours because my face broke out (just a little - nothing a little concealer couldn't fix). After the initial 48 hours, my face went back to be being blemish free. The Cicacream has made my face so smooth as well as decreasing fine lines/sun spots. It goes well under makeup too, my face is not greasy or shiny at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for testing purposes and did not purchase it on my own. I've used this product for a week and I can already notice a difference in my skin. During winter my skin suffers from dryness and looks quite dull. This product has brought moisture back to my face, and has even toned it! Would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free for testing purposes through Influenster. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and it does a nice job of moisturizing my skin. I like it for the morning because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly. It also acts as a good primer for my makeup. I would prefer a heavier moisturizer at night, but this isn't bad. I also have very sensitive skin and have not had any problem with redness or breakouts using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I have to rave about it my skin has always been super dry during the winter months and after using this for only a week and a half my skin is so soft and my husband actually complimented how radiant I looked !!

"I received this CicaCream as a complimentary gift in exchange for an honest review. I've been using it a week now, and have seen great results thus far. My skin feels smoother, hydrated and makes for a great primer pre-makeup application. My foundation goes on smoother and it's brightened my skin. I'm a covert for sure!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample to try from Influenster. I've been using it daily for a week. It feels so light and it's absorbed quickly but it leaves my skin so soft.

I received this product complimentary of influenster
I have been using the product daily for almost two wks. I use it post shower daily And prior to my serum and foundation routine. I do like the way the product feels. However I cannot 100 percent say it has reduced fine lines. I will have to continue use to be sure. It is a great moisturizer however and there is PLENTY of product in the tube. More than enough to use daily twice for 4 wks.
I received my free sample to try from #influenster. My skin is combination with some fine lines and I did see some nice moisturizing effects. But no reduction in the appearance of fine lines. My foundation did go on a lot more smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've been using the Cica cream that I received completely free from Influenster & lorealskin and I must say, I am very pleased with the results. The cream goes on smooth and dries quickly.

"I have been using this product for about a week. When you apply it, it doesn't feel overly moisturizing like you would think a moisturizer would feel like.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This bottle I am using came complimentary from Influenster, but I am most definantly going to repurchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Believe it or not, this actually works. I am always skeptical of claims made by expensive face creams/potions. Not only is this one affordable, I actually noticed an improvement after a week of day/night use. It puffs up the tiny lines under my eyes. No, this is not going to make you look like a teenager but it really did improve my skin. I am happily surprised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free as a voxbox from influencer! I've used it for the past week and it seems to be a great moisturizer since typically my face gets dry patches in the winter.

I tend to get shiny during the day, and so far have only used this a night. It feels great, applies smoothly, and has a light, but pleasant scent. I plan to use it at night for a while, and maybe test it on a day when I am ""around the house"" to see if it brings on shine or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
