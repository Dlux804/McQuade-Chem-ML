"I have been using different, more natural, products over the years. I've been looking for just the right products to switch to Now. I bought this night cream & was excited to try it - just felt right. After 3 nights of use, my skin was nourished & actually felt soft, plumped & beautiful. It's light, smoothes on, light fragrance & absorbs during the night. My skin Loves it. I Love my new Bee-line with Royal Jelly. I hope this line continues to expand. Great & very excited to have tried it."
"Skin Nourishment Night Cream inspires me to wash my face before I go to bed. Even when I'm absolutely exhausted at the end of the day and just want to crash, I remember how nice it will feel to have this night cream on. Rich texture; not heavy or greasy. I love it!"
"Purchased this on 1/072018 the weather where I live has been very cold and very dry. I used this every night along with the sensitive eye cream with cotton extract. in 5 days the puffy, chapped, red, peeling eyes were healed. I recommend this product its wonderful not heavy or greasy. since it's Winter and it has been really harsh and cold. I want to see how this and the other products I purchased work on my skin in Spring, Summer and Fall."
"I received this product to try for free. I dont usually wear night cream becsusr i suffer from cystic acne sometimes and if my skin gets too oily i will break out. This cream is nice and light and soaked into my skin easily. Nice mellow scent, i dont like honey so was glad of the mild scent. My skin felt nice the next day, not sure about how effective it os on fine lines and wrinkles yet but i will keep using it."
"Not the best I've ever used, but for the money -- it does the job well enough. Best feature: It's easy on the skin, & doesn't cause my eyes to water. I have experienced improvement since using it, so I would purchase again."
As I understand it there are two basic needs for a night cream. To moisturize or for anti aging. This is more for moisturizing that for anti aging even though it does claim to have some anti aging through the royal jelly. I tried it in addition to the daily moisturizer in the Burt's Box. I broke out some.
This is usable but not as moisturizing or nourishing as the original Radiance formula. Please bring it back. I'm still looking for an adequate replacement in its absence.
"I've been using Radiance Night Cream for years and and honestly there was NOTHING like it for my dry, dry 63 year old skin. It went on so smoothly, plumped up my skin instantly, but the best part was it gave my skin such a glow that I used it during the day with just blush and it lasted! I tried the Skin Nourishment Night Cream recently, and it just doesn't compare to the Radiance in terms of glow. PLEASE consider bringing back the Radiance! I'll try the Intense Hydrating Night Cream, but I so miss the Radiance."
Hi! Would you al consider bringing back the old Radiance royal jelly night cream? I have dry skin and have found that this cream is just making it worse. The old cream was gentler and more hydrating. Thank you!
This by far has been one of my favorite night creams I have ever tried. It keeps my skin moisturized and smooth. I have found my skin to look more healthy after incorporating Burts Bees products into my regular skincare regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is awesome to use right before bed because the natural scent is not overpowering, but subtle and peaceful. It helps calm me for the night and feel like I'm giving my skin the treatment it deserves. I have not woken up to breakouts from over-moisturizing, either! My skin looks healthier with this entire line of products, but if I had to choose just one, I'd choose the night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream smells incredibly delicious. It feels so wonderful on my face. Sometimes I use a little extra to rub on my hands, too. It's a thicker consistency, so if you're clumsy like me, it won't spill all over the counter if you accidentally knock the jar over. Previously, I used the sensitive night cream and while I liked it, I prefer this night cream's texture and effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love love love heavy and thick night creams. My skin loves the moisture it provides. This stuff has a consistency like frosting, super thick."
"The first few nights I used way too much, being used to thinner creams, and it took forever to rub in. Then I started using closer to a small pea sized amount, and it was perfect for my face and neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this product. It goes on your skin smoothly and hydrates without an oily feel or appearance. This is my ""go to"" nighttime lotion now. I don't know how I'll live without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I typically use one of the other Burt's Bees night cream, but this one works just as well. It just takes a small amount for all round coverage of your face and neck. It is very light and doesn't feel greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am picky about night creams. I want one that goes on easily, is absorbed into my skin, and feels light. The first thing I noticed about this night cream is that it feels cool as I smooth it on. It is light but very moisturizing. My skin feels so soft in the morning when I wake up. And it doesn't take much to cover an entire face, making it very economical. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is thick, yet it didn't make my face oily or greasy. I feel like the thickness built in a softening layer for my skin overnight. It has a really pleasant smell that was soothing and calming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Within minutes of trying this night cream my skin became itchy and inflamed with bright red blotches. My skin is combination and generally not overly sensitive so I am so disappointed to have this type of reaction. I generally love Burt's Bees products however this one did not work for me!
"I read reviews about the formula has changed, but do not discontinue this because this is perfect for oily combination skin like me so if the people here wants the old formula for their dry skin or whatever that is , then just keep this formula and then make the old formula(yes separately) But this one - I'm already contented with!"
"I bought this cream about a month ago and I absolutely love it. I've had bad eczema my entire life. Gets better and worse, but this cream definitely helps to keep my face soft and glowy. Can't handle many creams, but this one has given no irritation whatsoever. I'm going to buy the body products as well. Would definitely recommend."
"Lovely creamy texture, light not greasy. I just hate the flowery scent. Please consider making unscented products BBees."
"I am not a big fan of night creams, they always feel heavy. I received this as a gift so I tried it and it was great, not heavy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is so soft in the morning after using this! My skin is sensitive & this doesn't irritate it! It kind of has a floral scent & is totally part of my night routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As soon as I began applying, I felt the moisturizer being absorbed. The product felt amazing and immediately made my skin feel soft and nourished. The texture isn't very thick, it's creamy and spreads easily. I'll definitely be purchasing again!"
I love this rich creamy night cream! I use it on my face and neck every night and have been using it for the past six weeks. My skin has never felt more soft and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This seemed to go on heavy but only because it was work horse all night and leaving you with very hydrated skin by morning. I am looking forward to see long term results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually use the sensitive moisturizers, but this one doesn't seem to bother my skin or cause break outs. My skin feels soft the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very bad about taking my make up off at night, but adding this to my face has helped with fighting fine lines and wrinkles. I like how it makes my face will soft and silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked using the night cream. My face felt soft in the morning. It didn't leave a residue feeling on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Sometimes my face is dry. The Skin Nourishment Night Cream is a perfect product to solve this problem. I put it on after I wash my face before bedtime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is very moisturizing and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Also, I think it smells great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It leaves my face very oily and I already have oily skin .. I got one night cream a while back thay was just amazing and I can't remember the name of it or what it looked like but I wish yall still had that one. But i love all things BB honestly especially the face wash
"I use this nightly before bed and love how quickly and easily it absorbs into my skin. Moisturizes well without feeling greasy. My skin is less dry, even in the cold, dry Utah winter! I took off one star because I don't care for the strength of the product's scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was very think but it does not feel heavy on the skin. It also had a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product fells good to the touch and good on smoothly but it doesn't absorb all the way and makes my skin feel sticky and heavy and greasy.
"This night cream goes on easily, and is absorbed almost instantly. The cream makes your face feel soft and moisturized. I have been using it for about eight months, and I love it."
"I received this in a BellaBox and after just one use, I was hooked. So beautifully thick and leaves my skin feeling nourished without being greasy. Absolutely LOVE this product."
I love how smooth this cream is. It feels great on my face and not too thick and heavy. I feel as if I am treating my skin after a long day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In general I've been happy with Burt's Bees products. I like that this product doesn't contain parabens, phthalates, or SLS, and I like that there's no SPF (I want it for nighttime use). The texture and weight is good. After a few tries, though, I've stopped using it. I can't deal with the smell, which reminds me of mosquito repellent."
Found the product had a nice texture and wasn't too greasy but alas trying to use it in summer just meant it is not for me as I sweat an awful lot. I will be able to better try it out in the colder months.
I enjoyed the other product more.

I'm actually disappointed in this cream. I expected more from Burts Bees. This product is as light as a day cream. Nothing about it makes me feel like I'm nourishing my skin. I wouldn't buy it myself. Maybe it would work better for teenage skin.

I am in love with Burts Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream! It has made my skin feel amazing! I put it on before bed and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels soft and hydrated. I like to apply a generous amount. I like that it leaves my skin hydrated without the gross greasy feeling. Also that it has a nice smell. A smell I don't mind lathering on my face! I highly recommend Burts Bees Skin Nourishment Night cream!
My skin felt really clean and radiant when I woke up in the morning. It also did not leave my face oily which I love because I have very oily skin. This is a great anti-aging cream. I recommand highly.

"I received a sample of this in a beauty box. I am a fairly loyal burts bees fan with only a handful of items I'm not too keen on. This is great though. This is a great nighttime moisturizer that doesn't leave my already oily skin, more oily and does not clog my press, so far. As with all burts bees products it has great ingredients but it also has a pretty high price point. The fragrance id's soft, not overwhelming and with a coupon, I'll likely purchase out."
"In the jar, this feels lighter than the Burts Bees intensive hydration day lotion (I use it daily and really like it), but once applied feels a little stickier. It will be good as a hydrating night moisturizer, but I probably won't try wearing it during the day. The scent is light and refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Skin Nourishment Night Cream goes on lightly and doesn't make my skin feel greasy. I put it on after washing my face with the Gentle Foaming Cleanser. Before, when I woke up, my face felt oily. Now with the Skin Nourishment Night Cream, it doesn't feel that way. Wrinkle reduction is also an added bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I encourage all my female friends to use this night cream. It works wonders.
Great formula with royal jelly! it isn't too heavy but moisturizes well!
Burt's Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream is good to apply to my face during the winter months when my skin is dry. Thanks Burt's Bees for another great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has been a dry skin life saver. I was really suffering from serve dry skin with the weather change, I brought this into my regimen and WOW! Dry skin no more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my first purchase of the Burt's Bee's line and I love it. I wanted to try something that was natural and chemical free for my combination skin. I love this night cream. It's not to thick or greasy and soaked into my skin leaving me feeling refreshed in the morning. I love that it doesn't make my skin break out either.
"Since I live in a High Desert area, I am constantly on the search for moisturizers that aren't too heavy or greasy but keep my skin nicely hydrated. I had high hopes for this cream after reading the rave reviews. Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to the hype. I tried it for several nights, and every morning I woke up with dry, rough-feeling skin. I don't know if it's my skin or the dry environment I live in, but this product is not a keeper for me."
"Please keep making the Intense Hydration products, especially the day and night creams. Most skin products have stearic acid and anti-oxidants which irritate my eyes. This one does not. Currently the Intense Hydration products are out in all our local stores. Maybe that's a clue? Thanks! P.S. I do add a capsule of 500 mg of Primrose Oil to the product for extra lubrication."
5 stars just for the smell very nice sage scent
"Its very thick going on the face feels tight and googy at first so apply fast . not greasy just thick absorbs quickly and after a while it feels smooth. Yes it's hydrating. Love Burt bees product. It was a little ify but, Now after 10 minutes it feels nice I would buy it again , the less chemicals for the face and neck the better. 4 stars for it because I'm not use to the thickness of a night cream."
"Never would I have thought Burt'so Bees would have a product like this. I absolutely loved it, it felt very good on skin. I have already recommended Burt's Bees to my family members and some of my friends. I myself plan on buying this product when I do my shopping TY Burt'so Bees for an awesome night Cream."
"I used this product nightly for roughly a week now. I find that it left my skin feeling soft and a lot more smooth. There was no greasy feel, that you get with some creams. The pros are that this product seems to do what it says. But the con is that no matter how much you rub it in, you still seem to get it on your pillow. I would maybe put it on an hour before bed to make sure it has time to absorb."

I tried Burt's Bees skin nourishment with royal jelly and it worked pretty well. It hydrated my skin very well but maybe just a little too much as I woke up with a slight greasy feel. It gave my skin a nice radiant glow and I received several compliments on how nice my skin looked.

"My skin loves Burt's Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream. I have been using it on my face and also on the neck for a few evenings and I can see a great improvement in the texture of my skin. It is also definitely less dry. The application takes a little time as it it quite a rich formula, but it is so worth it! I would recommend to anyone who would like to get rid of little lines and give the skin a little more ( or a lot ) of moisture."
[I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review]
The first thing that I noticed about this product was the packaging. It is a good size and attractive. It stands out on the shelf. I did find that it was a little bit greasy but not to the point where I wouldn't want to use it again. The smell was fine and it did reduce the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes more than anything. You don't need to use a lot at a time which is good .

"I received Burt's Bees night cream with royal jelly from Shopper Army and have been using it nightly for the past week, specifically on the dry areas of my face. This cream is extremely hydrating and rich, but not sticky. It has a wonderful scent and doesn't seem to cause breakouts on my sensitive skin. This product is perfect for anyone looking for that extra boost of hydration overnight."
[I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review]
I've used this night cream for over a week now and I love the texture and the smoothiness of it. The scent is quite nice and subtle and fades off fast enough so to not incommodate your sleep. It left my skin smooth without any greasy feel to it at all which I found a lot of night cream usually does. That was a nice surprise. I would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.
[I received the product for testing purposes]
"I have received this product for free for an honest review. I have enjoyed using this cream. It is a thick cream so you have to rub a little to penetrate your skin. With that being said it does hydrate your skin very nicely. It does not feel greasy after application. I do notice a difference to my skin in the morning . It looks healthy and radiant. I did not notice anti wrinkle benefits yet. However, I have only been using the product for a week. I would recommend this cream for dry, normal and combination skin."
"This is THE PERFECT night cream, OMG it absorbs real fast and feels lie it truly fills the face with moisturizer. smells delicious and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a dry cream that doesn't feel sticky or wet after applying! Magical treatment indeed!!!"
I applied the cream before bed and by morning my skin look great. It was certainly nourishing as my skin was very hydrated and looked firmer. I believe with continued use over time it will reduce fine lines. I would recommend this to everyone.

"I wear this at night time and I love this cream! It smells nice and I prefer it to the radiance line cream. It goes on a bit lighter, so it is not too thick or oily. My skin is on the dry side, so I use pea sized cream and gently rub it into my skin. I can feel my skin is very soft after wake up."
[I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review]
"This cream moisturizes your face, but it doesn't feel gunky or leave a residue. It is a very good addition to your nightly beauty routine. I love that it doesn't have an overpowering scent that keeps you so awake that you have to get up to clean it off your face. I don't love the price though. It is a bit on the steep side, but I might have to bust into my wallet to get some. Good thing a little goes a long way!"
"I liked the feel of this night cream when I tried it from my beauty box but I realized pretty quickly there is something in it that I'm allergic to. I had to wash my face because it started burning within a minute or so of applying this product. I've had some issues with Burt's Bees products in the past and I guess this is one of the items I can not use. But it was very moisturizing and felt very smooth going on, absorbing quickly. I would recommend it to a friend!"
left my skin well hydrated and moistureized and soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually don't use a night cream, but this one is lightweight enough to feel clean, not greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using Burts Bee products for years. I luv the naturalness of the products and how they maintain my skin. I use several of their products and am very happy with the results.
Burt's Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream. This was just awesome. Wore it to bed. Went on great. went into skin great and woke with soft supple skin. Incredible product!!!
"I absolutely loved this sample! It was lightweight and very silky. It made my skin feel amazing. Sadly, it's a little too pricey for my taste but overall, great product."
I received my sample of Burt's Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream in my Wal-Mart Beauty Box and I absolutely love this product.It was simple to use and I love the results.Royal Jelly is an amazing ingredient and I really love this product.
I am a huge fan of Burts bees. I love the fact that they are a natural product that you use some ingredients you wouldn't think of in skincare. I love the way they make my skin feel and how well they work
I love getting my Beauty Boxes! I use all the products that are provided but some are better than others. Any Burts Bees products are great and I used the sample and then got the product at Walmart.
I received this in the Wal-Mart beauty box and it felt so good going on my skin. I would use this again just to see how well it works in the long run. It was creamy but did not clog my pores and it did not have an overwhelming smell to it.
Received a sample in my recent #walmartbeautybox. Smells wonderful and very rich....makes my face feels so soft. This product is a keeper in my daily skin regimen. Love Burt Bees products for years.
I received a sample of this product in a Walmart beauty box. I had no adverse reaction to it and it did deliver on its claims. However the product was quite heavy on the skin and did not absorb all to well.
"I love this night cream. It goes on smoothly, blends nicely, and doesn't leave a greasy feeling after. I use on my combination skin, and I just love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a sample and added it to my small stack of night creams. I finally checked it out and applied it. It smelled great, didn't affect my sensitive skin, absorbed into my skin evenly and quickly and made me feel very moisturized and comfortable. I can't wait to get more and try other products in this line."
I love this product! It takes only a drop for your whole face and it feels super nourishing and not greasy at all! Love it!
"Love Burt's products. Nice fragrance. Not greasy, worked well for my oily complection. Went on smooth."
"It was great to try a new product by Burt's Bees. It is amazing on the skin, helps heal dry cracked elbows and does not break out my skin."
I have always like Burt's Bees products. This one applies easily and leaves the skin soft waking up.
I started using this and noticed in just a few days that my face was very soft and nourished. Great product!
I have real sensitive skin and this doesn't work. Other Burt's bees products are good but this one didn't.
I've never been disappointed by a Burt's Bees products. They come at a fair price and a product you can trust to get the job done!
I like this cream very much. I used my coupon to buy some for a friends birthday. It is going to be hard giving it up though!
"It has great texture and makes your skin softer, but is expensive compared to Other moisture's that I use, ie Ponds, Aveno, L'Oréal etc"
"I liked this product and enjoyed the scent. However, I was a little reactive to it and it gave me a small rash."

Love love Love... This is an awesome product. Which I always love Burt's Bees products but this one you just have to try and see for yourself!!!!
I love almost all Burt's Bees products and this was no exception. I just wish it wasn't so pricey. Other than that I'd highly recommend!
This is the only brand I can use and I use this one on days my skin is not as dry since it's lighter
"This night cream is thin in consistency, did not absorb very well. I liked the scent but it made my face burn really bad."
"My skin was left feeling smoother. However, I didn't find that it was much different than other night creams"

"I love Burts Bees products very much, the fragrance is amazing."
"Better than some, not as good as others."
I tried this for several nights and I really did not care for it. Left my skin oily feeling.
I like this product but not as much as the Palmer's Coconut Lotion.
This product is wonderful. Totally got rid of my dry skin after just a couple of uses. Love it
This felt so nice on my skin I liked it a lot . I would buy the full size of this product .
I like how easy it is to apply.
This product leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.
