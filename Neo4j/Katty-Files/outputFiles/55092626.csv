"I've tried a lot of moisturizers; especially lotions designed specifically for dry skin. In comparison to other hydrating lotions I have to say Cetaphil's Daily Hydrating Lotion takes the cake. It's my new favorite! I've noticed a significant change in the moisture of my skin; it's super hydrated and it looks great. Try it out, you won't regret it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have dry skin and this is incredible. It does not feel greasy. Absorbs light well. But my skin feels hydrated and healthy. Good quality and value for a daily lotion.
I Would recommend this lotion to a friend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I was really nervous about this lotion because it comes out on the thinner side and most of the time that means it will be sticky. But this left my skin so soft, nothing was sticky about it and it absorbed into my face quickly. A little bit goes a really on way. This is my new favorite Cetaphil face lotion.

I received this product for free to try and i loved it! The gentle non greasy formula is great on any kind of skin. I would recommend this to anyone with any kind of skin. Does not weigh down the skin or clog your pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this for about four or five months now and it works great!! It is not too greasy and it doesn't clog your pores yet effective enough to keep your dry skin hydrated and glowing! I'm glad I took a chance on this because my skin is very stubborn and not many lotions work well on my face. Good stuff!
I LOVE this moisturizer! Perfect for my combination skin and it is one of the only ones without spf! SPF irritates my skin plus I work nights so I don't need it. Please don't change this.

This is one of the best moisturizers than I've ever used that's available from a drugstore. It does everything that claims. It's been over thirty days of use now and I've had no adverse reactions and I can honestly say they did not miss my more expensive moisturizer. It didn't have any fragrance or unpleasant fragrance for that matter. It absorbs pretty quickly and works very well underneath my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I used this mostly in the morning because my face would tend to be more dry during the day. This goes on so smooth and absorbs quickly then leaves your skin feeling like there's nothing there. After about 3-4 days of use, you will see a lasting difference in the appearance of some lines and crow's feet. My skin looks smoother, plumper and less dried-out. Definitely reccomend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i like that the lotion has no fragrance and my skin appreciates the moisturizer.
"I've been using this moisturizer for a few months and love it. I can put it on right before bed and not have to worry about it rubbing off on my pillow because it soaks in my skin so quickly. And my skin feels super soft after using it. Best of both worlds, very moisturizing and super lightweight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

What can i say about Daily Hydrating Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid i have to say i have very dry skin but my forehead is very oily and let me tell you this works miracles very hydrating keeps my skin feeling soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great lightweight moisturizer that can be applied before makeup in the mornings. It's not too heavy and most importantly, it doesn't make my skin break out or cause weird reactions. The only thing I would change is if the moisturizer had SPF so I would not have to apply multiple products for sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly I'm not a big fan of lotion, but this one's nice and I typically put it on at least once a week. It matches with all their other products like their face wash and their scrub and it's nice to kinda just after you wash your face maybe just moisturize it with the lotion I know I do that before going to bed and I notice a big difference in the way my skin feels [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I find that this product does moisturize my face. However I find that it is very liquidy and doesnt seem to keep my skin moisturized as long as I need to. It's cold and my sensitive skin gets very dry. I would prefer to use this as a light moisturizer in the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I HAVE TRIED SOOOO MANY FACIAL LOTIONS, BOTH DRUGSTORE AND HIGH END.FINALLY I FOUND ONE THAT HAS KEPT MY SKIN HYDRATED WITHOUT BREAKING ME OUT. I HAVE OILY SENSITIVE SKIN AND THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. I BOUGHT 4 SINCE IM SO FREAKED OUT THAT IT WILL DISAPPEAR OFF SHELVES. GREAT STUFF!!!"
"I love the fact that cetaphil has made a face lotion for dry skin , I still can't believe how good it works even when it's oil free. I'm also glad to see that it has no spf the other face lotion with the high 50spf was to much for my skin but this is just right! I hope cetaphil keeps this one in stock"
"I have combo/ very dry flaky skin. My skin is acne prone and extremely sensitive and I usually have to use plain butters and oils on my face as store brand anything tends to break me out or dry me more. My skin has been so dry and peeling lately I got desperate and decided I'd take risking bumps over peeling. I settled on this and I'm in literal heaven. No breakouts, no flakes, no redness, just calm skin. It also takes so little and leaves a great soft feeling behind, no sticky or oily feel. Thank you guys so much for this product."
"I love this lotion so much!!! I have very sensitive, acne prone skin and this lotion does wonders to my skin. I does not break me out and doesn't irritate me. I have spent so much money on lotions that only cause my skin to break out I'm so glad with this product, that I'm buying more to keep it in stock. Thank you Cetaphil for such a wonderful product!!! Never discontinue it please."
"This is THE BEST lotion I've ever used. It's oil free, lightweight and feels like you're wearing nothing. I usually have a hard time finding lotions that don't look oily on my skin, but this fits the bill. I have oily, sensitive skin prone to breakouts and this is the best lotion I've ever used under makeup. LOVE IT CETAPHIL!"
My skin gets so dry especially in the winter months. Ive tried many moisturizers and they don't seem to be enough. But this lotion does that trick. I love how it is for extra dry skin and it seems to work. When I saw this new lotion I bought two so I can have an extra one in stock. They were very hard to find at first but now they're everywhere! I just hope that Cetaphil will come out with more new products. Keep it up Cetaphil!
"Please keep making this ""dry, extra dry"" lotion. It hydrates slightly better than the original moisturizing lotion from Cetaphil. It is super light yet hydrates my skin! It does not leave shiny residue, nor does it have scent/ fragrance. Love it. My skin soaks it right then and so far no breakouts nor pimples. Perfect for problematic and sensitive skin. A new ""holy grail"" in my bathroom cabinet."

In the winter my skin gets incredibly dry. I've been using the Daily Hydrating Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid for a few weeks now and I can really tell the difference. That tight feeling I had when I got out of the shower is no longer there. And I can tell the difference in the appearance of my skin. The glow has returned! I'm a huge fan of this lotion. It's making a difference for me this winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My son, my daughter, and I have been using this lotion daily for a few weeks, and it is wonderful. We all have pretty dry skin on our faces and this has worked wonders.

"I like that I am able to apply makeup after using this day hydrating face lotion. My face doesn't feel weigh down or heavy. I have combination skin and have no skin irritation from using this product for almost a month. Right now, I am in the fall/winter season and I need a slight heavier moisturizing fay cream due to the cold weather. But, this day cream would work for me for spring/summer seasons. Overall, this day cream is a great value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was already an avid user of Cetaphil moisturizing cream so I'm aware of the benefits, however, this daily hydrating lotion formula is a lot lighter and easily blends with all my serums. I'm happy with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of the only moisturizers I've found to be both moisturizing enough for the dry parts of my face, but it doesn't make the rest of my skin oily. It's really deeply hydrating but soaks in fast -- it doesn't sit on top of your skin like other moisturizers seem to. I usually apply BB cream afterwards, and it goes on nicely with this moisturizer. I'll keep purchasing this product until they stop making it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this hydrating lotion with Hyaluronic Acid. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly without leaving my face feeling greasy or oily. I have combination skin with a couple of very dry patches and this lotion along with the other Cetaphil facial products have virtually eliminated them.

Great moisturizer for the skin expecally if you have very dry skin . I use this product in the morning and at night before I go to bed so when I wake up my face will be moisturized.

"I really wanted to try this product, being as I have extremely dry acne prone skin. I expected it to be very moisturizing but I wasn't too happy with it. It however didn't break me out which is good but not very hydrating for me."
"This product turns up under Normal/Combination Skin: it is too thick and heavy, even used sparingly. Is there a Cetaphil moisturizer without sunscreen that is actually for normal/combination skin?"
This stuff is awesome. So smooth and soft No stickiness or oiliness! Removes the flakes! And no zits! My skin has never been so clear. If you have problem skin this stuff it GREAT!
"I'm a man and I have dry skin and this stuff is great. It's light, and absorbs quickly without any stickiness. It doesn't feel like a moisturizer but has the effect."
"I have sensitive, acne prone skin, and this is the only face lotion I have found that does not cause me to break out. It has a thin consistency and does not feel oily. Absorbs fast. Nice product."
"I received this full size bottle of Cetaphil Hydrating Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid to try for Free; For my honest review and opinion. My review and opinion is 100% my very own. I received it from TryItSampling and BazaarVoice. I love it. It locks in the moisture. It's non greasy, instantly hydrates your thirsty dry skin on your face. It's fragrance free also, so even if your skin is sensitive, you can still use it. And the best of all, you can wear it under your makeup everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in love with this daytime moisturizer. It's really light, so it absorbs well and doesn't look greasy under makeup. The fragrance was super light, and it was light enough that it didn't make my skin sweat off all my makeup. Even in Florida. This stuff is fantastic!

I don't use face lotion as often as I should so I figured I'd give this a try. It doesn't leave my face feeling as soft as I'd like it to but it does feel slightly more moisturized than usual and a little less dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this face lotion since I have very, severely dry skin. It looked promising and not cheap. However after many nights of use I saw no difference in my face, as if I did not put any moisturizer on. I would not recommend this to people with very dry skin. If your skin is slightly dry, it may work but nothing above that."
"My face tends to get oily from a lot of moisturizers. This one did not leave my face feeling oily! It's a nice lightweight lotion, free of scents. I apply this in the morning after washing with Cetaphil foam facial wash. It leaves my face moisturized, but not oily. My make up goes on great over this lotion, too!

This winter my skin has got really dry. I was looking for something that was not too heavy for my face.
This was the product. It is very smooth to the touch. Once you put it on it is very lite as well. I do not feel like I'm wearing a mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a nice smooth lotion, very soft on the body and gives a silky feeling to the skin. It is not as thick as other lotions which can be a plus or a minus depending on your preference; the looseness gives it a liquid feeling to it, but it's also not cakey either. It blends in well with the skin, so it won't feel like it's there very long after you've applied it. A great offering from a reputable brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face has been getting drier and drier, and this has been helping tremendously. I leave it next to my toothbrush to remind me to apply every time I brush my teeth!

"While this lotion was easy to use, it was just like every other lotion that I would use. It moisturized my skin just fine. There was no unique-ness to this product but it does work. I wish it had a smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have sensitive skin and this product worked well for me. I did not have any breakouts or reactions to it. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a nice moisturizer that soaks in quickly without being greasy. Pa fall and winters can really wreck havoc on my skin so I usually add a moisturizer to my daily routine. I feel hydrated after using and it has yet to create new breakouts which I'm prone to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's very runny and it doesn't hydrate my face very well.
"i love this moisturizer! i have dry skin, a little bit oily on my t zone"
Love Cetaphil products been using them for years. Day and or night.
Have been looking for a good gentle (safe for sensitive skin) moisturizer for months. This is light and gives my face a glow.
This is by far the best product otc it instantly hydrated my skin without leaving it wet or oily. A little goes a long way.
"I have dry acne prone skin. This product is actually really thin and watery. It kinda feels like you're putting Aloe Vera on your skin. However, my face does feel moisturized and not oily."
Moisturizing my face very well. I would recommend this product definitely.
I usually don't use a regular moisturizer. I'm a fan of BB and CC creams. I do enjoy using this for days I don't wear make-up and my skin feels fresh and hydrated. My daughter even started using this lotion in the mornings. We just wish it had sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this after reading rave reviews stating how wonderful it was. I have oily skin that is also acne-prone. I am 48 years old. This moisturizer doesn't moisturize at all. It's simply a light, unscented lotion that doesn't do anything. I was hoping for that smooth, velvety feeling you sometimes get from a good moisturizer. This isn't the one. You'll get super light moisture, at best."
Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion with Hyaluronic Acid is amazing. After washing my face wash I put on my hydrating lotion and my face is perfect. It's lightweight and easy to apply and drys quickly and not sticky at all. And my face doesn't feel like I have a moisturizer on my face and that's what I love about it.

I have extremely dry skin and it leaves my face very hydrated and soft.
"Does not clog pores and as always, very gentle for sensitive skin!"
"It's lightweight, and hydrating without being sticky."
Awesome after shave lotion. Not greasy. Very hydrating.
Completely transformed my extreme dry skin to dewy moistured skin
