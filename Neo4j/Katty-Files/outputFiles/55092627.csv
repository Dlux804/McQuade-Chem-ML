Bought this product on a whim after noticing that my skin was getting drier and more red with the cold winter air. I noticed a huge improvement in my skin within the first few days of use! My skin is less red and more moisturized during the day. Definitely a great product for anyone with red and/or sensitive skin!
"My skin is insane. It is extremely dry, acne prone, red/sensitive, and allergic to some fragrances and preservatives (phenoxythanol in particular gives me hives and is in almost everything). After a lot of trial and error I found this to be the best redness moisturizer, and the price is unbeatable. A little goes a long way and it seems to instantly soothe redness and irritation, I think because of the niacinamide and caffeine (which is a vasoconstrictor). I really hope cetaphil continues to stock this product! :)"
"I need an affordable fragrance free moisturizer that's good for sensitive skin. I also want niacinimide and ceramides in the product. The Cetaphil meets that criteria and works really well for my sensitive skin. It keeps it moisturized and hydrated, with no reactions."
This is an amazing lightweight moisturizer. I deal with autoimmune issues that cause skin issues and have used homeopathic and other brands. This is now my go to. Love that Parabens and fragrance are being removed from the product line.
"This is the absolute best face moisturizer ever!!! I LOVE the way it feels, it's lightweight but moisturizes amazingly, there is NO SMELL, some face lotions give me a headache from the smell, and best of all it is rated a 1 on the Environmental Working Group website for not having any toxic chemicals in it. It is, by far, the absolute best moisturizer ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I noticed a difference in my skin the first night I used this product. Extremely soft and creamy and instantly smoothing. I have redness around my cheek area and I noticed how calm my skin is. I wish they offered more than1.7 oz but a little goes a long way.
"I love this new moisturizer from Cetaphil. It has so many good ingredients for your skin, and it still feels so nice and lightweight! Can't even imagine going back to what I was using before! THANK YOU CETAPHIL!"
LOVE THIS! it works so well for my dry and sensitive skin! The only complaint I have is that the bottle is so small. Please Cetaphil sell it in a bigger size bottle!
I had the worst acne and i picked at it and made it worse. It was a big red irritated spot and I was mortified. Put this product around the spot and in two days it was gone! Yeah..love it
I love this product a lot but i have to give it three stars because of the size! It is much too small and a complete waste of plastic to have to constantly buy. I was disappointed in cetaphil for reducing the size of their products in an apparent effort to get people to have to purchase them much more frequently - which you do end up having to do if you use a product like this every night.
This is the perfect night moisturizer. I love it. Don't change a thing. It is not too greasy or oily or thick but also not too light. It is perfection.
this stuff is amazing. it helps counteract the drying of my face from the acne medicine I have to use to keep from breaking out. I use it only at night and I wake up with soft skin and it doesn't make me break out like many moisturizers do..would recommended this product if you are sensitive to breakouts and need something to counteract over dying from acne cream.
I am so happy with this product it really works great
This made my redness worse and my face break out. I have had rosacea for many years . And I trusted the cetaphil name so that the reason I bought this and the face wash .. they both ended up in my trash . Sorry cetaphil I was hoping this would work..
"I try this for only two nights!, and my skin is amazing! The redness gone like magic.im going to buy the rest of them."
Feels wonderful with no unwanted scent or greasy feel
I love this stuff! Makes my face so smooth and healthy feeling
"I'm really disappointed in this product from Cetaphil. I used their regular moisturizers for years and they have been a fantastic value. Unfortunately, the redness relief moisturizer needs some improvement. It moisturizes the same as any other moisturizer but it didn't do anything to reduce the redness on my face (recently diagnosed as rosacea)."
This moisturizes my face very well with no irritation on my sensitive skin. It smells nice but not overly scented at all. Its smooth & silky but not greasy. I have dry skin and this moisturizes it very well. I mainly use it at night right before bed. I keep it on my nightstand. I wld use it during the day. I will definitely reorder when I run out of it.
"While it may have relieved some redness, it certainly was not a very good moisturizer. I will not purchase again."
Moisturizes without a greasy build up or a any irritation.
