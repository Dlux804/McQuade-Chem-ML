So far I am pleased with this cream. I love how easy the press down pump is and how it is conviently located on the top of the unit. This cream applies so smoothly and has a nice subtle scent. I have applied the cream 2x per day and have seen some slight improvements. This product does suggest pairing with an SPF 30 due to certain ingredients that increase your skins sensitivity to sun. Certainly a product I plan to continue the use of and also one that I do recommend trying.
I have numerous brown spots on my arms that I would like to lighten. This Skin Brightening Dark Spot Corrector is something I really like. It is lightweight and not greasy at all. Smells fantastic. Comes in a beautiful clear plastic jar with a cool dispensing lid so you don't contaminate the entire jar. Just push on the top and a small amount will dispense. Covered with a clear lid to keep clean and prevent loss. I have only been using a short time but I can see a few spots on lighter. Will update after a longer amount of time.
Shipping was very fast. Product arrived in great condition and security wrap was easy to open. The smell is heavenly. it comes in a push pump jar (a lot bigger than what I thought it would be. the cream is very thick and luxurious feeling. Be careful how hard you push the pump because a lot will come out if you push it hard. it says to apply a thin layer twice a day for best results. Fingers crossed!
"The cream has a pleasant fragrance. It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly. I used the product on 1 dark spot for 1 week, applying once a day and included a before and after photo. The photo on the left is before and the photo on the right is after 7 days of use. The spot is visibly lighter. I am pleased with this cream and going to start using it on other areas that have dark or uneven skin tones."
"My wife Loves this cream,3 days after using she sais she noticed a difference already The cream smell nice and it leaves a pleasant feeling on the skin"
Love how quick it arrived and it smells wonderful! I have started using it and anxious to see the results!
Great product. It has a nice smell. I love how easy it is to get the right amount. The container has a pump action and you just lightly press down on it. It did not burn as i put it on and wore it. Worked well!
I love this creme! I've tried so many spot bleach creams and nothing helps. My cousin told me about this one because I have so many spots on my forehead and hands and this actually removed so many spots It smells so fresh and clean I love the pretty bottle and the pump works so easy unlike all the others Thank you
"I'm glad I got this product, for years I had problems with some dark coloring on my armpits and bikini area, although I tried this with my armpits, it's not really suited for that I don't think. it's definitely suited for the bikini area, I saw lighter tones within a few days. Had a pretty good experience!"
Love the push down applicator. Very easy to apply. Not sticky and smells nice. I have some dark sun spots on my face and after using this for a couple weeks they are noticeably lighter. I will continue using this on the other spots I have found on my leg and hands.
"This actually works great so far. Very easy to apply, has a wonderful scent, and I have seen a slight difference in a small amount of time. I can't wait to see the full results. But I have seen a slight difference, so far so good! Packaging is really nice too. Would recommend."
Easy to dispense container. Pleasant fragrance. I have been using on my face to lessen dark spots. Already using less foundation to coverup. Pleased with product so far.
I love the consistency and how well it is absorbed into the skin. it lightened the dark lines on my elbows significantly. Just make sure to follow directions and use sunscreen if you are in the sun to see better results.
So glad I tried this cream. The tone uneveness and dullness was an issue for me. This cream began to smooth away these issues within the first week. It goes on easily and smell really nice.
I had the start of age spots on my hand. Its not too bad but it bothered me. This skin brightening cream has helped! I have been using it about a week now and I can certainly tell that the dark pigmentation is lightening up. I am pleased wirh the purchase of this product!
"Absorbs fast, leaves skin smooth, not greasy. Smells really good. Pump is perfect for one handed dispensing."
There is no oily residue. The smell is very nice and it leaves your skin soft. I have noticed a that my dark spots are staring to get lighter.
it is working. it took about 2 weeks to see the results but now I can see it is working.
Great product ! My skin is looking better already! Good price. Smells nice and luxury packaging.
