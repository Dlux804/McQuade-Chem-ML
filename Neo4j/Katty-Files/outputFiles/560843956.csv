I accidentally put this review for a different product. So I guess I'll to rewrite my review here. This cream is thick but goes on light. Practically unscented. Only used two weeks so no drastic change yet but I've noticed lightening of the pigmentation on my cheeks. I'll report back (if the system will allow me) after I finish the bottle.
"I truly love this product! It really improved with the complexion of my skin. My skin felt really soft, and this product left a natural glow to my skin. I used it almost twice a day, for 2 weeks and within the first week my dark marks started to fade. I 100% recommend this product for people that want fast results for their skin!"
"I used this product for about 18 days now and the results are ridiculous. My dark marks have faded so much. I usually have light splotches on my lower jaw, but now I have a really even complexion. I recommend 10/10. (Disclaimer: takes about 2 weeks to see strong results!)"
"I have been trying this product for two maybe three weeks now and overall, I love it."
"Their facts are THE fact. This product delivers!! Normally, i stray away from products that give you a time span to see a difference because everyone's skin is different and more than likely, they went with the shortest time span. In this case, however, I eat my words. The product is tea. Which disclaimer: The product does have a thick consistency (if that matters)."
This product has become apart of my skincare routine for the past few weeks and I have definitely seen a difference in my skin since! My dark marks are slowly beginning to clear up and I barely bother to put on foundation now !
"I started using this product about three weeks ago, and have absolutely fallen in love with it. It is gentle enough for my sensitive skin, and has not only faded my dark spots, but also SERIOUSLY brightened and evened my skin tone. Absolute 10/10!!"
It has made my skin so much more radiant and has brightened up my skin as well! I've been using the cream for a few weeks now and I'm still satisfied!
This product is life !! My dark marks started clearing up within a week of usage !
The product has my skin glowing! I've used it for 3 weeks(applying twice daily) and I can truly see a difference of my overall complexion and dark spots. The cream has an amazing texture but a little goes a long way. My face feels hydrated while staying moistured for the full day!
"This is the first time I've noticed such dramatic results from a skin product so quickly! In less than two weeks my face was noticeably clearer. Also, it doesn't make my face oily or dry but keeps it perfectly balanced which honestly is amazing in itself, especially at that price! I will forever have this cream in my cabinet."
I've been using this Face Cream for 3 weeks now and It's GREAT!
"After reading most of the review about how this cream works so well, I decided to try and got really disappointed, this cream did absolutely nothing for my face not even a single dark spot faded nor got any glow from this cream ,will not recommend neither will I purchase again"
"I have always tested and bought your products. Satisfaction is guaranteed. I ordered this for my granddaughter and ""wow"", I can already see the difference. Thank you keep them coming."
I bought this product 2 weeks ago and I'm totally in love with it
I've been use this product all of May! It is my favorite from the new products! Alllll of th√© claims are true and I've seen an improvement (mainly) in the overall clarity & radiance of my skin !
"I have meduim skin tone and have a hard time finding a BB/CC cream that matches my skin without looking orange. So, I opted to try this product instead. This is better than any BB/CC, or primer I have tried. People actually think I'm younger than my 43 yrs now. Feels amazing too all day. Thanks Palmers"
Palmer glow cream isn't working on my face or the two masks. Could I get a refund?
"I've been using this Face Cream for about 2/3 weeks now, and my dark spots are basically non-existent! I can't wait to see what my skin will look like after a month. My face feels smooth and rejuvenated after using the Water Lily Face Cream!"
"So I've been using these product for a little over a month and I'm really pleased with the results! I have so much trouble with skin pigmentation and dark spots, so I'm glad I was able to come across this product to help. The cream is a little thick so be careful!"
This product worked really well in correcting my dark spots just in a matter of days! I applied the product after cleansing my face and the thick consistency helped my face feel moisturized throughout the whole day. I would recommend to not use a lot because often times it does leave excess bits of the white product on your face and seems like it's shedding. Overall I am very pleased with my experience using this product because of how fast my dark spots are fading!
"I liked the product, but I noticed that my under eye was a tad bit puffy and itchy. I now just use it on the parts of my face that are discolored, and it works well! I've noticed the discoloration has gone away and my skin is more radiant. I would recommend it, but just be careful near the eyes!"
Love. Love. Love. You're not going to regret using this.
"The product does exactly what it says it will do. If used correctly, you will see results! I'm addicted!"
I have been using the Water Lily Face Cream for three weeks and I can say my dark spots have faded! My skin feels smooth and soft! I highly recommend this to everyone!
"I've been using this product for a little over a month and I can DEFINITELY see a major difference in my skin. My dark spots are fading away and I have more of a natural glow. I used the product twice daily for about 4 weeks and my skin is smoother, more toned, and glowing! I made a GREAT decision to get this product"
I've been using this face cream for the last 3 weeks. I was targeting the dark circles around my eyes and BABY!! It's done the job. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish it wasn't as thick however it still gets the job done. Check out my instagram for real results @themelaninaire
I absolutely love this product! In just two short weeks I have been able to see a huge difference! My skin is more even and clear! I am so grateful for such a bomb product! I 100% recommend the water Lilly face cream! Hurry and snag some for yourselves!
I after using this product a couple of weeks ago and I definitely see improvements in my skin. I suffer from hyperpigmentation and usually get dark marks in my forehead area and I've noticed complete fading of the dark spots. My skin also has a very natural glow. It's thicker than any other moisturizer I've used so you truly only need a pea sized amount.
"I have have been using this product for a little over 2 weeks and I have already seen results in my tone, dark spots and overall evenness of my skin tone. What really surprised me was the change in my texture, my skin is soft and velvet like and I love it ! I would recommend this to anyone with hyperpigmentation, acne scars or dry skin!"
"This cream has helped my skin bring a natural glow. I use it two times a day, and I am impressed with the results I have seen in just three weeks!"
I really like this face cream and I can definitely tell a difference in the appearance of my dark marks on my cheek area. I get a lot of compliments about my skin now and I feel confident when I don't wear makeup.
I have been using this periodically over the past weeks leading up to my college graduation in order to get my skin prepared and it literally helped give me the most glowy looks! Love!
"This is my third week using the line and I'm 100% in love with the consistency, how it feels on my skin, and most of all the actual results I've received!"
"Since I started using this product my skin has been moisturized but not greasy. My dull skin has become radiant and glowy, ready for the suns rays!!! I recommend 100%"
"This new cream is a great edition to my skin care routine, I love that the absence of harsh chemicals does not interfere with the effectiveness of this product. I use it twice a day and I've seen a major difference in my complexion!!"
I absolutely love this product! It work so good for me and it's completely worth every penny.
