"This product came on time and as described. The scent is very light, so perfect for me with my scent allergies. Using for some dark areas on my underarms and I am seeing results. Gentle enough that I plan on using on the dark spots on my face as well."
"I've been using this on the top of my hands and arms and it has helped to minimize how dark the spots were - I am normally very thin skinned so the dark spots were easy to see. I really like how this smells, and how smooth and hydrating it is as well."
Works amazing ! Arrived before it said it would arrive. The results of the skin lightening you can see with in a couple of days !
This lightening cream works great on the freckles and dark spots that I have gotten from years of sun and tanning beds. I have already noticed quite a bit of difference already.
It works as expected. Gently lightened my dark spots. I made sure my skin was moisturized all day before applying so it wouldn't be so sensitive.
"Still using, don't see the result yet. It takes a little time"
