"I use it in the morning after I wash my face & put moisturizer on since I have dry skin , especially in the cold months. I do the same at night. I love this product."
"The Laura Geller primer under make up is extremely amazing! This product gave an excellent base for my foundation. There were a couple times I didn't use foundation, but it still gave stellar results with my blush. It left my skin soft and smooth. I love how it leaves my skin lookin smoother. I would definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used different primers from different brands and some are okay some horrible, this one...AWESOME! I am totally in love with it. It is so easy to apply unlike others I've used before that is pretty creamy and heavy. This one was more on the watery side which makes it easy to apply with my fingers. It drys pretty quickly. I left it sit for 30 seconds before applying my foundation. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had never heard of this product until now but I love it! I've already recommended it to tons of friends. It's super lightweight and really hydrated your skin! I definitely see purchasing this in my future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is of course a great premakeup primer. The one thing this primer does better than any other is that it is a great moisturizer. It keeps my skin feeling super smooth. I would definitely buy this again, I wish I had known about it sooner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is always a hassle for me to create an even moisturized finish without the flaking on my dry skin. After trying spackle daily for a week I've found it to be so hydrating to my skin. It is the perfect consistency for neat even application. It leaves a smooth finish everytime. Blotches of dry flaking skin no more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used Laura Geller primer under make up. This prroduct provided a good base for make up. I loved using this because it left my skin soft and velvety. It also worked to provide a even canvas for whatever I applied. Would definitely use this again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great primer, easy to apply, glides right into skin and smooths out your face. The texture is creamy and light, leaving a great canvas for make up. Holds up nice under make up, hasn't sunk into fine lines or make the make up cake up. I would highly recommend this primer and will be buying more once out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This primer was a decent size which is nice. It applies smoothly and evenly. I do wish that it had more evening out than it did. Foundation was applied on top and looked good. I prefer primers that have a more velvet feel but this one overall works well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product feels natural on my skin. I love the way my make up looks using this primer. I have loved the results every time I use it. I will recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm relatively new to primers, but this one really smooths out my skin. It's a little heavier than I would like, but when paired with a mineral foundation it feels and looks great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with this sparkle, it made me want to put on a full face of make up and look my best. It covered everything and made me look gooey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love how this makes my skin feel. I will definitely be buying more when I run out. I had never heard of this particular product before, but I am so happy I got to try it. It is nonirritating to my skin and left my skin so soft and silky. I have a red undertone to my skin and I wear make up every day. Quality is important to me and this product is spot on.

I've been looking for a good hydrating primer for awhile since my makeup makes my skin so dry. This primer really hydrates and leaves my skin with a natural dewy look especially around my eyes and cheeks. What I like most is that it doesn't make my skin look oily or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love to use the Spackle treatment hydrating make up primer everyday. It works well with my skin. It is silky and smooth and it is really moisturizing without being greasy. My skin is so soft and it doesn't clog my pores. It makes my powder foundation last longer throughout the day. Overall I am very satisfied with this primer and I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product to review, all opinions are my own. I have been using the Laura Geller primer for about a week now. I love that you can use this on it's own and under foundation. The product goes on nicely not to thick. This primer makes my foundation last all day. It's a great find for sure! I usually am a Mac girl but I am really digging the spackle. My friends love it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this primer. Because of this crazy winter weather my normally combination and oily skin is super dry. I loved how this primer hydrated my skin but also helped fill pores. It doesn't feel like silicon and if more like a moisturizer. There is absolutely no scent which I appreciate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this Laura Gellar Spackle Treatment Hydrating Make Up Primer! It smooths out my imperfections and helps my make up go on easier and smoother. This primer also helps keep my make up on longer! I can't wait to tell my friends and family about this and I highly suggest you try thos product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Was very impressed with the outcome of my make up, I feel great, it's smooth on my face and glide easily , just little quantity used, my make up did last longer,definitely will be using this on my daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received Laura Geller spackle under make-up primer a few days ago, and I love it!! Compared to other primers I have tried, this one by far works the best! I was not aware of the Laura Geller line of products before receiving this one, but I will be purchasing again. I would definitely recommend this line of products to everyone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It felt lightweight against my skin and absorbed quickly. It provided a nice base for liquid foundation and kept my face feeling moisturized throughout the day. The only downside is the squeeze tube format, which makes it difficult to dispense the proper amount. Too much product comes out at once and ends up wasted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I definitely love this primer. You can feel it hydrating your skin. Some primers feel like they are suffocating your skin and this one did not feel like that. It was a more of a refreshing feel. I put my foundation on over it and it looked even and not cakey. My makeup looked natural and how it should. I highly suggest trying this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love love love this primer! Before trying it, I assumed all primers were created equal but that is not the case! This primer makes me skin feel so soft all day long and helps to improve the look of my foundation. It also does not have an odor or make my sensitive skin break out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Primer is so important; however, it can be hard to find the right one, but this may be it for me. I love how it makes my skin feel and keeps my makeup looking fresh all day. I got it in the winter when everything is always so dry. This has hydrated my skin and makes it feel soft again instead of dried out. Absolutely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this primer. It's hard for me to find a good primer that doesn't make my face look greasy. This is very moisturizing and doesn't have a strong smell. I have heard of this brand but not this specific product. I will be buying this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a big fan of this product. It's silky and smooth and is really moisturizing without being greasy. I can tell it makes my mineral powder foundation last longer throughout the day. It feels more like a light moisturizer than a primer, but that isn't a bad thing at all. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like using the hydrating primer after I clean my face in the morning. It goes on very fast and dries fast which is a must. I do not use any moisturizer with this as it has a moisturizer mixed with it. My completion looks very clean after I apply my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love it! It is definitely hydrating, I am in a really cold season and cracking skin is not fun, specially if applying make up. This product delivers and I love it, plus you can also use it by itself... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this make up primer. This primer is very hydrating and goes on great. Its perfect for my dry skin and my foundation looks amazing when I wear this make up primer. My face is glowing every time I wear this make up primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently bought the laura geller sparkle hydrating makeup primer & I have never been so disappointed in any product before. I would never recommend this product or this brand to anyone in general. This product did not only acidically burn my skin but also my sisters and one other person I told about this product.
This was ok .> just cant make sense of what it is supposed to do [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Best primer I've ever used. I have desert dry skin and this makes my makeup look fresh! so happy it made it to the drugstore!!
"I really like to use the Spackle treatment hydrating make up primer, it really works well with my skin so far I'm not having any break outs like before when I didnt use primer. So far so good!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This primer is decent, it seems more like a moisturizer then primer which is a bummer it also doesn't go on as smooth as I'd hoped. Not sure I'd purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love using this. Never used any primer before so glad I got to try this. I'll never go without it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Laura Geller Spackle makeup primer is great. I love how it feels on my face. I already told my daughter about this product. I don't need to touch up my makeup during the day with this primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product as directed and it went on greasy and left a sticky feeling on face. Even after applying foundation my face had a wet look. I also dislike the glittery glow it gave my face along with the greasy feeling.
I have combination skin so I don't necessarily need a ton of hydration but I< br />absolutely love this primer. It feels like another layer of moisture on my skin and in the freezing Boston winter this is much appreciated! I'm not sure it does very much for making my makeup last longer but I think it definitely gives my skin a more hydrated and even base to begin applying makeup on top of. Also it has never pilled on my skin the way a lot of silicone based primers do and it absorbs super quickly ... win win my book!
"I have only recently started using primer based on recommendations by friends. I tried out the Spackle hoping it would help with my dry skin, having never used this brand before. It went on well and I tried to make sure that I didn't use a lot, based on other people's reviews with the product. My makeup glided on and I personally had no issues with the primer. I rubbed into my skin then waited for it to dry. I really like it and would definitely recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels moisturizing and set a great, light coat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Living in Arizona hydration is important. I have tried many products this is by far the best. Whether I use it with or without any of her other subsequent products my hydration in my skin his improved 100%. I also use this on my neck in and to the top of my chest area. the hydration and the skin has improved 100%. Being a nurse I also use small dabs on my arms in my hands. This products is fabulous it's good all over your body's skin (would NOT use on feet)
I would like to take a moment and thank you enough for this amazing product. I have dry skin n it get more dry around my mouth n nose n cheeks area. This primer works wonder on my skin. It creates a beautiful canvas to use powdered poducts easily with out being dry or caky. Luvvvv it!
I received this in gift box from beauty brands and this is the best primer under her foundation. It is absolutely wonderful ! Iove all of the products I received and I am absolutely excited that I found a makeup line that makes me look younger and healthier! I wish I could but every single product that she makes! I have told every female I know! Buy it you will not be disappointed!
During the winter my skin gets unbelievably dry to the extent that any foundation I use cracks and crumbles and no makeup has a pleasant finish on my face however after I started using this product my skin actually cleared up a bit and my makeup looks flawless. Thank You Laura!
This is nice as I like the moisturizing factor. I received in a sample kit and sure nice to have. It's one I will go for more often. May if I ever need it be in here yet if not will I would think..I read one lamenting it was out of stock. High demand to add moisturizing factor and primer in one....one less step. Easy.
Poor primer my neutralizer color correcting spackle does not do the job .it is far too wet and watery feels like I put nothing on isn't there a spackle with some real correction in it ? this Is my fist spackle product and I expected something with more substance in it.
Love this primer. I am 53 so I need a moisturizer before putting on makeup. This is absolutely not greasy allows my makeup to go on very smoothly. Works much better than my daily moisturizer at preparing my skin for makeup.
It's a great primer and does help hold my makeup on but the hydraulic acid in it feels like it's about to burn me and tingles on my face if I apply more than a certain amount.
I got this primer because my skin is very dry and sensitive. Every single time I use this primer it literally burns my skin away. It feels as if I have a sunburn and then my skin peels off for a week or longer.
I've never had such a bad experience with primers! It was super watery and once I put my foundation on 30 mins. after it disappeared my foundation. It literally looked like I didn't put any foundation on!
First time ordering spackle but have been wanting to try and wanted to love. I don't like writing negative reviews but I found this spackle awful. Feels like cheap greasy moisturizer Did nothing as described.
I have tried primers by Smashbox Urban Decay MAC Bare Minerals It Cosmetics & KatVonD and none of them came close my beloved CoverFX primer but this one....is the runner up.
I loved it and bought it at Ulta or Syphora when it came out. Not sure if it said Hydrating or not. But a little does go a long way and it's ALWAYS SOLD out and glad I could find it at which ever store I was at! (Thank gosh their both close to me!)
I find this primer to be moisturizing and my make-up glides on smoothly. Please keep in mind that a little goes a long way. Some might find it watery because they could be using more than needed. I highly recommend it.
love this product.......feels great on your skin make up goes on nice and smooth. Only need a little about the size of a dime.
This is so smooth and soft and effective! I sometimes even use this in place of my moisturizer before applying my makeup if I am short on time. A++!!
This product moisturizes and primes beautifully. I like that it provides two steps/products in one. My LG concealer and B&B foundation just glide on.
Very hydrating! Help foundation and concealer glided on very smooth
Searching for a while replace a primer that I could buy wholesale frustrating this works great
cannot live without this product under my make up. cant wait to try the others
I love this for Winter and even in the Summer I barely use moisturizer!
