When I first opened the jar I noticed the smell which is lovely, light and not over powering. The product seemed thick but it goes on effortlessly using very little product.

I got this L'Oreal product as a voxbox from influenster to test. I like how this moisturizer has a tent to it it makes your skin color look more consistent and even. The only thing I do not care for is that because it's an exfoliant it tends to follow up into little pills. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Rosy Tone Moisturizer is working very well for my combination skin. I enjoy the added moisture since the winter chill has wrecked havoc on my face. Am very happy it's not too moisturize and adding to my daily routine is simple. I just dab on a little and even use on my neck. After two weeks my skin feels soft and has a pretty flush. I was worried with my rich chocolate complexion it might look ashy but it soaks in and leaves me looking well rested not shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"It has a nice scent, a little thick, slightly greasy (caution if you have oily skin) but absorbs quickly. My skin feels moisturized and works very well under my makeup. I enjoy it best at night after cleansing my face when I feel dry the most. I don't know about the claim of “restoring the skin's rosy tone” since I am a person of color, other than that I like it. l received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just purchased my second container because the results from the first one were just awesome! My skin looks smoother, it feels smoother and softer. Use it twice daily and with a serum at night, it really doesn't take much as it is very rich. I've paid much much more for moisturizers that didn't deliver the results I've seen in my skin!"
"I have been a walmart customer since 1996. Ever since I started shopping online, which is much later, I find most of walmart's products good. However, of late, it seems to me that whenever I order cosmetics, I am sorely disappointed by the quality as they seem like rejects. The L'Oreal Rosy Tone Day Cream packaging was squished and the cap was broken. The bottle itself looks old. I will return it to a store. I have found another online store which expedites things to me in brand new condition."
love this product. hate the glass jar. I accidentally dropped it on my tile bathroom. floor and it shattered glass e everywhere. the product now is full of glass and I cant use it! wish u could consider a different package instead of glass. accidents happen but pls dont use glass containers. 3 stars be cause I paid good money for this product and it broke before I could use it.
"This is a rich moisturizer that has a rosy tone, but it doesn't really leave a strong color. It makes your skin look refreshed, nicely moisturized, and ready to apply makeup. I like the way it feels on my skin. I received this moisturizer free from influenster in a recent voxbox for testing purposes. This opinion is my own. #influenster #voxbox #lorealparis [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! I've been using it every morning for a month. It is a thick moisturizer but absorbs quickly and leaves your skin looking healthy, beautiful and very soft. I wear it under makeup and it plays well with whatever I put on top of it. I received this product complimentary for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this would be a good moisturizer for my mature skin with the added benefit of a little pink tone. I don't really like to wear foundation every day. But the product contains mica. So there are minute little sparkles in it. Putting sparkles on my face is not my idea of ""visibly youthful, healthy tone"" for my ""mature, dull skin."" So I'm disappointed and will be returning it. It would be great without the sparkes."
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Rosy Tone moisturizer is a REALLY GREAT product! I'm is my upper eighties and it seemed as though my skin was becoming more difficult to look healthy, no matter what moisturizer I used. L'Oreal's rosy tone did the trick, my skin looks healthier and smoother. Its even good for my morale! Barbara"
"Using 2 other Loreal (collagen/anti-aging) moisturizers and bought this to try the rosy tone feature. Like the creamy, non- greasy, non-oily feel of it. Glides on. Skin bounce is good even by afternoon, product lasts on my skin most of the day. Good for a $20 cream. Impressed with Loreal and ask them to continue to have ""fragrance free"" products. ."
"Pleasantly surprised. It goes on soft and smooth. No shine whatsoever, the rosy tone is wonderful, perfect for my skin tone. It has a slight rose fragrance which is wonderful. No itching, burning. Will order again."

"Every time a new product comes available, I just have to try it. I am in my early 50s and desperately looking for that miracle dream to turn back time. This product proved that my skin needed moisture. It smelled good, nothing artificial or funky. It absorbed completely leaving no residue. I didn't notice a rosy tone to my skin. The only reason I didn't give it more stars was because of the thick texture. I received this product complimentary for testing."
I am 52 and have dry dull winter skin currently. I also have very sensitive skin. This product made my skin feel smoother with a healthy pink glow. And the best part is that it did not irritate my skin.

Better than I thought it would be. I don't normally use drug store skin care but I received this for free from Influenster for review. It had a very nice consistency and it improved the look of fine lines around my mouth and forehead. I will finish using this and consider purchasing.
I received a complimentary voxbox for testing purposes and I am so glad I did! My skin was dull and lackluster. After using this product for a week I noticed my skin was brighter and actually had its old rosy glow. A little goes a long way and it went on easily and didnt leave a heavy residue. Bravo L' Oreal!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster and was asked to review it. I'm 53 and have average skin. I honestly didn't notice any difference after using it. At first the pink color threw me off. It didn't smell awesome either. I hope it works for someone else. I did receive it complimentary so I'm happy for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried loreal rosy tone moisturizer daily for a week and so far I am really loving how it works. Lot of moisture and the rosy undertones do really make a difference in my skin's appearance.

"I received this from Influenster as part of my Voxbox to review and I have to say, this is one of the best products I've ever used! It absorbs quickly and it really does impart a beautiful rosey glow - I even had a coworker comment on how nice and glowy my skin has been. I don't usually use L'Oreal skin care because in the past I've found them to be too heavily fragranced, but this has a very light, fresh scent that I can handle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about two weeks. The texture is a bit weird—kind of like a mousse-y makeup. It feels nice going on, and I think my skin looks good and feels hydrated. It might look a little pinker. This is a daytime moisturizer, but it doesn't have sunscreen, so I probably won't use it on a long-term basis. It's also not cruelty-free. I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free for testing purposes and it is not a good fit for my skin type. I have been applying it daily for about 3 weeks. The rosy tone is a bit too much for me as it makes me look like I'm hot all day long. In addition, my skin starts to feel oily by early afternoon. It does go on smoothly and has a mild pleasant fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this from Influenster to test and review. I really wanted to like it, but I don't. It went on easily, but it felt so heavy on my face. The next morning I washed my face and it had a waxy feel. This waxy feeling lasted for a week. Not what I am looking for in a facial moisturizer, but I'm going to try it on my elbows.

I received this from Influenster for testing purposes and I really like this. It's a thicker moisturizer but absorbs beautifully Into the skin.

"I loved the way this cream smells! It leaves your face smooth. However, I will only use it during winter as it is a bit too heavy for summer. I also wish it was a bit easier to apply as is a firm cream and it takes some work to sooth it on the face. I think is a great cream if Loreal can improve the consistency a little [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have used this cream for over a week now and I must say from the beginning my skin felt smoother but as I kept using the cream I could see the glow that my skin had lost and I have received many compliments on my skin especially when I'm not wearing any makeup.
