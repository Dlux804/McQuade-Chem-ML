Iâm one of those people who has to do the 10 step Korean skincare just to keep my face clear. Everytime I add a new product to my routine i end up breaking out for a week before I clear up again. When I started using this I figured I would breakout on my cheeks which is my most acne prone area (I have combo skin so i need this for the dry parts of my face). Iâve been using thia for a month now and i havenât had any breakouts. Even my sensitive area has been perfect. I canât wait to try more from this brand!
"I like the sublte melony scent. Leaves the skin soft, not oily or greasey. Absorbs pretty fast. Lightweight and gentle. Did not cause breakouts on my senitive skin. so far so good"
