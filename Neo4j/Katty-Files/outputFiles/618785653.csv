"The burts bees hydrating gel cream with royal jelly, was grat for my normal skin. Very hydrating, and smoothinh. I used daily for about a week and could see a slight difference in ny fine lines, they seemed more plump."
"The only con I found is it is marketed as a gel cream, and it was pretty watery which application a bit messy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's so light and itdoesmt clog my pored. I use it after I clean my face with miscellaneous water [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Still on the search for a good moisturizer. I liked the ingredients and price point, but my face felt dry and tight after using, even after two coats. If it's too hydrating, my T-zone gets oily. If it's too lightweight, the rest of my face feels dry. The search continues! Maybe I will try their night cream next!"
"When I use the product it is amazing but when using my makeup afterwards, it is as if it fell as when you peel off and I drop all the product, I do not understand if I have to use it in a different way, but that makes me not use the product because I use makeup."
"I bought this today with very high hopes, as I love Burt's Bees, but I am left feeling disappointed. Just seconds after applying, my face is burning and breaking out in bright red splotches. I'm not sure what could be causing this. No other facial product that I have ever tried, including other brands, has caused a reaction like this on my skin. I have attached some photos showing my skin reaction. I love Burt's Bee's and I'm just disappointed that this product caused such a reaction."
"I know I've read some reviews where users think they're allergic to certain ingredients and I am going to add myself to that list. Red splotchy patches, a mild skin burning sensation, and watery as heck eyes. The worst part is I tested this out on my arm and had no reaction so I thought I was fine. Has anyone figured out what exactly it is? If it helps at all, I really like the consistency of it. Wish I wasn't allergic because I think I would have liked it otherwise. Oh well."
"This was included in the Burt's Box. I have dry skin and was skeptical in its thin consistency. But, I can certainly tell s difference. It's also nice as it dries and that's a plus in hot, high summer humidity. There's no greasy after feel. The somewhat slime consistency is fine. I apply in the morning."
"I was traveling in Colorado last week, up in the mountains, and found I had forgotten to pack moisturizer. I bought this product in a pinch because I have confidence in the Burt's Bees brand. It is non-sticky, seems nourishing, and leaves my skins feeling mysteriously refreshed. I plan on adding it to my face-care routine"
I absolutly love this burts bees hydrating gel cream with Royal jelly. As i just turned 40 my skin is starting to show that age! Living in a hot dry climate my skin is in much need of hydration!. I used this hydrating gel every other night after cleaning my face and neck. Gently rubbing it in so my skin soaks up all the product.. My face has never glowed so much and felt so smooth.I can feel the skin tightening . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I decided to try this because I wanted something new. My skin is sometimes oily, so I classify my skin as combination. The texture/runniness of the product didn't bother me because I know it isn't really a cream. But, this dried my skin out a lot. I would wait a couple of minutes after applying the product, but my skin was still really dry. It is winter, and where I live is also fairly dry, so this did not help my skin out at all. Kind of disappointing because I really love Burt's Bees, but I guess I will have to try another moisturizer from them."
Best gel ever! my skin has never felt better! my skin drinks this up if i use the micellar water before hand. but this penetrates deep into my skin and plumps and moisturizes without being greasy. i noticed immediately after first day use my neck wrinkles immediately plumped and made my skin smooth and bright.

I recently purchased the night and day cream because I was excited about the royal jelly ingredient. Unfortunately these products left my face feeling dry and my skin is starting to break out due to lack of moisture. I really need to find something else quick....
"This nourishment gel is watery when you open it and didn't appeal to use it. But after using it, it keeps my skin moisturized for whole good day. Keeps skin healthy. I have acne issues but using this has not worsened it but it has nourished my skin. I would recommend this for daily usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is great for moisturizing oily or combination skin. It's a gel so it doesn't leave behind a greasy or sticky residue. It works great under makeup to provide a smooth finish. It smells great and I believe it does help to make skin look more radiant and youthful. I really enjoyed using this product and will continue to use it. My skin feels so soft and smooth, and I can tell it looks more radiant since I've been using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like that it absorbs quickly while still hydrating. The consistency is strange adn kind of snot-like. My two main gripes is the jar packaging makes it so I have to dip my fingers in every time which is unsanitary. I'll probably depot and put it in an airless pump. But the main reason I won't repurchase is that it doesn't layer well. I use this as a mid step in both evening and at night. It layers terribly with other products like sunscreen and makeup ad causes it to pill.
I was so excited to finally have a daily skin care routine and bought like 10 products from Burt's and bees and so far this is the worst one I bought. As soon as I put it on my face turns red and hot and itchy and my skin feels dry for a while and then it feels moisturized and my skin calms down except for the itching. The itching never goes away. The night hydration cream doesn't do this to me so this just has poor formula. Super runny too. DONT BUY!!! Super disappointed... and it cost me a pretty 18 bucks
"I bought this at the store because I was looking for a natural moisturizing product. It is quite liquid and thin and goes on easily. However, I've been using it for several weeks and haven't seen any noticeable difference. Also, it leaves a film. Family members have raved about Burt's Bees products and I really wanted to be happy with this product, but it's just so-so. I'll keep looking."
"I have oily skin, but tend to dry at times. I try to stir away from oily moisturizer, esp during summer time, so I thought Id try this. I think my skin prefers gel over heavy creams. So far, this has exceeded my expectations. Some people complain it being watery, but its just perfect for me."
"After using this almost every morning for a couple weeks, I used this morning and suddenly developed a rash across my face. Afterwards I did a test on my wrist to confirm that was the problem. I'm assuming it's a reaction to the royal jelly but I don't know. I don't really have any skin allergies. It may work for others, but not for me!"
"Been using this ""gel cream"" for a month now."
"Not impressed at all. It dries stiff and has enhanced the appearances of wrinkles around eyes. Gel like, yes, but does not have a cream consistency nor absorbs. It just dries to a stiff and uncomfortable film on skin."
"I bought this product thinking it is an improved version of Burt's Bees Skin Nourishment Night Cream. To my huge dismay, the consistency is too thin and watery and it has a funky odor once applied on my skin. It doesn't hydrate my face at all after washing. The Skin Nourishment Night Cream is the better of the two."
I was suffering from contact dermatitis using another product and when I got this product from the stores. I immediately used it. I had used so many products to help nourish my skin back to health that I was feeling hopeless in my situation. Overnight I saw my skin get healthy and the next day I saw my skin get smoother. My contact dermatitis is slowly healing.
I am so sorry I wasted my money on this gel. It is really disappointing. I don't think I will be able to use it at all. It dries out my skin. It is also hard to use. It is too runny to be in a jar.
"My skin is extremely sensitive. Have tried so many Top brand moisturizer creams that break my face out. I HOPE they never stop making this! LOVE IT! Perfect moisturizer, NOT oily, absorbs WELL!"
"I wanted to love these Burt's Bees products, however, this gel did not hydrate. It sat on the top of my skin and as a result, my foundation application was a mess."
I just tried this product last night and am also having a reaction to it. About an hour or two after putting it on my face and neck were itchy and my face almost looks like I have I slight sunburn. I love your products but this is not a keeper.
I bought this product because I had not been able to find your night moisturizer which I have used and love. This gel cream feels very dry and after using for a couple of weeks my skin feels awful. Definitely won't use again and hope to be able to find your royal jelly moisturizer again soon.
"I originally purchased this after running out of my usual face cream. I have dry/combination skin that is practically dehydrated in the winter. It practically did nothing for my skin except get rid of most of my ash appearance. And I typically had to reapply a second layer. Maybe I could use this in the summer, when there's more moisture in the air."
I really wanted to like this product and tried to like it but unfortunately I did not. I felt as if I needed to keep putting more on in order to to feel some moisturizing benefits but all I felt was sticky. I love Bert's Bees products so much that I thought it was my skin that was in serious trouble but it wasn't at all. The sad news is that I would not recommend this particular product but I still recommend there other products. Sorry Bert!
This product is very runny in the jar making a mess when first opened and I find that it doesn't do much to mosturize my skin. Not even 5 min after applying my skin feels dry. The product seems to work well as a primer for the makeup line but I was looking for a product that mosturizes without sunscreen in it. Would probably work well with really oily skin or just as a primer.
I thought the product would be thicker but its very thin. It has a light pleasant scent and does not feel thick or greasy on skin. A small amount works for the entire face and neck area. I have seen a major difference in my skin over the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Burt's Bees Hydrating Gel Cream with Royal Jelly. At first I thought that it would take a while to dry because of the gel cream thinner consistency, but it absorbed quickly, and dried easily, leaving my skin soft, but not greasy. My skin feels soft and hydrated all day! Although I did receive a free sample for testing purposes, my opinions are sincere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It made my skin a bit dry to begin with (for an hour or so), but moisturized for the rest of the day."
Absorbs quickly! No smell.
"I love everything about this product. It is perfect thickness, smells good, so soft, and makes my skin feel amazing!"
I love it ❤️❤️❤️. Lightweight. Absorbs very quickly. Good moisturizer
"This gel is so lightweight and non greasy! I apply it at night or in the morning, it soaks in quickly and is great under make up. The smell is wonderful, fresh and citrusy. A little goes a long way, this jar will last quite awhile. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combo skin and I use this as one of my hydrating steps followed by their oil on top to seal. If you want to be even more moisturized you can follow that with vaseline/aquaphor/cerave ointment to prevent water evaporating overnight. I love gel textures because it doesn't clog my T-zone up especially now that I'm on tretinoin. So pleased with their new products!
"The skin nourishing gel leaves your skin refreshed and hydrated. I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause me to have a reaction or leave my skin wanting more hydration. It is quite thin and does cause a bit of a tingle when first applying, but dries quickly. I would use this product at night and not under make up or foundation, as it could cause it to peel or wear off easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product!! I was looking for a natural moisturizer that wasn't wasnt oily, and this is unlike anything I've tried. I love the watery consistency because it goes such a long way. It smells amazing, the packaging is endearing, and I am thrilled so far."
"I was looking for a hydrating cream because I was going on holidays, and I had tried lip balms and was looking forward of trying a cream from Burt's Bees. I had a hydrating gel from another brand that I love, so decided to try this product instead of a cream (almost convinced my sister to do so). When I opened it the consistency was surprisingly liquid, not hygienic at all if I have to dip my finger, and the smell is not so nice. I do feel the effect, but I do think I'd be happier with the cream"
"I was so excited for this product because I love all BB! I was super disappointed. It's so watery, and like a kind of lubricant. It's so wet and then just kind slowly dries...I don't recommend. I live in a dry climate but this is not hydrating. I want it to be so bad. I'll just stick with the night cream."
This is my first time ever using a Burt's Bees product outside of their lip balms and I must say I'm really impressed with this product. I don't usually like to use moisturizers because I'm oily and most moisturizers make my face extremely oily but this one didn't and I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked it is was very moisturizing. I a little surprised by the consistency I had thought it would be more like a cream but it very light when I tried it on. I like that it is made with better for you ingredients. I would definitely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first opened the container, I thought great another watered down moisturizer. BUT I was pleasantly surprised! A little goes a long way with this gel. It didn't dry out my skin and afterwards my face felt soft as EVER! I would definitely recommend this product for someone who wants a lightweight and simple face moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love this gel formula because it soothes and calms my skin and adds a lot of moisture. I like that it hydrates my skin to help it look and feel great, but doesn't feel greasy. This is great for nourishing your skin and something I definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I always struggle with using any type of moisturizers on my face due to my sensitive skin as they usually cause a breakout. But Burt Bee's Skin Nourishment Gel is a great moisturizer without leaving any residue or greasy feeling behind and NO BREAKOUTS!!!!! Pretty impressed!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product did not break my skin out at all. It feels super hydrated and soft after use! I love that Burt's Bee's brand is all natural and use amazing ingredients instead of chemicals and preservatives! I definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry or combo skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
All I can say is wow. This skin gel is absolutely amazing. Very natural smell. Not strong at all. The thing I love so much about it is it's not oily and it makes my skin so so soft. Because this is mainly natural it made me feel even better about putting it on my skin. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination skin type and I love that this product really hydrates my skin and smooth my dry patches I love the consistency of the product reminds me of coconut oil I really love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This hydrating gel is an amazing moisturizing base I prefer to use it in the morning under my foundation so my skin stays hydrated all day. It is very liquidy but it comes in the cutest little jar and the product works amazingly so if you need a good daily moisturizer I highly recommend this one it works like a charm and doesn't leave a heavy feeling at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a different type of facial moisturizer then I'm used to. It's light weight and does dry matte. I used this at night after using many hydrating products before and it did great. Since my skin is dry in the winter I would use this in the summer when I'm more combination. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow i loved this product, I wasn't sure at first about the jelly feeling, but i loved it on my face! It makes your face feel so smooth and soft, and the smell was good! I loved this and will be buying this product again in future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is fantastic!!! As someone who has combo oily/dry skin this worked like a charm!! It doesn't smell hardly at all which is nice. It is super fast to absorb into my skin which is wonderful since i use it at night before bed. It didn't leave my face feeling sticky. After a few days i could really tell the difference in my skin problem areas. Love this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This feels great going on my skin, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and absorbs quickly. And after using this daily, I do feel that my skin feels softer."
I bought this a couple weeks ago and every time I've tried to put it on it stung terribly and left my face all red. This wasn't exactly cheap and I regret buying it.
"This is crazy, it is truly a gel, which is at first odd, but it works nicely. I liked how cool it felt when applied, and it absorbs nicely and leaves your face feeling very moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this was okay, but very slippery.... I don't know that I would buy this again. I didn't feel like it moisturized my skin well in the winter months [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I purchased this moisturizer looking for something that would give me intense hydration. However, after applying my skin felt very tight and dry. I eventually stopped using the product because my skin broke out from dryness. After spending so much money on a product I had higher hopes!"
"This gel moisturizer is something I'll be keeping in stock for sure! A little bit of this stuff goes quite a long way, just one dip into the jar with my finger and that's all I need! I can see this lasting a long time. I wasn't sure how well this would perform on my skin, as it's quite dry during the winter but it's done a great job at keeping my skin hydrated and supple! I can see this also being an excellent summer moisturizer for me! I experienced no irritation at all with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have oily skin in my t zone and despite that this product doesnt feel like it's greasy in any way on my skin!
I have a sensitive Skin and i love how this product has a very mild perfume. It soothes my Skin perfectly!
This nourishing gel was very soft on my skin. It didn't leave a tacky feel and wasn't too heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
