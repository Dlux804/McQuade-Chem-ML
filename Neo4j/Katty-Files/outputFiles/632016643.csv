"I really like this lotion. I got it for the salicylic acid in it, which is just fantastic as a lotion- it's more like a facial treatment than a cream, and it's great for any acne or dead skin. Don't waste money on a steam facial, just put this on after a shower and it's the same thing."
The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because when I first started using it it made my skin feel really oily how ever I've been using it for about 3months now and my skin has gotten use to it. It did fight my acne and my skin is way clearer now it also helped my eczema that I had on my nose so over all it's amazing because I don't deal with the excess oil anymore and my skin looks glowing clear and overall spectacular
"i have used the clean and clear brand for years and i do use the walmart brand often, they are just the same. it is a lightweight moisturizer that works great"
"I have moderate to severe acne. I've went through so many products. At the moment I'm using a cleanser with 5% BP & this. The first couple of days it only got worse. On the third day, I decided I should maybe massage it into my face. Now, after about a week, I have to massage it into my face and then after 5 minutes cover my face with it (and not rub it in). This has been doing an okay job, but I still have many zits."
"I usually buy clean & clear and I know the off brand names usually work the same so I tried it. I didn't notice it right away I figured since summer my skin would normally get oily but this is just ridiculous. I had to rinse and dry my wash while I was at work because I was so oily, and I was still oily so I washed my wash after work with a cleanser. Other then be oily it has done it's job it cleared my break out. I paired this with the equate AM Refreshing Facial Cleanser."
"I'm usually all for buying generic over name brand, and usually the generic is just as good as the name brand. That was not the case for this product. It's very watery when I dispense some in my hand it runs down my hand/fingers like water. I feel like I have to just a lot for my face feel moisturized. I have normal skin with no issues."
"It seems to be new packing and also new ingredients. My previous purchase was thicker, this is too watery"
Halfway through my first bottle. No problem so far!
This has a very strong unpleasant scent. It is also greasy and leaves my face looking shiny and oily. I threw it away after a few uses. I will not buy any more Equate facial products.
Very thin and watery.
"I started using this product about two weeks ago. I wanted something that wasn't greasy or cause acne. The one thing I've noticed is the small blackheads appearing all over my face. I never had an issue with blackheads before, only a small zit once in awhile. This is upsetting because I love how the lotion makes my face soft without that greasy feeling. I may have to discontinue using it if the blackheads become more prominent."
Love the way it moisturizizes my face
"Best for quick results! Put it on every morning, does the job fast!!"
"I have very sensitive skin, so buying this was an experiment. It's store brand and it's fabulous! I have NO issues with my face getting red or blotchy... nothing like that. I am glad I made this purchase. It's worth the money."
"I love this moisturizer!! Very cheap and smells great! Really helps with my acne and makes my face glow and smell great! I usually apply it once a day, but lately I've been doing 2-3x cause I love it so much! Doesn't make it feel oily! I have dry skin so it really helps! Hope this helps someone else!"
"I previously used the name brand that this product is compared to. The consistency is nice, it does not leave a residue or an oily feeling after application and lasts all day, but the perfumed smell is not bearable for me. I'll use the name brand for this product simply because of the smell."
I bought this bc my skin is oily in the summer and this was the only oil free moisturizer i could find at Walmart. It has a nice consistency and leaves me feeling moisturized. The smell isnt the greatest but its not off putting either. I cant say how it works on acne as I only get an occasional breakout during my period.
Smells like old used cooking oil. Not pleasant at all. Almost like a hospital smell. The clean and clear version is worth the extra 50 cents.
The lotion is thin and hard to apply. The top of the pump broke the first time I used it.
Great refreshing product for your face and amazing scent
Smells like fruit loops
very good
