I love the way the whip goes on with no oily feel after. It covers well and truly makes my skin softer to the touch. The added sun screen also is in it so one less daily add product. The cost is fair and always available in store or on line to order like I did. Shipped right to my house in excellent packaging. Thank you'
I love this product! It's smells so nice and I love how it makes my skin feel so silky matte! And it also covers your pores so when applying your makeup over top of the moisturizer it's flawless! I highly recommend it for everyday use before bed and also during the day! Diane H.
"I've been using the night time regeneration cream for years and finally tried this cream with spf - especially since it advertised matte finish. I have oily skin and it does not leave my face matte, more dewy. I've tried this with my foundation alone and with my usual primer - it works both ways! I have noticed an improvement in my skin in just a short time- been tempted to skip the foundation with just some powder (again, oily skin). Definitely recommend!"
"I have been searching for a moisturizer that will moisturize dry areas, while not breaking out the oily areas. I wanted to feel as if I hadn't put anything on at alI, one I could wear under makeup daily and at night. All of this seemed a tall order as nothing worked, no matter the cost. The skin advisor tool suggested Whip Regenerist.This moisturizer is by far the best product I've ever used. It does absolutely everything I wanted and leaves my skin feeling better than I could have hoped."
I bought this expecting to see a lighter feeling face cream than I had been using. I have used Oil of Olay face cream for 50 years and have never had any problems with its texture. This new jar with the “whipped” label is rather disgusting. It is much heavier more like partially hardened coconut oil. I am not happy with it being called whipped when it doesn't resemble “whipped”.
"I was given a trail size of this to try. First let me say that before trying this product I didn't really have a face routine other then normal washing. But after using this product I would like to make it apart of my new routine. The only thing I wasn't to happy with was after being outside it made my face feel a little on the oily side. Other then that i loved the feel of it. It has a light smell to it, but nothing over powering. It went on smooth. I would buy the product to use."
I've used regenerist whip for a few days and I am very disappointed with the way it makes my skin look and feel. My face feels greasy & looks shiny. I never had this problem with other moisturizers. It says it is oil free. After seeing commercials for this product I couldn't wait to try it but it is definitely not what they describe on tv.
I bought this because I thought it would be great for my skin while at the beach. It felt thick when I put it on my face. And while applying my foundation it made my makeup ball up. I had to wash it off so I could apply my foundation all over again. Even after applying the Olay whip I even waited an hour to put on my foundation and it still balled up. Won't be buying this product again. I will take it back to the store.
"I've already been in love with the regenerist line, so I was so excited to hear the Olay whips came out with an SPF25 version! It's light, airy, and absorbs into my skin without looking oily or shiny. It wears great under makeup too! I highly recommend the regenerist whip SPF25! Thanks Olay for sending this my way."
"I honestly can't recommend this sunscreen enough.  It gives my skin all the protection it needs, while moisturizing like nobody's business.  It's rich and creamy yet absorbs super quickly so you're left with this magical glow that leaves your face soft, smooth and dewy.  An absolute must-try for those of you looking to up your skincare game!  Product provided by Olay, but all opinions are my own."
Olay sent this to me and I love how smooth it is! It makes for a great makeup base. It's lightweight and doesn't make my skin feel greasy. I love that it has SPF so I am multitasking when I use it and don't need to use another separate SPF product! I definitely recommend trying it out!
"I have used Olay for years I always kind of laughed when I saw the advertisements on TV or in the magazines because I had never put anything on my face. When I did try moisture's they just felt like a mask had been put on my face. Olay on the other hand, felt light, wonderful. Because of my financial condition I have not been able to purchase the cream, so am very pleased to receive a free sample. Thank you, and my face thanks you."
I always wanted to try this product. I don't like putting on moisturizers because I can't stand the greasy feeling it leaves on my skin! I always have to fight the urge to wash it off IMMEDIATELY!! I received this product as a sample and it was the BEST THING I EVER DID! I absolutely LOVE this product and it's a must have!! THANK YOU OLAY!!!
"It's deceptive when the box is 1/3 empty space, so what integrity does the product have? The bottle is more appealing than the box so do away with the box. This reduces trash and transport costs and ultimately my cost. If the 1st ingredient is water, is that something I can add post purchase? To post comments I had to agree to terms and conditions. There should be a link there for terms/conditions and include disclaimer that Olay doesn't sell my email."
"I've received this product for and honest review. This face lotion is too perfume. My skin type is combination, after applying the lotion on to my face, my forehead were very oily, luckily I did not get any breakout. My skin texture didn't change to my knowledge( better or worse). Overall it was just ok. The price is high for me, for what I consider just ok. I won't be buying it when it run out."
"I was a little hesitant to try this product due to the price. However, I received a sample size jar (from another retailer) and after trying it decided to get it in the SPF version. I am a week shy of my 62nd birthday. I am somewhat happy with how my skin looks as far as wrinkling is concerned, and I don't really expect miracles from any product I use. I basically want my skin to feel soft and also any moisturizer I use to work well under foundation. I feel like this product fits the bill and the SPF is an added bonus."
I would love to try this. I have heard it is really good wrinkle remover. I really need help wih wrinkles and my face needs to be revitelized.
Love how weightless and soft it feels going on! I drive a Topless Jeep all spring/summer/fall in the Midwest and don't get sunburned on my face! LOVE LOVE LOVE
"I use this product in the morning but at night as times. As I get older (41) my skin tends to dry, this helps restore my skin to a softer & youthful look."
I was thrilled to find a moisturizer that worked well without being greasy. To find one with sun protection was fantastic! I use this moisturizer and skin protection daily with excellent results.
I am 63 years old and my face is very oily. I tired many moisturizers and it made my skin more shinning and oily...I use this product once and my face and neck look fresh and smooth..looks like I had a facelift...I look 20 years younger.
"I love this product so much, I'm a total Olay convert and started using Olay face wash. Love it too!"
"I like everything about this product, So great to have moisturizer and sunscreen in 1. And not greasy, very light feeling."

"Not worth the money. Even with a tight lid, the product evaporated or dried up easily. Other light moisturizing spf creams such as Aveeno are better quality for the money."
"This is the BEST product that I have used, and I am so thankful that Olay finally formulated their cream with a SPF 25! This product is perfect for my lifestyle and delicate skin. Thank you! Please DO NOT discontinue this cream.....ever!!"
I have always perfected Olay and I have been using for years. The last couple products I trip one being the Regenterist Whip beads up on my face after a while and turns into complete mess....I started using other products one being nitrogen's daily Cleans and creams and I hate it but they tend do also not only be a better product but they also do what they say they are suppose to do to help your skin. Sorry Olay I may have to throw you away for good.
For at least15 years my son's feet itched fiercely under the bottom. We seen our share of m.d.'s. He'd scratch yo bleeding. His feet were always a red horrible mess. In July I was looking for something preferably w/out dyes or petroleum but that had some vitamins in it. I found this. By chance I tried it once on my son. Immediately the itch ceased. I'm over the moon.!!
Im not understanding all the bad reviews? I got this and i love it! Its not greasy its very light an airy and it absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin very softand no after looks of oil laying on your skin. I first got it in the mail as a sample and that was when i fell in love with it. If you buy it just give it some time it isnt a miracle worker.
Amazing product - out performs any other moisturizer I've ever tried. I've tried some very expensive ones too!
Amazing product so light on my skin! love it! and the scent is insanely good:)
"About 4 hours after application, the moisturizer just started peeling off my skin."
I have not tried it yet but I would like to cause all I use is olay. On face and body Thank you but
"Love e product, but the scent is Extremely overwhelming and too strong. Please make one that is fragrance free*"
I received a sample in the mail I noticed a difference immediately! It made my dry 60 year old skin feel wonderful!
"Had to try this cream. Was highly recommended on an episode of Dr. Oz. It's very light, and not greasy. I am really pleased thus far."
Can't wait to bring this to Italy over the summer! Love how lightweight this is - no grease and no mess! (I received compensation for this review)
Olay is the best choice in this world and it looks amazing when you have used this products. Thank you
"It goes on very lightly, never feels heavy or oily, and a little goes a long way. I also love the light scent. I have found my forever moisturizer."
Greasy product. Advertised as matte. Did not play well under makeup. Pores were magnified. So disappointed in Olay. I returned it.
I have been using this for a few days and i can definetly tell a difference already! You do not have to use much at all so it is worth the price because it will last for a long time! Goes on smooth and leaves my face looking more energized and soft!
This is my favorite Olay product. It feels like nothing is there.
"It is fluffy, smooth and soft on the skin. I love this product ALOT!"
"i love the product , and the way it was shipped. thanks"
I have oily skin and this product works great for my skin. My makeup looks flawless
"I have oily skin to begin with and thought this product would do what it says and leave my skin matte throughout the day, however, after a few hours of application I would start seeing a shine and then towards the end of the day my skin would feel like there's a thick greasy coat that I could scrape off. So the product does not meet my expectations and I would not recommend it to people with oily skin. I do not care for the tub container either. Seems less sanitary."
I must say first off I was impressed that you sent a full sized bottle for me to work with. Yet I don't seem to need to use very much of the product each time. However it is so light and airy yet covers the face extremely well. This product is so wonderfully light it dries in seconds . Basically no waiting around for the product to dry yet my face is very soft to the touch. I am in my mid sixties so I use a lot of moisturizer. I will continue to purchase this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the Olay Mist.......it really refreshes my face.
great product. I have used olay products for years and this one is great for daytime
I love the feel of this. It's not heavy or greasy on my skin!
I love this cream them let my skin so soft
light not heavy - quickly absorbed - pleasant fragrance
This feels really nice on my face. After application my skin felt smooth and moisturized.
"It feels so good, and is the best for the price so far."
I love Olay Regenerist whip Face Moisturizer! It nourishes my face and I look younger.
I love this product but buying it from the manufacture is way too expensive
"Been using oil of olay since i was a teenager, am now 60 wouldnt use anything else love it!!"
Awesome product makes your face feel smooth and soft no dry skin no harm from the cold weather or even the Sun
Light weight works smells great love it! It's none greasy! I use the whip regenerouse. I hope they don't change a thing it's perfect!
"I got this lotion as a sample in the mail hoping this would work for me since I have sensitive skin and have trouble finding the right products for my skin. I was surprised that I had no problem with it. My skin felt very soft, no redness, no irritation, no discomfort. Im so happy that I was able to find something that worked for me."
I bought this due to all the amazing reviews it was getting and I was not disappointed! The texture is amazing and the fragrance is light and not overwhelming. The transformation of my skin has been great. My age spots have lessened and my skin feels amazing
"Not only does this stuff look and smell like cheap conditioner it also feels like it. Sticky and filmy on the skin not at all pleasant. Super bummed I bought it, normally I pass along things that aren't for me in the hopes that someone else may enjoy it... but for this I couldn't imagine passing this buck"
"The product in the jar was definitely NOT whipped. It had a paste-like consistency to it. I did try it. It never changed consistency and went on with some pulling and dragging. Applying liquid foundation did not happen. The foundation grabbed on to the moisturizer and would not blend. I had to wash it all off and start over with my regular moisturizer, I don't know if the product was bad or if it is supposed to be like this. For the money, this was a big bomb."
"The smell is nice, but it felt greasy on my skin. The worse part was how watery it made my eyes. I made sure to only apply a half inch below my bottom lash line, and not on my eye lids. I had to wash my face three times before my eyes felt better. I'm wondering if it's the sunscreen. I love Olay products, but this one I'll have to return."
"Took the ""28 Day Challenge"" with Olay Regenerist Whip Moisturizer and Olay Eyes. Did not improve my skin in 28 days as advertised. Completed the required form for the promised refund, sent it in along with original store receipt as required. Have yet to receive the guaranteed refund for the products. I will say that the whipped feel of the products is wonderful - there is no greasy feel at all as I have found with other skin products. Just wish it would have improved my skin."
"I've never really tried any face products before, but my friend told me to try the olay whips. So i ended up buying the tan one . It leaves your face feeling so smooth and fresh, and it smells good too. I also use it underneath my foundation and it still leaves my skin feeling fresh & soft. I've only had it for a week now but I can totally tell a difference. Well worth my money spent."
"I recently received a sample of the Olay Regenerist Whip Face Moisturizer and I was blown away by how amazing it felt on my skin, the cream felt so light and airy, and seemed to absorb instantly, it didn't feel heavy at all the way some moisturizers do.. Even the scent of this product was light, not too heavy or strong, and it smelled amazing.. I plan to purchase some on my next shopping trip and look forward to using this product.."
"I requested a sample of this cream and expected to love it. The advertising made it sound so rich and creamy. It was watery, not whipped at all. It did sink in right away but my skin felt just as dry as it did before I put it on, maybe even more dry... how is that even possible? Very disappointed and I would not recommend to anyone."
"I bought it yesterday after finding out it also has SPF which I really need for my daily walk. I used the regular whip a while ago. That did it! So that's why I bought this. I put it in this morning. Ooohhhh my it feels light, smooth and soft unlike other moisturizer I use is sticky, bit greasy and icky. It's going to be empty when I use it for my night regime before moving in to Olay night cream very soon. I'm going to stick with Olay for long time!"
"i have been using Okay products for a long time. When I saw the whipped version, I decided to try it. Apply the face cream as recommended, but afterward my face felt right and very dry. My wrinkles were more prominent than ever before. Giving the product a chance, I continue to use it, but finally gave up and threw the jar away. What a waste of money!"
"I don't use facial products due to them feeling heavy and greasy. I got a free sample of olay whip and decided to try it. glad I did. it was light, non greasy, and it hydrated my obviously dry face. oh and left it so soft. I will recommend this to others and will continue to use it myself......thank you"
This product initially feels good going on however while smoothing on my face it tightens up. I tried applying my foundation and found the product did not allow my make up to go smoothly over my face. I could not blend foundation. I had to drag my foundation across my face which caused pulling. Not worth the money.
I absolutely love that this product It smells amazing and my boyfriend noticed a difference (without me pointing it out ) the next day! It stands up to its promises and I use ester Lauder usually for my products that I buy for my wrinkle creams and serums. Not anymore though. Can anyone tell me if the jar like this with added spf is exactly the same besides the added spf ? If it's the same I'm so excited for this because I already love the original.
Do not purchase if you plan on wearing it under makeup!!! It is and okay product to use before bed at night to moisturize but cannot be worn with makeup like the original version could! I love the original version and I'm very disappointed I spent the money on the whip one:(
"I've never used a moisturizer because I've always had skin that is oily. I tried Olay whipped and WOW what a difference it's made in two weeks. My skin looks more radiant, the marionette lines around my mouth are smoothing out and my foundation looks so much smoother with Olay whips under it."
"Smells wonderful. Light, not greasy, goes a long way and it has SPF in it! When used before makeup it doesn't leave me Cakey. I have paired with another layer of sunscreen but I only do that with direct sun exposure because sun dries me out and sunscreen is oily. I would recommend. Going to try their other products Now!"
I am an African American 60+ woman and have been using this product for approximately 2 months. I am beginning to see an improved difference in my skin. It glows and is it not as uneven prior to using this product. I am also using on my neck with hopes that it will help with the gradual sagging.
"I have been using for about 6 months. I can see my fine lines decreasing. Especially on my neck. Would recommend. My only negative is the cap on the inside is hard to open. The first several bottles I purchased had a different cap, it was easier than the newest one. Need to be easy to open !"
"I received a sample of this moisturizer and I must say I'm impressed. It has almost a gel like feel to it, goes on easy and absorbs quickly. It gave my skin almost a mat look when I put it on. I normally have very oily skin that gets worse with a moisturizer. However this product did do that. I was able to wear it under my makeup no problem. And it smells wonderful. I would recommend this product."
"This moisturizer is simply amazing! It's is so very light & airy but a tiny amount covers your entire face. It soaks in your skin immediately without feeling heavy, oily or sticky. Leaves just a soft and clean feeling. You won't be able to stop touching your face! And the smell is awesome!"
"My face is super oily, so it has been very hard finding something that doesn't cause a massive oil slick and make up melt down by noon. This has decreased the meltdown dramatically! I wish they would have come out with this sooner! Would love if it were fragrance free, as I prefer not to have fragrance in my skin care"
"I loved this product; however I have multiple chemical sensitivity and cannot handle any perfumes. After a few days I had to stop using the product. However, I loved the way it felt and I believe if I could have continued use, I could have seen a dramatic difference in my skin. Please consider making a fragrance free version."
"I really like the feel of this on my skin. My skin feels soft, moisturized, and absorbs well. But you must make a fragrance free version. I won't be purchasing until that is an option. I am very sensitive to fragrance and that's always a deal breaker when it comes to skin care."
"I have used the Oil of Olay regenerist for a long time and the serum for about a year. I love the serum and use it in warmer weather because it is light and absorbs quickly. The regenerist is heavier and does not absorb as quickly, but it leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I was really excited to try the whip, but I am not a fan, it leaves my face feeling very tight, dry and mask like."
This product does not disappoint with the light as air effect it has on your face. You know it's working with the gentle tingling all over your face and neck. I haven't even used the product a week and I noticed my wrinkles and fine lines on my face had soften. Love this product and looking forward to trying the other products. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this product but not as well as I like the Regenerist serum pump. I like the results better and it last long because of it being in a pump bottle but the pump on those has issues with working correctly. I have had 2 to 3 bottles that the pump has quit working. I have used only Olay products for about 40 years. The serum has been the best. Can you please send me some coupons?
"Thanks, Lois Jacobs [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would like to confirm the ingredient listing order for this product. The ingredients on the box I have are the same, but they are in a completely different order than they are listed on the product page for the Olay Regenerist Whip. For example Palmitoyl pentapedtide-4 is listed as the fourth ingredient on the product page. However, it is listed as the seventh ingredient on the box I have. Which one is correct?"
"Love this product on my face. Not heavy or greasy at all. I have been using this product for a week now and I can already see the difference. Even my co workers noticed the difference on my skin. I use it day and night. The funny thing is I have my husband 'whip' day and night and his skin has improved so much. The only thing that is missing is the SPF so in the morning after the whip I have to use another Olay product with SPF. So far, my husband and I are loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love how quickly this absorbs and the soft feeling of my skin. Currently, I use the original Regenerist lotion for day and also the night one as well as a few other products. I need to use this whipped, fluffy one a little while longer to decide, but it is so smooth and not greasy I may be switching to it for day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Regenerist moisture cream for many years & I have now tried the whipped Regenerist moisture & can say I like the feel of it! It has a light feeling when you put it on & I find it makes your face feels very soft!
I might add I'm a great believer in Olay products!! Thank for sending me sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It has a soft, pleasant smell. It leaves a fresh, light feeling without an oily finish. As I use this product, I hope to see wrinkles & fine lines diminish."
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 54 years old and have tried just about ever face cream on the market from the most expensive to the cheapest and I can tell you this is THE BEST I have EVER used. It feels so good on my face and after just 2 uses I saw and felt a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What a revolutionary new product! It truly is as light and airy as whipped cream. What amazes me is that it's also SPF 25, not oily or greasy like most sunscreens. Only one negative, I can't get the white top off the jar. My husband had to use pliers. I would suggest a different jar design. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been a longtime user of Olay Pro X Anti-aging moisturizer SPF 25. The Regenerist whip moisturizer SPF 25 might just replace my beloved Pro X! This little gem feels light as air but is super hydrating. My face feels soft and protected. My only complaint is that I wish it were fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a huge Regenerist fan and didn't think it could get any better, but Whip did it! Love the texture, light and fluffy. Absorbs easily and leaves my skin hyradef and feeling great! Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I travel a lot and live in a dry climate where I appreciate a product with more moisturizing effect. This product is nice when I am in humid climates. The only problem I had was that the whipped product stuck to the bottom of the inner cover and it was difficult to remove the inner cover. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I rated this product when I first received it, on initial impressions. But half way through one jar and my pores are closing. My face over all is smoother and has a better skin tone. And it feels so good! I catch my self touching my cheek and wishing I'd had this produce years ago. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this new olay moisturizer. It is so light and absorbs almost instantly. I have been using it morning and night and my skin is so much softer. The only drawback is that there is fragrance. Very light and pleasant, but my skin is very sensitive. I don't seem to be having any reactions as of now, but would love a fragrance free version. This is definitely a buy again. Thank you Olay! I found a new daily moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I pre ordered the product before it hit the market. ( #119 out of the first 1000 jars) I was already using the original Regenerist for years and thought to try the new whipped formula. It is pleasantly light yet JUST as powerful as the original . I truly love this cream and highly recommend it to anyone. ( Oh also it was not a sample nor a free product for exchange of a review. I did this because I honestly think highly of it.) :)
"Like most Olay products, this cream STINKS. I don't know why that won't make their products unscented. For the positive - It has a nice, light feel. It does absorb quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft, not greasy. I was asked to review this product after only having it for 10 days. At this point I have not seen any change in fine lines. While it is a nice product overall, I would not recommend it based on the overpowering scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is so light and absorbs quickly. It was so easy to apply foundation after applying Olay Whips. My skin felt soft and moisturized. I can see a reduction in fine lines and my skin seems more firm and toned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually use the Regenerist micro sculpting cream. I'm not sure if this product has the same anti-aging ingredients as the micro sculpting cream, but it's very smooth and goes on like Olay Complete. A much higher price, however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is AMAZING! It glides on and it absorbs within SECONDS! It dries to a matte finish, so NO more greasy shine! It doesn't even feel like I have anything on my face. My makeup goes on better, and it lasts longer throughout the day with way fewer touchups. I have had so many compliments on my skin just in these last few weeks I've been using the Whip cream. I'm SOLD! I love Whips so much that I preordered the SPF version too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This whip face moisturizer makes your face feel wonderful. Soft and full of moisture and does not feel heavy on the face likes a lot of other moisturizers I have used. At my age I have fine lines and wrinkles and I have noticed a difference in them not being a prominent as they were. I will continue to use this product and even recommend it to my daughter. We are both Olay users and will continue to be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I only received the product about 10 days ago but I love it so far. So whipped & creamy & feels wonderful on my skin. Helps hydrate my face during these dring winter months but light enough to use year-round. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Have been using this product for two weeks now. Find it is very light, not shiny, absorbs quickly, not greasy, my skin feels soft and hydrated, my makeup applies very smoothly over this. Glad it has the SPF"
Need more time to see if there is a reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product is light and easy to apply, and feels nice on. I did not see any SPF protection on the bottle or packaging; so for day use, I use my other Olay spf product on top of this one. I don't see any difference in results between this product and my usual Olay product(s). For me, this would not be a ""have to have"" product. I don't know what the regular retail is so I don't have a value rating for this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels light on the skin. I use foundation, so re-applying every 2 hrs (as directed) doesn't work for me. I use the Regenerist products and love them -- I'm a Sr citizen so deep wrinkles are my concern. I would recommend the"
Whips! Thank you for allowing me to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Haven't used it long enough but I am sure it will be 5 stars like the regular
Regenerist cream. PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE MY AGE. I have been using Olay products for all my adulthood. I think it shows. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i use regenerist mucrosculpting cream. like the addition of spf, spf 30 would be better. nicer smell but prefer unscented. goes on smoothly, so, no pulling. nice matte finish. will need more time to evaluate any differences in effectiveness when compared to microsculpting cream. cannot recommend product without determination of effectiveness.

"I haven't used thus long enough to see any results, however I love how it feels when I apply it then my face and neck. I also live that it absorbs quickly abs doesn't feel at all greasy. I also like that this product doesn't cause breakouts on my face which a lot of products do. I'm hoping it will lessen the same smile lines over then next month [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin felt smooth and cool with a velvet touch. My skin is very sensitive and after cleansing It would still feel a little warm to touch and sort of a little dry. When I apply the whip it starts to feel so cool and smooth. My skin is also protected from the sun even if I am out only for a few minutes. I don't feel dried and hot on my face like I use to. It feels so good on my face, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product smooths on and disappears instantly. I like that it has a 25 spf and am looking forward to it being my summer moisturizer. I have used Olays other spf moisturizes for years. Thinks for making a light weight one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as part of a promotion from Olay. It lives up to its description of instant absorption and leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth. Living in Florida, the SPF25 is a major plus for me. The reason I gave it 4 stars for effectiveness is because I have only been using this product for a week and it is too soon to see if it reduces the appearance of fine lines. Other than that, I would highly recommend this item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The minute I felt Olay Whips on my fingers and applied it to my face I knew it was a special product. It's so light and airy but you can tell it is doing amazing things to your skin. It doesn't feel heavy at all once applied. Your skin just drinks in the moisture. My face and neck feel so soft afterwards. No other moisiturer can compare.

Product smells and feels great just watch you don't grab too much as they smoothes over your face throat and chest so smooth its wonderful feel and doesn't seem to allow the sun. The winter is when we are outside more in AZ but the sun is still extreme. This feels great to just used this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about a week and a half now and without reservation I can say it now tops my Olay product list of favorites. It is silky smooth, I've already seen my little wrinkles diminish and smells great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Whip Face Moisturizer is a must buy. There is no fragrance, which I love, and it is so smooth and creamy. It leaves no residue and does not feel greasy at all. It soaks into your skin almost immediately and your face feels so smooth. You can feel it working right away. I would highly recommend Olay Regenerist Whip Face Moisturizer to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely loved Olay Regenerist Whip. It felt light and velvety on my skin. There was no greasy feeling and my skin absorbed it instantly. After a few days of use my skin felt and looked firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It smells nice, isn't sticky, absorbs nicely. I can��t really give accurate opinions because I have only had the product to use for 5 days. That being said it appears to moisturize as well as my dr p cream. However, I cannot comment on any anti aging results as yet [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product had a very light feel and I liked it. I only gave this three stars for effectiveness because I have a lot or wrinkles to deal with. I am certain that this would have a five star rating by someone with moderate wrinkles. I have been using an Olay Regenerist regime for a little over a month and intend to continue to use these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay whips is a great new product it seems to float on your face but sinks right . My face feels well hydrated. I usually prefer scentless but the scent on this Olay whips is quite nice.
I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Moisturizer is light but definitely left my skin moisturized! My foundation went on very smoothly over this product. I haven't used it long enough to see if fine lines will be less noticeable but so far I am very impressed by this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Olay products for years and recently jumped on the chance to try the new Regenerist Whip. Whenever I have applied foundation over my moisturizer I would still need to use powder over it because my skin would be shiny, but not anymore. Your skin feels like velvet when you put it on and the beautiful matte finish lasts all day! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product absorbed quickly and evenly, which I loved. It did a good job of moisturizing, but I haven't yet noticed any particular improvement in the intrinsic quality/texture of my skin in the week or so that I've used it. (i.e. It has smoothed out fine lines while it is on, but hasn't seemed to reduce them once it is washed off.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is great because it smells good, feels light and smooth gong on the skin. I especially like the fact that it has broad spectrum SPF 25! I never consider using a daily moisturizer that does not have sunscreen. Having SPF 25 versus 15 is an added bonus for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the Olay Whip Regenerist moisturizer. It very light and smooth. It has a nice light scent and it just feels lightweight on the skin. Like whipped air haha. My face and neck is smoother and looks better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the matte feel from day 1, the product is very light and airy, my face feels clean and refreshed after applying because the product is not heavy, will continue to buy after this promotional jar is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just received the generous Regenerist Whip sample, so unable to rate its' effectiveness but immediately noticed a softening of my skin after 1st use! For day, I've used regular pink Olay for years (thanks to my grandmother!) & already use the regular Night Regenerist in PM, so I am an Olay customer. I look forward to trying this new product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist whip is amazing! The cream itself is light and fluffy. There is a slight sunblock smell, but it dissipates almost instantly. When applying, it only took a small amount to cover my complete face. It absorbed quickly and didn't leave me feeling oily or greasy, nor did it have the nasty shine. It feels like you didn't put anything on! I have fine crows feet, and the difference was noticeable in 3 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unsure if I may be applying it too close to my eyes as they water every time I use it. Other than that, I love this moisturizer. It is light, smooth and has a pleasant fragrance. I also like that it has a SPF in it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the new Olay whips a lot better than the original cream.
"It's very light and creamy all in one, my face doesn't feel so heavy after applying and it feels very clean. I'm definitely staying with this type of Olay cream."
Thank you very much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free sample of the Olay Regenerist Whip Face Moisturizer from Olay to try for free. I love it! I put the moisturizer on my face and it is as light as air. I can't even tell it is on my face. It works great to keep my face moisturized all day without feeling heavy. I would buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels very light.....it didn't leave my skin feel greasy or oily. I like the fact that the moisturizer has sunscreen in it and how I noticed less wrinkles within a few days of using it, absolutely amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream make your skin so smooth after application. The texture is creamy but doesn't make your face oily. It absorbs quickly. I have dry skin so it might be good for summer but little too dry on winter. I have to put a moisturizer underneath this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product makes my facial skin feel so good because it absorbs very well and doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy. Application turns dry skin into well moisturized soft, smooth skin with a bonus of SPF 25. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I already love this product but the whip goes on much smoother and seems to dry quicker than original product. Great when applying other Olay products like eye cream or serum! Definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always loved Olay Regenerist and didn't think it could get any better, but Regenerist Whip is amazing! Wonderful light and fluffy texture absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated. I would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first applied Regenerist Whip I was afraid it might be oily, but I was completely wrong. I felt the moisturizer quickly being absorbed into my skin leaving my skin feeling soft and replenished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is light, feels great going on, not heavy and it absorbs quickly. Does not make your face look or feel greasy. The fragrance is nice and light. I would recommend purchasing this product, I would definitely purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
No smell and the cream was rich but it was very light. It only takes a small amount to make face feel very soft. It takes such a small amount to cover and moisturize so the jar will probably last for a long time. This will be my new face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Just touching this product let's you know you're going to love it. The soft creamy texture feels wonderful on your face. The finish is silky. Than you remember the anti-aging & sunscreen in the product. Perfect combo.
Can't wait to see the results as I continue to use it. Thank you for the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Amazing! I love Olay products to begin with, but this is so wonderful. No heavy or greasy feeling - now I feel like I can use this in the morning and not just at night as I was using the regular Regenerist formula. I tell my friends the Olay Regenerist family of products is what I use and now I have one more to recommend to them - use this product - it works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Regenerist whip is outstanding it's very smooth my skin feel soft plus I look much better since I started using the whip regenerist. I told my five sisters, my friends and co-workers that this product is awesome. I don't think I'll ever try any other moisturizers again. I really love this product and can't wait to try more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The whip is great for several reasons....softens face, smooths lines, does not feel greasy, and I think it is working on the wrinkles. I'm not sold on the inside cover which I find hard to get off because the whip creates a suction."
Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have the Olay Regenerist Whip. I have oily skin. I began using the Olay Whip right when it came out and within a week my face is feeling like a cloud. I am young and enjoy ""playing the field"" and all of my dates compliment how soft and flawless my skin looks after using this. I love this and am buying it as Christmas presents for all of my family! Even the guys! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This new product (like the ""old"" Regenerist Face Moisturizer) feels much lighter and softer to the touch. BUT, it still packs a punch in terms of effectiveness and light fragrance. I have tried some of the pricier face moisturizers but I come back to OLAY Regenerist time and time again -- and I will continue to do so. I really appreciate that OLAY is constantly looking at ways to ""improve"" their product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product feels so light on my skin. It has very little smell. Glides on without feeling greasy at all. my skin feels very smooth after the application and does not irritate at all. I liked this product right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product one week ago and have used it daily. I was initially surprised by how light the product was on my face. I appreciate that spf is protecting my skin from the elements. The scent is not overpowering. I'm really pleased with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've only had this product to use for four days. The feel is great. It goes on smoothly and does not have the tacky feel that regular regenerist cream has. It feels like a cross between regenerist serum and cream. Too soon for results. However based on feel I would buy this product again over the regenerist cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the smoothness and scent of this Olay product. I've used Olay products for over 40 years since I was a teenager. I have never been disappointed with the results. I have had many compliments over the years about my skin and I know part of the reason is the products I use. I have recommended Olay to friends over the years because of the results I get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product went one very smooth and I loved the way it dries to a silky soft finished. THatbis what we look for in a product. The smell was a little over powering would rather it have no smell or real soft. Have only used it for 1 week have not seen any major results but it's still to soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this product goes on your skin. It's very light and soaks in right away. You don't even feel like you have anything on your face. My skin also feels firmer. In the winter I could use a little more hydration on my skin but it will be perfect in the summer for sure. I really like it a lot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just received this product several days ago so I'm not quite sure as to the effectiveness of changing my skin. I have used Olay products for many years now and have had wonderful results so I do not expect anything less from this product. It does make my skin feel incredibly smooth and smells nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this cream. It feel light, a little goes a long way and love the way my face feels. I have been using L'oreal Revitalift and now totally using Olay whips. Worth trying and you will see for yourself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy the original regenerist, though I have never been a fan of the fragrance. The fragrance is still there, but the whips version feels lighter and does a good job of controlling oil in my combination skin. Overall I really enjoy it for daytime wear! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was doubtful at first, thought it my be to greasy feeling on my skin, but that thought quickly left me, along with that greasy feeling.Very much love this product , the only reason I have it four stars and not give us I haven't used it long enough to know if there is long use improvements to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used the original Regenerist fragrance-free for years and love it, but this feels even better. We live in a warm climate, and this works nicely without the weight. My skin is very dry. I periodically try Clinique, Lancôme, Lauder, etc but always return to Regenerist without even finishing the jars. Most highly recommend**** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Put it on a clean face morning and night. So light, this product doesn't even feel like I am wearing a moisturizer. It soaks right in to your skin with no tacky or greasy feel. Especially nice not feeling like you are wearing another layer under your make up. Highly recommend trying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have searched for a moisturizer that I can use during the day that won't let my makeup slip or look oily. I have found it! It's light and fluffy and melts into my skin. I actually think it helps my makeup stay on and look fresh longer. It also has a pretty fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay always surprises with his products. This cream is super nice, it does not leave the complexion greasy and it feels like a silk the face. I am a consumer of olay and this new product I love. Very good as well as base in the morning. I recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had stopped using Regenerist because it felt heavy on my skin. The new whipped type is much lighter, and after one week, I can see an improvement in my face and especially my neck. Absolutely love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank you for my generous sample. It smells divine and feels wonderful both going on and after. I'm a definite fan and will continue using it in the future. I have been using Olay products for many years and a lot of people tell me my (80 yr. young) complexion looks fabulous for my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very pleased so far with this product. I feel I need to use it longer to get a full overview of results. The product is lightweight and I am not bothered by the SPF with other products I am.
So far the product has made my skin smoother and feels more moisturized. I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I keep my night creme by the bed but usually I have to wait to lay down because it will only rub off on the pillow. But the new Olay Whip was absorbed almost immediately. My skin felt softer fast and it was easier to get my make-up on over it in the morning. It's almost transparent and has a lovely scent. This new Olay is a winner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's so perfect it hepls
"I have searched for years to find the perfect moisturizer that is light and airy but still moisturizing and gives that glow, this product is the best product I have used and has forever changed my skin, I definitely recommend this product!"
The Olay Whip Light as Air Finish cream is truly light as it says it is. I especially love this product because it works. I did notice a difference in my appearance.
I've used different moisturizers before but this one I love the most my skin feels amazing I have dry skin and this made my skin feel wonderful. And I will definitely keep using this
"This is what a moisturizer should be like!! Light and airy, absorbed amazingly, smelled like heaven and made my neck and face feel soft, rejuvenated and refreshed."
I'm an only Olay user! & this whip lotion is by far my favorite & best product to use. Its very light! I have oily skin and afraid to use anything heavy.
"I recently received a sample in the mail and I love this stuff! It is so light, smells good, and makes my skin feel so soft. I want to get a full size even though it is a little pricey for me. Seems worth it though!"
"I have a sensitive skin and don't like products that are heavy on the face, but this product is so lightweight that you wouldn't feel your wearing a moisturizer. And I didn't have any problem with my sensitive skin. A must try product"
"I would love to be able to try this, but the white top is impossible to remove. Four different people have tried without success. I'm taking it to work tomorrow to see if anyone there can take it off. Fort Knox!"
"Love the product, my skin is soft an noticing a difference in my complexion and wrinkle reduction. Only negative is the white protective cover was so hard to remove. Had to use a knife to pry it off."
I've struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy or under moisturize. It feels great. Smells great. My little forehead wrinkle is less noticeable. Price is a bit much tho.
"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used! I've tried a lot I have Lupus and a lot of things irritate my skin this one doesn't and the way it makes your skin feel is unbelievable, it's well worth it's money."
Loved the smell and how it made my face so soft and smooth. I didn't get a chance to see if truly did work beyond what ive seen so far because i only had 2 small samples.
I like this because it is a good day moisturizer and non-irritating sunscreen but it does nothing for wrinkles or reducing the aged appearance of skin.
Okay Olay: that lid took me 10 minutes to get off. I resorted to trying a steak knife and finally it popped open so fast I spilled the contents on my bathroom counter. Please redesign that lid! The handle is way too small to even pull.
"Not impressed, my jar feels just like any other Olay product. Very heavy for being whipped and I have used creams that are whipped and this one falls short."
"I received the sample of this, it's amazing coz it doesn't make my skin oily,.I highly recommend this new olay products.,I'm olay lover since I started putting cream on my face.."
"It appears to make money this company has whipped up our Olay Regenerist so it is pumped up with air so less is really in the jar, even if it states there is 1.7 oz. I'd rather have 1.7 oz of cream rather than air."
"I received this product from Olay as a sample, and it was really wow, a great refreshing scent, a light cream whip that gives a soft and smooth feeling to the skin, plus it has multiple vitamins like B3, B5 etc. Love it."
"I Love this product!! It feels amazing on my skin. It has a very subtle, fresh smell and I would DEFIANTLY recommend this product! The only downside is that it is very expensive."
Sits on the skin's surface and feels greasy to the touch. Makes skin shiny. Nothing like regular regenerist. I've been using Olay products for 20 years and this is a real miss. Would not purchase again or recommend.
"I have been using this product for about 4 days now and on two separate occasions at work mu nurse co-worker mentioned to me if I had sunblock on my face. So, not liking this product very much."
"Tried this product as a sample and love the way it felt so light on my face. Not enough use to see results yet, but interested to see. Have oily skin so lotions and serums are hard to really like and use."
