I bought this at the spa doing my facials and laser hair removal. I have bad cystic and hormonal acne and this relieves and clears my skin fast! The redness and irritation from messing with my acne went away overnight and the spearmint in the product cooled the inflammation. Definitely buy!!
"This product clears up zits like nothing else I've ever used. I ordered it again after my last bottle ran out and my skin instantly revolted. A must for anyone who struggles with stress zits (like me), acne, or even just the occasional break out. Literally can't live without this."
