I just bought Physicians formula Rose All Day 5 days ago. I've been putting it on everyday underneath my makeup. And after only 5 days I've seen such a vast improvement in my skin. My face is silky soft & very hydrated. Plus it makes your skin actually glow so you don't even have to wear makeup. I absolutely love it & I've been recommending it to my friends & family.
I originally got this a sample and started using it after washing my face and before applying makeup. I have noticed improvement in my skin no more dry patches and gives a little bit of a natural glow to the skin and doesn't make the face feel oily at all and does not affect my make up at all throughout the day very pleased with this and will continue to use!!!
"Gives the right amount of glow, to wear on days with no makeup and days with a full face! This serum absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy residue and it smells good!"
my fav serum other than there argon oil. makes my skin feel like it is tightening and like its glowing. ill always use this I've gotten all my girls on this after a mutual friend introduced me to the beauty that showed me this.
"Overall great product. I really liked the light pink tint it had and it really helped my skin's complexion and my acne scars. However, the syringe type thing that draws out the serum could be better. At best I got 2 small drops at a time"
I received this as a free gift @ Ipsy makeup convention 2018 in NYC... I have to say out of all the products I either purchased or received as free gift...this by far was my favorite...I use it at night or after any face mask/ peel...I recommend it to my clients...use it to spot treat dry areas before applying makeup on myself or my clients...I recommend this for all skin types...I've repurchased 3 times.
"I love this product, but I do not love it as a primer, it broke up my foundation and made my skin more oily then normal, however when I just use it with no face makeup I love it itâs wonderful, I even use it as a quick highlighter on my get up and go days but as a primer itâs a no for me."
"I've only used this for a few days so I can't attest to any long term effects. However, it smells like genuine roses and not a perfumery scent either. My sensitive skin hasn't broke out and the iridescent sheen is not an overpowering highlight. So far, so good!"
"I rated 3 stars because its a thick, creamy serum. I personally like a more liquid, lighter feeling serum so my skin can absorb faster. I must say that it smells really good! (obviously)smells like roses!"
This product is amazing! It make my skin look and feel great and is NOT greasy. I will definitely be buying it other products in the future!
I wish PF would make this fragrance free but as of now this serum is so good for dry sensitive skin. Dewy goodness. Must have!
love this stuff I use it before my primer and on some days it's my primer. can't say enough I have pores and they look better after I apply this serum.
"First, I wanted to address the dropper issue people keep mentioning. The dropper (this is true for any dropper bottle) is not supposed to fill up all the way, the amount recommended to use is typically ""a dropper full"" which doesn't mean a FULL dropper but the amount you get when you've squeezed the bulb. So what you do get in the tube is an accurate, calculated amount. The bottles are working just fine. I also thought this and got so frustrated and dis some"
"First the smell, so light and fresh, then the moisture it adds to my skin. i have dry/combination skin and needs heavy duty moisture especially in the fall/winter season. I apply this at night before cream and in the morning after washing my face before makeup and i love how soft and moisturized my skin feels."
"It ends up being quite expensive, the dropper sucks, and the bottle is half full. I'm irritated because I love what's in it!"
Smells just lovely and feels so nice on. It is too luminous of a finish for me personally. I can use it at bedtime for the benefits though.
"Excellent product! I will by it again, you can feel the tightness immediately!"
This serum is amazing. It doesnât feel like a serum more like a lotion but I like how it comes out white out of the bottle and turns pink on the skin. It gives a lovely shine that Iâm in love with. It smells like roses but the scent is not strong which works better for me. I applied it under my foundation and used no primer and didnât see any creasing. I love it. The only concern is that the applicator doesnât dispense lots of serum at the time I have to try a few times until I get a drop. Amazing product! I highly recommend it.
loove how this makes my skin look and feel. it's great under makeup and alone.
"Purchase this product, the label reads interesting with the antioxidants vitamin C etc. iâve washed my face but as I apply it itâs rolling off like a peel on my skin. I donât have any skin issues pretty healthy clear skin just wanted to try something different since I just turned 44. Iâve used to say moisturizer for the past 15 years. Also the color stands out on my skin I am of mixed race and my face has a pale pinkish orange shine to it. Unfortunately I feel the need to return this product."
I have to say I am just loving this product - it's beautiful and makes me feel soft and glowy. I love the soft glow it gives you and have had people ask me what I am wearing. Can you pleaseeeee make a perfume or wearable skin oil for the body with this scent? I would be happy to test it :) thanks for another great product!
"It makes my skin feel tighter and it has a subtle glow on light skin sense I've been tanning it now has a much nicer glow to it. I like the slight rose sent it has. The only thing I don't like about this is the dropper, The formula is 2 thick it needs to be in a jar. The packaging is pleasing to the eye just not practical."
"Iâve seen a few people mention running out quickly or their skin not feeling hydrated enough after using. What Iâve found is using the serum supplementally works best. I use it twice a day, after I apply my regular moisturizer and before my eye cream. Iâve been using half a dime sized amount for two weeks twice a day and the change in my skin is shocking. My texture has improved and pores are smaller. Iâm very pleased with this purchase"
"I bought this because I am a sucker for rose scented anything. I absolutely LOVE this product. It does not break me out or bother my sensitive skin. I wash my face and use my vitamin C stick all over. I follow that up with the RosĂ¨ All Day serum. I use it at night. In the morning my face looks and feels very soft. I find myself using less product on my face- less toner, less moisturizer, and even less foundation. Love love love this!"
"OMG, I love the smell and feel of this product. It also works really well on my skin and I can't wait to put it on my clean skin each morning. My only recommendation is the stopper on the bottle. I can't get as much product as I would like without having to use the stopper dispenser multiple times."
"If you have oily and/or acne prone skin, this works like nothing I have ever found. It completely got rid of my blackheads and occasional breakouts that comes with oily skin. I like how it feels on my face and it stays on all day. I also love the slight glow that it gives my face. The only thing that I don't like is the eye dropper. Just like everyone else, I have a hard time with it too. That needs to improve."
This serum is the best. I highly recommended this to all women who are looking for so long. I had been searching and spend so much money for my face needs and never had a luck but when I tried this physician formula. My face in three weeks really bloomed and rosy looking. Love it
"I need to incorporate this more into my skincare routine, but first impressions / been using it, it doesn't break me out and smells really nice, just like fresh roses. The scent isn't too much which is good. Did not break me out which is a huge bonus! I give it only 4 out of 5 only because I haven't seen a difference yet, but will continue to use."
Iâve used this and the smell is amazing and it makes your skin feel fresh and alive!
Very good product my skin glow I love it
"Is a really expensive serum and is hard to get out of the bottle, the dropper wont absorb enough liquid and there isn't enough in the bottle either."
