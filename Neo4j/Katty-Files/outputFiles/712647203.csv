"This is great stuff to peel off blemishes and lines from your face. However, it has to be diluted. I mixed it with three parts water. I left it on a minute and a half to 2 minutes then washed off. Did it again a few hours later. It's meant to be used, from what I understand, several times over a month allowing healing time in between."
It works great but please anyone who gets this READ THE INSTRUCTIONS VERRY CAREFULLY I can't stress that enough because if not mixed priperly it will burn your skin.I used a 50 50 solutin of water and the product abd its amazing.
It works so good just need to dilute in right proportion
It works as described . YOU WILL NEED TO DILUTE IT. Make sure to buy ointment cream with it. So far I saw an amazing result from one time use.
Quality product. STRONG. This product is made to dilute.
"wow, the doctor billed me $1200 to apply this to a lesion and I got the same results buying it for $15 here and doing it myself!"
be very careful with this it will burn your skin you can't leave it on not even for a moment
Don't buy this product from this brad/name!..use a name you know... I'm not sure who this is by and the instructions vaguet.product burned my face and it's a tiny.
