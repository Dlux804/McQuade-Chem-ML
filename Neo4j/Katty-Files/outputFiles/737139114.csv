"This product is incredible. The smell is absolutely divine; smells just like honey. This moisturizer isn't sticky or greasy, but leaves my skin feeling like a baby booty. I had some rough, dry patches on my chin and they were cleared the next day after using this product. (This worked better than my $30 higher end moisturizer!). This is my new go-to. I will be trying the other manuka honey products from Earth to Skin. Just buy this product."
"I never write reviews on products I buy, but since no one else had written a review yet, I will be the one to tell you THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!! My face and body skin get random âbreakouts,â from allergic reactions, or who knows, and I always pick at them. I bought this product on a Friday night, and by Sunday, my face and body looked SO much better. I was/am amazed and happy. I havenât even used the whole jar yet, and Iâve already bought more online. Definitely worth the money, and definitely works!!"
Works wonders for my skin and I'm super sensitive my skin feels like velvet !!
"I got all excited when this new range came out as a great price, preaching it's natural and includes non of the nasties. However, when you look up some top ingredients many of them are man made synthetic silicones (Dimethicone)."
