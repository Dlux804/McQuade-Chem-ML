"This is probably the best anti-frizz, conditioning product I've ever used (and I've tried out so many: from inexpensive to expensive)"
I love this cream...i used it with the sleek shampoo
"I have naturally frizzing hair, and when I damaged my hair, it is even frizzier. I bought this without reading reviews, since I was going to buy the Garnier Fructis one. Well, I'm glad I got this one. It took all my frizz away. Also, I found using it on dry hair made my hair greasy, making me put my hair up in the middle of the day. I suggest only putting it on wet hair. There is no blue tinted glitter in it. Right after I read the review, I checked. No glitter."
"I have been using this leave in conditioner daily for over a year. My hair is fine and thin, but I don't feel like it weighs it down. Just use a small amount on damp hair and it moisturizes. Can't beat the price either. Walmart is the only place I can find it anymore."
"My hair is so dry, I swear I could put motor oil on it & it would soak up the oil and you'd never know it. So, maybe this would be too much for someone with less dry hair, but I LOVE it! Makes my hair smooth & shiny, and tames the frizzy fly-aways. Smells nice, too. Wish it came in a large, economy size..."
This is my holy grail hair care product! I have dry/frizzy and thick hair and have all my life. I am now 18 and i used this just one night ago and my hair has never felt this soft and manageable for as long as i can remember. I never thought i wouldnt have to use a flat iron to tame my hair but i didnt need it at all. Love it!!!
