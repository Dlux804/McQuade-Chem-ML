"I bought this in hopes of helping my poor dry winter skin, and it's done nothing but make my skin hydrated and glowing (which is exactly what I wanted)! I have since repurchased two more bottles in case it ever goes out of stock! Love this product! Please make this in a bigger bottle, this would honestly be a game changer if it came in a 1oz bottle!"
I absolutely adore this oil! It helps with my pores as well as hydrates the skin! You only need one drop on each cheek and I use it at night . Great product.
"Bought this by chance and I love it! My 54 year old skin looks better than ever! It is so smooth, non greasy, and so soft! A few drops at night and I'm all set"
I have oily skin and I use this facial oil every night. I have noticed a huge decrease in my oil production during the day. It's not greasy and absorbs into the skin easily. It is a staple in my skincare routine!
This oil is officially my holy grail. I suffer from sensitive dry skin and any other oil would irritate my skin or burn. I took a chance and purchased this!! OMG! I'm amazed! My skin immediately looks replenished and has actually improved the way my skin looks and feels. My makeup even looks better. Ordered 3 more bottles.
I've been using this facial oil for about 2 weeks when I put it on my skin my skin and glistens and my skin drinks it up it is so good for my skin I'm going to keep using this because I love the way it makes my skin feel
I was skeptical about using an oil on my face but adding this to my moisturizer has made my skin look so much younger and healthier. I've noticed the fine lines around my mouth are much less visible. I will definitely repurchase!
I added this to my ELF foundation and I feel it adds a new dimension of coverage and feel. I also use it on my skin when it feels thirsty. I have even used it on my cuticles. It's a small bottle but a little goes a long way.
I bought this product almost 1 month ago. I use it every morning and night. My skin is so soft and moisturized. My skin literally glows now and no more dry flakes. I can literally go out without foundation on and people compliment my skin!
"I've been wearing this at night after cleansing and I loooove it! Goes on smoothly and is really light. Definitely feels like an oil when you put it on, but my skin drinks it up. Already ordered another one!"
"I have terrible acne so I was hesitant to try it. I've now been using it for 2 weeks and my face looks better than it's looked in a long time! I put it on right after my morning shower, let it soak in, then I go on with my make up routine."
It is wonderful and feels good on my skin that tends to run dry during the winter months. I use it alone and with foundation it leaves my face with a dewy look.
"It's lightweight, a little goes a long way, it doesn't have any detectable fragrance (but there is a slight ""oily"" smell). I don't find that it does anything special for my skin that coconut/almond oil or a good moisturizer wouldn't do. Basically it's just a convenient way to add a few drops of oil to my facial care routine. To its credit, it does NOT LEAK out of the bottle!"
"I started mixing 2 drops of this into my moisturizer twice a day everyday for the past 2 weeks now and WOW. my skin has been so much better. I suffer (usually pretty badly) from rosacea, dryness and acne, but lately my skin has looked brighter and felt smoother and just overall looks younger and better. I am only 28. I have also been oil cleansing nightly with pure organic coconut oil too, I think its been a little bit of both making my skin look more hydrated and healtheir"
I'm very pleased with this oil. My face loves it! Very mositurizing and don't feel heavy on my face.
I love this oil! I use it as an under eye moisturizer. It soaks into the skin quickly and has a lovely silky texture. Not greasy in the least. And it beats more expensive oils. I love ELF products!
"I loved using it! Feels good to put on my skin before bed. Very calming, hydrating and soothing. It also doesn't make my skin breakout at all (and I have acne problems!) For the price, this product is a gem <3"
I have been using this oil for over a month. I put it in my moisturizer my foundation etc. People come up to me and tell me how beautiful my skin looks. This oil gives my face this natural looking glow with out looking greasy or oily. My skin feels soft the next day after I use it. ELF PLEASE DONT EVER DISCONTINUE THIS OIL.
"I have combo skin - dryyyy cheeks, and oiiiily nose+forehead. I put this oil on my cheeks at night after my serum and regular night time moisturizer, and it sinks into the skin so nicely, and I have felt a difference in the hydration of my cheeks! I would recommend to anyone, and look at that list of ingredients! It's a dream come true! It's a fairly small bottle, but a little goes a long way."
Bought this product a month ago. I was concerned that it would make my skin more oily but it did not at all! This stuff is incredible! has gotten rid of all the little bumps on my skin and my makeup goes on so much smoother. I prefer to wear little to no makeup and this oil allows me to do so because it has evened out my skin so much!
"I bought this product in a huge haul and the first time I used it, I felt like my face was really greasy and I used this in my nighttime skincare routine. I was worried that when woke up the next morning, I would have breakouts everywhere but that was not the case. My skin felt extra soft and hydrated, not oily at all after wearing it to bed. I have been using this for a week and absolutely love it"
Mix this with your foundation!!! You will not be disappointed :)
Bought it and mixed it with my foundation. Super hydrating
"My face was clear prior to using this, now I have tiny bumps all over my face from it. Haven't had a breakout like this since high school. Unfortunately I can not use this oil anymore."
Makes your skin super soft but it's not ideal for oily skin cause it can make it look more oily. Makes foundation more blendable.
"I love it; my skin just drinks this up! Being winter, I have been using this 2-3 times a day. So great especially for this price!"
I have tried several face oils and most are way to greasy for my skin. This however when used properly Is great. I use at night and all you need I'd a drop. It soaks right into your skin. Next morning face is super hydrated.
"For $12CAD I didn't know what to expect. It's like I'm just putting canola oil on my face. It feels way too heavy, and it doesn't absorb well into my skin. After using it on my skin, it gave my skin an oily look."
"I can totally see how some people would love this, but I honestly felt like all it did was make my face feel oily. To be fair, I didn't have any breakouts when using it, but my skin felt not good."
I'm so glad I bought this helps for the winter time
It blends into the skin really well. Great for oily skin bc it doesn't run down your face when you sweet!! Best product by elf. It should be more expensive!
