People often comment on my skin and ask me what I use. I am so in love with this product that I give it as gifts to my family and friends. I use it morning and night and ALWAYS put it on when I travel by plane as the recirculated air can be so drying.
"I have used Neutrogena products for over 10 years and my skin has never looked better. The Hydro Boost feels wonderful on my skin and when I wake up, my skin is still soft. Highly recommend this product, the facial wipes, and daily moisturizer with SPF."
"I started giving up on finding the perfect moistureizer for my combo skin. The lotions just made my face more oily. Once i found Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Water Gel, i never looked back. It sinks into the skin like nothing i have ever seen. It is a great follow up to their Retin Oil."
"I have been buying this product for over a year. Go on so smooth, and refreshing. Keeps my skin soft and have noticed other companies starting to copy. I'm staying with Neutrogena."
"My friend swore by this water gel and at first, I was skeptical of the price (I'm usually cheap!) but this is SO WORTH IT. The water gel is like an instant cool splash and makes my skin so soft and happy."
"I love this! This is my 5th jar and I use it in the morning under my make up. It goes on easily and dries quickly, so I can apply my powder make-up without any problems and off I go!"
"Like the texture of this water-gel, it's very light. My face feels smooth right after it. Good moisturizer for it's cost. I have sensitive skin and it's combination (oily, dry, normal) so it doesn't make my face oily, but to cover my dry spots I use also cream - gel from Neutrogena. So works great for me..."
"This cream did not irritate my sensitive skin. However, it smells perfumy and gave me an instant headache. Why do manufacturers have to put fragrance in face creams? I feel bad writing a not-so-good review, but I can't stand the smell.Sorry!"
"I bought this 2 weeks ago, and I'm very happy with this product so far. It keeps my face hydrated and it gives out great smell"
"I have been using the Hydro Boost Water Gel for two years, I love that it feels so light, not greasy."
"I have oily skin and I was never 100 percent happy with my previous facial moisturisers because they never seemed to absorb the way I would like and just sat heavy on my skin. Finally this moisturiser feels amazing! It absorbs nicely and feels refreshing. I'm on my third round of this stuff, love it!"
"I just bought my second container of the Hydro Boost Water Gel. The first container lasted a long time, I think 6 months or more. I love the gel consistency, it feels cool and soothing on the skin and absorbs more quickly than cream-based moisturizers. I typically use it at night on my face and neck after toner & serums. I always apply this gel around my eyes as well and haven't experienced any irritation at all. My face always feels smooth, supple, and hydrated after using it!"
I purchased the Hydro Boost Water Gel because my skin reacts badly to thick lotions and I don't like strong smelling creams or lotions I am very sensitive to a lot of things so I tried some and it was like putting water on my face with no heavy scent and my face is so soft and fresh looking and I'm 54 my daughter also uses this product and she 29
"I bought this product because I tried a different water-based moisturized and loved it. I have used other Neutrogena products and loved them. Unfortunately, I have to use a ton of this product to get the minimum desired results. When I used the recommended amount my skin was still dry looking. I do not have dry skin so I was surprised. I was a little disappointed."
"I've been using this product for about 9 months and am very pleased with the way it keeps my face hydrated and soft throughout the day. My skin is very dry and I am a wrinkled senior. I used to have dry cracked patches that were painful, no matter how much moisturizer I used, but no longer have that problem since I started using this product.."
"This product did not work well for my sensitive skin. As soon as I applied it (after getting out of the shower) it burned my face. Once it calmed down, it felt fine. A few hours later, I noticed that my skin was extremely dry and flaky. Not a good fit for me, despite the wonderful reviews I read before purchasing."
"My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Hydraboost Water Gel, and I'm certainly glad she did. It absorbs completely and leaves my 72-year old complexion looking years younger! My skin is soft, moisturized, and radiant. Living in the desert, maintaining moisture in my skin is crucial. This product really delivers! People say I look at least 20 years younger than the calendar indicates. I'm SOLD."
This product makes your skin feel like new! Both of my daughters love it and now one of their boyfriends use it too. Each person has different skin issues and the water boost doesn't cause any additional problems but rather hydrates the skin while making it feel so good.
"I love the hydro water gel, I've been looking for a moisturizer that doesn't break out my face and moisturize it. And this definitely works for me. My face is less dry and doesn't break out from it. Most moisturizers are too heavy and this is light and your skin soaks it up perfectly. Will never buy anything else!"
"I looooove this water gel! It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and moisturized! Plus it smells amazing! It's like luxury on my face. One problem I have is that even though it says it has hyaluronic acid on it, it doesn't say that I'm the ingredients. Either way, very nice moisturizer! I recommend!"
I loved this gel ! It made my skin smooth and more like baby skin
I have been using this for several months and my skin is so hydrated. I give it as gifts.
I have been using this product for years and love it.
Been using this product for over a year and like it very much.
I bought this product like 2 days ago and I didn't that I was going to see the positive effects that early like it is amazing it smells good and it makes my face feel smooth and healthy I am literally a huge fan of Neutrogena's skin care products and I would love to review this on Snapchat as well
"I've been looking for a water based moisturizer and I usually use a SPF based moisturizer but I heard about Hydro Boost and it's all the rage right now so I decided to check it out and I honestly don't regret it at all. After the first few uses, I noticed a significant difference. My skin feels smooth and hydrated! 11/10 recommend."
"At first I had to use it everyday, now I only use it every other day !!!!! I don't even need it every single day because it is so hydrating . Coming from someone with super dry skin, I was shocked by the results —- I've tries more expensive, name brand products and they didn't come close to this . Thanks neutrogena!"
I am very glad I bought the serum and gel. The two pair nice together and so far seem to be solving my skin issues.
The Hydro Boost Water Gel is a product that I love and buy often because it helps balance my oily/combination skin. And it smells great! It also pairs well underneath makeup.
I have been using this product for several months now and I would not change it for the world. When I started to use it my face was peeling and I have not had an issue since. Smells and feels great on my skin.
I have been purchasing expencive lotions till I got hydro boost now my mom who is 78and my daughter who is 22 are alway looking to see if I have hydro boost for them to use. Love this stuff can't live without it thank you for making this line
"My skin is very dry despite daily use of moisturizer and sunscreen. Since using Hydro Boost before bed, my skin glows as well as feeling so great, supple and smooth, not like I'm going to crack."
I wanted a light weight moisturizer for the summer months and stumbled across Hydro Boost and love it. It does not weigh your skin down like many moisturizers. Glad I came across it. Great product.
I've been using this for almost 3 weeks... I'm very pleased with the results and I'm 70 years old. My skin is smooth n supple as Neutrogena promised it would be. Thank you Neutrogena! And its affordable too!
"I have been using this product for a couple of years and I love it. It's so cool and soothing for my face. And it's moisturizing without being heavy or greasy, which is a plus for my oily skin."
"I purchased the face, hand and body gels. All work great and they're not greasy like other products I've tried. My dermatologist recommended the face gel and I'm glad I tried it!"
"Bought this product when I tried the serum, and I honestly love it just as much as the serum. It smells nice and is super hydrating. Most importantly to me, it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin! I use it every morning before I apply a BB cream!"
I bought this about a week ago and so far so good. It smells really nice and it definitely hydrates my skin without being oily. I love it. Makes my skin feel good.
"Smells great and dries quickly without leaving oily residue. My skin cleared up, not sure if it was because of this product or the Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser. I've been using both and they both work and smell great!"
"I've been using this product for a little over a week. I find that this cream is light as a feather, penetrates almost immediately, and keeps my skin moist for hours. Light fragrance, too."
I have been using Hydro Boost water gel for almost a year now after using several other age/wrinkle creams and this one actually shows me the positive reduction of lines and wrinkles!! I love it! I am going to try the other hydro boost products.
"So happy with the results of Hydro Boost Water Gel, the cleanser and the cream. Unbeatable combination for fine lines and not so fine lines! Makes my skin look Young and healthy. Thank you Neutrogena!"
I have been using this product for 4 months now and I can really tell a difference in my skin. It is hydrated and silky soft. I love the way this melts into my skin and feels cool and refreshing. Everyone should be using hydro boost gel.
"tried many other products over the years, keep returning to Neutrogena due to its performance. Have very sensitive and dry skin as well as age related issues, Neutrogena delivers!"
"I have been using this product since it first came out. It is refreshing, hydrating and is also a great base before your morning and nighttime beauty regime. I am addicted and cannot function when I have run out. Seriously the best product ever."
I bought this because I am 68 and need a little hydration in my neck and face areas. I recently lost 25 lbs and needed the extra boost. This is a great product and it really helps!
"I have been using this product about six months. I visited my aesthetician last week and she was raving about my “new” skin. She commented on the decrease in fine lines, no more dryness, and how supple my skin was. I noticed all of this too, but also noticed many of my “not so fine lines” decreased. I am a forever customer .❤️ Did I mention I am 70 years old? I have great genes. Thank you Mother!"
Two words: Hyaluronic acid. Dry skins best friend. This water gel has changed my life. The dimethicone in it makes it great to wear under makeup as it really smooths everything out. I don't have acne prone skin but if you do this might not be the product for you. If you do have skin that tends to be on the dry side then you won't regret it.
"WOW! About a month ago, I got this moisturizer and have been using it almost every night. I take off my makeup, rub witch hazel over my face, and top it off with the hydro-boost gel. My skin has never looked and felt softer, or healthier. 110% recommend this product to anyone, no matter your skin type!"
"I have oily skin and this is the PERFECT moisturizer for me. When my skin is not hydrated, it produces even more oil and this keeps it so happy. It never leaves my skin looking greasy. I tried a bunch of other products similar to this with eco friendly packaging (not a fan that this comes in a plastic container), but nothing was the same"
I love how this hydrates your skin without every being oily!
its 2019 in Chicago...THIS STUFF IS GREAT!!!! my skin looks dewy and fresh ALL DAY!!!! I have the one with sunscreen and the booster!!! of course its Nuetrogena!!! the mascara I bought with it was terrible-Ive NEVER been happy with mascara from this company but...they are known for skin care so...idk.
I love the fresh scent and how easily it smooths on.
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used and im 46 years old.
I have such dry skin and I tried the Hydro Boost Series and Love everything that I have tried so far!!
"I bought a few weeks ago along with the cleanser and lip treatment. My skin feels tight, not supple and soft."
"I've been using the product for a week now and I'm very happy. It's hydrating, but very light and absorbs quickly."
I really believe this product has help my skin. I put in on my neck and face am and pm. No turkey neck for me. My husband even uses it.
I bought this a month ago. My skin in moisturized and looks young and dewy. I am a young looking 65 year old.
I have been using for a year and love how it makes my face and neck feel. Great gift for friends and family.
Light and moist. Just the right about of moisture and never feels greasy or heavy. Dries quickly so you can do make-up soon after application.
"This product is exactly what I needed. It absorbs instantly, leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, and never feels greasy."
"My face is so happy I made the switch , it's seems little greasy at first but then it dries and it's like magic my skin feels soft and hydrated. I'm glad they came out with the whole line for the body too"
"I've always struggled with skin on the drier side and I've used many different types of moisturizers from Clinque to Murad to Drunk Elephant, but I must say this is the best Moisturizer for dry skin! My skin has ever felt so soft and hydrated in my life! Everytime I use a moisturizer for dry skin, my skin ends up becoming too oily and I start to produce pimples and blackheads. However, this moisturizer gives me the perfect amount of hydration while keeping me clean and acne free!"
"I finally found a product that really worked on my extremely dry, flaking skin, Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream. I could not believe how soft my skin became. Glad I saw this advertised and will definitely stay with this product."
"I love this gel formula it absorbs quickly, not greasy and my skin feels hydrated. I have oily skin and this just works. You should try it if you haven't yet."
"I have been using Hydro-Boost Gel for quite some time. FINALLY, a moisturizing product without oil! My face doesn't flake any more! It goes on smoothly, is refreshing, and hydrates my aging skin well. Thanks, Neutrogena!"
I started using this face gel around the time when it first came out and have probably bought over 10 jars since!! It feels so lightweight and non-sticky which means a lot since I have a problem with using lotions. Also doesn't make me itchy or breakout. I would recommend this to everyone!!
I love the product and I am using it for quite a while now. I am in my fifties and need hydration and smoothing out wrinkles. Great great product. I just wish the packaging and the container could be changed to a more eco-friendly version because it will y stopme to continue buying it.
This product caused me to break out and I'm not sure why. I wanted to like this product so bad because I am a huge fan of the sheet masks. Now I have a large jar of this product just sitting under my sink. This is not a good product for sensitive skin... it feels really hydrating but wishing 48 hours you will begin to break out. I've tried this product 5 times because I really wanted to love it.
"This has got to be the best discovery for me this year. I have gotten to a point in my life where I need to take care of myself more than I am used to. I have combination type skin; I was looking for a moisturizer that was fast absorbing and non greasy feeling. This is my best friend in the mornings when I'm getting ready for work, and it performs exceptionally well the whole day in keeping my skin in tact. Definitely recommend to anyone with a similar situation, definitely worth every penny."
"I have been using this for a year now and it's definately the best moisturizer I've ever used. I have tried MANY different kinds ranging from drug store brand, department store, dermatologist..you name it! This moisturizer is so light and makes my skin feels so soft afterwards. It smells great too! I recommend this product and the whole hydroboost line to everyone I know. I'm 34 now and feel like I have my perfect teenage skin back again."
"I personally love this moisturizer! My skin is so dry, and this hydrating gel is just what it needs. Even with my slightly acne prone skin, I've never had any problems with this product! I've been buying it for years now, and plan to keep on buying it!"
"I purchased this product when Neutrogena first revealed it to the public. Oh, my word!!!! Best moisturizer ever!!! I have super oily skin every thing I have tried in the past either caused breakouts or caused my skin to be even oilier. So I decided I had nothing to loose by trying this product, it was and has been the best decision ever made!!! Please please please do not change this product formula or stop marketing it... it's my holy grail!! Way to go Neutrogena!!!"
Super happy with my purchase ! My skin looks so hydrated :)
Made me feel like domeone had stretched plastic wrap over my face! Burned my eyelids too.
I love the water gel finally I found something that doesn't make my face itchy thank you.
Finally tried this and it's is so worth the money...
I love this cream and buy the sunscreen for first time and is the best!
"I bought this long time ago and keep using, shared with my mom and she likes it too."
The product is fine but I was surprised there was no inner seal when I opened jar.
The fact that I bought five should tell you all you need to know.
I bought this product a few months ago and won't stop reordering!
This is very hydrating. I used Retin-A and this hydrates my dry skin very well.
"It recommends the new product, one of my new favorites."
This is great. Not too greasy. Applies evenly and my skin feels so soft.
"I like the soft feel on my face , not drying , last through the day"
its good but need long time to absorb，im oily skin
The nongreasy feel and good performance is a plus. I will buy this again for dry winter days
"I was trying out another product for about a month but stopped using because i noticed my skin, especially around my cheek area got super dry. I then switched to the hydro boost cleanser and water gel. I'm not even kidding when I say my skin changed overnight!! I would definitely recommend this product. It's a life changer!!"
"I love this stuff! My skin is so soft and youthful looking since day one of using it. It works great under makeup and seems to keep my makeup looking good and in place all day! I have a tendency to break out from any face cream, but so far, so good! Highly recommend trying it out!"
Product definitely hydrates. Skin hasn't loved it though. Some breakout is occurring.
Product does what it claims. Not perfect for my skin.
"Every hydroboost product has lived up to expectations and then some... please, please, please make a lip balm, I will be the happiest Neutrogena customer ever!!"
"I used this product once and the next day I had peeling skin on my nose and the skin around my eyes were red, scaly, and itchy. I checked the ingredients and to my knowledge have no allergies to any of them"
"If you have even slightly dry skin, go for the extra-dry skin version. I don't feel this one is moisturizing enough for my skin. I have to apply it twice in most areas to feel I'm getting the benefits."
"I have tried so many face products and this is my favorite. Provides continuous moisture that is OBVIOUS, it doesn't leave you wondering if it is still working. I can actually see and feel the difference."
This is a good product.... absorbs fast into the skin making your face feel super soft. I don't recommend this for people with severely dry skin though. This tends to work better for oily skin types.
"My skin cant breath just because of the damage caused by dryness. I was so worried with this. Tried almost everything from home remedies to dermatologist, but all in vain. Then someone told me about this wonder product. I thought of giving a chance to this product as well but guess what, its a miracle product. I feel the diffrence even after 2 3 applications. Its really an amazing product to keep your skin hydrated. Go grab this and feel the diffrence yourself."
I got this not too long ago in the travel size as I ran out of my usual moisturizer. I was drawn to it when I saw the hyaluronic acid. I really love how this product goes on so hydrating but dries so well. I also LOVE the smell. Haven't used it for long but seems promising!
"I think the name says alot. The formula feels like water boosted into your skin. Its light & it sinks/absorbs right into your skin. Leaves skin feeling soft & looking 'dewy'. Not a heavy feel at all. Also leaves face looking plumper & younger. I dont have sensitive skin, but this is so light feeling, I imagine it's kind on sensitive skin. I have dry skin & it looks like I get 8 hours of sleep nightly with healthy skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combination skin and this product works great to hydrate it. It helps eliminate dry areas but does not leave my face feeling oil. Its lightweight formulation feels refreshing on the skin and gives it a smooth and healthy feel. I really like this product and would work on both people with oilier skin and those with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just want to put this out first that I have oily skin so the reasoning behind this may just be it's meant for dryer face types however I was disappointed because I thought the gel would be good for my oily skin but instead made it irritated and dry. It does have a good consistency and smell and it works great for my grandma lol (she has dry and aging skin) so I gave it to her but overall I probably wouldn't repurchase and I had to discontinue using it.
"I bought this hoping it to be a good replacement for my Clinique moisture surge, but I am allergic to the blue dye in your product, so I will have to return it. please remove the dye from the product as it is not necessary to the performance, just for looks and many people are sensitive to dyes and fragrance."
"Hola. Me encantó el producto desde que lo compré en un viaje a Europa. Sin embargo, al llegar a Puerto Rico y comprar el producto nuevamente me percaté que el empaque no dice el tiempo de expiración (12 meses) y que adicional dice que tiene hyaluronic acid. ¿Por qué la diferencia? Es importante saber antes de utilizarlo. Gracias."
"My 4th order. Great moisturiser and not greasy, great absorption"
I've been using for 1 month and a half... this thing is wonderful
With just a couple of uses since I recently bought it and it works really good
Absorbs quickly cool feeling love it skin feels hydrated
Love the way this cream makes my face feel and it smells so good!
I have had this product for 1 month I love the product
Been using this product for about a month and I have acne prone skin. I found it to be non clogging and my skin does not have a reaction to it. I use it in combination with Neutrogena's Grapefruit facial wipes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have bought a lot of stuff from Neutrogena fairly recently. This is by far one of my favorites. I recommend it to friends and family of mine all the time. It is not oily t all and very quickly hydrates the skin. It absorbs into the skin, leaving it soft all day. This is the one product I make sure I don't run out of."
I love this product as I have been applying twice daily to address the dry patches on my face. It has hydrated the dryness enough to put on foundation and not have the dry flakes appear through the make-up. It hasn't irritated my skin or caused any break outs due to the oil free formula. I will be purchasing it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had got this a few months ago and it kept burning my skin when i applied it but i didn't think it was anything bad until it kept making my hyperpigmentation worse and darker because it kept burning my skin and i didn't know that this was what was making it worse until i finished the gel & stopped using and it would also over dry my skin which was weird i would have to keep reapplying every like 30 minutes to an hour or so
I love the product but it would be great if the container was recyclable. Please consider taking care of the environment
"I have been using this product for one month. My skin looks amazing. The product is reasonably priced, smells great and is effective too!"
I like the way the hydro boost water gel feels to my face. It is not oily feeling and my skin doesn't feel dry.
Awesome product I can recommend to my friends and family I been using this product last couple weeks and I can notice change
I have used this before and absolutely loved the feel of my skin when I use it. Never feels greasy or heavy and moisterizes my face very well.
I love the way my face feels after applying the hydro boost water gel. I use it under my BB cream and foundation.
"It seems to work well enough for a lighter moisturizer for the summer months but the smell is awful. I'm not sure why they add fragrance when the gel-cream doesn't include it, now I'm stuck with what I purchased and won't use."
"If you have oily skin, this is for you! It drys quickly while perfectly making the skin feel refreshed and moisturized. I am on my 4th jar and I can not live without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel really is great for hydrating your skin. It has a nice gel consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
NEUTROGENA® HYDRO BOOST WATER GEL IS AMAZING!! IT REALLY IS A REFRESHING EXPERIENCE. YOU REALLY NEED TO TRY THIS. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is seriously my favorite moisturizer ever! It's not greasy and soaks into my skin versus just sitting on top. The feeling lasts all day too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! I have very oily skin and this does not leave me feel greasy and it is not heavy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A little goes a long way. I use a pea size amount after washing my face, wait until it dries, and then follow up with my regular oil-free moisturizer. This instantly helps keeps moisture locked in and boots the function of my moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I suffer from dry skin and always have trouble finding a good moisturizer. This is awesome for dry skin! Especially in the winter when your skin is a little more sensitive. Only downside it felt a little on the sticky side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used every high-end product on the market to help with wrinkles and sagging skin on my neck, I have also used Botox on my forehead and eye area. With HydroBoost I have found my remedy. My neck has improved dramatically and the forehead lines are becoming less of a worry. I love this product, it has replaced all other products for me! I may even be able to replace the need for Botox- amazing!"
"This product does wonders for dry, acne prone skin. When I initially tried it, i was surprised by how lightweight the formula was and how quickly it absorbed into my skin. This was just a random store purchase, but now it has become a staple piece in my skincare routine. I would recommend this to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i started using this a couple days ago on my combination skin, it works good on my oily forehead and is exactly what i want for that part of my face. However, it leaves the rest of my face dry and flaky, (which it never is). it gets worse if i try to apply makeup too. i'm not sure why it's making most my face dryer than it was before. not sure what to do."
This moisturizing gel feels very light on my skin but provides the higher amount of moisture that I would expect from a thick cream. The gel works well under my foundation. I like that there is not a strong scent because I have a sensitive nose. I originally received this product in a pump bottle which I prefer to a jar that I have to stick my fingers into. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is a lightweight, oil-free facial moisturizer with a powerful hydrater that holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water, keeping skin plumped and hydrated. It's a cool, pale-blue cream that jiggles ever so slightly when you move the jar and feels like liquid to the touch. It has a pleasantly aquatic scent—crisp and watery—and absorbs instantly. The only problem with this product is the price is very expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My nieces talked me into trying this. To me it smells horrid, very chemically. But bc I liked how light and cooling it felt, I tried it for a couple of weeks, but then -bc of the smell- set it aside. In spite of closing the jar tight, I was later shocked to see that most of the product had literally evaporated! There was barely any left at the bottom of the jar! Primary ingredient, water. Water evaporates! Stinky smell at that. Total waste of my money."
"This product is seriously my favorite moisturizer! I have struggled with combo skin and mild acne my entire life, I'm now nearly 30. It's hard finding a moisturizer that does it's job without causing my face to breakout. I am able to use the NEUTROGENA® Hydro Boost Water Gel daily and my skin LOVES it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product, it feels very light weight on your skin. Works very well at replacing moisture in your skin. The only problem, as far as I can tell this is not a recyclable container.. which is a bummer because it is a HUGE chunk of plastic."
"THIS IS AMAZING!!! IT HAS CHANGED THE WHOLE VIEW AND FEEL OF MY SKIN!!! MY SKIN IS SMOOTH, SOFT AND ENJOYABLE TO LOOK AT IN THE MIRROR AGAIN. I LOOK FORWARD TO USING THIS EVERYDAY BC IT MAKES ME FEEL MORE CONFIDENT!!"
I was very excited to try this product yet my skin has been hurting all day because of it and has become very blotchy. Odd for a product that is supposed to offer hydration. Won't be purchasing again.
It works I know it's a little pricey but it did helped with my skin give it like a week to see results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"unsure why, but i purchased this product twice in my life time, when it first rub into skin, it does give you the sense of instantly absorb. but overnight i do find rubbery/ eraser like residue [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm on my like 4th jar of this and I can't get enough. Most moisturizers clog my pores and I have tried various different kinds. This was recommended by a beauty guru on youtube (Lauralee if wondering) and I have been using it ever since. I have got many others hooked on this product as well.
"I have been using Neutrogena products since I was in elementary. This product Hydroboost is the most amazing product there is. I never had skin problems, but I love the cool feeling on my skin and it does keep it hydrated. I have oily skin and this product is SPOT ON for my skin type. I wish i could order a case. Please do not go off the market. I don't know what I would do if I could not get this anymore."
"This is by far the best moisturizer I've used. Many moisturizers break me out because they're too oily, but this one is perfect!! I've been using this for around a year, and I will probably never use another moisturizer. The only thing I will say is that the blue dye is kind of annoying. I get that's it's trying to imitate water, but I think that this product would be even better if the harsh, chemical-y dye was taken out."
I have repurchased this cream multiple times. I enjoyed using it but the ingredients include fragrance and blue dye. It would be a really great cream if it did not include these two unnecessary ingredients. I have tried the extra-dry skin version to not have fragrance and blue dye but it is a bit too much for my skin. Please come out with a new version without fragrance and dye. I would buy it again if this change happened!
"I had the same problem as reviewer NayB. The first time I used it my skin felt a bit dry. After 3 nights of use my face felt burning as soon as I put it on. I do alternate between retin A and a mild glycolic acid cream because I have extremely oily skin. I thought this would help with the dryness that occurs in the winter when I use these products. The retin A and glycolic acid cause no issues in the summer, but really needed a moisturizer for the winter. Will be on the search for something else."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Neutrogena, for this incredible product! I can't tell you how many products I have tried in an effort to rid my 83-year-old face of flaking skin due to life in the Californa desert. At last, you have provided everything I have been searching for in facial skin care! I am in love with my new look and will no doubt try the eye Hydo Boost version as well. So grateful!"
"I have always been a Neutrogena junkie and have used many different moisturizers that fit within my combination, acne prone skin made within the skincare line.. After buying this moisturizer, I will never go back! It's so lightweight and instantly absorbs into your skin, it's like you can actually feel your skin becoming hydrated at the tips of your fingers. I love that it does not leave my skin feeling oily"
"I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and I ordered this because it is one of the only moisturizers I've ever found with zero comedogenic or irritating ingredients (nothing over a 1). It doesn't break me out, but when I put it on it stings and leaves my skin red. Nothing else on the label is an irritant, so I have to assume it is attributable to the fragrance, which is pretty overwhelming. Bummer. I would try the unscented hydrogel, but it has synthetic beeswax, which is comedogenic : ("
Hydro Boost Water Gel is simply the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have had oily/acne prone skin my entire life and have tried everything from dermatologist recommendations to high priced department store moisturizers. Nothing has kept my skin soft and oil free until now. I use it twice a day and my skin never feels oily.
I recently purchased this product at my local drugstore and decided to test it on my face right away. I washed my face with the Hydro Boost gel cleanser and rubbed the water gel all over my skin. It felt very light and didn't make my skin feel oily. My skin is sensitive and a tiny bit dry and most lotions burn my skin as I use them but this one did the complete opposite! My skin has never felt smoother and is very soft to touch. I would totally recommend this product. Thanks Neutrogena!
"I have been a staunch Chanel skin care product user for years. After paying hundreds of dollars for creams, serums etc.. I decided to try the Neutrogena Hydro line and purchased the water gel and eye cream. My skin is sensitive so I tend to be careful with eye creams since watery eyes is a problem reaction at times. I have been using both products for a couple of months, finishing my first tube and jar and I love the results. My skin never looked better and the value is amazing! I am now heading out to restock my supply."
"I love this product. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I wish they didn't put any scent in it. If a person has asthma, this will bother them and they don't need to add more stuff to good stuff already. The least amount of added stuff, the better. It would cost the company less to add less with wonderful results. I would be happy also to have it clear instead of using dyes. Clear like water is good, no added stuff. Company, please consider this."
So I purchased this product because I heard such great things about it and I wasn't disappointed.
It applies very easily and a little goes a long way. I have super oily skin and my skin just loves it. It does not leave any oily residue and it absorbs quickly. Doesn't leave your skin feelings rubbery or heavy either.
I also love it because make up is easy to apply with it. Im very satisfied!
"My dermatologist recommended the Neutrogena Hydro Boost line to me and I have purchased the serum, water gel, and eye gel cream. I like the eye gel cream, which seems to have no scent, and the serum, which has a little scent. The water gel, however, is unpleasant to wear because is too strongly scented. It would be great if Neutrogena would reformulate the water gel with less or--better yet--no scent."
I've been using this for about a year and love it. It works on my middle age skin and equally as well on my teenage daughter without causing break-outs. We live in a very dry climate so it is a real statement to say it keeps our skin soft and moisturized. My comment is that the package uses SO much plastic! I'm certain there is a way to cut down on that waste. I'd feel better about how many we've purchased if it didn't put so much in the trash or recycle bin.
"I don't usually write reviews, but everyone needs to know how amazing this is! I have really dry skin in the winter and I was looking for a morning moisturizer. This product works wonders. It completely soaks in and leaves no sticky residue. It is perfect for under makeup and keeps your face moisturized all day long! You only need a small amount for your entire face so it is definitely worth the money! It lasts for a very long time."
"I daily use the Hydro Boost with SPF !5% in the morning, and the Hydro Boost Water Gel w/out sunscreen at night. I'm 73, but my skin is very moist. I don't need those heavy creams anymore...my skin is too thin now to absorb most of them. I will stick with Hydro Boost Water Gel!"
"I can't even begin to say how happy I am about this moisturizer! I've never found a moisturizer that was light enough for my skin. I have very oily skin and I feel like my pores clog easily. This moisturizer isn't a heavy cream at all. It's a really light gel and it gives my skin such great moisture while being so light on my skin! Not to mention, it smells FABULOUS. So pleased and I'll continue buying."
"I love this stuff. I only tried it a couple times, but I am already in love with it. I do have a question though. After you apply Hydro Boost, can you apply another daily moisturizer? At night is it OK to apply my night time wrinkle cream? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks Neutrogena for making such a wonderful product. Love all your products!"
"I'm 65 and spend weekends in the Florida Sun (Flea Market Vendor) and for this in spite of using spf 100 have developed seriously deep wrinkles... Have used every product in the market and have found that Hydro Boost Gel is the only one that works instantly leaving my skin supple, wrinkles disappear and the scent is soft and quite lovely.... The value is excellent... Thank you for finally producing such a wonderful product....."
"I have oily skin and dry skin and I am sensitive as well, am oily in the T-zone and dry on the cheeks. It's been hard to find a moisturizer that would fit my skin needs, this not only moisturize the dry spot it doesn't over moisturizer the oily ones. Not only that it doesn't irritate, living my skin softer, smother and hydrated."
I have been struggling with skin issues from my medication I need to take for medical conditions. This product is the only thing that has helped. My skin is no longer dry and blotchy and it is amazing. I also adore the cool feeling when I apply it. I wish I could soak my whole body in a tub of this every day. THANK YOU NEUTROGENA ! YOU HAVE MADE THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.
"I am a senior citizen (age 65), who doesn't like putting greasy products on my face. This is so light, and absorbs so easily. Keeps my face hydrated all day. Love it! I just learned that they have an unscented version, and since I am allergic to fragrance, I can't wait to give that a try."
"I have combination oily skin. I bought it few days ago, I was shocked about how my t-zone not getting oily like my other moisturizer. I'm wondering is it because this moisturizer is so hydrating? Because face producing oil because it lack of hydration. The only con was I don't like the scent. But will definitely continue using this product."
"I have always suffered with dry skin on my face due to having eczema, and also very sensitive skin. I find it hard to use any sort of face creams, even the sensitive ones with out it stinging my face for at least 5 minutes or making me go red and hot. This cream doesn't do any of that, it smells amazing and my skin is so soft to touch now. I have only been using this product for 7 days and I love it! I apply every night before I go to bed, or before applying makeup."
"This product smells great! I have been using this product for over 6 weeks now and although initially, I loved the lightweight, hydrating feel of it, I now recognize it might be what is causing the burning, irritating sensation on the skin under and around my eyes. I might give the gel cream a try but am a bit skeptical, given the price. The product feels great on the rest of my skin!"
"In the summer of 2016, I was searching for a face cream but stumbled upon and consequently started using Hydro Boost Water Gel - and I loved it right away! The moisturizing effects coupled with the sheer lightness of the product was perfect for me and I was fairly impressed with myself for 'discovering' it. After using it for a few weeks, a friend came to stay with me and couldn't believe that I suddenly looked to be in my early 30's. I'm 48! This product is my forever friend!"
"This is a great product, but I can't use it daily like I would like. My skin is sensitive to fragrance. Usually I can always find neutrogena products fragrance free - but can't find this without fragrance. Works so well on aging combination skin, but have to limit use."
My overall skin texture has improved and my skin feels and looks wonderful. I gave been using this product for the past two months and am anxious to see how it works in the winter. I also have very sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate it at all. Compared to other moisturizers it relatively economical to use and works very well with makeup.
"I have fairly normal skin and I've been using this product for a little while now. It keeps me so hydrated and supple. Also this sinks into the skin so nicely, it's perfect for under makeup. I hate things that sit on your face but it absorbs so quickly and has a very pleasant scent."
"I have very oily, acne-prone skin, so regular moisturizers usually leave me looking like I swam in Crisco. This gel was a welcome relief as it did not leave me looking shiny, absorbs well into the skin (providing you don't use too much) and smelled heavenly. My face was left moisturized minus the oil slick. I would definitley recommend this to my oily-skin ladies. I got this product complimentary from Influenster for review and testing."
"I'm nearing 40 and my skin is getting dryer, especially just under my lip. This product has been the only thing that has worked on it. Also... it. Smells. Incredible. I usually don't like scented products, but this scent is so crisp and clean, I love sniffing it before applying. It's the highlight of my morning get-ready routine"
I bought this product after watching a skin care video by a beauty influencer on YouTube. I have been using different neutrogena products since I was a teen and besides the makeup removing wipes this is no my FAVORITE! I'm on my second jar now and it has brought so much moisture of my skin and I never had a break out which is huge for me. It's affordable and the smell is an added bonus. Overall i would recommend this product for sure!
"I purchased this product in Jan 2017 in search of a good moisturizer. Didn't think it would work because it said hydrating, instantly making me think I would look like a GREASE SLICK. Boy was I wrong. I am very oily and with this product I not only hydrate my skin, I DON'T have to touch up my makeup due to oil breakthroughs. It's the only moisturizer for me."
"Many products claim to give you ""visible"" results in a few weeks. This one does. I truly believe my skin looks better and that I look younger. I wasn't sure I would like a gel, but this goes on great, smells wonderful and, most importantly, it works!"
It's been such a difficult struggle finding a moisturizer that balances the oil on my T-Zone without making my cheeks oily and after buying and trying dozens of moisturizers I started to lose hope that I would ever find one perfect for my skin until now. This was actually recommended by my dermatologist and I am so thankful it is. This gel is super hydrating without feeling tacky and makes my skin feel incredibly soft.
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! I have oily combination skin and this one doesn't make my skin more oily or greasy looking. Also, this is the only moisturizer that doesn't clog my pores. Some of the moisturizers that I have used leaves something like a residue on my pores and makes me break out. So I was so happy I tried this one. I hope this doesn't get discontinued!"
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer!!!! At 64 I still have acne prone skin. I've tried several of the ""high end"" skin care lines. All work great for the first 30 days (i.e., during the time period for returning them) and then my skin will start to break out again. I've been looking for a moisturizer for my face and neck that was not a lotion or cream and this is the only product I've been able to find. Easy to apply, absorbs quickly, and my face feels so smooth and soft!!!"
"I absolutely love this product! It's everything I've been looking for in a facial moisturizer... And more! It soaks into the skin in about 30 seconds (or less), leaves my skin moisturized all day long, and smells amazing! I recently got a sunburn and have been using this to moisturize my burnt skin (once the irritation went down) and I've barely peeled my skin's so moisturized! My only hope is that Neutrogena makes a body lotion with this formula... That would be amazing!"
"I've finished using the hydra boost extra dry skin and loved it because it was simple, fragrance-free and dye-free. I thought the normal version would be the same... Turns out it has a strong fragrance and a blue tint! Why do you have to put in all that extra useless"
ingredients Neutrogena ?!?!? I definitely will not repurchase but will repurchase the extra dry skin version
"This product is just amazing! It absorbs so quickly into the skin, doesn't stay greasy and it's perfect for use under make up as it keeps your skin hydrated and dewy looking and not super oily, even in the T-Zone! I used this twice a day (morning & night) and I can say it shows results very quickly. I wake up looking refreshed and my skin doesn't look or feel dehydrated. 10/10 would recommend this product."
"How refreshing! I wish someone had thought of this sooner. No more gooey creams for me. My face drinks this like cool water, feels soft and smooth, and there is no residue or pore-clogging. It's the very best thing I have ever put on my face. Thank you!"
I have tried nearly every type of moisturizer for dry/ combo 45 year old skin. This stuff is amazing. Smells great and leaves my skin feeling velvety soft. Hydration lasts all day and wears very well under makeup. So happy to have finally found a product that actually works.
"I saw this product advertised on television. I love and use Neutrogena products, so I decided to buy the Hydro Boost Water Gel. I loved the way my skin felt after one use. I am on the end of my first week and I will be ordering this again! It is light and not greasy. You will not regret this purchase!"
i tried this water gel hydro boost and at first thought the texture was wrong and the smell reminded me of a product i used i the 70s (nice & Icy) hey did you make that. well honestly i thought rats i can only use this at night but oh my gosh it melted into my skin and puffed my face or infused my face with skin fullness i could feel with my hands when i washed my face. my problem now can't find water gel in stores had to buy cream . it works too but so prefer water gel version seems lighter
"I received a sample at my local Target and loved this product from the start. I have combination skin and it is just the right amount of moisture. It is so soothing to use at the end of the day after I take off my make up. This cream has such a wonderful scent. Usually scented creams bother my face, but not this one. Nice job!"
"I was about to buy the product. I had a research on internet, and was sure about it. Then I read the cover. I would like to know why methylparabene is indicated on the box but not here on the website."
I would like to decide according to your reply.
Thank you.
"At the risk of sounding dramatic, I can't rave about this product enough. My skin has become extremely dry, flaky and tight-feeling as I've gotten older and I couldn't find anything to help. This product is like water in the desert for my skin - I feel instant relief when putting it on, and it keeps my skin feeling smooth, soft and hydrated without the greay, heavy feel of so many other products. I am 100% sold."
"I've been using this product along with the hydro boost serum for just over a month. I have always had extremely dry skin, especially on my forehead. I experienced immediate hydration the first time I used it, and continue to love it. This is the first product that has consistently worked for me (and I've tried LOTS of products). THANK YOU NEUTROGENA!!"
"Purchased this because I turned 26 and decided that just putting milk on my face with a cotton ball once a day for 15 minutes is not enough anymore, but I didn't want to get cream/lotion that would be too chemically for my relatively good skin. This stuff is perfect; I don't even want to explore other options."
This product is great but I wish it was in a different package the jar is good but I would prefer a bottle or squeeze tube. Overall product is amazing my skin feel hydrated and supple. I have a bunch of moisturizers on my dresser and everyday when I need to moisturize I always reach for the water gel wouldn't use anything else.
I think this product is really good my skin type can change from dry to greasy so a moisturiser that hydrates without a greasy look is just what I needed! I originally picked this product up as I had seen a review. It did say that it had an SPF 15 but I did not see this on the package... does it have an SPF15?
"I absolutely love everything about this product aside from the smell and the strange blue dye. This product does everything it says and more, doesn't cause break outs, lasts a long time, but has the worst fragrance added to it. I'm normally not very sensitive to scents but this product smells like a cheap air freshener to the extent that it makes me cough when it's on my face. I'm going to switch to the cream-gel simply because it is fragrance and dye free, hopefully it won't be too hydrating for my oily skin."
"I have very reactive skin that breaks out almost every time I try a new product. This moisturizer is the best! It's lightweight, absorbs quickly, feels like water, doesn't smell heavy and doesn't have unnecessary ingredients. My skin is so much smoother and less irritated since using this. I'm on my second jar and have already bought a couple backups because I never want to be without it!"
"I am 73 and inactive ,have lung cancer, asthma, and arthritis. I have finally found something that works for me. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I use the hydro boost water gel in the morning and the hydro boost cream gel at night. It last about 1 mo. and then have to renew. I did and still love it. I am having trouble finding the pump makeup Healthy skin enhancer Lt to Neutral SPF20."
"I love that with just a little bit I can moisturize my entire face & neck without leaving a sticky residue like other moisturizers. This works perfectly under my Neutrogena concealers and really helps keep my face from getting too dry in the winter! Thanks Crowdtap & Neutrogena for the free sample. Disclaimer: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"This is hands down the best moisturizer i have ever used. I have normal to dry skin and this instantly soothes and hydrates my skin. I have also noticed since using this product, my skin has a natural glow to it that i didn't have before. My skin looks and feels radiant. I even got my dad using it, he loves it."
"I'm a 64 year old white female. My skin began to feel rougher as I aged. I could really tell a difference in the feel and look of my skin after one use. It was one of those ""wow"" moments. I was using the product every night but cut back to 4 times a week. Still getting fabulous results."
"I received this product as part of an Influenster package and was really surprised that it actually worked. I do not have extremely dry skin, but I do think I would benefit more from the gel, which I will be trying since this did help quite a bit. Overall, a good product, but the price is a bit steep. I say start off with a sample and go from there."
"I received this product through Influenster, but all opinions are my own. In fact, I have been using this product for years now, ever since I found it in Hong Kong. It is amazing! It says gel, but it is perfectly moisturizing - goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin hydrated and feeling refreshed all day. I have sensitive skin and live in a very dry climate, so I am always looking for serious moisturizers that can I go under make-up, and this is the perfect product. I can't wait to try the eye gel!"
"Influenster sent me this complimentary product for testing purpose and I completely fell in love with it. Don't let the word ""gel"" scare you, this gel does hydrate your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and supple, and you don't need to apply a moisturizer afterwards. I definitely recommend it!"
"Would you please consider making a fragrance free version? Great lightweight moisture that goes on without feeling sticky (like competitors) and so far has kept my skin quenched all day. This was my first return to Neutrogena in 8 years, after switching to more expensive products, and this one impressed me. While the smell is sweet, for sensitive skin I would prefer no fragrance- to the point where I'd consider switching back."
"After using Hydroboost moisturizer for a week my skin feels smoother and is noticeably more even in tone and texture. Also, my liquid foundation (which I am using less of) looks better on now too - pores, fine lines, and redness all show less now. Thank you Neutrogena!"
"Purchased a couple of months ago and fell in love!! Used it all up & just purchased a new jar - the scent is SO STRONG that i can hardly stand to use it and it burns my eyes. SO DISAPPOINTED! I can see no “scented/unscented” options, so what happened? Please help!"
I had a place on my face that I just couldn't get a handle on. I exfoliated with a 2 part product that heated up when mixed. It worked great everywhere but this one place. I almost gave up until I saw this. It worked the first time. I told all of my friends on facebook about it! Thank you for a great product and keeping it affordable.
"This is a great product, it does Not leave a greasy film. It fully absorbs fairly quickly and plumps up my skin nicely. Feels great. I have tried other products and they do not absorb and leave a film. This is a great product, I would highly recommend."
"I love the blue jar, as it is cosmetically appealing. However, this product is too lightweight for my Normal to Oily skin. I much prefer the ""Extra-Dry"" formula to this one. I still recommend this product to those of you who reside in humid climates or possess Oily/Acne skin types."
"I'm a CPA and obviously have stress during tax season. Every tax season I would suffer from my face being so dried out it hurt and I was having a hard time staying focused on work. I read about your product in People magazine and decided to give it a try. After a month, my face felt normal again. Thank you!!"
"I've been using this for a couple weeks and I am obsessed! It smells fresh and makes my skin so soft. My pores get clogged really easily, but they have already started clearing up since I started using this. I have also noticed I don't really get oily throughout the day anymore. I think this is because my face is already hydrated so it's not overproducing as much. I never write reviews but I was super impressed by how well this is working for me. Would recommend!"
"I completely dried up my face using tea tree oil and other acne products for a breakout. My face was peeling and flaking and was quite embarrassing. I bought this and the overnight hydro boost mask. Both are awesome products. I use this daily now as my. Moisturizer. I haven't broken out, it feels so refreshing, and works well alone or under makeup. My skin isn't flaking anymore and someone even commented saying my skin has a nice glow!"
I've been using this product daily for 2 months. I definitely agree with the claim that it doesn't clog pores. Finally I found a moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts. I live in Massachusetts where it gets really cold and dry but this product is super moisturizing and I rarely have dry skin with this product. I struggle with acne and get really bad breakouts at times. My breakouts haven't been as bad since using this product.
"This product is terrible. Whether you order online or buy in store it comes in a jar without a plastic piece over it to peel off. It's very smooth, but it dried my skin and left dry patches all over. I would put it on after my moisturizer and wake up with a flaky dry face. It also made me break out. DON'T BUY THIS."
"My skin is very sensitive and so is my nose. Most scents cause allergy-like symptoms, watery eyes, runny nose, itchy, or sore skin. I hesitated to buy this product, fearing more of the same, but I do trust Neutrogena. So glad I tried it. My skin is soft and smooth, the scent is light and pleasing, and no part of my body reacted badly to it. We have a winner! I moved from a moist climate to desert and my skin was not pleased. This is a game-changer. Thank you for such a great product!"
"I'm so bummed about this product. I bought this and the serum a few days ago after deliberating for weeks. Beautiful, enticing packaging. Everything feels nice in the bottle and on my fingers, but when I put it on my face, it gets very itchy. I just wanna wash it off! It's a shame because my skins does look very fresh and glowy, but I can't stand the itching! Also, the scent is strange, it reminds me of laundry soap. I feel bad because I love most Neutrogena products I try, but this one was a bust."
"I've tried a few moisturizing products, but all leave my skin feeling heavy, clogged, and oily. Neutrogena Gel face moisturizer is the only product that I can use, and my skin feels great! I can even wear my liquid or powder foundation too, and my face can breath!"
"I've been using it at least once a day, if not two times a day, depending on how often I wash my face- it's so refreshing and light on my skin, I've only been using it for a week and I've noticed a huge difference already in my skin's tones and textures. Totally in love with this stuff."
"This is the best moisturizer for my combination oily skin. I used to skip moisturizer in the morning because they all led me to get the ""greasies"" later in the day. But my skin was suffering without an AM moisturizer. This is perfect. It hydrates my skin without leaving a greasy, slick feel or making my t-zone oily as the day wears on."
"I loved this product! It smelled amazing and was so soft. After a few weeks of using it, my skin started to burn. It became hard to let it be exposed to wind, I'm from Boston our winter was horrible. So I swapped to just once a day, still nothing. i stopped using it and my skin immediately recovered. I loved the product and will still tell people it just wasn't for my sensitive skin."
I love the results I have received from the hydro boost water gel! I experienced slight irritation the first couple of days but after that everything was great! My skin is smooth and breakout free and I have even noticed a slight reduction in my laugh lines. Definitely worth a purchase! #gotitfree
"After one week of trying this product day and night, I did notice my skin being much more supple, smooth, and hydrated which was much needed considering we are in the middle of Winter here in the US. I wasn't sure if this product would dry quickly but I'm happy to report that it dries to a touchable finish."
Wow! I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately even though my skin looked and felt great the fragrance was OVERWHELMING! I smelled it from the time I put it in in the morning until I washed it off at night. I can't understand why they would put a fragrance in a face cream. I can't believe I read about this on a dermatologist blog. Almost great product. But ultimately an epic fail.
My skin has never been drier since starting to use this product. It seems like the gel almost dries out my skin so that I have to keep putting more on. I really want to love this product and I may try and push through it a little more but it just isn't working for me. My skin is so dry now! I think I will go back to what I was using before with more hyaluronic acid.
I can't say enough great things about this moisturizer! I have such sensitive skin and have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't irrate it. I have photosensitive skin due to having Lupus and have tried so many moisturizers that have caused irritation. This is so gentle on my skin and hydrates it beyond belief!
Thank you so much! ❤️❤️❤️
"This gel is remarkable! My dry, diabetic skin is so much more comfortable than before. Thank-you for Hydro-Boost. The only drawback is the price! It is frustrating to find a quality product, but understand cosmetic markups mean it might not be available to all who would benefit from its use."
"I was hoping to find a really great moisturizer, and this product felt nice right when I put it on, but absorbed so quickly and left my skin feeling dry. I had to apply another moisturizer on top of it. My skin is not overly dry, but not oily by any means. I had used a gel moisturizer in the past, but the product was discontinued and I could never find a replacement. I was hoping this was the one. This product is packaged very nicely and smells great, I wish I wasn't disappointed."
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer!! I have terribly dry skin, more so in the winter, and this has made an amazing difference in my skin's appearance and texture. I used this every morning and plan to purchase when I run out. I received this as part of my Influenster membership; opinions are strictly my own. This will become a part of my daily skin regimen!"
"This product is fabulous I have been using neutrogena products for at least 20 years,and this is wonderful I just turned 62 last month and I always have taken good care of my skin been told I don't look 62 so I'm keeping my Neutrogena and this Hydro Boost is everything they say it is!"
"I love this product so much! I have been having really dry skin and the Hydro boost Water Gel has helped my face feel less dry! I apply it on my face and wait about fifteen minutes before I add any face primer or foundation! My face feels amazing now that I have been using this! I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."
"I have been loving the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel. I was able to try it out courtesy of Influenster. It hydrates the skin without that greasy feeling, which I'm a huge fan of. Also, it dries extremely quickly so you don't have to wait forever to start putting on your makeup or getting on with your day. It's really a consistency that I've never experienced before. Overall, it's a really great drugstore product that I would definitely recommend! ‪#BehindTheGlow‬ ‪#Neutrogena‬"
"I bought this about 5 days ago as I have normal to dry skin and thought this could help me. Instead after two days of night time use, I woke up with small bumps all underneath my eyes and on my cheeks. After exfoliation and not using makeup they have began to shrink but they are still very itchy and red and I am hoping they don't last too long. Test this product before use!!"
"It leaves my skin so soft and smooth and it never feels greasy. I am not sure what the other reviewers are referring too but mine has virtually no scent at all, no blue dye and it does not sting or tingle. I use the cleanser as well and love that too."
"I have been using this in conjunction with the gentle facewash for over a year and it has done wonders for my skin. Even during the cold and windy Michigan winter, my skin did not chap! Keeping it moisturized has evened out the oil production for my face too and my normally acne prone skin cleared up so nicely! I never thought I would ever get compliments on my skin, but I have since using the hydro gel! I would highly recommend giving this product a try."
"I fell in love with this product the minute it touched my face! I have combination skin and usually the skin around my cheeks and specially my forehead gets super dry! Every moisturizer i tried felt too heavy on my face, but this one feels so soothing and light! It's amazing."
"After a week of use, i noticed my skin around my forehead was no longer dry or flaky."
"This product is amazing ,but I have a question is it normal that when I used it I get like a burning sensation on my skin than is redness in my chin after 2 minutes is gone and ot looks normal , and the next morning on my chin I see dead skin , I need to know if this is normal .. I really love the product I just need to know if this will not affect my skin .. I also wish that you guys recommend me more products for combination skin , Thank You."
I bought the gel-cream version first and that one broke me out which is weird because it doesn't have the fragrance in it..I guess cause it's heavier. The water gel only one so far has worked SO much better. My skin just soaks it up and it makes it feel nice. But it does have a scent which doesn't bother me . I have combo skin w dry patches. I recommend the water gel
I just found the Hydro Boost Water Gel today and am already in love with it. I had my skin moisture level checked before and after using this product. I went from 25% to 55%. It is so silky soft and it smells so fresh. I can't wait to see what the hydration levels show after using this product for a week.
I bought this item last week. I have oily skin and wanted a moisturizer that had no oils in it and was light weight and thought to give this a try. On my skin it feels so cooling and light and the smell is great I think. I have sensitive skin due to eczema and this did not irritate it at all. My skin is the most hydrated it's been.
"OMG!! and my husband made comments, which he hardly does. And the scents are heavenly, so refreshing and well scented."
Been using them now for months. I have introduced tenths of my friends. NEUTROGENA MIRACLE!
"PLEASE DONT EVER CHANGE. My only problem i cant find''EYE CREAM AND BODY LOTION"""
"I've been using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel at night after my normal skincare routine. My products tend to dry my skin out, and this moisturizer is the perfect remedy for my flakey skin! I wake up looking refreshed! It smells great and it really works instantly!"
"I was so excited to receive this as a member of Crowdtap. I tried the product right away and I loved it. My skin felt so soft. The scent was a little strong but not bad. The day after I used this product, my face broke out, it looks like a burn/rash. I have never had sensitive skin and I didn't change anything else in my routine, there is just something in this product that didn't agree with me."
"I like the product and how it feels on my skin. I would have recommended the product. However, I asked how much hyaluronic acid was in the product. For some reason that post was not published. I see now they only select posts that talk about how good the product is. If you don't say that, they won't post it. I don't like that and see all these great ratings are hand picked. I will be returning this product since I see customer questions aren't addressed?"
I have oily/combination skin and most moisturizers I've tried make my skin more oily or cause breakouts. This moisturizer is great though! It helps keep me from getting dry spots on my chin without making the rest of my face feel too oily. I'm so glad I tried this product.
"I have been really happy with the Hydro Boost exfoliating face wash so I thought I would try this water gel. I put it on last night and my face felt just a little dry and tight but I thought I was probably a little dehydrated. I put it on tonight and my face is burning. I washed it off after about 20 minutes and my face still feels tingly, tight, and red. I've read so many good reviews about this product, I'm disappointed!"
this product is is super moisturizing with out having a greasy feel to it . I feel it is very light weight on my skin and i love using it after getting out of a hot shower to bring back all the moisture to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product works pretty well but sometimes not quite enough for deep hydration if my skin gets dried out. I do love the way that it feels and doesn't stay very tacky once it dries. I use it mostly for my neck and face but I also use other moisturizers on my face now because I have skin issues but this is non irritating which is why it's in my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I could not get rid of my dry skin at all. I was using product after product and nothing was working. I used this a few times and dry hasn't been back at all. I use this twice daily. I highly recommend if you suffer from dry skin! No scent which is a huge win for me as well!
"This is by far one of the best products I have ever used! It is the perfect product for my oily skin. When using this after my hydro boost mask, I feel like my face has been completely refreshed and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so glad there is a Trial Size available bc a little goes a long way! This is my first time trying out this water boost get and omg let me tell you how amazing it feels on my skin. I applied it early in the morning and my skin was still feeling so soft and moisturized at the end of the day! The smell is nice and subtle. I definitely recommend.
"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel works SO great! I have lots of allergies and sensitivities to lotions, etc. and I have used this product for several years now. It feels so nice when applied because it's not greasy and it keeps my skin hydrated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this product a little over a month ago. It feels nice and moisturizing on the skin and looks great when you apply it before your makeup...BUT sadly this products breaks me out terribly. When I took my makeup off I had SIX new friends pop up on my face. It's a shame because it felt very nice on my skin. I guess this moisturizer just isn't meant for me.
I literally loved using this Neutrogena boost water gel it left my face feeling super amazing I already recommend it to my family and friends. If you are looking for something that hydrates your face all day I highly recommend to use this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this after my favorite Mary Kate moisturizer was discontinued. I thought there was no alcohol in it but after using it for only 3 days my skin started to burn for hours after I put it on and get super red. I looked back and there is ethanol-based ingredients pretty high up in the list. I am so disappointed and don't recommend anyone with even semi-sensitive skin get this product!
"I used this product for maybe a week and I woke up one day to my face burning and looking blotchy. The next day my skin was red, blotchy and VERY dry, my skin was peeling and after 4 days of not using the product, I still have VERY dry skin. I know this works well for people but use it with caution! I have oily/combination skin."
"My 51 year old skin no longer looks that old, and I say it all belongs to Hydro Boost Water Gel. Use the SPF version during the day, and the other at night. Absorbs quickly and some of my little lines and wrinkles disappear almost immediately. Best beauty investment ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Having Acne prone skin is something I have lived with and struggled to control for years now. Most of the Acne meds I have used were very drying making my skin look dull and much older than my real age. This moisturizer has brought back the moisture, youthful look every one should have. it didnt happen over night, just give it a few months before seeing any good results. So I just using for at least 6 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this stuff. It has helped my dry winter face recover and has given me more confidence. I often use this in combination with my foundation to help achieve the look I want and to lock in the moisture. Also, the material that the container is made of is awesome for getting every last drop. I highly recommend this stuff!"
"Love this stuff, worth the price. I wish they were sold bigger sizes though."
"please cut down the scent, it is overpowering!!! otherwise great!"
So hydrating and fills in pores as a added bonus .
I bought this a year a go and am so happy that I did
Helps so much and really fast and effective. Lightweight and oil free not heavy works magic

I love Hydro Boost. It really sooths the skin and just feels so refreshing on a hot summer day after I've come home from work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just bought this product and am incredibly alarmed that it does not have a safety seal on it. So in theory, anyone could tamper with this product which is very alarming when it's promoting skin health."

It's so refreshing and moisturizing for my dry skin and it doesn't break me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product in my allure box this month and I was very excited to try it. I love how light it is when applied but it quenches my dry winter skin. This is my go to night moisturizer now!
"This Hydro Boost Water Gel is a fantastic product! I have used it for about 4 months, and it really makes a difference in the look and feel of may complexion."
"Please offer fragrance free options for all of your products. Or better yet, just don't add fragrance to anything. Really don't need perfume on my face."
"I use the whole hydro boost collection. I start my cleansing my face with the gel cleanser then use the serum, eye cream, then top it off with this moisturizer. My face has never felt or looked as clean as it does now. It's amazing."
Love it but for some reason it burns my skin when first applied. I will continue to use it as I haven't found such a good moisturizer for my oily/dehydrated/acne-prone skin.
My skin is very oily and I have to watch what I put on my face because it makes my skin oily but not this product. My skin has truly gotten softer and looks younger. I love it.
"Hi, I don't care what color it is as long as it works. I don't want to slather a chemical dye all over my skin or a uanessacry fragrance. You could pick up so many more buyers by being fragrance and dye free."
"This is a nicely textured hydrating gel that leaves no oily residue. I really wish they would make a fragrance free version though. This smells like febreeze and gives me a headache. For this reason, I had to stop using it."
"My dtr and I like your product, however we feel there is only a small amount of product and that we are paying for excess packaging and unnecessary thick jar. Very wasteful and not environmentally wise."
I thought this would be a great product since it's water-based. I've been using for a week and my skin is more dry and flaky. I am also breaking out a bit - red bumps. Very disappointed.
Product dulled then burned my skin. I was really disappointed. I expected soft skin but it dried out my skin. I searched the internet to see if I was the only one
"OMG!! I bought this product almost a month ago and really really i can't stop love it. is so fresh and make feel my skin so well, stop shinning almost all the day. I really recommended this gel for all of you. NEUTROGENA YOU DID IT AGAIN!!"
Xoxo
"Because I am a swimmer, I have really dry skin. Since i've been using this product my skin is really soft. I am acne prone and because it has no oils it works amazing on me. When i use it, my skin immediately became soft. I love it!"
I bought this online. It was described as fragrance and dye free. When it arrived I realized the product had fragrance and dye in it. I'm so disappointed.
Ive bought the serum many times and loved it. This time i tried the gel. I was surprised by both the strong scent and the blue dye. They are both unnecessary. Im going back to the serum.
As soon as i put this product on my face and neck it started tingling and burning? Is this supposed to happen? I like how smooth my face feels but not the burning feeling and tingly pricks im getting ....
My skin has started getting drier as I pass 35 but most moisturizers are so heavy that my skin feels gross. This is the first product (including expensive options) that has hydrated my skin and left it feeling clean and fresh all day.
Great moisturizer - pleasant scent - better than much more expensive products. Skin absorbs immediately and feels soft without greasy residue. I use it day and night on face and neck.
I love how this feels on my skin and how my skin looks but the scent is so strong it gives me a migraine. I've tried it a few times but each time I've had to remove it because of the smell.
I bought it few months ago for the first time and I love this cream! My skin is very soft after first use and I just ordered another one (3rd).
It's perfect under makeup!
I'm 78 years old and have been using Hydro Boost Water Gel for Extra Dry Skin for about one year. It is just the very best!!! I do not use any other makeup but would just love to have a formula that contains sunscreen. Any chance?
"I loved it. The product smells really really good. I use it day and night. The most important part which I loved it most is, it can be used under make up. Awesome. Very refreshing :)"
I've been using this product for a while now. In the summer it worked great on my skin. But now that it's winter I notice it dried out my face and left it flakey.
Hydro Boost is a blessing for my problems. I use it daily to help with those expected problems. I highly recommend it for those of you with similar issues.
I've been using for 6 months now and this is great. It does exactly what it says...and it's a great primer too. My skin is so soft and my make up glows it's sets real nice.
Skin feels smooth and soft but it smells like fabric softener. And it strong. I don't know if I can continue using it because of the smell. Works well under make up.
I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and absolutely love this product. I have combination skin and this is the only product that I have used that moisturize my face without leaving it oily or shiny. It's the best ever!
"This product made my skin really soft and it keeps me feeling hydrated all day long. You just have to apply it twice a day, in the morning and at night. This is one of the best skin creams/gels I've used so far."
"I have very sensitive skin and am 43 years old, my skin was so dry until I tried this it is one of the best products I have ever seen. It did not irritate my skin and I noticed a difference immediately. You must try it."
"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used! My dry patches are gone and everything. Though I wish they sold this in bigger jar so I don't have to keep repurchasing so often. Other than that, it's amazing I am highly impressed!"
I have tried so many products (wasted so much money) over the years for my sensitive/oily skin and finally money well spent!!!!! I love this product so much and I'm on my 3rd round. Please don't ever discontinue
This product is more than amazing. It is perfect for my oily/dry skin. I love that it absorbs so quickly and wears well under make-up. My face feels smooth and supple.
I bought this today after carefully searching for a moisturizer with no oil and suitable for older skin. The perfume made my eyes sting and the moisturizer made my face itch. Another $20 down the drain.
This is very good moisturizer. It absorbs quickly with no sticky or greasy feel. In the summer I keep it in the fridge to give my skin a cool feeling after a hot day
"My boyfriend bought this for me about a month ago and I've been using it everyday. I love this product but for some reason, it burns a little. I get a great cooling effect, but it burns just a tad."
I love this stuff. I get told I'm 20 and I'm really 35. I actually got my cashier where I bought it at to purchase it. I will definitely recommend this to people. I use it in the morning and at night
I am absolutely in love with this moisturizer. It is not greasy and has a pleasant scent. I can really feel the difference in my skin as it hydrates it very well.
"I am 44 and have very dry and sensitive skin. This gel is so soft and rich, just a touch of a finger is enough for all my face, I'm so happy with this product. Thank you Neuteogena!"
Has a Very nice fragrance that when dries you don't feel it anymore. Boost your skin after 30 minutes in a way many other expensive creams have not done before for me. Price is reasonable. Very much recommend.
I have rosacea with sensitive skin tending toward dryness. This product does not irritate my skin and feels wonderful. I don't notice any odor with the product so don't understand what others are saying.
"Was looking for a substitution for Clinique Dramatically Different gel and tried this. LOVE!!! Cheaper and yes, better! So glad I tried it and will definitely buy again."
"I bought this 3 days ago I use it after shower and after washing my face at night and my skin feels like is going to break, I have a rash and itchy face."
It did what it said the very first time I used it. I rested my face in my hands hours after I put it on and could not believe it was my face I was touching!! It's so plump and soft.
I wanted to try this but I'm confused because it claims to be non comedogenic even though dimethicone is the second ingredient and doesn't that clog pores ?
I have combination oil dry skin and this is my new favorite moisturizer. It absorbs really st and I think it smells good. My only issue is that it's a little pricey but you get a lot of product which is nice.
I suffer from extremely dry skin and this product answered all my prayers... A little goes a long way! I am amazed at the condition of my skin and all of my friends are pleased as well. Awesome product
"Moisturizes and won't break my skin out, even in high humidity and heat. Perfect for summer. I wish they'd make a giant tub of this for all over the body."
I love this product and after using it for just two weeks i can already tell that my face is staying hydrated and not dried out. I especially needed that during these cold winter months.
I have super oily skin and this literally saved my life I just put this on alone after I wash my face in the morning and through out the day my skin is supple and looks hydrated instead of greasy thank you neutrogena !!
"I've seen so many good reviews about this product; I was so excited to purchase it. After putting it on, it burned my face so bad. I was so excited to use it, but I just cannot. It physically makes me think my face is on fire. I'm so disappointed."
"I really like this product, i use it by chance and I have to say that I will buy it again, i can feel the difference when i don't use it, I highly recommend to apply the cream in the morning..!"
I have been using this product since it came out and I love it. All of the Hydo Boost products are excellent! They leave my skin feeling soft and clean. I try other brands once in a while but always come back to Neutrogena!
Yo compré hace una semana el producto. Me parece buena la textura y es bueno para aplicarlo antes del maquillaje. El único problema que tengo es que cuando lo aplico arde un poco y me ha enrojecido ciertas zonas de la cara. ¿Debería seguir usándolo?
It works so well for my combination skin and a little definitely goes a long way it's not sticky or greasy and absorbs well I usually apply it after my shower
The best moisturizer for anyone with oily or combination skin. I have tried a lot of moisturizers and spent a lot of money trying to find one that is good for oily problem skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I don't have super dry skin so I liked this moisturizer. I had others like the gel-cream because they have drier skin. I didn't buy the one with the SPF in it so that will be my next purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't read the reviews before I purchased this. I was surprised this burned when I 1st put it on. I thought maybe it should and kept using it thinking my skin would get use to it. After a couple of weeks it still burns. So disappointed.
"Excellent product lasting effect, I recommend my friends to try at least once. Thank Team Health Essentials. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
All these products are definitely worth it. The work extremely well. Very hydrating leaving your skin looking well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I like the fact itâs a trial size, this way i can try it! So far it has not made my face break out from allergic reaction! Iâm very pleased at the ease it goes on my face and feels good! Thank you Neutrogena!"
"I have really dry skin. Ive been using this stuff for 2 years now and I can honestly say this stuff does exactly what I need it too. It's very light (not greasy or oily), it has SPF, doesnt leave that white under tone that I've experienced with other moisturizers. My only con would be that It's alittle pricy for me but alittle goes along way and it is definitely worth it."
I had saw a dark skin YouTuber by the name of Jackie Aina using this and saying it's so bomb. But I put it on after cleaning and my skin burned. It busted my skin up do not use this. It smelt scented at first and now I know u shouldn't use this. Terrible product
"I have combination/oily skin and it's always a struggle to find a moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin super greasy. This is the second water based moisturizer I've used and I'm honestly not that impressed. It feels like no matter how much product I use, my skin is still left feeling tight and dehydrated. I would rather recommend the L'Oréal water based moisturizer which I've used before this and achieved better results with."
It's been almost 2 years since I strarted using this and I still love it. I have oily skin and this does not leave my face dry or patchy. My skin feels very smooth after using it. It absorbs very quickly. It does not make me break out at all. I also use the eye cream but I don't see much of a difference with that but it's still refreshing.
Bought for my daughter because this product disappears off shelves everywhere!
Hey lease please make a body wash with this scent. It is sooooo wonderfully fresh
"Light weight moisturizer that I love , however it makes my skin look oily by the end of the day ."
I have been using his product for over a year and love how it makes my skin feel
"I've been using Hydroboost Water Gel for the past 3 weeks and it's amazing. It goes on light and it's a great moisturizer. It doesn't make me feel oily at all. I would highly recommend it I !tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I received this for free from Influenster for testing purposes, and while I was SUPER excited to receive a full sized jar, I was disappointed when it BURNED after applying it. I have sensitive skin that is very dry from winter, but I use several other moisturizers that do not burn, so I'm not sure why this one did, but I don't want to use it again!"
Bought this a month ago... I have suffering terrible dry skin and I thought it would help. My dry skin began to rash and burn... It took me some time to realize that the dry skin was not causing the Burning Rash... It was the hydro-boost... I later confirmed it by testing it on my arm which immediately had the same burning rash though without the dry skin present on my face... I liked the feel smell and packaging of the product... But I will be finding something else and avoiding Neutrogena products in the future...
"I've been using the Hydro Boost line, and I absolutely love it. It goes on smooth, cool, not greasy, leaves smooth soft skin, they stays moisturized hydrated through out your day. I sometimes reapply because it looks and feels that good. Would highly recommend the Hydro Boost line."
This product instantly absorbed into my skin and felt great. I could feel my skin feel smoother and plumber and it felt like i had nothing on. It also didn't interfere with my makeup. I have dry skin and it kept me hydrated all day..I do think I need something richer for nighttime though.
"I recieved this product from influenster for review. I have been using this for 3 weeks now and absolutely love It. I have either oily skin or really dry depending on the season, this is great for the warm days when my skin is just too oily. I highly recommend it. It smells great. The price is a little on the higher side but you don't need a lot, so the jar will last you a while."
I am loving it this moisturizer. I have extra sensitive skin which is dry and flaky and this has helped so much. It goes on so nice and soaks into the skin nicely. It doesn't leave a sticky film and the smell is amazing. It is refreshing to my face and calms my skin when I have any irritation from the day.
I just bought this product along with the exfoliating hydro boost wash and regular gel wash and I'm blown away! For years I've been looking for a product that would relieve my extremely dry skin. The exfoliating wash is great because it scrubs off all the dead skin cells and left my face so smooth. This gel cream is incredible because it doesn't feel greasy and it's cool on the skin while hydrating. I'm so grateful this product exists!
"I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free, from #influenster for the purpose of my review. I must say, My skin get pretty dry around this time of year. And this water gel instantly quenches my skins thirst. I automatically feel smoother softer and all around healthier looking. I believe the word is ""supple"". I recommend this for all who are looking for something to stop the dry itchy face... #influenster #neutrogena #hydroboost"
"I love this gel because it is so super refreshing! It's hot in CA and this feels great when I apply it. It lightly moisturizes my skin without getting greasy. I only take away one star because it is pretty heavily fragranced like a clean linen candle. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I loved this product. I used it in the morning and at night before bed. I arose with fresh feeling soft skin and went to bed with the same. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, and all opinions are my own."
"I���m a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I have been using this product daily for about a week now and I have already noticed a huge change in my skin. My skin feels softer and truly has a natural healthy glow that I have never seen before. My favorite part of this product is that once you put it on, it is almost weightless and feels so natural. I highly recommend this to everyone!"

I bought this product about a month ago and I love it! I gave some to my mom too and it's now our favorite moisturizer. It's long lasting and works like a charm. It takes very little time to kick in.
This stuff is the absolute best! I will use it for life! Please don't stop selling it ever! :-)
I bought this product a week ago and it's horrible! It mad my face drier. I would never recommend this.
I've been using this water gel for over a year. Could not live without it. I'm 59 but my skin looks so much younger. I get many compliments.
"Now it has started to burn it went apply, even I feels burning after my makeup, I know it is caused by hydro gel cream."
I want this product to be fragrance free. I also would like to know the percentage of Hyaluronic Acid.
I bought this under the recommendation of my dermatologist and love it!! It smells so good and makes my skin felt silky and soft
This is my favorite product. I use it daily and since I have started using last year I have no had any issues with dryness.
A woman complimented me on my good skin. It was so moist and healthy looking. Wish you would make a body lotion like it.
"I'm using the second one. My skin feels a little hot and burns, especially when i used exfoliating products on the same day."
"I got a sample from my Dermatologist, and it makes your skin smooth immediately like a primer and softens!"
I got this in the mail and used for the first time and it made my skin so hydrated and soft . It wasn't dry for 24 hours . I highly recommend this
"due to having sensitive skin, I was a little afraid to try it, but I'm glad I did! Moisturizes nicely; a little goes a long way, too."
This is the best product for my oily skin. My skin feels great. I use in the morning; my makeup last super good all day.
I love this product. My skin feels hydrated for 24 hours. I am over the age of 60 and found my new face cream.
"This has got to be the best moisturizer ever,I have tried many high end top brands,but this is definitely amazing."
I bought this item about two weeks ago and since then the texture of my skin has gotten worse it made my face dry and made me break out like crazy!
I only use Neutrogena products and have for years. My dermatologist recommends them too. Imagine that!!!!
Neutrogena hydroboost nourishes my skin like nothing else.....Gives it GREAT moisture....skin feels smoother and looks younger.....Worth the money...
I have been using this product for about a month now and I absolutely love it!! Thanks Neutrogena!!!
"Better than the department store gel moisturizer, and more affordable. I will keep using this forever!"
Its the PERFECT product for this harsh winter weather. My skin stays hydrated for the whole work day. I'm completely obsessed with it. #GotItFree
Liked the way it made my skin feel but caused breakout in the chin area and dryness along the sides of my mouth.
I purchased a few weeks ago and it gave my face a burning sensation. It also put a dry itchy patch around my chin.
I've incorpoated this product into my regular routine for a few weeks. I haven't noticed a dramatic change and prefer a lotion over the gel.
its a good product and it helps make my face look good and feel healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Excellent product would recommend this to others and is well priced [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absorbs quickly. Light scent. Moisturize fine, but not the greatest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this product leaves you skin tone very soft and clear [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Works great! My extremely dry skin cleared up within hours. Very hydrating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have tried various Neutrogena products. I really like this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this product.. I love the way it feels and the way it hydrates. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for a few weeks and have really enjoyed it as a moisturizer. It has made my skin feel hydrated and is gentle.
works great on combination skin and isnt oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the way this product feels on my face but how come it almost like rubs off if I rub my face or when I put my primer on?
"immediately absorbs, not greasy, doesn't break my face out, feels great on hands [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really good I recommend before a few days use that the skin look fresh and softly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
great moisturizer for all skins for all seasons. sometimes wear just this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product for a few days and it caused redness, flaking and peeling skin on my forehead and nose. I am not allergic to any of the ingredients and am unsure why my skin reacted as it did."
"I bought this product about two to three weeks ago and so far, it kind of tingles/burns when I apply it and my skin has a few more bumps than it used to. I""m still trying to hold out hope for it, I'm just not sure if it's meant to burn."
"I was trying this review in hopes that it could be a great oily skin moisturizer, I was so wrong. It literally burns my face and makes be break out in a rash all over my jaw and cheek area. SOO AWFUL. Scent is overpowering, not happy!"
"I have very dry skin, especially on my face. The first day I used this product the difference was noticeable. The feeling of my skin as well as visually, an added plus was the great way I felt about me. After a week others noticed. I was hooked."
Great product!!! Has a fresh clean soap like scent that's smells great!! Love the cool gel texture of this product! Very different from other moisturizers. Left my skin soft and hydrated!!
"I bought this product on 3/9/18 and have been using it now every day since. In the morning after I was my face , I spread a little all over , I notice a huge improvement under my eyes and my skin looks younger ."
"I just started using the Hydro Boost moisturizer gel-cream and I love it. I have blushing rosacea and what a difference in my skin. My skin is soft, no dry spots and lot of the redness is gone. I will be getting the serum tomorrow."
"I love this so much!! I have combination skin, and acne. My skin was very dry and flaky so I got this and after the first use my skin felt smooth hydrated, but not greasy at all!! didn't make me break out!! I love this so much!"
Received this to try out and I must say it's amazing. Never had a moisturizer quite like this it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth even my husband commented on the feel of my skin. I would recommend to anyone.
"I bought this approximately two weeks ago. First it was really good, but that was because the temperature was warmer and my dry skin wasn't that bad, so it fixed that. As the days went by and the temperature got lower, it did nothing for my dry skin. I have to constantly be reapplying this 3-5 times a day. It also made me break out near my cheek area."
I love this product only for night. Because i need my spf in the morning. I noticed when i mix spf with this product it makes my skin oily. I would love to try the one with spf in the hydro boost line. I know neutrogena released it in Hong Kong (I think). Waiting for the product to be introduced in USA. All are pros for this product only the no spf part.
"I really wanted to like this product. Out of the jar, the fragrance is pleasant but as the day progresses, the fragrance makes my eyes burn and sinuses ache. I used it twice with the same result. Because of this, I have no idea if the product is effective as a moisturizer. Too bad it's not offered for sensitive skin or unscented."
"I got a sample/trial size of this in with my neutrogena makeup remover wipes. I was skeptical, but then I tried it! I love how soft and smooth it makes my face feel. I have oily skin, but this product has actually helped with that! Now I'm on the hunt to find where I can get this product for the best deal!"
I received this from Influenster for free to try. I must admit I love it so much. It makes my skin feel replenished with moisture and it feels so soft. I highly recommend this. The best part this is extremely affordable and works just as well as the higher end products.
"I absolutely love this product. I have sensitive skin and live in a coastal area--so I am pretty picky when it comes to skincare products. This moisturizer is lightweight, doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or dried out. I received this product for free to test and review, but these views are all mine & I will purchase another jar when my current one is empty."
"I am always afraid to try new things when it comes to my face. My skin is so sensitive and I worry it will break out. But this stuff is magical. I put it on and my first thought was ""oh this is going to look so greasy"" but to my surprise it was very light and gave my skin the perfect glow. I was able to try the product for free and I have already convinced my sister to buy it! I can't wait to try some of the other products. Thanks Neutrogena!"
"I was pleasantly surprised how long my skin stays moisturized after using this. I was at first hesitant that it would cause my face to feel a bit oily after using it, but that wasn't the case. It has a soothing feeling, and I imagine it will be perfect in the summer time after some extended time in the sun. I was able to test this product after receiving it for free from Influenster, but all opinions are your own."
This one has blue added coloring = bad.
"I used the serum version = used immediately and after 3 uses on my whole face, I had sagging cheeks and fine lines around my mouth area and in between the my brows. My skin was perfect. Just keeping maintenance. It is bad product doesn't have instruction. You are supposed to use H.A. after moisturizing. Got so freaked out I immediately throw such expensive product to the garbage."
"I bought this about 2 days ago , and when I say it's amazing I mean it. It glides right on, and after about 15 seconds of drying, your face feels hydrated,cool,and refreshed. My skin is very VERY sensitive and breaks out with everything it touches. It's also very dry . This water gel has moisturized my face, without breaking me out.!!!!!"
I just bought this recently because it was recommended to me by a friend. I have sensitive combination skin. I couldn't believe how smooth and hydrated my skin is! The dry spots are no longer dry without feeling like the product is just sitting on top of my skin and the oily parts aren't greasy. I love it!
"I purchased the Hydro Boost Gel about a week ago based on all the great reviews and was looking forward to the same positive results. While it did feel wonderful going on my skin, I suppose the fragrance was an irritant and caused redness after a few uses. Disappointed. I do love the Ultra Gentle Hydrating cleanser though!!"
I was recommended Hydro Boost water gel moisturizer by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive and combo skin. I have tried lots of products but this moisturizer is by far the best thing to happen to my skin! It feels amazing while and after applying without that greasy feel afterwards! Love this product and I hope it doesn't go away because my skin feels and looks better than it has in a long time!!!
"This product is so smooth and feels great on my skin. It has helped immensely with my winter dry skin, and even a dry, irritated nose from being sick! I love this product and would definitely recommend it for dry skin. It doesn't irritate my skin like some other moisturizers I've tried in the past, and the hydration lasts all day.I received this product free from Influenster for testing, however these are my own opinions."
"I really like this product. I have tried many facial moisturizers and lots of them just make my face break out. I'm happy to say that I've been using this product for over a month with no breakouts. It makes my face feel soft, but not greasy. And, it smells nice and fresh too :) I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."
I recently received samples of this. and I am highly impressed! its ultra light weight. doesn't leave a nasty residue on my face. and my skin is noticeably soft. i have always been a huge fan of neutrogena. and they have really out did themselves with this product. I have really oily skin and i wear it in the morning under my make up and i apply it at night. and its such a rich moisturizer it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily at all. this is one of the best moisturizer i have used.
"I received this item for free through influents for a review and I have fallen in love!! So much so that I purchased 3 more jars for myself! My skin is SUPER dry, especially in the cold winter months. I used this night and day on my face in place of my typical moisturizer and felt quenched immediately. Within less than 7 days my skin completely changed and is now dewy and plump. Will use this product forever!"
"I recently received this to try. I normally have dry skin due to facial cleansers, been on a search to find a facial moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin oily. I was pleasantly surprised by this product, my skin is close to matte with this product. The fragrance is a bit strong, could do without the fragrance. Doesn't interfere with my makeup routine. Will purchase in the future!"
"I have been using this product for about a week now. I absolutely love it! My face is very dry after I wash it, as soon as I wash my face I put on the water gel and i feel an immediate difference. My face is refreshed and no longer has that dry rough feeling. It is truly an amazing product. I also love the smell of it."
"The thing I most love about the Hydro Boost Water Gel is that while leaving me skin moisturized it doesn't leave it greasy and shiny. I have combination skin and most moisturizers make my t zone shine like crazy. I will be using this product from now on. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I use to hate winters not just because of the freezing cold.but because It made my already dry skin that much drier. Not anymore! My skin has changed, I can feel the difference after a week and I do not forget this step in my skin care. Well worth the money."
"I have been using this product for two weeks now. We have had so many extremely cold days here. I really like how moisturizing the Neutrogena Water gel is. My face gets pretty dry in the winter, this product helps my face stay hydrated. I received this product for free to write a review."
"This winter has been a season full of frigid temperatures which makes for terribly dry skin. I began using the hydro water gel and my face has never been softer or more hydrated. I use it each morning and night and the results were almost instant. This is a great product that did not clog my pores and evenly moisturized my face! I would like to mention that I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I have tried numerous moisturizers. Since I have oily skin I have yet to find one that suits my needs.... until now. The Hydro Boost Water Gel does exactly what it states. It does not contribute to my oily skin but instead has balanced my skin while keeping it soft. It smells great also which is always a plus. I use this every night before bed and wake up to refreshed, hydrated skin."
"I absolutely love this product. I received this product free for testing. I have never tried any Neutrogena products before, but I will be continuing to add Hydro Boost to my daily routine. I have used so many facial moisturizers and I have not found one that has made my skin feel so fresh. Hydro Boost has a light fresh clean scent. It leaves my face feeling so soft and not greasy. I use this product each morning and night, I will defiantly recommend Hydro Boost to family and friends!!!"
I received this product for free to test it. I have very dry skin and couldnt wait to give this a try. Im really surprised how soft my skin feels now. It also leaves a refreshing feeling on my skin. I will continue with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel
"I LOVE Hydro Boost water gel. My skin feels so nourished and refreshed. I have recommended this to my girls and anyone I see. It works without your skin feeling greasy. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
"My skin has been very dried out due to the extreme cold we have had this winter, and so I was happy to receive Neutrogena® Hydro Boost Water Gel for free to review. My skin feels much smoother and is definitely more hydrated. It was flaking and patchy and now it has a nice glow to it. I love this product and will definitely buy it in the future."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. My skin is somewhat dry and the Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel hydrated my skin and made it very soft. It went on smooth and was not sticky. My skin looks brighter and has a nice glow. I would recommend to anyone looking for a product for dry skin."
"I received a free product to try and I absolutely fell in love with it after my first use! The Hydro-gel goes on smooth and creamy moisturizing your skin, brightening dull skin, and making your skin feel smooth and soft. I absolutely would recommend this product."
I got some of the Neutrogena HydroBoost from Crowdtap to try and I absolutely love it!! I've had really dry skin lately due to the wind and winter. Using this new HydroBoost makes my skin extra soft and feel so hydrated. I've even been using it on the backs of my hands and it's making them even look younger! Absolutely love it and would definitely recommend!!
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I thought that this product absorbed well and it wasn't tacky or sticky. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. It's great for dry flaky winter skin and smells very nice. It has a pleasant floral fragrance. I used it on my neck,face and hands. This product is more like a serum then a cream since it's water based. A little is all you need to make your skin feel soft and smooth."
"I LOVED the neutrogena hydro boost water gel. It really made a difference in how soft and moisturized my skin felt. Winter makes every inch of my skin super dry, and this was the perfect amount of moisture to revive my dry flaky skin. It was lightly scented, not heavy, or sticky and just perfect. I LOVED it. I received my sample free, but the review is 100% my own."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review after using the first time I was amazed how fast it absorbed into skin leaving a cool feeling to skin ,soft,non greasy,and a feel of skin renewed amazing.so happy with results and hooked love it. will recommend for sure."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.” Overall I would recommend this product to my friends and family. I received it as a free gift to try so I am not sure the overall cost. Using the product it was cold like most creams are, but it was light and it seemed to work well without leaving an oily residue on my skin. After a few applications my skin seemed to glow and become clearer."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.” #HydroBoost is an AMAZING product, I am 47 and my mom is 67 years old, our skin is so soft, unlike anything we have ever tried. My mom always stops using a product because she doesn't see a difference, she faithfully puts this on everyday. Our aging skin looks healthier, and feels hydrated, I am so thankful to get to try this product for free to try and review, LOVE IT."
"I have very dry skin and I really liked how hydrating this was! It absorbed quickly but lasted all day! My skin is definitely in better condition now that I've added this to my routine. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review"
"I love the new hydro boost water gel! I have such dry skin, and this refreshes my skin filling it full of hydration. If you have dry or uneven skin tone, then this is a great product to use. I usually have to put on a moisturize 2 to sometimes 3 times a day to get it not to peel or flake. With this however, I only have to use it once a day. I would highly recommend this product if your skin is in need for hydration."
"I've been using this product for a week and usually I have some dry patches, but since using this my skin is so soft and looks hydrated. I also really like the smell of this and it doesn't make my skin look oily at all so I can wear it day and night! #gotitfree"
bought this product and love it very light on your skin
My skin is super soft after using this and I am 60 years old!
I bought this about a month ago and I love the way it makes my skin feel.
thought this product would make my skin feel moisturized makes it fell dry instead
"Burned my face, left it dry and flaky, disappointed."
"Would have rated this product as ""5 Star"" if it had included an SPF 15 (or higher) sunscreen."
I have tried just about everything on the market and this is by far the BEST product ever
i love this product its the best and my skin is hydrated
Absolutely love this product. Keeps my skin looking/feeling amazing!!!!
"Impressed! Just started using it, and I love it. 10/10."
"I have just started using the product, it feels good and soothing"
I bought this product like 2 weeks ago and this product gives me a tingly feeling is that normal?
I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks and my normally dry skin is now even dryer and turning flaky. I am extremely disappointed
Wow! Used it for the first time last night. My skin feels so soft this morning. Only one day use and I'm very pleased with this product.
I absolutely love this cream. I've tried a lot of products on my dry skin and none have worked until now. Highly recommend this product.
I got this because I was dealing with dry skin and this fixed it after 3 days!!! I love this product.
"I bought this a few months ago and I use it everyday.. I'm impressed how fast my skin changed, it's amazing!"
"Excellent product, best moisturizer for oily - dry combination, my only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger jar ! I always need more ! Can you please make a supersize jar so I can use it morning and for night? Love , love love this product!"
"receive my #HydroBoostWaterGel 2 weeks ago and I am totally in love with it! Before my skin was a little dry, but after 2 weeks apply it! , It feel so hydrated thank you so much for this great gift! #gotitfree"
By far one of the best moisturizers I've tried in a long time. It's very cooling and refreshing and keeps my skin moisturized and smooth all day and night. I will definitely recommend!
"cooling, feels refreshing, smooths and hydrates. Good value. Wish it could get rid of my wrinkles but I do feel it helps. If I had only stayed out of the sun!"
I've been using this for over a month now and the difference in my skin is wonderful. It is so soft and all of the dryness from a very cold winter is gone. Lots of moisturizers have made me break out in the past but this has not at all.
I highly recommend this product if you have dry skin or to use after you cleanse and exfoliate. My only complaint is that there is very little cream for such an expensive price:(
"This is not what I had hoped for. After using for one week, i was left with dry patchy skin and multiple blackheads! I needed a light weight moisturizer that didn't clog pores. I'm so disappointed."
"I've been using this product after my morning cleanse and I have noticed that my face does not produce oil all day! I've never had any luck with moisturizers until now. I have combo, sensitive skin so this product has been life changing for me."
"My face has been feeling very dry so I switched to the new Hydro Boost. One week later and my skins is soft, and feels plumped with moisture. No longer feeling shriveled!"
I absolutely love this product! My skin tends to get very dry especially during the winter. I moisturize my skin with neutrogena boost water gel before I apply my make up and it leaves my skin silky smooth for the rest of the day.
I received this product for free from Influenster to review and try out. I love the way the gel smells and feels on my face. I have been using this product for weeks and would definitely recommend this to friends and family.
"Hydro boost water gel is amazing! Fast absorbing, lovely smell, since it's a gel there's no oily or stickyness! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated and amazing."
"I love using this water gel from Neutrogena. This feels very light on my skin, and goes on smooth and nicely. This lotion is not expensive and works great."
"I got the product for free from Influenster and was excited to try out a product. The gel goes on easy and adsorbs quickly. After a few minutes, my skin felt smooth. Has a great smell - not overly powerful."
"Before this product my skin was very dry, and now using Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel my skin feel so soft and hydrated, and the product smells great!"
"This is one of the first times I have ever used a gel on my face instead of lotion, and I was really skeptical at first, but it was so awesome! It went on smoothly under my makeup (a huge bonus) and moisturized my face the entire day!"
"This is the one product I have found that gives my very dry skin some much needed hydration, while not causing my sensitive skin to break out! Love, love, love this product!!"
"I switched from Neutrogena Deep Moisture Cream to this and my face has gone backwards and is irritated, broken out, sore. It's worse than it's been in years. I gave it time to adjust to this but can't use it anymore because it's only getting worse with time."
"This product was awesome! My dullness went away. My skin is more hydrated than it has been in a long time and is soft to the touch. I've been using this for 2 months now and has not come even close to breaking out my sensitive skin. It is amazing, it absorbs quickly and smells great. I love it!"
I love that hylunronic acid is being added into more drugstore products! This moisturizer is light but does it's job very well. The scent is very fresh and not too overpowering. Great for normal to oily skin! If yo have a dry skin type I'd recommend something stronger and thicker. I was lucky to test this product for free so my opinions are my own!
"I've been using Hydro Boost Water Gel for 2 weeks along with Fresh Foaming Cleanser. My skin feels 10x more moisturized and smooth. This has been extremely beneficial given the harsh winter the Northeast has been experiencing, leading to dry skin. I'll continue to use this product as part of my daily routine and recommend it to anyone experiencing dry or fat looking skin. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free through Influenster, but all opinions are my own."
"I'm in the Neutrogena Crowd on CrowdTap and I got to try this product for free. I didn't expect this product to be as good as it was. Overall it's great, my entire face feels hydrated all day long! My favorite part was the scent, it smells amazing! Best smelling face product I've ever used! Highly recommend this stuff!"
"Neutrogena Hydro Boost is a game changer for my dry winter skin. The lightweight formula seems to lock in moisture without over-moisturizing; in fact, it seems to disappear into my skin, leaving it plump, supple and younger-looking. The light scent is refreshing, and the texture is smooth for easy application. How can an oil-free formula be so moisturizing? It's a skincare miracle!"
Just bought this recently as a friend recommend it to me. Water gel sounded like a great way to hydrate my face. Even tho I think it's working in that way I don't like the burning feeling and redness it gives me after I put it on. I'm thinking it might be the fragrance because I usually don't use very perfumed things on my face. I also didn't like how it didn't have a seal when I bought it therefore it makes it easy for people to possibly dip in it before I buy it. I really wanted to love it!
I have used Neutrogena products for years and I am now 71 years old without wrinkles. This Hydra Boost is another product that I will not be without. I feel like I have new skin every time I apply it which is twice daily. This is a must for everyone.
I received this product as part of influenster but all opinions are my own. I'd been wanting to try this moisturizer since I saw an ad for it in a magazine. The moisturizer is uber-hydrating without being greasy. Heads up though it did make my skin burn the first few times but I didn't notice it after those initial uses.
I received Hydro Boost Water Gel free from Influenster to try and review on my own. I was happy to get this and try it. I have very dry skin and with this cold winter I needed something. and this worked great. I apply it every night before bed and wake up with smooth healthy skin. Its so light on your skin and has a nice clean smell
"I received this product complimentary to test and I was a little skeptical at first. However, after using it, I love how it moisturizes my skin without making it feel greasy. My skin can go from dry to oily in one day, but this product has not made me break out like some others have. Definitely try it yourself if you can be super dry one day then breaking out from your moisturizer the next. Neutrogena products are definitely the best for my skin!"
"My skin is so dry and VERY sensitive that I am always so nervous to try a new product, especially on my face. But, I am so glad I risked it! I love this moisturizer. I've used it for about four weeks now. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized without feeling oily or heavy. As I mentioned my skin is so sensitive I have a hard time using any kind of face lotion. But, this one I am definitely going to keep using! Disclaimer: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."
"I've been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and I'm seeing and feeling a difference. I've got combination skin, oily forehead and dry cheeks. I use the gel daily and I feel like my cheeks don't look and feel quite as dry as before. The smell can be a little overwhelming if you're sensitive to fragrances. Disclaimer: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I've always had dry skin, and I've tried countless products to hydrate and moisturize my skin. This product is on par with the only other product I've found that keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long. The other plus is that this product is much cheaper than my other favorite product! I will definitely purchase it in the future. I received his product complimentary for testing and review purposes."
I put this on my face after cleansing and exfoliating at night and woke up to reduced lines and bags around my eyes. The best my eyes have looked in a long time! My face felt more hydrated and looked great! I put it on under my day cream and makeup in the morning and it is amazing! Highly recommend it !
"I am in love with this product! No more dry itchy skin! This product makes my face glow and feel so soft. Instantly after washing my face and applying this cream , my face feels relaxed and at ease, not tense and irritated. I love how you only have to apply a little not much and you can feel the tingle and how it just makes my face feel amazing. I received this product for free , for testing purposes"
"I was born with a skin disease that makes it very dry & flaky. I had been paying twice the amount of money for a product that I found on the internet, until I found this one. I have cancelled all future shipments & only use Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel. It is fabulous ! I have never had such soft, smooth skin & I'm loving it ! I also love the fact that it doesn't leave my face shiny ! Great product & the price is right !"
"just received this from influenster complimentary for reviewing purposes only. I must say I love this product. my skin had been dry due to all the cold weather this winter, and after using it for 2 weeks, my skin is smoother and softer. I highly recommend this product."
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I am glad I did! My skin is extremely dry, especially during harsh winter months. Using Hydro Boost has decreased the amount of large dry flakes I typically have. I love the lightweight gel texture and that it doesn't leave any type of residue. It has a wonderful refreshing spa smell, but isn't powerful. Also, since it is a gel, less is more! It isn't heavy and is absorbed quickly into the skin leaving it feeling very refreshed!"
"In the winter months, I am always looking for a lightweight face cream to use daily under my foundation! Neutrogena Water gel left my face feels rejuvenated and soft without causing my foundation to cake on! Wonderful product! I was excited to get the chance to try this product through Influenster!"
"I've been a regular user of Moisture Surge for several months. The Neutrogena water gel is a great dupe for it. It is light, absorbs fast and doesn't make you look greasy. Love the pleasant scent too. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I seem to have a problem with moisturizing creams pilling up when I put on my foundation. I bought this last week to give it a try. First of all, it had made my face and my neck feel wonderfully soft. The product absorbs and no more problem with my foundation. I wish you would make this for full body use"
"I've been wearing my Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for a week now and I love it. The gel holds up to 1000x its weight in water so your skin feels replenished which is a nice feeling for this wild winter we are having! It's an easy application and absorbs quickly without leaving behind an oily or greasy feel. This is a new part of my routine and one of my new favorite products! #BehindTheGlow Thanks for sending, Influenster."
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I fell in love instantly. I have severely dry skin and its extremely sensitive and I had no irritation after using this product. I applied it after showering and it left my skin feeling nourished and well hyrdrated for hours. I definitely recommend it. Although I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, all opinions are completely my own."
Hydro boost makes the skin feel smooth and soft. Hydrates without making the face feel oily. Love that the skin doesn't feel greasy or filmy. I was lucky to get to test this product for free from neutrogena and influenster but have already pursched more products in hydro line!
"I have been using this product night and day and it has transformed my dreadful winter skin. I am typically oily in the T Zone and dry in others. My dry, flaky skin has now been transformed into smooth softness. I also love that this product does not leave my face greasy after application, it is soft and cool. I received this for free as a promotional testing item but I will 100% be purchasing this for future use once this jar is gone. I am VERY pleased with the quality. I would highly recommend the Hydro Boost Water Gel!"
"I was sent Neutrogens Hydro Boost Water Gel for testing purposes and I am head over heels for it. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter. Most products don't work for me and I have to moisturize multiple times a day. I started using this product about a week ago and I am hooked. My skin is glowing, hydrated, and soft. I only need to apply once and the moisture lasts all day. I also love how it absorbs quickly and has s fresh scent. If you're looking for a great moisturizer, look no further!"
"This product is very effective and provides smooth, silky hydration that isn't greasy and this doesn't irritate my skin. I can't wait to see the long term how great its going to make my skin. being in florida my skin is so dry but this is a total refreshing glass of water for your face! I'm a member of the influenster and they sent my my neutrogena vox box and sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review."
"This stuff is just, WOW! I was a little scared at first thinking it wasn't going to be very moisturizing...but I have been pleasantly surprised! The texture is wonderful and when you rub it into your skin you are left with a soft/supple feel! I wasn't oily/greasy or sticky! It also has a pleasant smell (which is sometimes an issue with products). I can say I have always been a fan of Neutrogena, and this is just anotehr thumbs up on my list!!"
"The lightweight,fluffy texture sinks in to your skin locking in moisture without any greasy residue. My skin was softer,fine lines plumped and brighter within 7 days. I've also used HydroBoost on the back of my hands. The difference is dramatic! Fine lines and dryness have almost been eradicated. Having HydroBoost underneath my makeup each day is my new secret beauty weapon!"

"I'm in the middle of my first winter back east and this has proven to be a lifesaver. It smells great, goes on like a gel, and deeply moisturizes my dry face. My skin is adjusting from mild Southern California winters to bitter cold and my overly heated office, so this has really revolutionized my face. I've used it for a week now, and can really tell a difference in the way my face looks and feels. *all opinions are my own--I was able to test Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but will 100% be adding this to my normal routine."

Some friends were able to try samples of the product and they all had positive experiences too!"
"I love this product! When I put it on, it sinks in right away and leaves a silky almost powdery finish. It smells amazing, and it leaves my skin feeling so soft. The container is pretty, too.

I love this product & recommend it to anyone looking to hydrate your skin. It has a cool touch to the skin & my face feels so moist & overall healthy. Other products are too greasy or leave my skin dry. This gel is very light & has a beautiful smell. My skin gets so dull & dry so this gel gives my skin just the perfect amount of moisture.
"For many people with combination skin we have to search for something that works all over.. well i believe that i have found what i was looking for.. I received this product in the mail today FREE from Influenster and i have to say i have only used it once but i can feel a difference as if my skin can breath!! i don't have any dry or oily places on my face its all the same it feels to me!! as i said before, from only using this product once this is a must have product!!"
"This winter really took a toll on my skin, I've been looking for a moisturizer and I'm so glad I found this product. After just a couple days my skin started to glow again after months of being dull and it just feels refreshed, I have only been using the cream for a couple weeks and I can already see and feel the difference. The stuff also smells great, and I believe it's a great value for the quality of product that you are getting. *I received these products complimentary from Crowdtap for testing purposes*"

"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water gel feels smooth and cool on your skin! It is not clammy or sticky like other moisturizers get. I use this every night before going to bed and wake up to silky smooth skin the next day. A little goes a long way so I know that this product will last me a long time! “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"

It not only smells fantastic but it left my skin extremely soft and hydrated until my next facial washing and application.

I have combination skin so finding a moisturizer that solves both dry & oily skin problems is challenging . This gel was perfect because it helped my dry areas and left a fresh oil -free feeling on my skin. It absorbs easily and is perfect for wearing under sunscreen and makeup. Even though it's a gel I didn't experience drying or tightness. (I received this product complimentary of Crowdtap for the purpose of reviewing. All opinions are my own)

My skin was mega-moisturized, and I didn't break out (which is always a fear when trying new skincare products). The fragrance was so/so, I wasn't crazy about it, but it wasn't awful, either. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena rewards program, and Neutrogena sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review."

"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I've been using this for about a week now and I notice my skin's feeling a little softer and less dry. Not a huge difference, but how much can you really expect in only a week? Goes on easily, a little goes a long way! I didn't notice any smell. It's not greasy/oily; you can barely even tell it's there. Dries quickly. Recommended."
"I really really like this gel and use it once or twice each day. It definitely looks interesting being light blue, immediately reminds me of water. The smell is fresh and light, again it reminds me of water and the ocean. The gel is very easy to apply and moisturizes my skin well for hours! You can even use it right before you apply your make up. ""I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"

"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I tried this gel for about a week.

"I definitely wasn't expecting this gel to be as amazing as it is. I used it immediately after my bath as I do regular face cream, instead using the Hydroboost water gel.

"Ive been using this product for about 3 months and it definitely helped with my dry skin, but after a while it started to burn my face when I put it on. Not sure why all of a sudden this happened, but its not working out anymore."
My husband and I are loving this!! Perfect for our oily combo skin and doesn't leave our face feeling greasy. Really light with silky finish. Wish I would've found this product sooner.
"I love this moisturizer. I received it through Allure to try out. It goes on wet, but sinks into the skin so that your skin does not feel oily. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I've noticed my dry patches are starting to go away."
I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I am so glad I did! My skin feels soft and smooth. It's very refreshing when you apply it and it doesn't make you feel like you have cream on your face.
"I absolutely love this product. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and so soft. The product has a fresh scent to it, and I love it! I highly recommend this to anyone considering it!"
This product has really helped improve my dry winter skin. I love using it after I cleanse my skin with my Clarisonic. It also smells wonderful! I was able to test this product for free. All opinions are my own.
I have been using this product this Winter and it was so good at moisturizing my skin. Even better is the smell. My husband thought I put on perfume even though it was just the Neutrogena Hydro Boost that he was smelling.
I live in Miami so traditional cream moisturizers always feel a little thick. This gel consistency was perfect for warm days while still making my skin feel quenched. I used it twice a day for two weeks and have to say I'm hooked.
The gel is lightweight and absorbs so quickly leaving my skin soft and supple. I'm so in love with this product. The quality of the gel is very similar to HYDRA BEAUTY GEL CRÈME by Chanel. Love. Love.Love
"I received this product to review from influenster and I couldn't be happier with it! After washing my face, I apply this gel to my entire face. It is so light and smooth and I just love it!!"
"My skin can be quite sensitive, but Hydro Boost Water Gel was wonderful for my complexion. I loved how easily it absorbed into my skin and never left me feeling greasy looking. My skin just felt nice and soft."
"I received this product for free for testing, and I love it. It has a great scent and goes on smoothly. I love how my skin feels after using. I definitely recommend."
"My winter dry skin absorbs this almost immediately, I love it! I use it as a night cream on its own, and with a serum during the day. I love how soft it makes my skin feel. (I received a free sample thanks to The Vogue Influencer Network)."
I have searched so long for a moisturizer that actually balances my skin and this is it! I received it in the influenster voxbox and I am so happy I did! Thank you so much for this product!
"I love it! It makes my skin feel smooth and cool and lasts all day. It even smells like cucumber. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
I have been using the product for about a week and I love the way my skin seems more hydrated. I tend to get dry skin during the harsh winter months and this is a refreshing way to keep my skin soft and supple.
this product is my holy grail to my skin now I just love how my skin feels after applying this to my face I can totally feel the hydration on my face which I love.
this lotion is amazing. and gives my skin the perfect boost. i was very pleasantly surprised how well this feels and smells. long lasting as well. crowdtap let me sample this amazing product.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I loved it! it made my skin really soft and smooth."
I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I can see the difference in my skin. My skin feels soft and well hydrated even during this cold winter. I recommended this product to anyone that suffer from dry skin
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena rewards program, and Neutrogena sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. This product moisturized my skin and gave it a very nice glow. It was not greasy and made my skin feel so smooth"
"I have been searching for a long time for a suitable moisturizer to wear at night. After the very first application, I was sold. I'm very excited for finding the perfect nighttime routine that includes this moisturizer!"
I really need a high level moisturizer with my skin but am concerned with it being too greasy. This hit right on the spot for me. It was super intense but no greasy sheen or icky feeling. LOVE
"I am in love with this new neutrogena face cream! I like the cooling texture and the instant absorption, no greasiness or oiliness. Also my skin feels very smooth after the application, great base under makeup!"
"Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel is non greasy and does not leave your face sticky, this water based gel blends smoothly into your skin leaving it feeling refreshed and moisturized. My skin is quenched and glowing."
I loved Neutrogena Hydroboost Water Gel! It made my face stay moisturized all day. My face did not look oily like some products do to me. I use this before putting on my makeup and it made my face look awake and refreshed.
"I received this sample from Crowdtap for free, for my honest feedback. Awesome Product, the way it made my skin feel was great. Soft skin and smelled great who can beat that."
"This product is great to use day and night, or after washing your face. It immediately made my skin softer. I kind of wish there was less scent, but it didn't seem to bother my sensitive skin."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I absolutely how it hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling smooth. I love it."
I got the Hydro Boost Water Gel through crowdtap for free to try out. I have enjoyed using this product a lot and would recommend it to friends and family. I have used this product both morning and at night.
I received this product to try from #Crowdtap and #Neutrogena. It left a great feeling on my skin the first day! Not a greasy or wet feeling. Well worth buying and trying for yourself. I will be purchasing another jar for myself.
Neutrogena facial water is a very good product to have on hand. It relieves your face of the every day dirtiness. You find yourself with a smooth face every day. I highly recommend this product.
This product is amazing I've only been using it a week and I can already see and feel a difference. My skin just drinks up the product and feels super refreshed after.
"I usually use oils on my face since my skin is so dry. The Neutrogena Hydro Boost was a lighter alternative, but still left my skin hydrated. It made a great base for my makeup."
"I have VERY DRY SKIN and Hydro Boost Water Gel added much needed moisture, absorbed quickly, went on smoothly, and smells HEAVENLY!! I definitely recommend this stuff! I'm in the Neutrogena Crowd on CrowdTap and received a sample product for free."
I thought the texture of this moisturizer was really innovative and left my skin feeling hydrated without being sticky however I found myself only applying at night because it was missing sun protection as it has no SPF. Would prefer to wear this during the day because it feels so nice but its no the product for me because it doesn't meet my basic sun protection requirement.
"What I found most unique is the texture! It doesn't have that lotion-y feel to it and instead felt so clean as it just melted into my skin. I used it everyday all over until I ran out! I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but my opinions are my own."
Ive been using this product for about a month now. If your over 55 and your skin is dry it does not work. It is not moisturizing. At first when you put it on it feels cool and good then it drift and all the moisturizing is gone so your cover up looks dry.
"I baught this product after so much review. I got pack of two as I was too much excited to use this product due to my dry Skin. I applied after cleansing my skin , and its start burning . I was too much sad as I baught 2 packs. I'm 28yr old and my skin is dry. And I m really sad. Tell me about my dry skin as I really want my skin hydrated and smooth."
"I heard wonderful news about this product and gave it a try. My skin is sensitive and I should have noticed the jar did not read for sensitive skin. In my head.. it's got to be good, it's Neutrogena. I have used this product for over 4 weeks and now my under eyes have turned red, swollen and burning. I'm assuming since the gel is scented it caused my skin to have a reaction. Please make a sensitive formula for us girls who break out."
"My biggest pet peeve with heavy moisturizers is just that, that they feel heavy. I hate the feeling of having something on my face that feels obvious that it's there, whether because it feels greasy or heavy on your skin, but this feels like you've got nothing on at all while really doing what it promises!"
"I love this new moisturizer. Love the blue color. But I hate that it comes in a jar. The jar is beautiful in design--very appealing, reminds me of water. But it is just not sanitary to dip your fingertips into a jar. I transferred it to a squeeze tube right away. But that is not easy and I'm not sure that I want to have to do that every time. Please change the packaging!"
I've been using it on my skin after my regular skin care routine and my skin so incredibly soft after using it. I have also been applying it to my son's face and arms. He has keratosis pilaris and it leaves his skin extremely dry. Since using this water gel his skin has become softer. He loves to put it on after his bath. It smells light and soft and the texture is the best consistency. I love that a little bit goes a long way. I got to try a jar of this Hydro Boost Water Gel for free from Influnester for testing purposes.
"First off I had never tried neutrogena hydroboost water boost until I received it in the mail. The product is absolutely amazing in leaving my skin moisturized and feeling light. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
"This product is great. I am always skeptical of facial products because they always leave your face feeling wet, or slimy. When I opened the product I first noticed how great it smelled and how light it felt on my fingers. I rubbed in into my skin and almost immediately noticed that it left no unpleasant residue. My skin feels amazing. Would reccommend this product. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I love using this moisturizer after washing my face in the morning or before bed. It goes on smooth, and isn't greasy or shiny at all. It also has a really nice, subtle scent to it. It prevents my face from feeling tight or looking flaky. Now that I see how much it retails for, I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it, but I do enjoy the product."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. This is not just another facial moisturizer....it's the one for me. I LOVE it. I love that it is a gel and not a lotion. It's very light and has an amazing scent. I love how it leaves my face so soft and it absorbs very quickly. This is one moisturizer that I will continue to purchase. It's wonderful."
Great product for wearing under makeup. This is better than the gel cream version for dry skin.

Love love this product!!! Will continue to use but wish they offered coupons.
Does this work on oily skin or is it only for dry skin ?
"In 2 days, it cleared up a rough patch on my face! Nothing else I tried did! Great product!"
"Love this product, it's amazing for dry skins like mine!"
I love this gel! My skin has never felt so hydrated. My skin feels alive.
"feels really great on my skin, and help keep it stay hydrated. (Bonus: I love the bottle design)"
This is such an amazing product. I will definitely use it again.
Can this product be used on a man's face it gets great reviews from women so I was wondering?m
