Neutrogena bright boost brightening gel moisturizer feels like silk on your face. You only need to put a small amount on your finger and apply it to your face.

At first glance I really liked the look in the smell of Neutrogena Bright Boost brightening gel moisturizer face cream. It has a nice fragrance and a cute pink color with some glitter in it. Once I used it though I was not a huge fan. It did not moisturize my face as much as I expected it to. I also found that my face felt slightly waxy and sticky once it dried. My skin does not seem brighter either just seems a little bit drier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wanted to love it! heard so much good stuff about Neutrogena boost line! Tried it for 3 days and unfortunately broke me out.....I have very sensitive skin and can't use a lot of drugstore products. But Neutrogena was exception until now...Did see some brightening and made my skin very soft but caused large cystic under the skin acne! But if you've tried hydroboost and loved it, you'll love this as well. But unfortunately not for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Moisturizer has a light scent, glides onto skin nicely, feels moisturizing but not heavy, also has some mica in it which at first I thought I would hate, but I love the glowy look it gives. Has AHA acids in it to help exfoliate/bring radiance to skin so you need to wear sunscreen with it. My least favorite part is the way it smells -- Neutrogena should produce more products without fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for three days now,so far I like what I am seeing. First of all, I love how great this product smells. It's wonderful. My skin feels amazing after applying, no greasy feeling. I love the shimmer that is in the cream. I also noticed my dark circles under my eyes, have been less intense. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I sampled the Neutrogena Bright Boost Brightening Gel and I was a bit disappointed by it. I enjoyed the scent of it (not too strong but subtle) and the gel went on easily but it left a sticky feeling on my face which I didn't like. I was very disappointed with the effect it had on my foundation. It caused my foundation to cake and leave lines on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The bright boost was very moisturizing. It had a nice light fragrance, nothing overpowering. I saw a little bit of difference in my dark spots but nothing drastic. My only complaint is when mixed with other products it clumps up (makeup, sunscreen, etc). So using it at night was all I could do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Neutrogena® Bright Boost Brightening Gel Moisturizer Face Cream felt really nice and light on my face. Sometimes my skin can become very irritated using certain products but I didn't feel any of that with this face cream. It did a good job at moisturizing and keeping my skin fresh throughout the day. My skin looked somewhat brighter, but using this product a little longer could change my opinion on the effectiveness of this so right now I can give it 4 out of 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It doesn't take much, either. I'm definitely noticing a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel that my skin is more hydrated. It is brighter and I even put some on the back of my hands. I noticed a difference one day when I had accedently got it on one hand and not the other. My skin looked smoother. The thing I don't like is that sometimes I'll rub my face and have some come off. Like roll off. It's like it almost makes me feel dirty. Even though I know I'm clean. Other than that it's great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff really works if you apply it religiously. Its light weighted cream that penetrate into your skin as soon as you apply. It non greasy and leaves skin moisturized and well hydrated. I am using it from last 2 weeks and can visibly well a brightness boost and lightening of black spots on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very impressed with this product. I enjoy the smell. This product is lightweight and I like the slight shimmer in it. I did notice that my face is slightly brighter and it appears smoother. The only negative factor is that if I rub my face shortly after the application there is slight residue that comes off and it does leave my face feeling a bit flimsy feeling. But overall I like it will continue to use it and recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love a gel moisturizer and am glad that I got to try this one out that's drugstore! It definitely competes with high end ones. It felt good on the skin.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried Neutrogena® Bright Boost Brightening Gel Moisturizer Face Cream and love it! It has a subtle pink glow that makes your skin look instantly awake and luminous. The cream is a little heavy for everyday use during the hot summertime, but doesn't cause breakouts and is perfect for a boost of hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The gel is great feeling and easy to apply. My reason for a lower rating is the scent that is used. It caused irritation to my eyes even though I didn't use near them! It's scent is okay but it does have an older lady perfume type scent. It is kinda off pink shimmering gel and I didn't see any boost in brightness to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like how smooth it goes on. The scent is a little strong for a product that I would put on my face l. It smells nice but smells more like a hair product like a shampoo. I also don't like it's a jar I have to scoop out and put my hands in. It does seem to work well. My skin was broken out due to a cask mask and this is helping the red spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's a pretty pink color with glitter/sparkles. The fragrance is appealing. A small amount of the product goes a long way. I do love the look and feel of my skin after using it. I don't care for the sticky residue feeling it gives my skin after it's applied. It made my hair crispy like when I got some in my hair at the edges of my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Packaging was super cute. It smells amazing. The first day I used the moisturizer my skin felt fresh and not oily or greasy. After the second week of use I could see subtle changes in some discoloration spots I had we're actually getting lighter. I would definitely consider purchasing this product.

Neutrogena bright boosting brightening gel moisturizing face cream worked well to help brighten my complexion. I hope that with long term use of the cream it helps reduce hyperpigmentation and scars. The cream also smells great-kind of like watermelons! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the Neutrogena Bright Boost Gel. The smell and feel of the gel was wonderful. The packaging was appealing and similar to higher end products I have purchased. The only issue I had was I did not find it to be the level of moisturizing I would have hope for. It did brighten up my face but left a stinky feel on my face. Overall I will be continue to use it conjunction with my normal moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer had it all, great smell but not over powering, a little goes a long way, has aha (for my dark spots) but I had 1 major issue. It has shimmer in it. I don't know, but shimmer was everywhere on me an hour later. This shouldn't be in skincare... at all. I can't recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I aprecciated the oportunity to try the Brighboost gel cream of Neutrogena i really enjoy and i will keep use it i like is light weight and ligh fragance it absorbs very qukckly and leave my skin soft and fresh . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this! Seems to plump skin. Fine Lines less noticeable especially around my forehead! After applying I wait 5 mins and ready for primer and foundation. This moisturizer works well under makeup it makes your face smooth for applying makeup. I feel like this face cream tightens and lifts skin. I am 31 and need to start thinking more about anti-aging products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got my Neutrogena bright boost brightening gel moisturizer face cream about a week ago and I absolutely loved it. My face felt so smooth and had such a natural how after only a couple days. I have already recommend it to many of my friends and I will be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the Neutrogena Bright Boost Brightening Gel Moisturizer Face Cream. It went on smooth, smelled nice and left my face feeling fresh. The only downfall I found (which could have been my fault) was that it would sometimes feel almost crusty around my hair and jaw line. Overall, it was an amazing product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I very much enjoyed using the Neutrogena® Bright Boost Brightening Gel Moisturizer Face Cream. I was very impressed with the quality and results I had from using this product. It made my skin feel super soft and also helped brighten my skins appearance! I am definitely going to continue to use this awesome face cream in my daily skin routine.

I love the Neutrogena Brighton's Gel cream so lightweight and fresh. Doesn't even feel like I have anything on. The smell is so refreshing as well. After 10 days I did notice my skin looked brighter
And very well hydrated. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product. My only problem with it is the perfume smell. It smells great once you first open the bottle but once you put it on your face it's just too much and gave me a serious head ache. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After a few days usuing this I like the way it feels going on it smells good however I have noticed it leaves a layer residue on your face. And you dont want to get all sweaty after it will burn if it gets in your eyes! Over all I'm liking it so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this cream a lot! It is very light but also has a really nice, fresh scent. It doesn't feel oily or greasy on my skin, it does feel slightly tacky when you first apply it, but that goes away soon after it dries. I've also noticed that my skin is less dull and my fine lines are less noticeable even after only 3 days. I will definitely continue using this product!

This IS the best moisturizer I HAVE EVER TRIED! I get acne very easily and this helped my skin so much. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy or oily. It helped my dry skin and left my skin looking more Radiant then ever. I will never buy another moisturizing face cream. Nothing could be better then Neutrogena Bright Boost Brightening Gel moisturizing face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This comes in a well designed box and you can actually see the product. Upon opening the Bright Boost Brightening Gel Moisturizer I was greeted with a light-floral-fruit scent. It is not overpowering at all. The cream goes on smooth and leaves absolutely no oily residue. It absorbs right away and leaves my face smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way it feels on my face. I use it twice a day (morning and evening after I wash my face). It left my face so smooth and my skin felt so nice and hydrated. Plus some of the dark spots are slowly fading away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved it! I totally felt like it brightened my skin. Compared to other high cost brands it is practically the same. I love how much product I can get for the amount of money. My only thing to compare to my other more expensive product is my product goes from cream/gel to kind of an adsorbtion liquid that feels light on my skin. Neutrogena's Gel Cream is similar but I felt didn't absorb as well. I still love the product you just only need a dime size amount or less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The packaging for this product is really nice. The jar is a nice size which makes using the product really easy.
It only takes a tiny bit of this creamy lotion to cover your entire face. It leaves my face feeling hydrated with a beautiful glow after just using for a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this face cream to be fast absorbing and highly moisturizing, perhaps a little too moisturizing for my combination an acne prone skin. I noticed a slight brightening effect immediately upon application due in part to a finely milled shimmer of Mica. It was not glittery but I did not care for the shimmer. I think this will be useful for me during winter months when my skin tends to be a bit dryer and I look forward to seeing the results long-term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
