You don't need much of this as a little goes a long way! This product is great as you can also use even a tiny bit and add a bit of water to it so it gives a light layer of moisture. It comes with a little spatula to scoop out product so you don't have to dig your fingers into the container which is helpful.
"I found out about this while searching for a moisturizer recommended for Rosacea. Very calming, just as advertised. Nice herbal scent, too. The price for this on Jet cannot be beat!"
