Because it's wintertime? Believe me. It's NOT a good look. Use this over or under your make up and you can't go wrong. I haven't had a peel or dry skin on my face in a month. Super moisturizing without being greasy. It has a clean smell which dissipates upon absorption. Comes in a little glass jar. Not sure how many ounces because I threw the box away. It also is about 5 bucks! It can't get any better.
"I've been using this product along with the other revitalift eye cream, face wash I'm 61 years old.. have no wrinkles or anything my skin looks beautiful"
I have used this product for almost seven years. I am close to 50 and I have people ask me all the time if my son and I are siblings. People always compliment my skin. This product is why!
I have used Hydrarenewal for many years at night & loved it. The latest jar I bought was heavily fragranced & heavy. Not good for my sensitive skin. The cream is not absorbing into my skin & “pilling” off. I now need to look for a new night cream. Will not buy again
"I have been buying this product for night and day use for years. When I opened the last jar, I immediately noticed that it seemed more clear than the normal white. It is now more like a gel than a cream and is greasy and not easily absorbed. My makeup did not go on over it as usual. Will definitely never buy again. Why did you mess with a good thing?"
"I have always bought two jars each time and have used so long I have no idea how long I have used and been so happy with it. Now your ""new formula"" I'm looking for my receipt so can return it. Just not understanding why when you have a good thing you feel you must change it."
"I was using the Hydra- Renewal cream for the last 4 years. I absolutely loved the old formula. Light texture, very mild fragrance and wonderful moisturizer. The old cream worked so perfect for my skin. I just bought the replacement bottle and was so disappointed with the new formula. Why to change the perfect cream to some over fragrance gel? Very dissatisfied."
"I used to love this face cream, but they changed it. It used to be the only cream I could use on my sensitive face. I opened a new container last night and tried it, but there is now a very strong and unpleasant scent and the texture is like a gel that did not rub into my face well. It also left my hands and face feeling sticky. If you want to make a new product, fine, but don't change a product that so many people already loved. I will never use this again!!!!!!"
"I had previously used this a year or so ago & decided to try again so I bought this a few weeks ago & began using it at night - I dont remember the consistency being more ""gel-like"". It leaves a somewhat sticky feel on my face. I remembered it being more creamy/smooth like consistency. Did the formula change recently?"
I use other Loreal products but disappointed with this one.
Bought it for a friend because a very good value on Walmart. Customer swears by L'OREAL hydra-renewal.
"I've been using this cream for years with excellent results. The last jar I bought was a new formulation. It's no longer a cream. It's now a gel that does not moisturize my skin, Why did you change this product??? It was perfect as it was."
"I have been buying Hydra Renewal for years. Loved the light feel and light scent. I hate the new gel-like, strongly scented product. Can not believe you would mess with a good thing."
This was a great product until the formula was changed recently. I dont like the way it feels as well as it doesnt absorb into my skin anymore
"I have been using this product for years and loved it! The new formulation is terrible, it burns when you put it on and is greasy. Sadly now I have to find a new product :("
I bought a replacement bottle yesterday. They changed the formula and it feels and smells horrible. Nice job ruining a perfectly fine moisturizer!
"I have been using this product since the late 80's, it is the best on the market"
"I agree with the customer""unhappy with new formula"". I have been using this cream for many years and used a lot as for facial cream and as for body lotion. l have been very pleased with it. BUT this new formula is disgusting! It smells toooo strong and it gives me headaches in the day and night! It does not absorb in very well and it does not work like the old formula. Not good for my skin. Why don't you leave a good thing alone. I won't buy again."
"I have been using this for about a year, but just purchased a new jar and it's completely different! It has a strong fragrance and completely different consistency! I don't like this at all! I came on here to read reviews to see if anyone had the same issue and it looks like I'm not the only one! I loved this product, but I guess I need to find a new one."
"u should've known by the price it was to good to be true. i have been using Age Perfect day/night hydrating cream and really liked it's rich, creamy feel. it really made he wrinkes disappear. this is thin and does not feel like i've put lotion on at all. they didnt have what i wanted, so gave it a try and then gave it away."
"This product should have been purchased from the store itself, ordering via the Internet the product arrived half open and it had been droppen on the floor a couple of times. Alsom the consistency of the cream it looked like it had been exposed to the Heat."
"I am pleased with the product and with the very fast shipping. The packaging was not good. My order of 7 glass jars of face cream made it safetly to me, thankfully. They were shipped in a grey plastic bag, with absolutely no padding other then the box they come in, which is only made of paper. 3 stars for the US Postal Service for fast safe handling."
"I agree with the customer""unhappy with new formula"". I have been using this cream for years and I might add that I have been very, very pleased with it. BUT this new formula is disgusting. It smells toooo strong and does not absorb in very well and it does not work like the old formula. Not good for my skin. Why don't you leave a good thing alone. I won't buy again."
"Using this for years. It provides a dewy, moisturizing, youthful result that lasts for hours. I apply makeup over it and it is the best product for my purpose I have ever used. It makes a beautiful, soft almost glowing and nourished face and neck. May it be sold forever and ever. This product has value. Tons of it. I'm told all the time how ""youthful"" I look and this product is my little secret. :)"
"I've been using this for the past 20 years and have purchased at least every two weeks. Suddenly last week a whole new formulation that isn't a cream at all. A gel that pills, doesn't absorb, doesn't work under makeup at all, and isn't in the least hydrating. So disappointed that I have to find a new product that's as great as the original Hydra Renewal formula."
"This is not really a cream unless I got a bad jar. Being a lotion, it really doesn't go as far as a cream would on the face so even at this low price I do not consider it a good buy."
"Bought this because the price was so low and I typically buy Loreal creams and lotions. This one is weird. It's in a jar like a cream but its think and watery like a lotion. I have sensitive skin and it works just fine, no irritation. Has a slight baby powder/perfume scent though. Overall I am satisfied with what I got for the price I paid and would buy it again if the price was low."
I bought this first because of the price. I'm on my second jar now and love it. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't bother it at all. My coworker said I looked younger just out of the blue one day. Enough for me at 47 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have terribly sensitive skin. This moisturizer keeps my face soft and it never irritates my skin no matter how often I use it. People complement me on my great skin And I attribute that to this product. And the price is a steal at Wal-Mart. I recommend this for every woman.
"I applied another facial moisture cream at least 3-4 times daily for over 25 years. I loved it and doubted that I would ever discontinue it. But on a whim I decided to try L'Oreal Hydra-Renewal a couple of months ago. I now use it once in the morning and once at night. I was floored by the results. Goodbye old moisture cream! I have a new favorite -- L'Oreal Hydra-Renewal! My face is so smooth and never dry. Thank you sooooo much, L'Oreal!!"
"I have been using this moisturizer for close to 8 Year's now, for a moment I tried other higher end brands and I ran out of one of my moisturizers so I ran to wal-mart hoping that they would still carry this specific moisturizer, and I was SO happy that this moisturizer had not been discontinued, so as of now I have gone through 2 new jars and on my way to get a new one now. Thank You loreal!"
I have been using it since 1992 when I worked for Walmart .I was manager of cosmetic dept. One of your reps gave me a sample then. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I use it twice a day morning an night before bed. Ihave used for 23 years and will continue to do so. Carolyn [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my first purchase of Hydra-Renewal Cream and it is amazing & reasonably priced!! I'm in the 50+ age group and was looking for something that is light and non-greasy for sensitive skin. This cream has met all of my needs! In addition, I have noticed the dark spots on my face are getting lighter! I smooth it on day & night religiously! I am enjoying the compliments about my smooth, radiant-looking skin! Fifty-plus never looked so good! Thanks L'Oreal!"
"Love this cream. I've been using it for a few years. My skin is naturally dry and sensitive, but this cream makes my skin feel perfectly moisturized. I use it at night after I apply my anti-aging products....it keeps the other products from making my skin dry and irritated. The next morning my makeup goes on much smoother. This is a staple in my skincare routine."
"no ""oomph""in the facial cream--I see no softer or moisture on my skin."
I was looking for a moisturizer that was not greasy and did not clog pores. This works great. Just what I was looking for. A little goes a long way.
"This one is my favorite foundation base cream. It works pretty well, but will be a little thick and greasy on oily facial skin."
"I have used Hydra Renewal for many years and have problems finding a place that sells it, so I am happy Walmart has it. It is the only product I have found that really feels good on my face."
"This cream has the most incredible texture. It feels like a gel, goes on like oil, and leaves skin radiant. I love it. I have also noticed that it is helping to reduce my fine lines. I love the healthy glow it gives my skin. I will be buying it again."
"I have used this product for many years. I have purchased other brands, including very expensive ones just to try them out. I always go back to this one as it makes my skin feel refreshed and moisturized!!"
"I love to use L'oreal products, I gave a try to this product it worked wonders on my face."
Awesome product I suggest you to buy one and have a lasting flowing glowing skin.
A DREAM COME TRUE product
I have been using this for a week now and notice that my sensitve dry skin has really gotten better over such a short amount of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I finally found a facial cream that works well and doesn't have such a strong scent right next to my nose. I went all winter without flaking, and it goes well under make-up. I'd recommend this to anyone!"
"While the L'Oreal Hydra-Renewal cream seems OK for the price, I can't believe they added so much fragrance to it, especially since it's supposed to be for sensitive skin. I can't stand to breathe in the smell once I put it on. Have to return it."
I have been using this face cream for as long as I can remember. I...LOVE...IT! I am 50 years old and my face has minimal wrinkles and is moisturised and clear. I've been having trouble finding this product in stores and was recently told it has been discontinued by L'oreal. I am praying this is not true.
I use this moisturizer every day and night. It's very light and not greasy at all.
"Not greasy or heavy, absorbs well, pleasant smell."
Product very good and can't beat the price.
"Usually products for sensitive are un-scented and have little ingredients added in them. I was skeptical of trying this, but this works amazing. After only a week my dry skin is more hydrated and this product did not cause any irritations on my sensitive skin as well. The moisturizer is very thick, so a little goes a long ways."
The face cream wasn't the same. It was thinner and had a different odor. My face still felt dry after I applied the cream. I am very disappointed.
Makes my skin feel soft and smooth. great under makeup. Light and airy. I will continue to use this product.
This is a very good moisturizing cream from L'Oreal and Wal-Mart had it at an unbelievable price. I ordered several jars before they ran out.
"This cream is light yet a wonderful moisturizer. I highly recommend it for anyone, particularly if you have dry skin."
This is the best moisturizer. I love it. Please never discontinue it. Far better than any other product out there!!!
works well and smells great. however its a bit messy coming out the jar. i hope they can do it in tubeform soon.
"The cream was smooth, and did hydrate my skin with a tender glow. Definitely a good price for this much product."
It is just right for my Mom. She doesn't want to spend too much money for her face and have the almost same result.
Good product
"I am in my late 50's and have just discovered Hydra-Renwel Continuous Moisture Creme. First, let me say this is product performs better than mostly all other more expensive products I've purchased in the past. This is my new daily face/neck moisturizer which I use under make-up as well as part of my night-time regimen after cleansing. I found it at Walmart (great price) and used my online coupon that I scored. I especially like the jar container so I use every drop vs wasteful pump containers."
"I have been using this product for 20+ years, it is great."
"Too watery for me...once it's finished, I will buy another moisturizer."
I've been using this product for many years. It is not greasy and seems to have kept wrinkles
Item was ready to be picked up the next day. Doesn't get any better than that.
My favorite especially for winter. All day moisture and never irritates my face. I where it alone and under makeup.
Mom is always trying what she calls cold cream to find a good one. After finding hydra renewal she talked me into trying it now we both love it
"This really worked! I have combination skin with acne, now with a little bit of rosacea thrown in. I have tried so many different face creams and lotions and nothing has worked...until now. This made a visible difference in the redness and dryness on my face within a few days of using. And it didn't cause a break out! I don't know what's in this stuff that makes it work so well for me, but I'm going to continue using it. I'm just so happy I found something that worked!"
This is the best moisturing cream ever. I have used this cream for about 20 years and it works so much better than the high priced creams or the L'Oreal new creams. It is difficult to find however. I buy it in the Stop and Shop grocery store or wherever I can find it. I don't know why L'Oreal does not promote or advertise it. Keeps my face and neck moisturized throughout the day and is not greasy. Makeup goes on smoothly over it.
"now i dont have dry skin, but when i used this cream, i thought it was one of the bestest! it does what it says, keeps my face moustrized all day long. of course, my skin tends to be greasy at the t-zone, so my face did look shiny hours later. i didnt know it was for dry skin, so that probably explains it. either way, i love it!"
"I hope L'oreal NEVER discontinues this product!!! It is the best moisturizing cream ever made, and it is not greasy. I have dry skin, and I first discovered the Hydra-Renewal cream at least 10 years ago, and it keeps my face moisturized all day... I used to live in a semi-humid area (near the beach) all my life, and now I live in the desert, and really need to use moisturizing face cream for sure. I've been using this cream every day, and people even compliment me on how my face glows."
"I have used Hydra-Renewal for at least 20 years. My students used to compliment me on my lack of wrinkles and smooth, firm skin. They always were shocked when I told them my age. Hydra-Renewal has a light, non-greasy feel on my skin, it's absorbed instantly and has a light fresh scent. I love it and use it daily."
It helps my skin. i just wish it would come in a larger size and a pump
I would highly recommend this product as it helped retain moisture in my skin.
Saw a big difference in just 2 uses! I use it under makeup and at night. Definitely worth buying and the price was right.
Most products usually break me out within hours. I'm loving the moisturizing I get with this product. I think I've found my next new moisturizer.
I've been using this moisturizer for over 20 years. It is wonderful and also one of the cheapest L'Oreal face creams. Works great under makeup and at night after clensing face.
I can't get over how well this works on my freakishly sensitive skin! Not too heavy or greasy feeling & lasts 12+ hours! (After only one application!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin if really dry and i trylied everything to try and help it but noyhing will seem to help it so i want to try thia and swee if it will work [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My favorite skin cream! I've used it for many years. Doesn't leave your skin shiny or greasy, but moisturizes all day long. Wouldn't use anything else! And the price is right!!!"
i have been using this product for about 6 months.. and i love what it has done to my skin .. the best part it softens my wrinkles.. they help diminish the definition of the wrinkle itself.. i love this stuff.. and affordable...
"This is excellent for dry sensitive skin. I have mild rosacea and it seems to calm it when I put this on at night. I also use in the day sometimes under my makeup. Very moisturizing and it does not irritate, I highly recommend!"
this is my 1st jar of hydra-renewal moisture cream for dry/sensitive skin. the product has improved by facial skin tone and my skin is soft. this is the better facial cream i ever use. thanks
Is nice for you
"My skin tends to get dry in the winter, so I got this, thinking it would be a thicker cream suitable for colder weather. Well, it's the opposite of thick. It's a rather thin consistency, which would be better called lotion. Reminded me of nivea soft, which don't get me wrong is a nice product too and a better value. I think it broke me out on a couple of spots though I have sensitive skin and it's rare for a moisturizer not to break me out."
"Much too thin. Went on nicely, but more like a lotion. Pleasant light powder scent."
Great product other than clogged my pores =[ gross
This moisture cream is incredibly wonderful. I have used it for years now and am very satisfied and can recommend it highly for ANYBODY.
I have been using this product for many years. I have sensitive skin and this product is the only face cream I can use without breaking out into little red bumps. Hyro Renewal is great
Like how light this is on the skin. There is no heavy residue.
Hydra Renewal keeps your skin moisturized all day.
I have sensitive skin. This is the only product I trust.
"Lightweight, not greasy. So far I'm impressed"
Makes yours skin so soft!
I use this every night and sometimes in the morning. I love this cream because it really works.
very good product at the price point.
