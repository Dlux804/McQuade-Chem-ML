I have tried so many moiture controlling products and this is by far the best yet. This product is easy to apply and doesnt leave my skin feeling oily. I have used this for a few weeks and I have havent had nearly as many breakouts as I did using these other products I have bought. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pretty sceptical about this moisturizer. But I tried it for a week+ and it did not break me out, clog pores, leave me greasy, sunscreen, and it has no scent. That is all a plus in my book!! The only thing I want crazy about is if you dont let it fully dry before putting on foundation it will leave your foundation looking funky. I would purchase this product. I received this product free for my honest review. This review is in my own words. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Differing is a different acne treatment because it doesn't clog pores. I absolutely love this moisturizer oil control with SPF 30 sunscreen. It's perfect for my combination skin. It's so gentle and soothing when I apply it to my skin. I love that it's not greasy feeling at all. I also love that it hydrate's and protects my skin all day long. I am happy that it's fragrance free and that it has UVA/ UVB protection. Overall very pleased with this Sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Differin oil control moisturizer Is so moisturizing while remaining non-greasy, non-oily and not clogging up my pores. My favorite feature is that it also doubles as an SPF 30 sunscreen. I wore this every day while on vacation at the beach for two weeks straight and it did a great job of protecting my combination skin. I did not have to worry about reapplying. I would certainly purchase this product again in the future and recommend it to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and get little bumps when I use most moisturizers but I've been using Differin for a few weeks and I love how it feels on my face and I have not any breakouts at all. It feels very light on my skin, absorbs quick and my skin doesn't have that shiny look after applying it.There is no perfume smell either! I really love that that this is a moisturizer with sunscreen. I feel good knowing that this is not only moisturizing my skin but also protecting it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Iv used this for a few weeks I like it! It's not oily, light weight. The only thing that I didn't like is it made my skin a little sticky after drying. The fragrance is minimal. I am starting to see a difference in my pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this as a sunscreen more than a moisturizer , it's doesn't stink, and it doesn't make my skin feel grease , I have combination skin and this absorbed really quickly and it's good base before my makeup, I love the practical dispenser . If you have dry skin stay away! But if you have oily skin this is for you! A great sunscreen that it doesn't leave the skin grease and that it doesn't smell awful!

"I am really enjoying this Differin Oil Control Moisturizer with Sunscreen. I have always struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn't leave my Tzone oily after a few hours. This is a first, and I couldn't be happier. Plus, it actually absorbs excess oil and has 30 SPF. Ithe consistency is like a thin lotion, and to me it smells like a sunscreen. It absorbs fairly quick and leaves my skin soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! I have sensitive and acne prone skin, and I couldn't find a good product that would work for my skin but my dermatologist recommended that I used differin but I eventually began using the moisturizer and it has helped my skin so MUCH"
Differin Oil Control Moisturizer acne treatment because it keeps my skin moist while taking care of my acne. Felt very soothing to my skin.

"very lightweight, but... leaves my face really red right after application"
I really liked it and it helped my skin better than before. It came at the right time since it was offefrr fro free to try. Especially now that we are going into summer the rainy weathefr here took a toll on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Feels great on my face. Not oily or tight feeling after applied. It's light and I noticed no breakouts when using it. It's a good sized bottle and will last for a long time. It has no smell which is appealing to most people but I like a lotion to have a smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this out because my skin is constantly either oily or dry. Theres no in between. So i tried it out and it works as expected. I would definitely recommend it. The only thing is i didn't really like the smell [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer has SPF protection and is light weight. I wear it under my makeup every day and it does not feel cakey and helps my makeup apply smoothly. I love that this has SPF protection as well. SPF is very important when it comes to skin care and is often over looked. Thanks Differin for the great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have oily skin and have tryed many moisturizers and that have irritated my skin and caused breakouts. I tryed this for the first time 3 weeks ago and its works great for my face. It obsorbes excess oil and dont clog my pores. It also has sunscreen added which I love because I am outside alot and need the extra protection. Its thin, white and very creamy. Its goes on so smooth and lightweight. I absolutely love this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a month now. I'm wearing it in winter/spring Cleveland so I have not been able to test the SPF. I prefer the feature of SPF since I want protection every day. The lotion goes on smooth and soaks into the skin right away. It is light and not oily. I can apply makeup right over it without the worry of the makeup not going on evenly. I really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's a good light/non- greasy moisturizer for oily or acne prone skin. I liked how it doesn't shine or becomes oily after application. Love it especially during spring and summers. It has spf, doesn't irritate the skin nor break outs [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Differin Oil Control Moisturizer is very hydrating on the skin. It's not greasy and no scent that I could smell. Feels nice and light which to me is important during the day. Controlled my oily skin nicely. Only thing I will say that is it currently winter where I live so controlling oily skin is quite easy. The true test will come when I wear it during the summer in the heat and humidity. But for now it's a winner in my book and I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this for a while now, while I think it's been helping a little bit it's not what I'm looking for. I want something that works a little faster and better. I did like how it obsorbs into the skin though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a really nice product. It goes on easy and is lightweight. Doesn't clog my pours. I like that their isn't any strong fragrance in it. I can wear it all day and be comfortable. Doesn't make my face greasy at all. I wear my makeup over it with no problems. I love knowing my face is protected with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The only thing I don't like about this product is the smell. Personally, I think it stinks. I would say overall love, aside from the smell, I like it. Comes out very smooth and does not seem to heavy or thick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Goes on very thick like sunscreen and smells like sunscreen. Great for use as a sunscreen, but not very sure about the moisturizing ability. It absorbs easily into the skin and doesn't leave behind a typical sunscreen type residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Starting using it and a matter of 3 days my skin was noticable cleaner feeling. Less red and scars were fading. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a change in your skin. It will change your life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ive tried and tried everything OTC for acne. Im 33 yrs old and have suffered with breakouts since i was 12. Comparing this product to countless others, this one is definitely in the top for long lasting oil control. It doesnt dry out my skin or smell horrible either and has reduced my pimples by 75%. Not a complete cure but definitely noticeable results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is perfect for me. I have fair, sensitive, and dry skin. My skin feels hydrated and soft after using this as a daily moisturizer. It does a good job at protecting my skin against the sun. It absorbs quickly and is non-greasy. I have gotten sunburned, but only from not reapplying after constantly sweating in the hot Texas sun for a few hours. It does not cause blemishes. All-in-all this is a great daily moisturizer that contains sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Works really well and not too greasy. Keep skin feeling great. Really enjoyed using this and will buy more to keep handy. My sons skin sucked it right up and looked so nice instead of scaly and dry. Xo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been struggling with the balance between dry skin and clogged pores for a few months now. Then enters differin! I have sensitive skin overall and I don't like most scents either so finding the right face product for me can be a real challenge. This worked better than I could hoped! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this moisturizer it not only helped acne be a little more controlled but it made my skin smooth and soft. It didn't dry out my skin like other acne products and it was not sticky. It soaked right in and helped my rough skin too. I got a sample for free to test and try and give my own opinions on which are 100% my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've used this for about 2 to 3 weeks now. I like to use it after my oatmeal face wash. I enjoy this face wash because it is good at controlling the oil on the skin which I have excessive.

I have been dealing with acne for the majority of my life. I have combo/oily skin and good moisturizers are hard to find. This moisturizer is lightweight and doesn't feel thick or tacky on the skin.

"I like this product, the oil control properties are beneficial, especially in the hot and humid months. I just wish the bottle was bigger. Having to apply every two hours will make me go through this bottle in a few weeks. It also can't be worn if wearing make up, great for make up free days.

It does an amazing job if oil control and has the benefit of having sunscreen in it as well, which makes for an easy way to get my teens to wear sunscreen, when they normally wouldn't. I love differin products and their acne slaying properties. This one doesn't disappoint! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like they created a formula to control the oil yet and still it's a moisturizer all in one. I feel the advertisement of the bottle could have been designed different. The name doesn't really help you to understand it's for the face. At first I thought it was a hair product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like using it and it has added sun protection so it's great for year round use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this moisturizer for a few days but I felt like it was too oily. I thought the consistency seemed ok when dispensed from bottle but on my skin it wasn't great.

I got this for my nephew who has bad acne at the moment. He already uses the differin and now he has the moisturizer to use as well.

"I have had acne since high school and even as an adult in my mid 20s, it has still remained. It's gotten better but I still get breakouts occasionally. I also have patches of dry skin, especially during the winter. I was happy to review Differin because it addressed both of my skin issues. My skin wasn't flaky and my acne seemed to improve. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I suffer from sensitive combination skin at times and other times from just oily skin. It's hard to find anything that works and doesn't irritate me and so far this has been good to me. I get occasional breakouts and I haven't had one since using this so that's been a major plus for me. I love how it has spf protection and doesn't feel heavy on my face, overall a very good product :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have oily skin but it does get dry, especially in the winter. I have used different moisturizers that moisturize well but then leave my skin feeling very oily. The Differin Oil Control Moisturizer is the first product that I have used that can moisturize my face without adding oil to it. It's magical! My skin has never looked so good. I love that it also contains some protection from the sun because we all know how damaging the sun is on skin. My skin is glowing and looking so fresh.

"I don't suffer from heavy acne, but I do frequently get blemishes and using this has helped reduce that frequency. I actually use this about every 3 days as an alternative moisturizer and I really have seen a difference in my skin. I will also mention I do not have super oily skin, so I can't speak to that aspect. For someone with normal-dry skin, this moisturizer is still hydrating (as sometimes oil controlling ones can not super soothing). Great for the price!

I have dry oily skin and also suffer from mild acne have to be careful with the lotions that I use on my face to make sure that I don't break out from them this lotion has been great it's nice and light weight goes on smooth and has not caused any breakouts would definitely recommend and will be purchasing again.

I live in sunny state , so I am glad i have product that can protect my face . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a great product as we're heading into spring and summer. Great coverage and protection from sun without it feeling greasy or like it's going to negatively effect my skin. I've been using for a week or so with no breakouts! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is wonderful! It does a great job with my oily skin while keeping my skin hydrated. I like that also contains sunscreen, which is great because I am very fair complected. It's nice using a product that does the same thing that I would've had to use three other products for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

When I tried this cream for the first time it was amazing how beautiful my skin was. I love it because it has sunscreen and at the same time the skin looks healthy and helps with the excess oil and the acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion is awesome! It has spf in it so it protects your skin. It's also super light and won't clog your pores. I hate traditional sunscreen because it's so greasy it clogs my pores. This stuff does not do that! I will be buying more of this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've struggled with greasy skin & blemishes for the last 10 years & have not found a good moisturizer until now! Differin has really got a great product here & it's even greater that it is super affordable! I have used this everyday & can see a huge difference in how much oil is on my face at the end of the day. It hasn't clogged up any of my pores at all so I am totally SOLD!

Differin helped control my oily skin all while helping with acne and giving me smooth moisturized skin. All in one product for all your facial needs. Added spf helps prevent skin damage from harmful sun rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I greatly appreciate that this product delivers the moisturizing I need on my face without feeling greasy. My face is combo- can be dry after washing, but produces excess oil during the day, so this is the perfect solution for me. It absorbs into the skin and doesn't irritate it. Thank you!

Works awesome! Does exactly what I want it to do! My skin is normally very dry and flakey and
This really helped with all of that. On the plus side Iit has spf in it and I don't have to worry about the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The first time i applied this to my face it did make my skin dry but I decided to try it again. To my surprise the second time i applied this it didnt dry out my skin. Maybe it was because of my sensitive skin i dont know. I was very happy the second time it didnt dry out my face. It is oil free i absolutely love that about this. It did make my skin shin a little but it wasnt overbearingly shinny. I was pleasantly surprised to see it helped with the acne and my face was less oily.

"I have naturally oily skin, so it's hard to find a moisturizer that I can apply after shaving without leaving behind a greasy feeling, or causing me to break out."
"The Differin lotion is a perfect balance of moisture, and comfort that leaves your skin oil free all day, while providing protection from the sun, or harsh conditions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely love this moisturizer! Goes on smooth and does not leave your face looking oily and shiny. Does not feel like you have anything on your face and it's a sunscreen as well! Win win! Will buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Diffrerin controls the oil while leaving skin soft and oil free. I couldn't believe how great it was I definitely will be buying some more! It makes you feel refreshed and ready to go for the day and does not make you feel like your putting a pound of stuff on your face. It also does not leave your face dry.

This is a nice lightweight sunscreen that absorbs into my skin quickly. I have combo skin and heavy moisturizers and sunscreens make it really shiny really quickly. No problem with this. I like that it's two in one to make my morning routine easier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product, oil and fragrance free. My main goal (as a guy) for it not to clog my pores and this product is specifically designed for that. It feels very light on the skin after you apply it which is important [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Differin! For so long I have struggled finding a product I could use that worked for my combination skin and that would not break me out. This is it! I can use Differin without worry of a break out like other products and it works! Controls the oil and helps with my skin. Absorbs quickly leaving my face feeling refreshed.

"When I tried the Differin Oil Control Moisturizer I was pleasantly surprised by how well this worked on my combination skin. It limited any oil and shine, but did not dry it out.

"Definitely helped my skin not break out so much. I have such sensitive skin that nearly everything will immediately turn it red and start to break out, in both rashes and acne. Will definitely be making this purchase again! And I love that it has SPF! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised with Differing Oil Control Moisturizer, it was non greasy, absorbed nicely and didn't have any offensive scent. It worked nicely on my sensitive skin. I like the little pump on the bottle, I always prefer that over an open jar which doesn't feel as sanitary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer! It is a must before I apple my makeup. The smell is great and isn't messy, I've noticed a big difference in my scars and haven't had any acne whatsoever! Can't wait to see more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this and can notice that for that last week I haven't had any new breakouts at all. Does feel slightly oily on my skin, but not heavy. I'd recommend trying this out for a regular daily moisturizer if you have or are prone to acne! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this moisturizer is not greasy, it is lightweight and dries and absorbs quickly all well not being stinky like sunscreen. This all helps so my pores are not clogged and i am left feeling like its more helpful that harmful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this everyday since I received it. It's so nice! Smells very strongly of sunscreen, which I don't mind at all but some might. Does not have that heavy feel that sunscreens usually do. Feels very nice & light on the skin. I use it under my makeup and have no issues with my makeup blending well or breaking down faster. I will be using this a lot in the upcoming months, and definitely repurchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If you have oily skin this is a great moisturizer. It balances the oil. It doesn't dry out the skin like other products. It's not chalky and applies very smoothly to the skin and doesnt clog the pores. Its hypoallergenic which is great. Offers the right amount of hydration to the skin and protection from the sun.

"I used this to protect my face and neck when I was out in the sun all day and I didn't get any color! I didn't get shiny either, which is often the case without a lot of sun screens. Will definitely keep using this to protect my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Differin is an amazing acne product!!! I've been using for a couple weeks now and can definitely see a difference on my face. It really works on my acne and does not leave your skin dry. Will keep using Differin Oil Control Moisturizer :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Differin Mousiturizer is different from all the others because it has great oil control ingredu=ients as well as suncreen protection and is made to help acne prone skin like mine! This will not clog your pores either. With the broad spectrum sunscreen SPF 30 this will protect you from sunburn while helping you stay oil free. This is my new favorite mouisturizer and it will be your as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have mild acne, due to my hormones. As well as large visible pores. So this helps controls it as well as moisturize my face, without leaving my face dry. This is Definitely for me.vand will buy in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This acne treatment is different because it doesn't feel like an acne treatment! It feels more just like a moisturizer.. but it doesn't clog your pores!!! It's also super gentle on your skin which is good because if you have sensitive skin, sometimes this type of product hurts. This one feels gentle and smooth and refreshing! I am really glad I got to try this. I didn't even know it existed! For anyone looking for a GENTLE, replenishing acne treatment.. try Differin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Differin Oil Control Moisturizer, is one of the best products I've ever used. I thought once I was older, I wouldn't have to worry about breakouts, but I found out quickly that that isn't the case. So to find something that actually works is amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this in conjunction with the cleanser and when I say it keeps the oil at bay...that is what I mean. I have breakthrough oil throughout the day and this moisturizer has been a lifesaver at keeping my face from being shiny. No dried out spots breaking through throughout the day either. Definitely keeps the acne breakouts low and my face clean and clear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This didn't do anything to control my oil. Hoping at least it works as a sunscreen.
"Differin is different from others because it works right away. It seems to tackle the problem at the source for better, beautiful, clearer skin. It restores confidence in stepping out without being to self conscious about people staring at my face. I was apprehensive at first with any side effects in using this product. So far so good. I have only had amazing results and I am completely pleased at how well and fast it works to clear me up and give me the joy back of loving myself.
