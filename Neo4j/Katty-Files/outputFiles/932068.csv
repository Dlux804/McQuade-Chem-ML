I am 51 yo. Love 7 in 1 . Love the way it works. Fragrance free is a big plus! Using it everyday and recommend to all my friends! Enjoy it! Great gift for yourself and your friends and family!
"I have been using Olay since it was ""oil of Olay""! I love the Total Effects, I have been using this one since it came out on the market, very nice light, every day moisturizer. I have also been told that I look ten years younger than my actual age, I think it does have a lot to due with using Olay products for the past 20+ years."
This is a phenomenal product that performs exactly as promised. It's gentle enough for my sensitive skin and I use it every day.
I have used this for years but am finding it more and more difficult to find it (without scent or sunscreen) at local stores. Delighted that Jet had it! It really makes a difference in my aging skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for years, maybe 20 years. Love the stuff, it gets absorbed into my skin instead of coating my skin like other products. I am of the older generation, and everyone says I look young. Olay 7 effects has helped me achieve looking younger. The product is amazing."
"I keep this at all times. It glides on smooth, then absorbs quickly. It doesn't leave any residue behind. You begin to see results within a week and they get better all the time."
"Been using this product for two weeks and so far I'm pretty well satisfied. My skin is usually very dry this time of year, this helps immensely. I haven't experienced any breakouts using it and my skin looks great. I have noticed that my face appears much shinier as the day wears on than it usually does, so I'll have to get oil blotting paper or something to deal with that. I'll be switching to the one with SPF for summer."
"I thought this product made my skin more smooth and soft. It did not help with lines and wrinkles or dark spots. I will not repurchase. The Olay with sunscreen works just as well, and is cheaper. It also made me break out a little and had a tingling sensation for a few hours after putting it on. My skin is very sensitive."
I love this moisturizer and have been using this daily for a few years. It goes on non greasy and when it dries you know your skin is still hydrated. Makeup goes on smooth.
"I have been using Olay Total Effects for several years. My skin is nearly wrinkle free, the skin tone is even and it faded one age spot to nearly invisible. I love it!!"
"About 3 weeks using this product. I have sensitive, acne prone skin, in my upper 30's. No breakouts or irritation. My blemishes looks lighter. Feels good under makeup. It's fragrance free but has a light SPF smell. Only 1.7 oz for almost $18. so, is a kind of expensive but works good, due to his size I can carry the container without problems when travel. The 15 SPF is a pro. Is not thick, easy to apply, quickly absorbed. Skin feels well moisturized but not oily. It really minimize my pore appearance and fine lines."
"When your friends start noticing how dry your face is its time to do something different, so I tried Olay Total effects fragrance free ( I'm already allergic to many perfumes) 7-in-1 moisturizer. Everyone notice the difference right away more importantly I notice my face wasn't dry and my skin was smooth and soft."
"I find the Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti Aging Moisturizer to be a very nice lotion. My skin is combination. I find that it's a light absorbing lotion that's very effective for a general usage moisturizer. I personally use it am and pm. I think it's a great product at a fair price. I will continue to use it, and would recommend to others."
"I have always used Walmarts own brand and found it just the same but at times the cream is a little firmer, much to my liking."
recommended by several friends after trying many other products. Really helps dry aging skin feel soft again.
I really like the product; I have only been using for about two weeks but I can see the difference it is making on my skin
"I love this product it is light doesn't feel greasy! Goes on so smooth, I don't even break out and I have sensitive sense. I will keep buying this facial cream over and over again. It's worth the price you pay."
Leaves a slight white cast so for that reason I will not buy it again.
Best stuff on the market.
Love this line of Olay's moisturizer.
Visible results in the first use. Non-greasy not heavy for the skin
Excellent product with good price
"I have used the fragrance-free SPF 15 version of this moisturizer for years, and now it's not available. I have very fair skin, so SPF is a must, but I don't like fragrance (on my face) either. I hope it's being repackaged or reformulated and that it will be back. I'm going to try Neutrogena's moisturizer with SPF 30, but it's not fragrance free :( Please bring fragrance-free SPF 15 back! Better yet, make it SPF 30 or more."
I started using this product when I moved to AZ in 1998 ( The non fragrance free formula)! I was just beginning to get creases around my eyes then. Through the years I switched to this formula(the store was out of the other) and 11 years later I am still using it! At 39 years old I have no wrinkles on my face! I have recommended this to multiple friends and family. Each person has been thrilled with the product.....too bad they don't give commission! lol I'd be rich!
I have oily skin/dry patches and can breakout. I also needed a cream to help with brown spots and little lines. this product has worked for me and I love how smooth and healthy my skin looks! I have been using olay since I was preteen my mom used it and still does.
love using this
"I'm 50 years young and love this product, it's not greasy, it's light and absorbs right away."
I have been using this for years & years. I am now 75 yrs old & when asked my age people state I look 60. Wonderful product
Disappointed with this moisturizer because didn't have sunscreen away from that good product
Works really well.
Love it
"So far I'm happy,"
"delivery was bad. I ordered two Olay products to be shipped to my home. One product arrived looking used. I would have preferred if this item came with a tight seal around the cap to indicated that no one could have tampered with it. This product, along with the other, seemed like it was almost empty. What are they shipping? Used products with no safety seals?"
"The new formula has cause so many problems with me. Made me dizzy and nervous until I washed it off! There's a few new ingredients they added to the new formula that is causing this! Why change a product with such high ratings to something different so annoyed by this, was using this moisturizer for years! Don't fix what wasn't broken."
"I love this moisturizer and have been using it for the last one month. I can feel that it has improved the texture of my skin with less visible pores and not oily at all. I use it as part of my daily routine - wash my face, use a toner and then use this moisturizer. Great product with excellent results. I will buy it again."
"I have used Olay products for many years. People can't belive my age! Granted, I have some very good genes, but I also use Olay to take advantage of my good fortune. I just wish you would have comments by someone besides myself who is in their 70's and is still concerned about their looks."
"Having oily/combination skin is hard, and a lot of moisturizers just make it worse. But, this stuff keeps me moisturized and doesn't make me get all oily. It has started to even out my skin tone and it helps heal my acne scars and reduce redness. My fine lines are even less noticeable and I love to wear it to bed. Thanks OLAY."
It does wonders for my skin.. moisturizes completely and satisfies dry skin.
"I really like this face lotion, it is easy to pumo out of the bottle and leaves my face feeling very soft."
"It does not have SPF which I really like. (If I were to go into the sun I would buy real sunscreen.) I also love the product has no fragrance. What I don't like is that it is not really moisturizing no matter how much you use. I'm only 30 with dry skin from hormones so if you have even more mature skin, I would imagine this wouldn't work well for you either."
"I started using olay products when I was 18, and started using 7 in 1 when I was 22. I was surprised that people still look at me at the age of early 20's even if I'm 33 now. This product is light,non greasy and even love it more when they released the fragrance-free one. I can say that I can go out without any make up on,just Olay 7-in-1 and I'm ready to go!"
I have tried so many products but keep returning to Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer Fragrance Free. I am not looking for miracles. I am looking for something that helps my skin feel and look better. This is it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Olay products for many years, and I am very pleased with the results. I am 72 years old and every body tells me I look much younger. I have not had any kind of surgery or used Botox , only the olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After years of using an expensive department store moisturizer my mother in law introduced me to the Olay line of products. I really didn't expect much but I found the moisturizers to be as good as what I used before for half the price. Total effects moisturizer feels light and I believe minimizes the effects of aging. I have been using it twice a day for about 10 years now and can't imagine using anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very lightweight, not greasy, and felt like it stayed put once on. I have had bad luck in choosing moisturizers in the past, always felt greasy, glad I found one I like! My Dad had skin cancer on his face, so it's very important to me in my 40's to wear a moisturizer with an spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for years and absolutely love it! I am 56 and everyone thinks I am 20 yrs. younger. I went for a while and didn't use it and noticed almost right away some dark spots and uneven texture. I went back to using this and with 2 weeks, bam, gone! I will use this product as long as they keep it on the shelves, which is I hope, forever!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using an Olay moisturizer since I was in my teens. I'm now in my 40's. I started using Total Effects anti-aging about 5 yrs ago. I have age spots & this moisturizer has faded them. I also love this moisturizer cause it's not greasy & leaves my face feeling soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this one. My cheeks usually get a little red when I use products/moisturizers but this one works perfectly. Not only do my cheeks not get red, it has evened out my skin tone and moisturizes very well No matter what I used on my face to moisturize I would always get little flakes (not the best looK!) but not since using this, it really hydrates without being too heavy. And I love that there is no scent! Definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never used an Olay product before. I am 40 and have very uneven skin tone. I have been using the product for the last four weeks, morning and night and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! My skin looks great I am going on my second 7 in one and will never use another product. I can't believe I wasted time with other products!! I also use the Olay cleanser day and night too!! I'm ready to be in the next commercial!"
"So happy I purchased this! I have been using this for little over a week now, and I have noticed a great improvement on the way my skin feels. I dreaded using foundation due to the fact that I always had dry patches on my face. Even when I didn't put any makeup on. I even tried serums at night but found them to feel too greasy. I started using this every morning and my face feels wonderful! It just has a perfect balance to it. Not dry at all or greasy. My face feels hydrated and smooth."
"I sure wish this product came out a long time ago, because I have tried several and having sensitive skin, I usually break out. But the total effects anti-aging, is fabulous, my skins feels so good and not once did I have any problems. Love the stuff stuff as well as all other products. Thank you so much.

"I've used Oil of Olay, particularly Total Effects and Regenerist for approximately 25 years. I am 58 years old and most people guess my age to be mid to late 40s. The last few years age is catching up with me a little more but I think I still look pretty good for may age and considering I was a ""child of the sun"" in my late teens to early 30s. I have recommended Oil of Olay to my 27 year old daughter. I tell her to start now and she'll look young even after she's my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is the best I have ever used. It is worth every penny. It works so well and makes my skin look fantastic. I put it on at night and when I wake up, my skin looks awake and years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never used anything on my face, not even make up. And I am starting to get wrinkles.So I tried total effects seven in one.it looks like my wrinkles are going away and my face is nice and smooth no more dry skin.I am so happy thank you for your product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 66 years old and have been using this product for a very long time. Love how it feels and gives me a radiant look. I'm always getting compliments on how my skin looks with hardly any wrinkles. I'll be using Total Effects for the rest of my days as long as it's on the market. Thank you for making Total Effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Love the creamy feel of this product it never makes my skin feel dry or itchy, like some others I tried. My skin feels so soft to the touch and I have no age lines at 66 yr. old. I have used the Anti Aging product for the last 5 years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm diligent in pursuing effective products for my 60+ year old oily, sun damaged, aging skin. Very picky about ingredients! Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer (Fragrance-Free) is my long-time favorite. It moisturizes without making my skin greasy (a real feat, I assure you!), effectively reduces spots and uneven-ness , and protects with SPF. I also use it on my neck and decollete which tend to be dry and it is equally effective there. I won't be without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am almost 70 yrs old, so I don't expect a great deal from creams, but I like the feel of this cream, its heavy enough to feel substantial, leaves my skin soft, and works well to keep dead cells sluffing off, and help with tiny lines. I like the fact it is fragrance free as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i have sensitive skin but still am ""lucky"" enough to get a zit still!! At 45!! This feels like silk on the skin, non oily, works great on my combo complexion skin type. Give it a try! You will be super happy you did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this is a very nice smelling and excellent product to wash your face on a regular basis. does not dry out your skin but also is not oily. ,keeps skin clean and feeling fresh and not dry. Makes your face more appealing. and glowing without making shine and /or drying it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really helps with my dry skin. Makes it soft but not sticky or greasy. Eases the lines as well. I noticed a difference the first time I tried it. My husband even remarked hoe soft and smooth my skin is now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay is my favorite face moisturizer and the effects and outcome is always a positive one. My skin feels and look very soft and I no longer suffer from dry and irritated skin. The Olay moisturizer keep aging skin soft and smooth and I am always satisfied with the end results. I have been using Olay products for a very long time and it is the best product to treat dry and irritated skin and restore it to beautiful silky skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this product works on my neck & face. my pores don't look so large anymore either . I am 67 years old & need all the help I can get. If you think another one of your products would do betteron this old skin PLEASE let me know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"my skin is VERY picky when it comes to skincare products, and though I do try out other moisturizers I find myself coming back to this one! I've been using this since I was in college and it has always delivered undeniably beautiful results! Perfect with the total effects cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I will be 60 on my next birthday and thanks to Oil of Olay I do not look it. I've been using OOO since I was in my 30's and I stay up with the new products. Total Effects is so creamy I feel sinful putting it on each morning a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this every day and night to keep my face soft and smooth.Easy to apply and use only a small amount each time.It helps keep my skin looking younger while reducing wrinkles.has no fragrance and is super light so skin dose not feel drawn or oily.

"I have been a fan of Olay for many, many years beginning with my first bottle of Olay moisturizer that was give to me by my mom. The Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance Free moisturizer is by far my favorite Olay product. I love the texture of the moisturizer and the way it makes my skin feel. I am very happy to say that the Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance Free moisturizer is a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Oil of Olay products for years; I've tried other moisturizers but always came back to Olay. The Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer is fantastic! I put it on my face at night and in the morning my face feels so soft. I've also been putting it on my neck area and there are less wrinkles (Yah!!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been more that thrilled with the results I have received from the Total Effects Anti-Aging Moistuiser that is fragrance free. I have noticed such a difference in my face being smoother and younger looking. Thank you for such an awesome product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer. I use it every day over my regenerist serum (just started using the serum). It's light weight enough that I do not feel like I have a thick layer on my face and it absorbs into the skin without leaving any greasiness. This is perfect for my sensitive skin and I love that the Olay products come fragrance free, which is what I always buy. I have been using Olay products for almost 30 years so I really trust the brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For years I used Olay Regenerist FF, but my kids and I have very dry skin and after a while we wanted something with more ""moisture"". We switched to Total Effects and really love it. Olay Fragrance Free doesn't irritate our sensitive skin. I love Olay moisturizers and will not use anything else! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i have been using lots of different products such as estee lauder, clinique and other expensive brands. i ended up having lots of acnes and very sensitive skin...i need something just gentle for my skin so i picked up this moisterizer from local target store without expecting much. After i used about three weeks i start noticing my skin tone getting better and it also helped me with my acne. totally recommend for anybody over 25 and having skin problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture of this cream is nice, not too heavy but still rich feeling. I can notice a difference in the morning when I use it vs. when I don't use it, but so far I haven't noticed an improvement in my skin overall. It's a lot better on my skin than creams with fragrance, but even so I notice a mild warming sensation on the more sensitive areas of my face. Like retinol products, I just assume this means it's working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It is so hard to find a product that has no fragrance free but also is as fantastic at keeping your skin moisturized as this one. I love the way it product makes my skin look and feel. I give this product an A+. I wish more of Olay's products was fragrance free for then I would be able to use all of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have very sensitive skin and this does not make me break out! It is lightweight enough for me to wear under my makeup. I have noticed a difference in my skin tone since I have started using this and I love that it is fragrance free!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer really works. I apply it to my face and neck. I put it on before my makeup so it helps to apply my foundation. And I have seen a difference in my complexion since I've been using this moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love total effects anti-aging fragrance free moisturizer.it's lightweight, nongreasy and doesn't clog my pores. Keeps my face moisturize and even tones. Doesn't make my face break out. I also recommended to my daughter, who also loves it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I began using Total Effects years ago when a lady at Church was about to turn 95, She looked like she was in her 60's, she told me she used Oil Of Olay since it first came out, I bought it that day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoy using, cause of the fragrance free. Keep the sun away from my skin. Keep me looking young and the smoothness of my skin. I can see the different of what I use in the past. I'm actually 60 years old & I look like I'm in my 40's. It seem like I haven't age for 10yrs. Still look the same, very little wrinkle & no lines on my eyes yet. I will keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer, it is light, non-greasy, leaves the skin soft , supple and moisturized. I have combination but sensitive skin at the same time skin, I did not experience any side effects by now. I have been using this moisturizer for over two weeks, it was introduced to m by a friend's who's skin looks amazing for her age.I will continue to use this product and hope to achieve the desired results. i know it can take a little time.

I have loved every product I have used of Olay and keep falling in love with all the new products coming out. I have never found another product to do what I need in my facial care. Always come back to Olay when tried other things. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only been using this for a week so I can't say anything about the lines and wrinkles or tone or anything. However I can say it isn't enough moisturizer! My face feels tight after using. PLEASE add more moisturizer to this! Us people with very dry skin need a product that makes our face soft! I do like the feel of it! Its not greasy at all!
please don't ever stop making this in fragrance free! my skin is oily and sensitive and tends toward breakouts. i'm also cannot tolerate fragrances. this lotion is amazing- doesn't aggravate my skin issues and seems to calm my face down.. non greasy and absorbs quickly yet moisturizes well.
I love this moisturizer! I can see a big difference in my skin in just a week of use. It is non-greasy but provides just enough moisture. It has cleared my skin (along with the sensitive skin foaming cleanser) and my skin has gone from a hot mess to not even needing foundation- in a week!! I love that it is fragrance free and still has all the great benefits of a moisturizer without all the nasty retinol and other chemicals in it. Love it!!
This is the first moisturizer I ever used in my life... I only started to use this because my face started to get really dry after I went to Korea during the winter. My face is really sensitive so I have to be careful of what I use. I only used this for one day so far and I can feel a dramatic difference already. I use this along with Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser and Olay 2-in-1 Sensitive Daily Facial Cloths.
"I love this product. It provides immediate results. It doesn't smell or leave my skin oily. It is fantastic! I am so glad that I found it! My mother used it for years and recommended it to me. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't seem to bother it. Thank you Oil of Olay, I don't know what I'd do without this lotion."
"I am not sure why you took the SPF out but please, please, please bring it back! This was your best product and now I have to find another brand because you took it away. It always sold like hotcakes off the shelves so I can't for the life of me understand why you got rid of it."
"I have never used Olay before so I decided to give it a try after my other regimens haven't improved the look of my skin. I have started using this product over a month ago, but still do not see a big difference in my skin tone. My pores did seem to get smaller, but I still breakout, although now instead of having large pimples, they're smaller. The tone of my skin has not evened out. I will continue to use this product until it runs out and see if it improves the look of my skin... maybe for me, it just takes a while to work."
"This is one of my favorite Olay products. It provides excellent hydration, and brightens my skin tone. I use it every day, morning and night. I also use it in combination with OLAY's age defying anti-wrinkle daily SPF 15 lotion, and both products work well together."
"I love the Oil of Olay fragrance free. This is the one product I have found that doesn't leave my face feeling oily. I have super sensitive skin and this item has never made my skin break out. Shortly after I started using it I talked my mom into trying it also. She loves it too. Oil of Olay, you're the Best."
"My skin is sensitive and it is prone to breakouts. There were not a lot of creams or lotions that I could use. I tried this product, and found it did not irritate my skin at all and it did not cause breakouts. It is not greasy and my skin stays calm after I apply it. I like this product. I can feel good skin texture after using it. I will recommend it to friends who have sensitive skin."
Excellent product. I've used it for years! No one can guess my age LOL!
"Finally, a rich moisturizer that is feather light!!!"
Yes
By far the best moisturizer I've ever used. I recommend this for anyone who has sensitive skin that isn't dry.
"I have used this product several years now and with living in the desert, it is a skin saver. I recommend it highly."
"This so called moisturizer cream made my skin burn, after applying it to my face. Will go back to using St. Ives which is so much cheaper. Lesson learned, if it ain't broke don't fix it."
I've usd Olay products for over fifteen years. I'm almost 67 and people say I look at least ten years younger. I use the Total Effects in the A.M. My foundation just glides on. I use Regenerist in the P.M. for overnight. Love these products!

Everything about this lotion is amazing. Worth every penny because a little bit goes a long way. The bottle lasts a while also. Your face will thank you :)
"While it did leave my face feeling soft, when I woke up the next morning my skin was very flaky, especially around my eyes and eyebrows. I went back to using the original Olay and have no flakiness whatsoever."
My only complaint on this one is the sunscreen. I like to use Olay around my eyes but because of the sunscreen I can't. It will get in your eyes and burn. I wish Sam's Club would sell the fragrance one like they used to do.

This product is creamy but NEVER oily. Most people think that I have lovely skin and that I look 10 years younger than my 53 years. It is a MUST-HAVE! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is wonderful it really shows results when used daily. I use this product on a regular routine and love the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Hello, I have used Olay products since my early 20's and find all work well but find the Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer especially good and makes my skin feel soft and creamy. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first it appeared to be fine but once I applied it after using OLAY's own facial cleansers ( I've tried 3 total including the Total Effects 7 in 1 cleanser) my face burned. Very disappointed be careful with what you put on your skin.
I love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel. It's perfect for my sensitive skin because I have to use Fragrance & Oil Free Products. Keeps my face hydrated all day. Olay products rock!!! :)
"This lotion is great as a night cream, as it lacks sunscreen protection. It applies easily and does not leave the skin feeling heavy, nor greasy. I actually prefer this lotion over the Regenerist line of products - Less money too!"
"This moisturizer was recommended to me and whenI first used it, it was good but, after a week it was just too heavy for my skin. I have very oily acne prone skin and this felt caked on my skin and caused me to breakout."
"I use this product daily before make-up application. I always wait for a few minutes and blend it in again, then put on my liquid foundation. It makes the foundation look so much smoother and makes my dry spots look like they've disappeared."
I been using it for the past 4 weeks and I can feel and see a brighter and younger skin not only I've seen it but my friends and family too. I recommend it. I no longer look tired! I glow now! Try and you will see for yourself!
"Keeps my skin fresh! I wish the store I went to had this fragrance free lotion with the SPF in it, they didn't and this stuff is expensive! But it's still a great lotion and I recommend Oil of Olay to everyone I know."
"This is a great product. It really softens skin, makes wrinkles smaller, (don't remove them), isn't greasy either. But remember, a little dab goes a long way. You only get about half of a thimbleful of the cream though, so don't expect alot of cream or for it to last a long time. Such a big container for only about a quarter size of cream. It is good though, just very expensive."
I like the one w/o sunscreen. This one burns my skin.
Great product. Great for my sensitive skin.
"This product works well on aging skin, reducing age spots and wrinkles. The seller provided the product at a significantly reduced price."
Been using this moisturizer for several years! Still love it. I love the texture and love that its fragrance free. Great for my sensitive skin.
Gives the skin a new and gentle feel. Its anti-aging effect works great!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I CAN NOT REMEMBER HOW LONG I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS !!!!!!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very good moisturizer! I put it on early this morning and my face is still super soft! The only down side is the SPF scent. It does not fade!
"I love this daily mositurizer but when I push the pump it keeps coming out for a bit and makes a mess. The pump seems strange, did I get a defect?"
This was the only moisturizer with sunscreen which didn't irritate my skin. This stinks!!!!! Bring back sunscreen!!!!
"It's so soft. Replenishes skin wonderfully. Leaves no greasy or heavy residue. Also has just a hint of smell, nothing over powering. Oil of Play has come a long way!"
I purchased this and have yet to see results. I spent a lot of money on this item too.
I've used Total Effects for many years and swear by it!
It did not do much for me.
I love how this product works and the fragrance free factor is so helpful for my delicate skin!
"Wrinkles less noticeable, absorbs quick, but no SPF."
Much better than more expensive department store brands. Love it! Great for sensitive skin.
"I like the feel of it, once applied. Makes your skin look young! With the vitamins and nutrients in it. Which is good for your skin."
Moisture last all day!
it works
