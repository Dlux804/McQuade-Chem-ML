3.7,"['2', '1']"
This worked for me! Last year 2017 my face broke out with rosacea I use Vick's which help reduce the inflammation but did not remove it. I've been searching for a product like this one that is a decent price and works so I bought it. Now I'm happy to say my face got clear in a week. I kept applying the cream once a day sometimes 2x a day. Love this product.
Doesn't help at all.
