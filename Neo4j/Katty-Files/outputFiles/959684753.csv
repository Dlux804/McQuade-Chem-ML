"It was shipped to me fast!!! And I like the product and it is working all ready, only had it a week.. If you want to get rid of dark spots this is a must use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't know if it will fade my spots but it immediately improved the texture of my hands especially, and also my arms. I'm trying it on my sun damaged neck too, where the skin is thickened. For sun damaged aged skin it seems to be a good cream. I'll find out in time if it fades freckles or age spots."
I bought this product about a year ago and it works so well all my dark spots are basically gone!!
Works slowly I use it every night for a month so far.
For the price Palmers Fade Away Cream works better than other expensive brands
I have always loved Palmer products. I am still working with the fade cream. But it takes time it
I've used it for years and feel that it really works to fade those age spots.

"It didn't fade the dark spots, it just discolored my skin."
