"I have used an older formula of this in the past and after success with that one I decided to try this one too. I had terrible acne scarring and have had amazing results!!! I love this product and highly recommend it, it has greatly helped my confidence. I have mostly oily skin, but it is also sensitive and can be dry at times, I have been careful not to use this daily as it does not help the oiliness but as a night cream it is wonderful and reduced my scarring by almost 100%. I am so pleased I tried this product."
