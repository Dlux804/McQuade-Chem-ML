I got this in the mail last night and I was so excited. So I took my shower and the put this Alba on my face. The scent was nice and fades fast so it is not a bother. But I woke up this morning and I looked and felt like a new woman. My face was so soft!!! I Love this stuff and will continue to buy.
I have used this for 2 years and I love it . It is not oily and it keeps my face soft and filling good all day. I use it once in the morning and before bed. I also use the hawian pineapple face wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great price
This moisturizer and I have been together for Years...love that it is not greasy but feels silky and smooth...just love it!
"I started buying this a couple of years ago, then could not find it in stores. So glad that I can continue to purchase it st Swanson."
"This moisturizer has been great for my oily skin. I purchased it solely based on the reviews. It is a wonderful product - the best I've found so far for my face. It moisturizes without being heavy & my skin feels so smooth. It wears well under makeup. My face doesn't get as shiny as it did before. It does have a perfumey scent that concerned me when I got it, but the smell fades quickly & is not bothersome. I saw improvement in my skin after just a few days. Love this product."
"i have difficult skin when it comes to keeping it moisturized. my skin usually is dry and oily and most face lotions just make it more oily. i use this 2 times a day after i wash and my face. my face has through its longest period of time without a pimple, and it feels moisturized! i love this product and the facial wash too! and better yet its organic(or the box says so)! the chapsticks are also wonderful!"
"I've been through my share of trial and error with facial moisturizers. This cream is a bit on the heavy side, so only small amount is needed, but it works wonders. My face remains moisturized the entire day. Plus it's organic and not tested on animals. The only down side, is that it does not contain spf, but alba has another product for that. Overall I would recommend this product."
"Our daughter has skin issues. Some face creams irritate her skin, but this one she has been able to use for a while now. It was a good find for our needs."
"For anyone that needs a light non greasy moisturizer, this is the one. Leaves my skin refreshed all day and not greasy. I used to use Proactive Green Tea moisturizer but it got too expensive. This product has the same quality, just as effective and half the price!!!"
This moisturizer smells soooo good. Its smooths on nicely and I only use a tiny bit so its going to last a long time for me because a little bit is enough. Its not greasy feeling and keeps my skin moisturized all day. Its also non comedogenic and goes good under makeup so that's a plus for me (I have acne prone skin) It somewhat feels similar to the proactive green tea moisturizer
"love the feel of the oil-free moisturerizer. Have used it for years, but was unable to find it locally"
This is a great moisturizer for my sensitive skin. I have tried many different ones and it seems that they always break my face out and do not add any moisture to my skin. I love this one. It does not cause any breakouts and it works well.
"My mom's getting her third Alba Hawaiian Moisturizer, said it works very well for her, and doesn't want to try anything else, as they usually end up being a waste. Definitely recommend it."
"Absolutely the best moisturizer I have ever used. No greasy oily feel. Even when I get up in the morning, my skin is still so soft and the best part, no oil! It smells so good too."
"I wanted a moisturizer that wasn't too oily, but also something that wasn't too lotion like. I'm really sensitive to facial products making my face itchy but this doesn't irritate at all. It has just a slight natural scent which is really nice."
"This is by far the best lotion I have ever found! I wish Walmart would Stock it still, But at least I can still order it. They deliver very quickly! There's no oil in this lotion, it's light and wears great under make up! I have my Mom and my sisters hooked too! Works so well!"
This probably the best I've ever used
"GREAT SERVICE FROM THIS COMPANY, AND LOVE THE PRODUCT."
"I have used this product for about a week now and I really like it. I had been using L' Occitane Immortelle Precious but at $50 a jar it gets pretty pricey fast. It was also too heavy but I like Alba Botanica better, it is light on my skin. I mix it with oil free tinted moisturizer and gently apply it on my face before heading out the door and its perfect. It has not caused me to break out. I have combo-oily skin with few breakouts.I do wish it were a pump and not a jar but I would still recommend this to a friend."
It's the best moisturizer.. affordable and worthy for the price. It makes the skin so soft and it's harmless.
My favorite moisturizer! Its very light weight and the fragrance is not overbearing. I have dry skin and I can tell a difference when I use it.
"It has a nice, light smell and feels pretty good on my face. I haven't used it long enough to see if it will turn back the hands of time, but I'm pretty sure it won't don't any harm. I like it so far!"
I like it and it works well but not a fan of the alcohol in it.
"light, easy to apply, improvement within 2 days no animal products or animal testing"
"Leaves my face very oily after a couple of hours. I went against all the ""oily"" reviews in hopes it would be different! This is not a good product for my face, maybe it is for someone else but it definitely is not oil free."
"this is an affordable facial moisturizer that is lightweight. it is also natural which is huge for me. i dont want all sorts of chemicals on my face, i want to keep it as simple as possible! my face feels clogged easily, but this lets my face breathe, but gives it the moisture so it doesnt feel tight, dry... i love it :)"
I love this moisturizer I'm on my third jar actually
it's an awesome moistuerized .. no more oily face !!
My face is at its best when I use this moisturizer; the dryness is gone yet there's no greasy feel/look. And any milia spots shrink when using this moisturizer.
"I have continuously searched for an affordable and useful facial moisturizer. I have tried multiple brands (Neutrogena, St. Ives, etc.) with no success. It is early on, but so far, this Alba moisturizer has done wonders for my dry face! At this point, I would highly recommend it!"
"I recently started an HCG diet which recommends not using any oils on the body. I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great! This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients."
"I love this moisturizer because it's OIL FREE and it absorbs quickly into my skin for a glowy complexion. The scent is very subtle and smells somewhat floral. However, after doing plenty of research, I heard it contains octyl palmitate, which causes blackheads. This bothered me a bit because I always thought the ingredients were all natural. So far, I had no problems with this product and no breakouts.So i will continue to buy this until i find my HG lotion."
This is an amazing product. Keeps face moisturized without the feeling of it being heavy or greasy.
It helps with my dry skin... using for past 1 year...
I love this cream. It's not greasy and feels light on my skin.
This product is non greasy a d light yet it leaves your face feeling soft and smooth.Wears very well under make up. I have used it for seven years send love it love it.
"I love this cream! I wish they did not put vit e in it, but you can feel is moisturizing your skin all day, and its very quick and easy to apply. Also a great value!"
This product claims its oil free yet after i apply it to my clean dry face a few hours later my face looks all shiny and is super oily! All i like about it is the smell but i dont see it doing anything for my skin! Why claim your product is oil free yet its not?
I was looking for an oil-free facial moisturizer that is paraben free. I found this product at it is amazing. My skin looks and feels great.
"Very good product, light not greasy. Wal-Mart needs this back inside the stores."
This has been my go to moisturizer for sometime. Lightweight and a little goes a long way!
