I love this cream! This was my first time to try it...and the scent is fresh & clean. Just a small amount is needed. Even my daughters enjoy using it on their face. Very refreshing to use on my face at night before bed....and also in the morning under makeup.
I bought this at a health food store for 3x the price as what I got it on walmart online. Was afraid it would be a different product cause it was so much cheaper but its not. Love the orangey smell and not to greasey. Good daytime cream for older skin
I've heard the values of C over and over. Many of the creams are over $100.00. I've been using this every morning and night and I love it. I am seeing great results. I'm over 65 and living in a dry climate.
Organic Vit C cream has made my rosacia (sp) barely noticeable. My sister told me about the product and I love it. My face looks and feels so much better. I use it a.m and p.m. I will definitely buy more.
"I use this at night when I sleep.You can use this anytime you want.Love the smell ,it smells like you just peeled a orange and I have notice some result but its only been a week"
I love this cream. I use it after my exfoliation. I love how it smells of oranges but not over powering. I do get headaches due to perfume but this cream is wonderful.
"This facial cream is about the same as most less expensive facial products. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and am please with the softness of my face and I do see some of the fine lines I've had are lessening in appearance. For the money, this product is worth it."
Avalon Organics Vitamin C Facial Cream..Give It A 5 Star...It has no harsh chemicals...I have used it for over a year and really like the way it makes my skin feels and looks..Vitamin c cream is also good for brown spots...
"I decided to try this moisturizer with vitamin c. I always use high end brand name moisturizers, but I must say, after using it for 2 weeks I am not only pleased I am impressed."
"I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks. So far I have not seen any change in my skin or lines. I did read that it would take about 6 weeks so I am going to continue to use it and see what happens. It smells really good, like oranges."
"I was amazed that in a few days I was able to see the results of daily use of the facial cream!! I recommend it to anyone seeking refined skin, with a smooth, softer appearance and feel. It's great!"
I am trying this instead of more expensive things and I like it better than anything I have tried.
So far so good. Been using for a week now and it is making a great difference.
It helps erase small wrinkles like on your arms.
I love this cream! So smooth and makes my face feel great!
So creamy and a little bit goes a long way. Soaks in very well.
Not happy with new formula. This new one is richer but a little too heavy and doesn't smell as good. Returning it.
"Makes my skin feel soft and it smells really good. I have been using for about a week so far because i read another review that said it helped treat dry spots. I dont see any improvement with the dry spots, i noticed i had more dry spots. I will continue to use until its all gone to see if it will get better"
This product so good for your skin with the vitamin C . love it.
"I didn't like this cream. It irritated my skin, so if you have sensitive skin, don't buy it."
Very nice cream to add moisture and to get rid of dryness on your skin.
"Good natural product. My skin looks brighter. I will keep buying this product. Sheer butter causes acne, but so far it's no problem to me."
"Works well for my sensitive skin. I've only been using this for about a week, and haven't yet noticed a huge difference. However, I do like the feel of it and the fragrance is very nice."
"I love the texture of the cream, the smell, the way it fast absorbing. The main part that it's all natural - definitely biggest desision to buy. Can't say lots about results yet - using it only for a week, hard to say yet."
Early results are good.
Good cream
Don't spend your money on pricy name brand products!! This is worth far beyond its price!! I bought this for twice as much from Wal-Mart and Loved IT...now I can get it with my vitamins FOR SO CHEAP!! Try this you will love it! Oh and I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any bad reactions...
"This works wonders for my dry skin! Helps retain moisture on my face all day & night w/o being oily. Works beautifully under my makeup too. Soaks into my skin. Therefore, no lotion buildup nor an oil slick. The orange smell is natural & not synthetic. Therefore, it is aromatherapy, & not a toxic headache you'll experience if you're sensitive to chemicals, which I am. Also, the smell does fade away quickly too. So, no, you won't be smelling fresh citrus all day long. I love love love this product! Fantastic value!"
"I read the good reviews on this product and decided to try it as I have read that vitamin C is good for aging skin. I have combination oily and have SENSITIVE skin. After applying this creme, I had a great amount of stinging. The next day I woke up with irritation on my cheeks and chin. I stopped using it 'til the irritation went away then tried it again. I got more breakouts and have stopped using it. I tried the serum instead and love it."
"I have found this cream to be a delightful addition to my skin care regimen. My skin is very dry and, at 72 years of age, beginning to show it. This cream has restored a fresh and bright look to my face. The thin wrinkles are gone away. I would not be without the cream and order two at a time."
so far it is working good time will tell
"I have been looking for a moisturizer that that doesn't leave my face looking and/or feeling greasy and this stuff is it. It goes on easily and is absorbed quickly. Also, a little goes a long way."
I have been using this Vitamin C Cream for over a year and half. I was reading the best things for your face from DR. OZ. was Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid Creams. I can see the difference and you can't beat the prices.
This cream is amazing! I've noticed a huge difference in my skin and only been using it a week. Smells great! Great price! Every store I saw this exact same product was $35! I will definitely be buying this again!
I have been using this product for a couple months and love it. Its nice and thick and Vitamin C is great for the skin. Love the price .... I have seen it in the stores at a much highter price..
"After a month of using this stuff, I can't honestly say I see any difference. But I'll continue until the jar is finished before I make a final determination."
I havent been on this long enough 2 answer it. I do love smelling the oranges in it. Thats all i know at this time. Or maybe 3 weeks should of show something.
Love this cream. Great results ... Not greasy or sticky. I recommend it.
"Bad quality. After I put it on my face, it wasn't absorbed at all. A few seconds later, it started to peel from my face and make my face full of white powder. Yuck! The delivery was few days late. All in all, the seller sent me something totally different from its picture. I doubt if it is a fake ""avalon"". Be aware of this seller!"
"Bought it yesterday and tried it on my face and neck. My face is fine - no tingling, itching or redness, but my neck is driving me up the wall with stinging and itching. I do not have sensitive skin issues. Be warned - after reading other reviews, I find that others have had this reaction to the product."
"The first time I purchased it, I liked it a lot. Then I ordered 2 more jars. However, this time, it was not as good. The cream appeared mushy, and I could drain water out of it. It was hard to apply it as it was so thin on the surface. I think the cream is simply too old that caused the ingredients to separate from the liquid."
"Based on the reviews, I decided to try this cream. Disappointed that it does not live up to the hype. This cream smells fresh, like oranges. It does moisturize, but not any better or worse than any other cream. Not sure that I would buy more since it is not a stand-out."
"This cream seems to be very effective so far. I love keeping my complexion clear and healthy looking! I've had several compliments on my complexions since using this cream. I used to use only coconut oil on my face, but now I use both: right after washing my face I use the coconut, then an hour later before putting on any makeup (just mascara and eyebrow pencil), I top of my complexion with vitamin C cream. It has a lovely luster to it, and I'm so glad I tried it!"
"I love the texture and smell of this cream. It is smooth and moisturizing without feeling at all oily or watery, and it smells like orange sherbet. I like the ingredients and feel good about putting them on my face. Plus, the jars are quite cute, and useful for several other products when they're empty (the label is removable). Works well under makeup because it's not shiny."
"This cream burnt my face. It made my skin turn red within a minute. Really sucks because I had high hopes for it, and it smelt so good."
I use it on my face and neck. It noticeably reduces puffiness and wrinkles especially below my eyes.
Great facial cream and really like the fragrance. Makes my face soft and smoother. Will order again many times!
The cream is great. I am a man in my fifties and I must say this stuff really works. A great value for the price.
I love this product. People have asked me what I'm doing differently with my face so it must be working!
I love this cream. It's gentle and so good for my skin. My face looks brighter and feels so good when I use it. I know I will order it again.
"The moment I put this on my face I could feel it tightening. I love it and have reordered another jar, I will continue to use this product."
I've been using this for years and love it. My skin feels smooth it looks younger then ever! My husband compliments the way my skin looks -
"My product came as promised-I have been using it every night since I got it, ubt it's too soon to see a difference in my dark spots."
Really good
"This cream is thick and not the easiest to spread so I use more, which may be by design. It does not make my skin oilier or drier. I use it twice a day with Avalon's orange cleanser. I also take 350mg photoceramide supplements daily. After a month's use, my skin feels smoother but my age spots have not changed. I am going to make my own vit c serum to see if it affects my age spots. There is a recipe for DIY vit c serum at healthbeautyandskincareproductsdotcom."
A bit high in price and I have only been using it for about 5 weeks so in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Swanson Vitamin C cream over both I am not sure which one of the three it is that is working or maybe it is a combination of the three but my face is not so dry anymore and has some moisture to it now and my upper lip seems to be smoother as well.
"I have been using it for the last month, I like that it's all natural and smells just awesome, like you just peeled an orange. But it feels heavy on my skin, when I apply it, it seems stuck to my fingers. I don't know how else to explain what I feel, maybe it's just a heavy consistency cream."
great product! makes my skin feel soft & young :) thanks a lot!
Best moisturizer I have ever used. So glad I found this one.
i have been using this product since long ago and keep using it. highly recommend it .
Wrinkles seem to be diminishing. I don't see the firmness yet but it's only been a couple weeks
"I use this daily-excellent moisturizer & wanted the benefits of Vitamin C, plus it smells good too."
"i like this product, it is not greasy,smooth,doesn't cause any allergic symptoms"
I felt like I had to use a good bit because the face wash dried my face out.
Smells great and I like the feeling it leaves on my skin. Susan
"An excellent moisturizer that doesn't clog my pores, or break out my combination skin. A little goes a long way and the scent is a pleasant citrus."
"This cream has a wonderful citrus fragrance when you apply it, but for me it seemed to make my skin feel dry instead of moisturized. I've used the facial cleanser and loved that, but this renewal cream isn't a hit with me and I won't buy it again."
"So happy to have this back for moisture. I don't know why I keep trying different things. This one, I really missed! Moisturizes great in the winter for my very dry 53 year old skin."
I love this facial lotion! It's very moisturizing and goes well under make-up. I suffer from dry skin during the winter months and this product has been the best on those very dry and cold days.
"I thought after reading a few of the reviews , this would be a nice change....having a product with vit c. I received the cream. I felt the smell of orange was stifling and like the orange cleaning liquid you can buy. The cream was hard in the cantainer and after pulling some out the application was stiff and unpleasant. I put it on over night and the next moring had a couple of red bumps ....like zits ....which I hadn't had in years. I think the jar I ws sold was old and I want to send it back. I felt like it clogged my pores"
"I recently turned 50 and I have combination skin. After trying numerous cleansers, this is by far the best, not just because the price is so reasonable, but it leaves your skin feeling clean with no oily residue or dryness. It's gentle enough for my ""tender young"" skin....said with a smile.......but no harsh stripping that leaves your face feeling tight! Along with the Vitamin C moisturizer, these products will be in my cosmetic bag forever!"
"Have not been using for a long time therefore it got four leaves. But for the price you cannot beat it. Not tested on animals, organic ingredients, no parabens. This is a steal. Makes my skin feel softer and has a more radiant glow. Not sure why others state it is greasy, it is a thickish cream but once you rub it into the skin my face is not oily at all. Will continue to use and buy. J"
"I tried Avalon Organics' Vitamin C Renewal Facial Cream after reading the glowing reviews it had received. I don't know what all the hoopla is about. It smells good and absorbs nicely, and does make my skin feel hydrated. However, I haven't seen any signs that it is ""renewing"" anything. My skin tone is the same and my wrinkles are the same. On the contrary, what I have noticed is that my pores appear even larger since I've been using this cream. I won't purchase it again."
I use this cream in my hands and arm because I feel burning in my face.
Softens skin and lightens wrinkles. The fragrance is wonderful.
Love for price
I like all Ávalon produtcs .. I used It fir a long time ego..
I use this every morning and night after my serum. Great price!
"THIS ORGANIC,FACIAL CREAM, WAS NOT GOOD FOR ME .I DO NOT NOTICE ANY CHANGE ON MY FACE ."
"THIS CREAM WORKS GREAT. MY MOM USES IT AND SHE IS 92 YEARS OLD, AND SHE LOVES IT. I USE IT TOO. GREAT PRODUCT."
"so far so good ; such a refreshing feeling, I just ordered two more jars.(by the way I'm a 75 year male)."
"Product feels great and smells fresh. Haven't seen a difference in wrinkles yet, but haven't used that much. Will buy again!"
"It goes on creamy, not oily. Dries completely and makes your skin nice and smooth. I have been using it for a week now and time will tell in the improvement . If it completely helps, I will continue with it! Thanks"
"I just began using the vitamin C cream and so far it is working very well with my serum regimen. It's still too soon to tell, but I would definitely recommend it so far."
"I use this after I wash my face with the Vitamin C cleanser. Goes on smooth and my skin feels hydrated all day. Good, safe ingredients too. I will definitely get this again!"
"I use this product at nite and another moisturizer during the day. Since I started this, I can really see a difference in my appearance. I, too, love the fragrance and that it's an organic product."
"I really like this cream as it is rich and yet doesn't feel heavy on the skin, nor does it leave a greasy feel. I immediately feel relief when applying it to dry areas of my face."
I have been using this product for sometime and love it. Prior to finding Swanson Health Products I purchased this in other stores and this is by far the BEST PRICE!
loved the way it smells & feels
I like what this creme is doing for my 67 year old face and I like it's smell.
Mixed with Hyaluronic acid gel as a night cream. A little greasy but works well. Way less expensive than the other cream at the store.
I have used this product for about 4 years now. I think it is great. I use it on my face and neck. It makes my skin look healthy and refreshed.
"this is the best face cream I have ever used, feels like its nourishing my skin, Swanson has the best price too!"
"♥ this product! Despite the high price, a little product goes a long way. This cream is non-oily & smells wonderful. Will continue buying it as long as it's on the shelves!"
"Feels greasy and irritates my skin. The oil- free version did not moisturize. I'm going back to AUBREY'S Organics. Much better results and their products are truly natural, more effective and the prices are better than Avalon!"
Love this cream as it majesty skin feel fresh and renewed with healthy ingredients.
I am really pleased with it. It feels good and has a really nice citrus fragrance.
"non greasy, pleasing sent, leaves skin feeling soft and smooth."
Always feel so refreshed and clean after using this product.
Excellent product. Have bought multiple times
Hydrating and smells great. Like whipped cream.
This just makes your skin feel good - not greasy. Nice fragrance that smells fresh.
I love this cream and it smells so good. I like having the Vit C. too.
"Horrible , absolutely horrible. leaves your face all greasy and oily, it's disgusting , don't waste your money on this product ..........."
"been using this stuff almost 5+ yrs now. noticed it also repels insects (not 100%, but without there's a noticeable difference during the summer)"
very smooth on the skin
great product
very good
good you could eat it
