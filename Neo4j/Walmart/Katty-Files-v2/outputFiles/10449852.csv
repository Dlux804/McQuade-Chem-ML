My face is glowing! I love this product...i use the palmers complexion soap and put the cream on a few blemishes...i wish i would've done this sooner..the discoloration on my face around my mouth has always been one of my biggest flaws..now im feeling Flawless
"I had really terrible bad cystic acne after I had my daughter, after the pimples finally went away i went left with terrible red acne scars. Nothing worked until i found this. It took about 2 months to see some real results but my skin was really bad so i didnt expect anything different. I have very oily skin and this didnt mess it up once. I have used it once a day for the past 3 or 4 months now and i finally feel confident BEFORE putting makeup on."
"I love this stuff! It won't work overnight, but if you stick with it, your dark spots will disappear. Spots that have been with you for years may not completely disappear, but they'll fade enough to not even be noticed. I've even had it work on skin tags! Again, it works fastest & best on new ones. I don't ever intend to be without it. Thank you Palmer's!!"
I have used this product for 10 years off and on. I can definitely say it works. I have scars and burn marks as well as spots that just are stubborn. Every time I use Palmer 's faithfully all marks fade remarkably well. I love it.
"This product works! As a 77 year old on the outside, but a 45 year old on the inside, I needed to get rid of brown spots. I was lucky you had this amazing product because I had no idea what to use. It started to work right away and there is a noticeable difference after only two weeks. My face is looking younger. Thank you for doing exactly what you advertise!"
I bought this cream because I have used it for over ten years. I used to buy it from CVS. It keeps my face clear and free of black heads. I must say I was very impressed with Walmat's excellent service. The product arrived within two days of my order.
I've been using the product faithfully. I am 30 days in and look at the results. I am so happy and will highly recommend the product. Please don't get discourage if you don't see results in 2 weeks stay with it and you'll see! Trust me!
I used this 2 years ago on a nasty scar down my leg it definitely works well no sign of scar after yse.
"I was pleasantly surprised bye the rapid results, I had a few dark spots on my arms, and I could see my skin returning to my regular skintone within a few days of use, I would definitely recommend."
"I've been using this product for several months and I love I recently Purchased another jar and opened it, but found the product was brown. The store told me to reach out to the company, they were also out of product that WASNT brown... is this normal ?"
this product is great! I saw improvement with my dark spots with in a little of three day! I recommend this. p.s. my skin tone is slightly darker than Carmel
"I love this cream. I have used it in the past to fade some spots on my face and it works great. I bought it this time to use on some sun spots. It is still too early, but I feel it will fade those too."
"I purchased both the palmers fade cream in the cream (which I use at night) and the lotion, which I use in daytime because of the spf. Have used twice a day for a month now, with no results. I'm very disappointed, I thought maybe I had finally found something that will actually work because of all the great reviews. But unfortunately that's not the case."
I use this every few days twice a day and it really brightens my face and gradualy takes dark spots and shadows away. Its a wonderful product.
This is my first time using the product and I have one complaint. Nowhere needon the jar or information inside does it say how often to apply it. I've only been using it a few days and I'm starting to notice results
"The old version of Skin success comes to you with the promise of lovelier looking skin than you ever thought possible, and that's exactly what it delivered. In 4 week I literally stopped traffic with the glowing skin it brought out. The new formula is not the success that u get from the older version. Palmers please bring out THE Original Palmers Skin success. Let us your faithful users decide which formula we prefer on our skin."
"Skin success works amazingly well. It lightens dark spits as if nothing was ever there. I had a lit of dark spots around my ankles that looked like chicken pox, skin success erased them so well! The whole palmers line is great. Ive used the cocoa butter for years. But the skin success is great at removing dark marks."
This product actually works. I have been using it for a week now and i see improvement. I thought it would bleach my face but the great thing about it is that it doesnt while it fades the dark spots. With regards to the smell..the product does have a smell. Its the typical smell that all bleaching products carry die to the hydrocortisone present but it is tolerable. I am looking forward to the end of the month when my face clears up. So excited
"My skin is really dry and sensitive, and prone to allergic reactions BUT this product REALLY DOES WORK! it really helps with my dry skin and it vanished all my dark spots. I used it along with my microdermabrasion machine from PMD and all my dark spots on my cheeks disappeared. I use it before going to bed or under my makeup. I saw a difference within the first month and by the third month my dark spots were completely gone."
I was using the old product which was the best! I ran out of it and decided to go to the store and buy more. Got there and there was this new stuff which I Haye might I add!!! Broke my daughter completely out! Please get rid of this disaster! We love the old product better because it fixed the problem! You lost a loyal customer!
This is an excellent cream to use to fade those dark spots and to give you an SPF coverage as well.
Works extremely well. Use everyday fir best results. It even works on old scars.
Really prevents new dark spots from appearing on hands and fades old ones somewhat.
Smooth and creamy with some substance. Nicely scented and easy to wear non-greasy.
very gradual with dark tones
"I used to use this fade cream 20 years ago and it not only faded brown spots, it removed them completely within a few weeks. I've been using the newer fomulation for eight weeks and see nothing more than minor blurring of brown spots on my hands. This is no longer the fade cream it was!"
The new reinvented line of Palmers products I absolutely dislike. I was a faithful user of the products until now. This new line does nothing for my skin so therefore I no longer waste my money.
"I have tried many well-known cosmetic named products that claim to fade dark spots, but this is the only one that has really worked, and worked quickly! Thank you for making a product that actually does what it claims it will do!"
I love the old one better! I put this crap on my child and I and broke out everywhere! The old one cleared everything up and never had to worry about breakouts! Please get rid of this! I am a loyal customer and want what I want!
"Palmers skin success is the only product that really works on my sensitive and acne prone skin,I had tried dozens of other skincare products,but none never worked this well."
The best ever this works wonders on my face . I use it along with soap in two weeks time i see results... magic in a box ... love it so much been using it for about4 years nw
"It was shipped to me fast!!! And I like the product and it is working all ready, only had it a week.. If you want to get rid of dark spots this is a must use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted a product for my face that would clear up my post acne scars. Within a couple of months, not only did it clear up my scars, but it toned my skin, make it smoother, and it just worked wonders on it. You have to give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about."
"I love this product! I have some hyperpigmentation on my forearms from getting a bad sunburn a few years ago. I tried lasers, peels, etc. and they kept coming back. I have this sitting on my nightstand and apply it every night. It has faded them significantly! So pleased!!"
"This product is the truth. I saw immediate results from the dark circles under my eyes in just a few weeks with consistent usage day and night. After having twins and being exasperated and tired after no sleep, my face showed ultimate wear and tear. I've used numerous other products and paid close to $85 for one gel product but none of them worked but this little $5 jar of palmers fade cream. Expensive does NOT always mean better. I highly highly recommend this product."
Gradual lighten of blemishes. Although I say gradual I saw a significant improvement in 3 weeks time. I use the soap along with the milk lotion. I wish there was a product strictly for the eyes. Allergy season does a number on me. I look like raccoon eyes.
Not a fan of this stuff. Its very thick which I donât mind but its hard to rub in. I dont really care for the smell and it does not say exactly how much spf is in the cream. Alsoâ Iâm not a fan of the ingridient mineral oil which this cream has.
"Due to hormonal issues, age and sun exposure, I got dark spots on my face. I've trued absolutely everything. I even got 12 sessions of chemical peelings. I tried the anti dark spot grade cream and serum and since the first week I saw the difference"
My dark spots are almost gone in just 10 weeks that I've use this product.
"This stuff does not work. Its greasy and causes breakouts. I am never out of Palmers Cocoa butter in the jar, the lotion and the swivel stick. I carry it every where with me. I love Palmers products but this one is a big disappointment. I don't do reviews but I couldn't help it."
"I read reviews for purchasing and I purchased based on the positive reviews. Somehow in the last year or so, I had been getting adult acne and they were leaving some brown spots (maybe scarring) anyway, I was very self conscience about it. I have been using the cream twice a day for about 4 weeks and have noticed the spot have definitely lightened up and diminishing. I have a burn spot on my stomach from some boiling water and it has helped as well. I'll continue to use and expecting continued improvements."
I haven't really seen much different so far but it's also summer and I have oily skin so I haven't been using it that much on my face I will try it more often in summer but I will say it is in a small bottle but it will last for a good while it's very thick and a little goes a long way definitely if it work I will be ordering again
"Sadly disappointed. A waste of product . After a couple of days of use, this product broke me out so bad I had to discontinue use."
"I like the Palmers skin success fade cream, it helps fade away any uneven skin. Especially those that are stubborn."
Personally for me it didn't remove the scars for me at all and mostly just discoloured a few areas of my skin. I think theres too much of a hype for Palmers fade cream in my opinion and it doesn't really work. But everyones skin is different
"For 11 years I have suffered with acne/acne scars, and a skin condition (acanthosis nigricans) that causes darkening of the skin. I bought this with little hope it would work... wow. It not only lightened up my skin, but helped calm some of my acne, which happened in less than a week!!! I swear by this product now."
I have spent literally thousands of dollars on high end fade cream from la Prarie and shisheido. I've tried prescription lotions. Murad is decent. Palmers-- at a fraction of the cost of the others--works!! I have age spots on my upper lip and a scar from a bad cold sore break out. They have faded finally with Palmers. This is a REAL review and I've gotten nothing free.
I bought this cream off a reccomendation through a friend who had bad acne blemishes. I will say the first couple weekd I used it I broke out in bad acne on my face. However I figured it was because the cream is a little heavy. I kept using it 2x daily anyways like the directions state. It has now been 1 month and even though my doors are not fully gone I can see a huge difference. It also even out my entire skin tone and brought it all back to 1 color. I will buy this again
I have tried numerous expensive products to treat a few burn scars on my arm from baking. This truly works! I used it consistantly over a few months (I still use it ) and those spots are faded into my skin color. No longer white patches that stand out. I would recommend this product!
"Works great! I have really noticed a Difference after using it a couple of weeks. The marks didn't go Completely away but they lightened tremendously. I think if I limit my sun exposure and continue to use it at least once a day (I forget to use it some days, lol) they would disappear with this product. I used to spend so much money on products for this that didn't work. It's really an amazing product for such a cheap price ! I even got one for my mother-in-law :)"
I've been using this over a period of about three months together with my regular facial care products. I use it at night only and the results are very significant! My skin has cleared up a lot. Just a few minor spots I'm still hoping with even out with the rest of my skin tone.
I have been using this product on and off for maybe a year now and it is amazing! Within the first month i noticed a big difference. As a red head with a ton freckles i always hated my freckles and now my family said they donât even see any on my face! A little goes a long way! Be patient and you will notice results :)
I bought this product to use on my noticeably dark elbows. After about two weeks of using this products my elbows started to lighten up tremendously. I also recommended this product to my daughter who had some dark spots on her face and it faded them in about a couple of weeks too.
"I had acne scars and I thought I would try this, it has helped and im very happy."
This product is amazing !! It's fading my dark spots slowly but surely !!! Worth the money !!!
The cream definitely does have a smell. It isnt a horrible one but it does have a strong scent.
"I love this product, have not had anything this good since the 70s."
As far as my face goes I have seen some dark spots clear up but when I put it all over my body to get a nice glow it just made me way darker which is weird because i added spf with it
"I bought this about 3-4 weeks ago and i saw some incredible results on my face. By the third week , some of the acne where faded and my skin looked much brighter but not completely"
luminous .
"My husband got this for me. I did NOT think it would work. Things like this usually do nothing. In less than one week, everybody noticed the results and commented on it. My dark spots faced rapidly."
I am a male Caucasian and my skin tone leans toward pale. I had a tad of discolouration. This is a classic product and a great value at the right price ... IT WORKS.
I've used this product for a week and already I have noticed some slight fading on the dark spots on my arms as this is where I am using it the most. I am going to purchase another box as I am very pleased with the results so far.
"Over the years I have darken to many different shades ( my arm is like three colors, my levs two, my feet another and stomach yet another.) So I sought to elimimate the multiple shades of my complexion and this did it."
I ordered the original skin success on line because the new one in stores contains retinol which causes me allergic breakouts. I get the box in mail and i get two retinols which is not what i ordered online
not sure if i like this product or not. I know that I definitely DO NOT like the smell but I haven't used it long enough to know if it actually works.
I been using this for about 2 weeks on dark spots on my foot and i havnt seen no change in color and it made an area on my foot break out in little itchy bumps
Broke me out. Can you make a noncomodogenic one for acne prone skin
I was very skeptical at first! BUT Within two months almost all of my blemishes are completely gone! Highly recommend!
I was inlove this cream but if you have sensitive skun dont use it gave me the only bad allergy reaction
I have only just started using this. Love how it feels
I have been using this product for years and Walmart offers it at a lesser price than what I've been paying. Thanks Walmart.
"I thought that Palmers made quality products , so I thought I'd try this for my uneven skin tone. After a month, I saw NO results. Pass on this one."
The product came in a glass jar that fell on the floor and broke and I was unable to use the product after that as glass was in the product.
The cream goes on nicely and absorbs well but I've only used it for a week so I cannot comment on its effectiveness yet.
My biggest issue is acne scars. Iâve tried a few things but nothing has worked like this product. Would definitely recommend.
"It works, it is good to use over time.It will fade the darkest mark.I have used this cream over 20 years.Its good on all parts of the body."
This product is awesome! I've been using on my underarms for about over a week now and it worked wonders! My underarms are so much more lighter now. Love this product!
made face itch where i put the cream on after just once use
This product really lighten out the dark areas on my skin.
it works just as stated - not many other products can say that
I used this skin cream for 2 months and saw no results. My dark spots did not fade.
this does not work I have used it for 3 months and no change
"It has been two months I am using this product, it is working very well. It takes a while, but I can really see the difference, just take care, no more sun, always wear a hat or suncreen."
"Love this product! Delivery was in one day and I already saw results . I suffer with sun burns under my eyes and dark spots over my face, I have been searching for something to use and I came across this and decide to give it a try. It's working so far and it also contains sunscreen protection in it so I made a great choice!"
"After a few weeks of summer I started noticing dark pigmentation on my upper lip, later diagnosing myself with Melasma. I saw this product at Walmart and IT WORKS. Within a few days of using the product twice each day, I already noticed the skin getting lighter and the dark pigmentation fading away. With continued use I'm completely sure it will be gone. This cream is lightweight, has a fresh scent and I wear it under my foundation for one of the applications. I completely recommend this product."
Love it!
I've only been using for a week and it has already started to fade an acne scar. i am satisfied with this product.
I've been using this fade cream twice a day since the 10th of August 2018 until the 18th of September 2018 and it has done absolutely nothing. I would not rate this cream at all.
"I have pretty normal skin, had acne breakouts in my early teen years but none since, until now. As the other bad reviews, this product also broke my skin out. It DOES fade your spots but after a week of use I broke out very bad. My face became very puffy and 4 days after discontinuing use, I am still broke out and plan on visiting my doctor. I don't recommend."
"I don't have any pimples on my face and after using this cream for a week, I had bumps and broke out all over my face. I don't recommend this product."
This is not working. No difference at all. I should have read the reviews on Amazon. A lot of the reviews had the same complaint: didn't fade spots at all.
I bought this product about a year ago and it works so well all my dark spots are basically gone!!
I've used it for years and feel that it really works to fade those age spots.
Works slowly I use it every night for a month so far.
"It didn't fade the dark spots, it just discolored my skin."
For the price Palmers Fade Away Cream works better than other expensive brands
I have always loved Palmer products. I am still working with the fade cream. But it takes time it
"Used the jar up, did not do anything for me."
Got it for my mom. She hasn't noticed any changes yet but like the moisturizer feel of the cream.
it works just as stated - not many other products can say that
I used this skin cream for 2 months and saw no results. My dark spots did not fade.
this does not work I have used it for 3 months and no change
I once use this product but was good when using but when I stop using it I started having acene problem
Great for my skin. I love how smooth my skin feels to the touch. Will continue using this soap because it's perfect for my skin.
"It has been two months I am using this product, it is working very well. It takes a while, but I can really see the difference, just take care, no more sun, always wear a hat or suncreen."

Very bad smell. The ingredients now include sulfur which gives it a horrible smell.
Am using this bar for 2 months and its really good
