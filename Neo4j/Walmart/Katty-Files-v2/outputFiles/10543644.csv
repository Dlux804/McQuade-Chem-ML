I am on hormonal replacement after surgical menopause and have problems with creams causing acne. This cream smooth my skin and doesn't cause acne.
I apply this face cream and it keeps me from dried skin all day. This is the best value I have found in years thanks to Jet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Age Perfect for many years....I am a ""senior"" woman and feel my skin is doing well with this product. It is less expensive than some of the other products advertised as ""perfect"" for older women, but having tried a couple of them, feel Age Perfect is just as good or better and less expensive. It goes on smoothly, absorbs nicely and is not oily or greasy, does not leave a shiny presence. Other makeup goes on over it easily."
"I brought this product two weeks ago and so far I love using it. I live in Florida, as you know there is more than enough sun/so I make sure to use Loreal Age Perfect right after I clean my face. The power of this product is super, my age spots are deminish and the dark circles under my eyes has inproved. I recomend this product it one: you have dark circles, age spots or you just need that extra sun protection, this product won't disapoint."
"I have been using this wonderful Day Cream for only a week now and all I can say is wow! Finally a product that works on my dry, 53 year old skin! It helps my fine lines, my sun damage, acne scars,, all fading!! I have tried many brands from expensive to cheap and I almost gave up! Thank you Loreal!! I use this along with the matching Night Cream and will for years to come!!"
"I took a chance and bought this product. I'm glad I did, I have oily skin, it doesn't leave my skin greasy. It actually leaves it pretty smooth. Nice Moisturizer!"
I really like this product. It is absorbed easily and quickly and doesn't leave a greasy 'feel'. And of course I look 5-10 yrs younger since I began using it!
"I'M DOING THIS FOR ME. I WANT TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND FILL GOOD ABOUT MY SELF. IT WORK'S GOOD FOR ME THE PRICE IS FAB. IF IT DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU, TRY ANOTHER. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT."
"So I'm on day 2 on using this product, so far so good!! The smell is amazing, and really hydrates my skin. I will be writing a another review in a couple of weeks to see how it really works. I'm hoping it doesn't clog my pores though. Fingers crossed! I have a lot of age spots and freckles so I hope it eliminates or at least diminishes those. Time will tell!!"
"I have been a long time Loreal fan, but when they came out with Age Perfect, I found the perfect skin moisturizer for me. It helps firm those lines, and revitalize my skin in just the best way possible, plus, it also helps tone those lines. I am very happy with my skin, my complexion, and how my make-up goes on flawlessly like I've spent a long time on it when in fact it may have been 5 to 10 minutes, tops! I think everyone will be delighted with Age Perfect, for mature skin. All of it."
"I bought it on sale for mom to try. Shes in her eighties and is developing brown age spots on her face. I didn't know this before I bought it, but sent it to her anyway. She says the age spots are slowly dissapearing, getting lighter in color every day. Mom isn't self conscience about her appearance anymore. It may not work as good with other people, but I do know it works great on mom."
"L'Oreal Age Perfect moisturizes as it protects from sun exposure. It is not a product than you would use if you are lying in the sun, but rather a product that protects and moisturizes while being outdoors for day-to-day activities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I brought the cream 5 weeks ago used it for the 5 weeks. My fine lines are pumped up but my sagging skin is still sagging and my uneven skin tone is still sun damaged with uneven skin tone. This is just a suncreen. I found out the customer has to the night cream to see results. That's is what not is promised on the box.
"I have been looking for a moisturizing lotion or cream that hydrates my face, but doesn't feel greasy. AND, one that has anti-aging properties. I have FINALLY found what I've been looking for! The size of the jar is nice - lasts a long time. I just feel like my skin has taken a drink of water, and I really feel like it's made a difference in how my skin looks! I've very happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Now that I'm in my 50s, I need all the help I can get! I like how it smoothes and brightens. I use it every morning and I can really tell a difference when I pamper my skin with Age Perfect Day Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this 2 weeks ago and it works for older skin helping with age spots dryness and softness.
I thought this was a daytime moisturizer. Then when I got it I read on the back that this would not help with wrinkles. It is just a sunscreen.
I love love love this day cream! I also use the night cream in this line. It's by far the best I have ever used! I'm 53 and a L'OREAL lifer!!
"I have used this cream for many years, with great results. No problems, even though I have sensitive skin."
"I have only used this product for a few days, but am pleased that it is a heavier cream that keeps my face feeling hydrated all day long."
You need this stuff even if you don't have wrinkles yet. I could see an improvement within a few months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a nice hydrating day cream, but is very overly hydrating, so I would only recommend this for those why very dry skin, and of course as the label says, for mature skin."
I just bought this today after one application I saw a noticeable apperence in my skin tone and evenness as not dark spots or discoloration appear unlike other products I've used in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Feels great on the skin. But don't expect any miracles. After researching the ingredients, the product is simply a sunscreen and should be placed alongside other sunscreens on store shelves (not with facial moisturizers)."
"I really wanted this to work, I wrote down the day I started using it even took a before picture 6 weeks later no difference still have droopy face so on to the next product which wont be loreal"
"I have used this product, as well as the Age Perfect Night cream and have been thoroughly disappointed. It hasn't helped with any dark spots, or firming of the skin as advertised."
"This product is amazing! It does exactly what it says. I am 64 years young and people think I'm about 50. My skin is radiant and feels so hydrated. Love, love this product. Smells wonderful too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used L'Oreal products for a long time, but this is the first time that I have purchased the Age Perfect Anti-Sagging cream. It is bit heavier than the day cream I have been using. So, it is taking me a little longer to become used to it. But I like it very much and it has now become a part of my make-up routine."
"A great moisturizer And sunscreen in one. Very convenient and good value, too."
Have used this product before. Needed more before I ran out. Like it very much.
"I really enjoyed trying the L'Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream. It went on so smoothly and silky. I loved the way it didn't feel greasy or sticky on your skin. It was a couple of weeks before I started noticing my skin was softer to the touch. I have always leaned towards having very dry skin, but this product I was very satisfied with and will continue to use long after the sample is gone. Yes, I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry, aging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just turned 60, and having been using the cream daily for about a month and a half. My skin seems firmer yet softer and a few age spots have faded. Love that it includes an SPF so I don't have to wear a sunscreen. Very good moisturizing cream - I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product for many years. I think it works wonderfully.
"I bought this product 2 weeks ago and I'm glad I did. My face feels renewed, there are no sagging skin on my face. I absolutely love this product."
"I'm only in my 40's, but because of extremely dry skin, gave this a try. I haven't been disappointed. Keeps my skin hydrated and smooth all day."
"I love the creaminess, but am not happy that it doesn't contain a broad spectrum sun screen. It's not ""age perfect""."
"After a year of researching products & ingredients for my 60ish skin, I was very discouraged because nothing I tried seemed effective, or was ridiculously overpriced. But then I tried the Age Perfect line and was astounded at the excellent quality of the product. It is more effective in moisturizing and improving my skin tone than products that are triple the price. I am tossing all those half empty jars and am now an Age Perfect convert for life. Thank you L'oreal!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although this cream costs only $8.96, I can't tell any difference from more expensive creams sold online or in upscale department stores. The cream absorbs into my skin quickly and the smell doesn't bother with spf. So I consider this cream a winner!"
"i have been using this product (previously used Reviltalift SPF) for a few years now. It makes my skin feel so hydrated and supple. I have received many comments about my skin's appearance. My age is constantly being guessed as being in the the early to mid-forties. I am 58, so thanks Loreal."
"This product may work for others, but not for this reviewer This cream is awful. I did tests to make sure this was not the problem of the product but after discontining this for 4 days and then restarting use I had a bumper crop of zits. I have sensitive skin and it is dry, this cream isn't for me. I have tried several different brands from different companies and this product was the worst."
Love the larger sizes for cheaper prices and they do the same with an spf in them too as the high $$$ department stores charge. I'm very pleased with this product will be buying more.
"This is a nice cream for every day use. It is quite thick and a little goes a long way. I like that it contains sunscreen to help protect my skin. The one thing I didn't like is that it didn't feel like it completely absorbed. Overall, I like that it will help keep my skin healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 is overall a 5 out of 5 star product. I love having sunscreen in this already great product so it takes a step out of my daily regimen. Even with the sunscreen it goes on silky smooth without leaving a great trace. It leave smooth skin for me to apply my makeup onto. It still gives all the long term skin smoothing benefits I was expecting from L' Oreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream! My face feels so smooth and my makeup goes on so easily with no dry flaky patches. My age spots seem to be fading and my small wrinkles are not as noticeable. This is probably the best face cream that I have ever used. It is not very greasy either. The only problem that I have been noticing is some acne. It has not been bad but I have had a little more than normal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this day cream.It goes on smooth and leaves your face moisturized all day.Face feels softer and more lifted.The age spots are lighter in color and my sisters want to know what i am using.I highly reccomend this day cream it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream went on very smooth and creamy without leaving my face feeling greasy.My face not only felt more hydrated it looked it too.The SPF 15 was an added bonus.I would recomend this product to all my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Honestly I think this cream is a little too heavy for me for the day. It's pretty thick and it felt like it might clog my pores. I like my day lotions to be a little thinner and sink in more right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the smooth, creamy, day cream. My skin is a little dry and I always have to use moisturizers. With this cream it also moisturizes without the need of anything additional. It feels light and refreshing on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first it feels greasy while applying it but later the skin absorbs it completely. I could feels its protection from the sun while driving. This prevented getting red spots from sunburn. After several days of use I could see signs that my face looked less weary and tired. Also seemed less wrinkled and with better resilience. I would certainly reccommend it for ladies like me over 50 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had thought, after about a week of using this product that it wasa king my skin break out so I discontinued use for a few days. Turns out, the product wasn't the reason from the breakouts so I have continued use again. This product makes my skin feel smooth, hydrated and healthy without feeling greasy. L'Oreal makes a great product and I will continue to use this! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great product. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks but I can see a difference in my skin already. My face feels and looks firmer. It also feels softer. A little bit of product goes a long way. I just wish I had had longer to review this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the time using this product to give a good honest review. I really liked the product it went on smooth and made my skin feel supple and soft. I wear foundation and used it under my makeup with not issues of makeup sliding down my face which is a plus, and it did not break my skin out. I would defiantly suggest this product to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried out the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15. Overall, I liked the product. It felt good on my skin. My only improvements would be to increase the SPF to a higher number. I only felt it was a little too light weight for the winter time. By with the temperatures recently dropping, my skin is not used to harsh weather yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this cream was very nice. Felt good on my face and was glad that there was SPF 15 for that added anti-aging protection. Absorbed quick into my skin so I could easily apply makeup afterwards. Would highly recommend this for the daytime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this out as soon as I received it and have noticed by skin feels extremely soft and moisturized. It is not thick or sticky. As soon as I put it on my skin soaked it right up. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a nice moisturizing cream that goes on smoothly.the rich formula feels great on winter parched skin. I wish this had at least 30 spf vs. 15. Living in Colorado with stronger rays, I try to have at least 30 spf to avoid sun damage. It is a bit of a pain to apply separate sunscreen. I wish the scent was not as strong. While not unpleasant, it reminded me of something my grandma would use. Bit too much perfume. Would still recommend as this seems to work well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not big on creams from stores but this L'Oreal has changed my mind! My face feels smoother and more moisturized than ever before! After cleansing and toning, I apply the cream and let it do its magic! No irritation or adverse reactions. Definitely a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to use this as it sounding like it would answer several of my skin issues. The texture was great, not oily, it was very creamy and ease to apply. But it had a VERY strong smell, like I was rubbing flower petals on my skin. I was glad I was trying the day time formula because the smell could have kept me up at night. I tried to use it a second time but it was overwhelming. Really liked the way my skin felt, but couldn't get past the overwhelming floral scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the product is great for those who are looking for a sunscreen in addition to their normal skin care routine. It really smells like sunscreen too. It hasn't been a problem for my very sensitive skin, so that is a great benefit. But, I must admit that it would be too thick for me to use in the summer, but it would be good for winter months. Overall not my favorite, but it does have some positives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the fact that it has spf. I don't usually use day cream, but this one worked well. It was a bit thick and took some time to absorb. But it seemed to keep my skin smooth. It also helped with blemishes a bit. I liked that it made my skin soft. My face does not have age spots or many wrinkles, but it seemed to make my skin glow. I did not like how much scent it had. It was too perfumy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was hoping for a daytime moisturizer that wasn't too greasy. This left my face feeling too greasy and oily. I did like that it provides an spf to help protect your skin from the sun. I will not be using this product anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the texture of L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF. It is light and airy, and my skin dranknit right in. It was not at all sticky. While I tend to prefer little to no fragrance in my facial products, this Cream had a very light perfume fragrance that wasn't too strong. I really appreciate that it has SPF. I would absolutely use this on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really excited to get this L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream with SPF 15. I love a heavy moisturizer for both night and day wear, as the cold winters here are hard on the skin. But this one, isn't the one. The cream is heavy and thick, which I like, but it is almost like a greasy sunscreen that doesn't soak in! Not easy to put make-up over that's for sure. I actually think it would be better for night time use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the day cream is a good moisturizer, I did not see any improvement in the fine lines and/or wrinkles, nor did I have any improvement with my skins elasticity. I do feel, however, the day cream is a good moisturizer and will continue to use it as such. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Day Cream but I just can't use it. Not sure if it is the sunblock thar is added in or what, but it made me breakout super bad. I want hydrated skin, but I don't want pimples. So this one just isn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think you see results with this product. Immediately you feel refreshed and clean, and fresh. Combined with L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream this product is amazing and shows amazing results. I would definitely stick with this regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There are pros and cons to the day cream. I like how it sinks into my skin and isn't greasy. It does a good job of moisturizing. I'm not crazy about the packaging. I'd prefer a tube so I'm not potentially contaminating the pot with my fingers each time I use it. I would also prefer something without soy and parabens. This has both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried face creams in the past and was not a fan. I however was willing to try L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 and I loved it. It was not a heavy cream and made my skin instantly feel hydrated. I have used the cream for a couple weeks now and really like what I see. I have a diminish in age spots and my skin is much smoother. The fine lines especially around my eyes are hardly noticeable now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using the day cream 7 days ago, I noticed immediately the thickness of the cream gave great coverage. My dark spots on my arms were lightened. Also my dry skin on my face and dark spots there, were also lighter. My skin feels moisturized and softer after just a week. I love the scent and the thickness of the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is super happy right now. I didn't know what to expect using this product for the first time, I've used it for two weeks to get a good feel and to notice any changes. I absolutely love the way it leaves my skin feeling day and night, it's moisturizing but not greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I cant believe first, the full size jars ,that they sent me! I was expecting a small sample, I am so happy, with such fast results. My face has a glow to it, that it was lacking for a long time! will defiantly be buying this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cram is amazing and very silky smooth. My skin feels so good after using this cream to moisturizer my face. I also tried the night cream and plan to purchase both in the future. I even had my daughter who is in her late thirties try both creams even though she does not have any wrinkles and she agreed that both creams made her skin feel softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that this lotion is heaven for my face. The combination really makes a difference is my skin. I love the fragrance of it! I think that it is pretty accurate it its description of the product as well as the ultimate result. I think it made my skin feel stronger and softer. I've noticed that since I have added the day and night creme to my beauty routine it has really made my skin much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was reluctant to use a day cream, because I have had times when it makes my skin greasy and my foundation doesn't stay on. I decided to try this, and I was pleasantly surprised at how non greasy it was. It was light, and it didn't change how my foundation stayed on. I would have no problem using it everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. It seemed to fade out lines on my face within just a few weeks. I do however have oily skin and did notice an increase in acne, however I am not 100% sure it was this product or something else. I will definitely use this product in the future if it is not the cause! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is really great. It's light, non greasy & makes my faces feel soft. I like the way it's not heavy feeling on my skin & it doesn't feel like it's weighing it down. I like the smell of it. It's a refreshing smell unlike other facial crams that I've tried. I will be buying more of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has to be the absolutely best facial cream I've ever tried ! I love It It smells really good and It's not to strong . I also let my mom try It and she loves It as well. It makes your face so smooth . I will be buying more when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used both L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream and L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream. Both went on amazingly smooth and right into the skin. Not greasy and when I used the day cream, I put makeup on right after and with no problems. Try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is an excellent product. It goes on smooth and is not greasy and doesn't leave your skin shiney. I've used it a week and have gotten several compliments on my skin. I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Right when I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was the fragrant smell. I enjoyed the smell very much, but if you don't like fragrance in your skin products this is not for you. I loved the texture and the moisture of this lotion. I have dry skin, so this really helped hydrate my skin. Its actually very light, but its still provides all day moisture. A bonus factor is that I don't have to put on my additional sunscreen since that's all included in the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Loreal age prefect day cream for about a month now and I love it. My skin before was dry and dull looking. Now my skin stays hydrated and has brightened up really nice. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Face cream was perfect for my needs! As I'm in my 40's now, I'm needing a good face cream to help with my wrinkles and dryness and this cream was perfect with a pleasant scent. I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very nice feel, not greasy but could totally tell a difference in my skin after about a week. Easy to wear under makeup or on a naked face. The size is amazing as well, so great price point for rebuying int he future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This day cream is light, moisturizing, and easy to use. It left my skin feeling soft without feeling greasy or heavy under my foundation. I appreciate that there was no heavy scent and that there is SPF 15 in the day cream. Although the jar makes for a luxurious appearance, I would have preferred a tube for more hygienic application rather than dipping into the jar each time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's only been a few weeks of using the day cream and I'm already seeing a noticeable improvement in texture, smoothness, and firmness. The formula absorbs quickly and doesn't leave me feeling greasy, even as the day progresses. I'll definitely be keeping this product as a new standard in my beauty routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have extremely dry skin on my face and am constantly searching for a face cream that has a lasting effect. This day cream is thick, creamy, and has a mild pleasant scent. Although it is a heavier cream, it sinks into the skin and doesn't feel greasy nor does it clog my pores. I have used this every morning and my skin retains the moisturized softness all day. I have used expensive creams that didn't have this lasting effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Upon first use this cream gave my face a little tingling feeling so with that being said less is more. It is a perfect cream to apply under foundation not greasy or heavy feeling. My face feels more hydrated since I have used the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 and I do recommend it because it leaves my skin smooth and silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's only been a few weeks of using these moisturizers and I really love the way they feel. I don't notice anything regarding the disappearance of fine lines yet, that will take longer, I believe. I do notice how much softer my face and neck are at this time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited to try this cream since I really liked the night cream. Having SPF in your face cream is a must in California. Initially my skin felt smooth and hydrated about half way through the day my skin felt way too oily.Overall a good product just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try this product, and I did see an improvement on my fine lines. However, I have oily skin and this just made it more oily. I think this product would work better on someone with dry skin. Also, the age perfect cream contains fragrance, and I prefer fragrance free face products. Overall it just didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As someone having rosacea the kind of lotion I use is important. This lotion is very moisturizing and has a light pleasant scent. It didn't exacerbate my condition at all. It's hard to find a good face cream when you have this condition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always been very picky about what products I use on my face. I hate thick lotions that feel oily and make my face look greasy later in the day. This stuff is great! It is thicker than what I normally use but it absorbs quickly and never appears oily - even hours later. I will definitely continue using this product for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the day cream for the last few weeks. While I absolutely love the night cream this is just ok. First the positives - I really like the smell. It's pleasant and not overpowering. I also like that the SPF is significant enough to protect from sun damage. The negative - it's a little to thick for me. I don't generally wear makeup or foundation and I want a daytime face moisturizer that doesn't leave me feeling like I'm wearing anything. Overall I think it's a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Day Cream felt really weird on my face and did not absorb into my skin. I ended up having a weird film on top that if I rubbed it would come off in strange blobs like peeling dried glue off of your fingers. It did smell really good and felt nice and refreshing on my skin though, so points for that. But for whatever reason, this cream did not work with my skin at all sadly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Fall means my skin gets dry and flaky. I received the LOreal moisturizers and started using them immediately. They feel great, and my skin feels very hydrated and less flaky within a week. The day cream having SPF 15 os also nice when you are out and about during the day to help protect my skin. The moisturizer itself is not oily, you can barely feel that you even put it on. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These 2 creams are great .L'Oréal Age Perfect Day Cream leaves my skin moisturized, light and free feeling, not greasy and clamy likes others I have tried and it will protect your skin from the sun too because it has sunscreen SPF 15 and soy seed protein for the extra glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product felt good going on. It smelled good. It wasn't greasy. By the end of the day my skin wasn't as oily as usual. And I think that I am noticing a difference in my skin. It just looks better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product for about a month and noticed a great difference in my skin! Amazing! I can't wait to share this product with others! I would use it in combination with the Age Perfect Night Cream, as part of a daily beauty regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oréal Age Perfect Day Cream is the perfect cream. I applied it before my makeup. It left my face feeling soft and looking radiant all day. After a few days of use my skin feels years younger. I can't wait to see the results after continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The claims this product has requires 6 + weeks of use. I did not have the opportunity to do so for the duration. This cream feels oily and the fragrance irritated my eyes. I also do not understand a moisturizer is supposed to absorb into the skin and SPF creates a protective outer barrier, so how does this product work. Also the dark spots did not fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oreal Age Perfect day cream. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't after it left my skin, mostly my t zone, feeling a little greasy. My skin did feel soft and supple, which I like, but I don't like greasy skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The formula of this this product is very light and creamy. I love the way it goes on my face without it being oily or greasy. The day cream really soaks into my skin causing my skin to look more hydrated and firm. I really enjoyed this product and will definetely keep using this day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved using this cream! It was so soft and smooth. Felt like I'm putting silk on my face. Its also nice and thick and great for the upcoming cold weather. It did not leave my face greasy, and I did not feel the need to use any other product with the cream. I felt the cream alone was enough because it was so rich and my face felt so smooth. It smells great and also works great on cuticles and dry hands. I am very satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in my fifties and also in an area that is very dry. Well I believe that we are beautiful at any age, it's always nice to have smooth and supple skin. I used this day cream in combination with the complementary night cream. After 3 weeks, I noticed that my skin is smoother, especially on my forehead. It didn't make a dramatic difference on the 'marionette' lines, but my face is softer, even if I skip a day. It doesn't feel too heavy, and the SPF protection is critical in a day cream.

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream with the spf 15 in it is great! i like that it doesn't leave my face all greasy and oily feeling, and i love that sunscreen is in it since I'm big on applying it everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 performed as promised. I've seen a marked improvement in age spots, skin tone and fine wrinkles with regular use. The product isn't heavy or greasy, has a lovely fragrance and.leaves skin silky soft. Kudos L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I like the Day Cream much better than the Night Cream. It felt less oily than the night cream, left my skin feeling tighter. Since I have used both creams for the last almost three weeks, I have noticed that my skin is softer and seems to look better somehow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would like to start off by saying this cream is nice and thick. I love the cream protects my face from the sun. The bottle is a nice size should last over s month, which is great. The big down side is the awful prefume smell yuck. This cream didn't keep my skin hydrated at all. That being said I will keep trying both creams and see what happen but I probably would not recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the product so far. I haven't seen a noticeable difference yet though. I have very sensitive skin on my face and I was pleased that this didn't aggravate it. It did provide great moisture and it seems as if that helped my dry skin on my face. It was not to heavy but you can tell it' s there . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
For a drug store moisturizer it was decent. The fragrance was quite over powering! When I put on a moisturizer for mature skin I don't want to feel like my grandma and that's what the smell did for me. It was creamy and light enough to wear under my foundation but I didn't see any less age spots or discoloration. I would not repurchase this item purely due to the strong fragrance [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product that heals the skin and keeps it looking fresh day after day. It works great as a base before applying making doesn't feel to thick or greasy very light weight and makes my makeup look much smoother on my face. Definitely recommend and will purchase again.

"I typically use a daily moisturizer by Clinique that I enjoy using on a daily basis, but I figured I would give the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream a chance and I was truly surprised. I really liked how soft and hydrated it made my skin feel, but I did feel that it may my face look more greasy by the end of the day compared to my usual day cream. I seem to have oily skin so I did not like that it seemed to get more oily/greasy as the day went on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the day cream. I have oily skin and most moisturizers make it worst, I'm consistently blotting my face all day. The L'Oreal Paris did not leave my face oily my; face felt fresh and smooth all day, without all the blotting and touching up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is the best age perfect facial day cream, SPF 15 works greatly to help prevent sun burn and moisturizer my face , My face looks so smooth & clear now after using this product for weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream SPF 15 for a few weeks now. I have a large, obvious dark age spot right above my upper lip that I have tried many different products on and this is the first one that seems to be lightening that spot. This cream has a pleasant, clean odor and a little bit goes a long way but I find it to be a bit greasy. Overall, I will continue to use this products as it does seem to be reducing dark age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the day cream is a little heavy at first application. Over time it gets better as I get use to the feel of it. It makes my face feel very soft and my skin looks nice. The night time cream is pretty good too. Again a bit heavy in the beginning but you get use to the feeling and my skin looks very nice and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for 2.5 weeks. I have combination skin with dry cheeks and an acne-prone t-zone. This product has not affected my acne at all. My cheeks feel amazingly soft. I like that it has SPF 15 because I frequently forget to apply SPF. It's in a very large container that seems like it would last 2 or more months. I was worried it would be too heavy for my skin, but it blends in very well and is very comfortable to wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris Age Day Cream smells great and adds moisture to my dry aging face. After using it for several weeks my face doesn't seem so dry and wrinkly. I will definitely continue to use this along with the night cream. I also like the fact that it has sunscreen in the cream as well to protect my face from sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used so many different day creams, moisturizers, etc etc. However, I have never been able to find one that doesn't make my skin extra oily! Until now. I really enjoyed this product. It has a perfect balance of moisturizing and not leaving my face feel greasy! This has definitely become my new hot item!! Thank you L'Oreal!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product for the first time. I loved how it made my skin feel after washing my face. My skin soaked up the creamy lotion and did not leave the greasy feeling that a lot of moisturizers do. I loved this product and will definitely purchase, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical about the claims that L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Day Cream made. My face always feels somewhat rough. I felt a difference after the first time I applied it. I am not kidding when I say that my face feels as smooth as a baby's bottom. I love getting compliments on how radiant and youthful my skin looks. Thank you, L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is wonderful! It glides on my skin and absorbs quickly in the morning. My make up goes on easier and my skin is dewy and soft all day. I am noticing my saggy skin looks tighter and feels so soft. I recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the nongreasy nature of this face cream. Combined with the night cream I can tell a difference in the smoothness and texture of my skin. I also like the fact that this product contains spf so no need to use another product on top of it. Will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is amazing I see a great improved and fresh younger looking skin and face .I love the smell also very happy with my L'Oréal Paris age perfect facial day cream thank you so much got to have more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I would honestly buy this product and use it on a daily basis. It has a light, refreshing smell and it is not ""perfumey."" I have a sensitive nose and I'm allergic to strong smells. The smell of this product does not bother me and I actually find it pleasant. The day cream contains SPF so I don't have to apply a separate sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product was just ok for me. I didn't notice a huge improvement in fine lines but my skin felt great after a couple of days. It hydrates really well without adding oil to my oily areas. I will keep using to see if I notice the difference in the fine lines. I have sensitive skin and it didn't cause any breakouts which was a big plus for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is perfect for your skin. It didn't feel like my face was oily or that there was anything on it. I have sensitive skin and break out easily and I was unexpectedly surprised. Love that it's easy to put on with nothing to worry about. Leaves skin soft and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 is great ! I think this product really starts to show its potential the longer you use it. What I really liked was that it didn't feel like it was sitting on top of my skin. It soaked in very nicely. Sunscreen is always a plus ! I can't wait to see the results the longer I use this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this less than a week and I am already impressed. Living in Hawaii, sunscreen and moisture are important. After a morning shower my face feels very dry. I use this rich thick creamy lotion and my face feels nice and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the cream helps to moisturize and hopefully diminish fine lines/wrinkles. It is luxurious and has a great smell. With being in Minnesota, we have less daylight and some cloud days so I don't always feel like I need SPF on, but this product has me covered. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Despite the fact it is meant for mature skin, I decided to give it a try. I was mostly worried about breakouts since this formula is really thick and I have sensitive skin. Luckily, no breakouts yet. Also, I don't have severe issues that need correcting but it seems like a good formula to help with them. I haven't notice any changes to my problem areas(dark spots) yet but they always say it takes 30 days to see a difference with skin care. So we shall see.

"This cream is the day cream that I received for free from bzzagent. The cream goes on smooth and does not leave an oily feeling and I have oily skin. It lasted with no oil until after lunch and then my face was shiny. The problem that I had with it was the fragrance, it bothered me and gave me a runny nose and burned my eyes. I am very sensitive to fragrance and I was hopeful this would be fragrance free but it is not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this day cream. It's light and not greasy. It blends in well. I use it before i apply my makeup and I've notice how smooth my foundation goes on. The area around my eyes is smoother and brighter. My overall appearance is impressive. Tighter and firmer skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is an amazing product I think it made my face smooth and felt amazing. I have tried this product for two weeks now and my face and neck looked and felt like like it did when I was twenty. I wish I had known about this product earlier I would have been using it every day. Now that I know how this makes me feel and confident this had made me feel. I'm telling all my friends about this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that this day cream is excellent! It went on smooth and didn't make me feel like I had a bunch of goop on my face. It made my skin feel moisturized and fresh. I have used it every morning and I love the way it makes me feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I must say that i would need to have more time of usage to give a review with all the effects but i just got the creams three days ago. What i can say is that it leaves your skin very soft and one thing i did like is that it doesn't leave your face greasy nor shiny. I would like to have more time to see if there is any changes in my lines expression so definitely i would come back and give you an update. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product does a good job of making my skin soft. The cream is very light and does well under my make up. I haven't had the product long enough to tell if it is helping with fine lines. I also like that the fragrance is light and not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream does a great job of moisturizing without feeling greasy. I sometimes have issues with redness from creams that contain SPF, but that has not been the case with this one. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks, but I am already a fan. I have noticed that my skin feels very moisturizized with decreased redness. I will definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was good! I really like that it has SPF in it. The smell was kind of strong, but faded. It went on smooth and dried quickly. I also liked that you didn't have to use a lot to get full coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the night cream and loved it but when I put the day cream on it irritated my face and my face felt a little sore and it was red. The reaction went away after about a half hour but I haven't tried it again to see if I have that reaction again so I'm not too sure about the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always on the lookout for products that will work well under my makeup. Unfortunately this just didn't work well with my foundation. It felt like it was too heavy and their was too much slip with my foundation. (I use Jane Iredale and Este Lauder). I wouldn't say that this is a bad product, it just didn't work well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this daytime moisturizer. It has a soft, creamy texture and a light scent. It has left my very dry, sensitive skin feeling fantastically hydrated. I have definitely noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my mouth and eye area. I attribute this mostly to the increased moisturization. The SPF 15 is a very welcome added bonus. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream melts right into your skin. The fragrance is not bad or too strong. Did not interfere with my makeup application. I am still using this cream and plan on doing so until I run out, but will not repurchase because I am too bougie for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream makes my skin feel. It's so fresh and moisturizing. I love the fact that it also includes SPF15 for sun protection. I haven't used it long enough to see lines and wrinkles disappear yet but I'm hopeful and excited. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Facial day cream is amazing. I love that it has SPF . I use it every morning the apply my makeup. My skin feels soft and hydrated. It has also helped even out my skin tone and gives me a nice glow. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way this cream moisturizes my face and neck, but the best part is the way it seems to smooth fine lines and wrinkles just after a couple of weeks! I always use fragrance free facial creams but this fragrance actually doesn't overwhelm me and fades fairly fast and is even pleasant...I truly like how it makes my skin look and feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must confess that I not only used this as a facial cream, but I used a bit on my forearms where I have some aging discoloration. It made a distinct improvement in the coloration in that area. I know it's not the intended use but what a plus! For the face it is the perfect pair for the night cream. Very light and easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It seemed to be a bit heavy so cut back how much I was using. It gave my skin a glow and it did looked better. I am not sure if it reduced any lines and wrinkles yet. I know it won't happen overnight but i have high hopes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The facial day cream was amazing. I felt confidant that my skin was protected with ths spf 15 that is in the product. After applying a small amount on my face, I was left with soft supple skin. The creamy mixture didn't leave any greasy residue and blended into my skin easily. I was very happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"FINALLY a day cream that keeps my skin well moisturized and contains spf! for so long it seemed like i could have one or the other, and L'oreal nailed this one. LOVE love LOVE it helps balance my skin tone and its amazing at achieving great looking skin for those of us who dont get the full 8 hrs of sleep [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. It lightened my dark spot and brightened up my skin. Even some of my wrinkles have become smaller, not so deep. I suffer from severe dry skin and it has helped with that somewhat. I do recommend this product. I would recommend using the daytime with the nighttime cream. Also the daytime cream is light, not sticky. The nighttime cream is slightly heavier but very soothing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very happy with this product. Light scent and SPF15 too! I started using it right away and within a couple of days I noticed my fine lines seemed diminished in appearance. I don't have 'deep' lines, wrinkles or creases so it worked pretty rapidly by my standards. . I'm that person that if I don't see results, I'm on to the next product. I'll be staying with this Day Cream as well as the Night Cream. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product! Started to use it when I noticed the normal wrinkles on my forehead starting to become more noticeable and deep. After one week of use, I noticed more hydrated and smooth skin. The wrinkles are not as deep and overall healthy skin glow all around! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been needing a day cream to moisturise and provide spf for my face. This has done wonders for my skin on my face. I usually have a patch of dry skin under my eye but it has gone away after using this product along with the night cream. Was worried about breakouts or a perfume but did not experience either. Wonderful!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was thrilled to try these products. I Love each of them equally. My face feels so smooth and not dry. Only been using them for a week now. I'm extremely pleased with the performance of both these products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My face is super sensitive so I was anxious to try it out, but willing to take the challenge. Softer, smoother skin within the first week of using the day and night Cream, and no real problems, except some dry skin on my chin, but after reapplication, all was good to go!

"I've tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 for over a week now. I feel like it's a good moisturizer and that it is good at making my skin feel less dry, more healthy and overall better. But it is more heavy than I would prefer for a day cream and I definitely think the scent could be toned down a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could not tell any difference on my face when using the day cream. Can't really say anything negative about the product itself like smell, or texture of cream, it just did not seem to make my skin softer and I guess that was what I was expecting. I also thought if I used the night cream which worked really good, then day cream I would see better results. I did not see any added benefit with the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't think I've been using this product for long enough to speak to how it works on age spots. I can however attest to how well it moisturizes my face, revitalized my complection and seemed to tighten my skin (though I don't have wrinkles). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was just okay for it moisturized my skin, it wasn't greasy, my skin felt really soft and it last all day. The only con for me would be the smell, it's just a little over bearing, I would prefer L'Oréal consider a fragrance free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really liked this day cream. I am not one who uses one on a regular basis because I have never liked how other brands made me feel greasy. The jar is very heavy, I have almost dropped it a few times! I definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use cream all the time, this cream was just ok, nothing special. It wasn't bad it kept my skin moisturized and Did cause any adverse reactions. So as far as the hydration it was good . Now for wrinkles it did not do a whole lot . I don't have alot of wrinkles but I have a few. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Leaves my skin feeling brighter and silky smooth. I normally don't like day creams because I think they feel thick or pasty. This cream was the perfect thickness, applies evenly, and doesn't become greasy throughout the day. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a light but effective day cream.

I think Loreal has found the secret to restoring youthful skin! I am so impressed with the Loreal Age Perfect day cream. It is not greasy...perfect under makeup. I saw immediate results in my fine lines and wrinkles...not weeks...days! My skin feels soft and looks brighter. I can't imagine using any other product again! Oh and the scent...it smells so good..you have to try this..you will love the results! And don't forget the Night Cream! Amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive, dry skin and I have to say this product is completely amazing. I have been using it a few weeks now and my completion is pretty much flawless. This product has also reduced the lines and wrinkles on my face as well. I would highly recommend this product to my family, friends or anyone else looking for a day cream.

"I love the smell and feel of this on my skin, but after using it for two days, I broke out worse than a teenager. My face, neck, and chest were covered in pimples. I have not used it since and my face is finally clearing up after a couple weeks going back to my regular skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it is a perfect day for a perfect face and L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Creme does just that. I noticed such a huge improvement in diminished wrinkles and imperfections on my skin that I was pleasantly surprised!! Those were exactly the results I was looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found L'Oreal Age Perfect to be an above average drug store moisturizer. It was thick without being heavy and had a light pleasant scent. I do find the container to be quite heavy and the amount of product it holds to be smaller than expected. Overall, I would purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream works great for me to apply before my makeup. When I do not apply a moisturizer before my foundation, the finish looks streaky. It's hard to find a moistureizer that isn't too thick, but still works well with dry skin. This is just light enough to be a good day cream, but moisturises nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"GREAT product! I really wasn't expecting to notice results which is why I waited to give my review. I expected it to take a long time but boy was I wrong! My skin is smoother, has a youthful glow and looks overall healthier. WHY did I not know about this product before now?? I'm in love with it. LOreal has gained a customer!

L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 is a high quality product. It is super-hydrating. My skin felt so soft and plumped 24 hours later. The plumping effect is great and really diminishes wrinkles. Feels luxurious! It's a plus that it has SPF 15. It's great to know my skin is protected from UV rays and worsening wrinkles with one product. It also has a light fresh scent that I love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a really nice cream. Not overly fragranced and it was thick enough to combat drying from aging and weather. I was also pleasantly surprised that it made the skin on my neck look tighter and smoother. It absorbed well and didn't cause any breakouts (which are still an issue even in my 40's!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried L'Oreal's Age Perfect Moisturizer. I have combination skin, and I'm usually left with oily skin by midday with other moisturizers. This went in so smoothly, and really soaked into my skin. No greasiness! By the enf of the day, my skin still felt great. I am in my mid thirties, and this is a great Moisturizer for my skin.

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream is exactly what I have been looking for. I often get dry skin on my face, this time of year but I don't like greasy, shiny moisturizers. This left my skin looking hydrated and healthy. I have no peeling or flaking skin and it doesn't leave a shine. I also like the SPF and the fact that it is absorbed easily. I will purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For me, this just wasn't the perfect cream. The texture is luxurious, the scent is minimal. It soaks in well and initially leaves no greasy feeling. However, as an oily skin girl, I found.that this was just too much for me. Within an hour or so my skin felt like it was dripping and my makeup was sliding off my face. I'd recommend this product for someone with a dry complexion, it just wasn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Originally I was hesitant about using this product as I rather like my current day cream. However, as soon as I felt the creamy silkiness on my hands I was sold. I cannot tell if the anti-aging element works or not but I can tell you my skin has never felt smoother or less bumpy. Depending on the price of this I will more than likely be switching. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it is a good product but it seemed to sting my lips and other sensitive areas of my face. I am continuing you to use and I am noticing that my skin is softer and not as dry as it once was. I have the night cream as well but tend to forget to put it on most nights and need to get into a better cleansing ritual at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely love it! This cream makes your skin so soft, and not greasy! It smooths out rough spots while reducing my little crows feet. It evened the tone of my skin and reduces some of the red on my cheeks! I would recommend this product to anyone that is feeling like there skin just isn't what it used to be!

"Day creams generally fall into two groups, those that provide enough moisture and a good base for makeup and those that make my face too oily to make it through the day. This Day cream falls into the first camp. I prefer it to my previous brands because it makes my face feel smooth and fresh. This is especially true when used in combination with the night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say I am very impressed with this day cream - it's so good my daughter is using it too! It settles into my face quickly (getting rid of fine lines) and is non-greasy even at the end of the day...that sealed the deal for me. I can't say enough about how pleased I am and the bonus is that it is working on my melasma spots. At 53, I need a multi-tasker that is up to the challenge and L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream is it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Age Perfect Day Cream for two weeks. I think it is helping with an age spot I got from pregnancy. The spot is starting to lighten up and my skin feels soft and hydrated when I use the product. It does not feel greasy at all and I can use it as a moisturizer underneath my makeup. The best part is it has SPF 15 sunscreen in it. I use the day cream daily along with the Age Perfect Night Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product that does appear to have tightened up the lines and wrinkles on my face. The only complaint I have is that it is very strong smelling. It has an almost floral type smell. So much so that it annoyed me. If it was not for the overpowering scent, I would definitely use again. Would definitely not recommend for sensitive users. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is a little sensitive and dry, so I'm always trying to find a good moisturizer. They're either too light or too heavy, they don't sink in or they're too greasy. I've been using L'Oreal Age Perfect for a few weeks and I really don't have anything negative to say about it. It smells great, it absorbs quickly and it has a SPF of 15. What's not to like? Now if it lessens wrinkles and firms my skin, it will live up to its name ""Age Perfect"". So far its a really nice day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using L'Oréal Age Perfect Cream for about two weeks and can't find anything to complain about. Combined with the night cream, my skin feels refreshed and smooth. Before, I could feel the tightness when I smiled, now a grin comes easy. The cream goes on so lightly, I've hardly made a dent in the jar. So I'll be using this for a long time. My daughter examined the jar and approved of the SPF sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this every morning, it isn't greasy it goes on nice and smooth only need a little bit so it will last a long time. My skin feels firmer and looks healthy. I love how my skin looks now. Thank you for the opportunity to buzz about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i know it does what it says its suppose to ive been usingn it day and night and for 2 weeks already i can see the wrinkles disappearing . i love the smell of the day cream but not the night cream. I've been getting complements from people saying i look 27 when im 35 years old mother of 5 beautiful children. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this day cream. It smells sooooo good and it's not heavy at all. I usually don't like day creams because I worry that they will feel heavy or make my skin oily. I don't feel any of these things with this product. It makes my skin feel so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed how smooth and soft the product made my face feel. When I first started to use the day cream my face looked shiny which I didn't care for, but once it absorbed into my skin the shine went away. I do not see any visible difference in my skin since I've been using this product, but 2 weeks May be too soon to tell . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this Loreal Paris Age Perfect day cream for about a week now and while I haven't really noticed any difference in how old I look, my skin does feel amazingly soft. I've also noticed that my foundation goes on much easier since I started using it. My skin is smoother feeling and it goes on more evenly and doesn't seem to cake up in spots like it normally did.

"I really liked this product. I have really dry skin, especially after showering and using daily fave wash. I found that L'Oréal day cream really hydrates my skin and makes it smoother. I would recommend this item to a friend or person who is looking for a good facial hydrate product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"On the good side the SPF in this product is awesome! I don't have to worry about doing that extra step in the morning. On the bad side, the product felt greasy and heavy to me. I cannot see myself wearing any make up over top of it. I do use it on days where I am not up to doing a make up routine. It hydrates nicely and I have noticed some of my finer lines fading.

"I found this product to be too oily for my face for daytime use. Perhaps it is the hot, summer like weather in Southern California, but I actually broke out after using this product only one time. I while I love the SPF in the day cream, I will have to pass this along to someone with much drier skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product smells wonderful.I typically have normal skin with some oily areas this product evened those out so its super soft all over.My wrinkles are few yet deep after using this product for a week I've noticed a vast improvement. Loreal is an excellent product I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried many very expensive brands and no one works as this great L'oreal cream, it goes on easy, and you only need a really small amount. It has a very nice subtle fragrance, not oily, and leaves my skin nice and soft. It's a great non-greasy way of getting some sun screen, and a moisturizer in one application [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 (2.5 oz) is moisturizing with a very light scent. Its dertmatologist tested, non-comedogenic and it honestly isn't greasy at all. The moisturizering ingredient last all day. I think I've found something that works as well as cocoa butter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product made my skin feel softer and more hydrated after the first use. I used it then applied makeup I haven't felt my skin feeling this soft and silky in years. I will be using this product daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed using the day cream. I liked that it has SPF in it and I know my face is protected from the sun. My face felt more soft and it really moisturized my skin. My friends felt I had a glow to my skin which made me feel good to hear. I would recommend this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love love love how soft my skin is with this day cream. When you first put it on it feels a little thick and greasy but it absorbs pretty quickly and you're left with nothing but super soft skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The key to helping reduce wrinkles is to stay moisturized and this product definitely delivers. It is a think non-greasy formula that soaks in completely while providing SPF 15 and can be worn underneath makeup. A little goes a long way with this cream. This comes in a nice glass pot that is easy to store. It does have a strong fragrance so if your face is sensitive or the least bit oily this may be too heavy for your face.

I really liked this Age Perfect Day Cream by L'Oreal. It has SPF 15 so that is a plus. It had a nice scent and went on smoothly and really soaked into my skin and made it feel softer. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The day cream added extra protection against the sun and continued the work of the night cream with firming and tightening my skin. I wasn't heavily scented so it blended in. There was no greasy feeling after i applied it. It was very easy to apply and remove. I would recommend this product and the night cream that goes with it. I have found that using both of them products back to back will give you the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Having SPF 15 in my day cream is a real plus for me. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect day cream has a light fragrance and, although the cream is really rich, it blends into my skin quickly. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft and I have noticed the lines are softening, especially on my forehead and around my mouth. I am definitely going to continue using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was scared when I started using this because I have extremely oily skin, and this stuff is pretty thick. To my surprise, my skin doesn't look oiler at all. I haven't noticed any anti-aging, but it is very moisturizing and I love the smell. SPF is always a plus too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day cream was wonderful. I loved the fact that it was not greasy or left a heavy residue on my face. It left my face soft and hydrated throughout the day. I noticed my skin become brighter and also a little less sagging in my cheeks. I love this cream and will continue to keep it in my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do like this product but no noticeable difference in the 2 weeks I have used this. I will continue to use this as it is not greasy. As a day cream, I do wish it had a satin glow or tint to it as I don't use face makeup and that would make it even better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial cream system really does make my skin feel so much softer and smoother. A little bit goes a long way, too. While it works so well, I am only giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the fragrance is light (almost a softer version of the conditioner that comes with their hair dye) however, after wearing the night cream for a few hours, the scent would start to bother me. I think for night time creams, I would prefer un-scented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm loving this face cream! I have been using this day cream for the past two weeks and I've noticed a softness to my skin! I also love love love the fact that I don't have to use an additional sunscreen in top of a moisturizer since it has spf 15. Easy breezy and love how it makes my skin feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oréal Cream has a great texture and Smell is light and easy which I like , cream is really good it's not too oily and it's light on the skin and very most arising also like the fact that it has SPF 15 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this for about a week so far. At first it seems nice and makes my skin more moisturized, but after awhile it makes my skin feel oily. I am also prone to rosecea with breakouts and it was a bit irritating on my skin. I also didnt like the smell that much and would prefer unscented, but that it because my skin is so sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this cream for my honest feedback. First, this cream has a very pleasant scent, but it's not strong and overpowering. The moment I put it on, I noticed that it wasn't greasy feeling, it absorbed rather quickly. I also like the fact that it has a spf. I am an avid user of facial moisturizer and this one really is top of the list that I will by again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The jars are a little cumbersome to use and get all of the product out, I would prefer a squeeze style bottle. With that said, I did have softer skin. Can't say there was a noticeable difference in the way my skin looked but it was softer than before and felt more moisturized. The smell was pleasing and not to over bearing. Overall a good product.

Hi there ladies...well i have been useing the age perfect day and night cream for 15 days i can say i have not seen any improvement in lines and wrinkles.I can say it is a wonderful moisturizer.I prefer the day cream myself it has a very nice fragrance and not heavy at all.I found the night cream to have a medicine smell and really uncomfortable if you get near your eyes . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a nice and light facial moisturizer. Many others have felt oily, left my face feeling sticky or smell different. I have used this for over a week now and I notice my skin is softer and has a healthy glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the product now for approx. 2 weeks and so many people have asked me if i was doing exercise for my face.. I was why would you say that and they said your face looks younger and softer whats the big secret i told them about the product L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15.They were as surprised as I was that finally something that actually works and stated they were going to purchase it asap..I will post pictures soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have naturally very oily skin, so I often don't think to use a moisturiser. I tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream and was pleasantly surprised at how it made my skin feel soft & dewy, but not oily or greasy. I love that it has SPF 15 in it as I often don't wear any make-up (e.g. no foundation with SPF). It made my skin feel very nice, I haven't noticed any break outs or clogged pores. Light moisture & it smelly light & lovely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This day cream is non-greasy, light weight, and has a light pleasant smell. It glides on really well. Love the fact that there is SPF already in the cream. I have noticed a firmer texture and more of a youthful appearance in my face since using this cream. End result I will keep using this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product because it makes my face feel so moisturized and my makeup goes on smoothly over it. I have seen my jawline get firmer...after only using this product for 2 weeks! It is especially great because now I have the SPF 15 on my face without using a separate product. In the summer, I am very diligent about sunscreen but usually I did not continue that in the fall/winter. Now I feel good that I am getting the sunscreen year round. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF15! I have very dry skin, this day cream is the cats meowwwwww :) I've notice all flakiness is completely gone. Im not one to concentrate on SPF so that part wasnt a bonus for me. Im beyond thankful to have had L'Oreal allow me to try a full size sample of there Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the perfect day cream for my face. I love the feel of it and it has a nice smell to it. Wearing this I do not have to wear so much make up to protect my face. Even in the Winter its great to wear. Love it will be buying more of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Finally a day cream with SPF that doesnt smell like sunscreen!!!!!!!! Living in the desert can be very hard on your skin and when its always sunny out you need that SPF!!! This jar is also 2.5oz which is alot of face cream for the price! After applying my skin felt soft and not sticky. The scent is light and my wrinkles are fading! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have pale skin and freckles, so I always pick a day cream with SPF. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF is the ideal solution. It moisturizes and fights wrinkles while preventing them from forming with SPF protection. A little cream goes a long way, so I'm excited to have the full sized bottle. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF is the multitasking face magic product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although this product made my facial skin softer and moisturized well, the fragrance was too strong. I have a fragrance allergy and each day I wore this product my nose ran from the fragrance and it also irritated my eyes. This product would not be good for people with fragrance allergy. I will have to not use the rest of the product because of having allergies to the fragrance. I did not notice any other benefits other than making my skin softer and moisturizing well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love both of these creams. I could tell my skin was smoother and brighter after the first use. This is definately something I'll keep on hand. I also liked how how it didnt have a greasy, oily feel after applying and its not overpowering in scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found both the day and night cream very luxurious feeling on my face and did not leave it feeling greasy or a heavy feeling like some others I've tried. I have noticed the lines around my eyes are not as noticeable nor are the furrows in my forehead. I would highly recommend this to product to anyone who wants to see an improvement to there facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion really lives up to its promises. My hubby 60+ used for 2 weeks. His crows feet 45% reduced. I 45+ used for 3 weeks my fine lines gone. And as a bonus my skin discolorations are faded at least 30% Thank You Loreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for 2 weeks so far and I can already see a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. It is alittle thick going on, but I love that it has a SPF of 15. I will continue to use this product until it is gone, and will buy more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I fell in love with this day cream. I been looking for something that don't have my face feeling dry, I even put it on my neck sometimes. I love the fact it has the spf 15 sunscreen in it because I'm in the sun more than usually. My face starting to feel happy again because Age Perfect day cream helped me. You have to try it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never tried this product before. It smells really nice and goes on well. I feel like it's the perfect level of hydration. Some creams are too liquidy and my face feels dry an hour later. This one really stays with you and makes me feel moisturized all day without being too heavy. I have not noticed a skin firming effect yet but it's only been a couple weeks. My husband has been using it too and likes it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream with SPF 15 has truly made a difference in my appearance! Before trying this product, my face was a little dry, but not too much. After trying the L'Oreal, my mother has asked me if I have lost some weight and my sister said that I secretly had plastic surgery. My husband, well, he just says that my face is really soft. And since it has SPF 15, I get the added protection from the sun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to try this product. As soon as it arrived I tried it right away. It is awesome. It is so smooth and make my skin feel so soft and refreshed. And how can you go wrong with SPF 15 in it as well? Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This day cream is very moisturizing! Some would say a little too moisturizing! I have combination skin and it's a little too oily for me. I'm also prone to acne but didn't notice any more breakouts than usual. It has a nice scent that's not overpowering. Idid not notice any diminishing of fine lines or any anti-aging effects. I would recommend as a moisturizing sunscreen for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After Using:: L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Night Cream (2.5 oz) L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 (2.5 oz) I can say that the lines on my face are getting finer, My skin feels good. I did read info on these creams and they are sold in most pharmacies and stores. I am going to finish the treatment. Happy with results. Very good product:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I expected a bit more from this product knowing what wonderful results I had from the night cream. I had some problems applying my make-up after putting this on in the mornings but wanted to give this a fair shot at working for me, it is okay but not my choice for day cream. After being in Love with the night cream I figured day cream would be the best but I was so disappointed, loving many Loreal products I was surprised that this isn't on that list. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I still think that not enough time has passed using these products for me to be able to give an honest assessment as to how it works against aging, but I did discover one unrelated benefit of the product; it is a great, mild itch reliever. I have dry skin in some areas of my hands, and this product relieves the symptoms immediately. It also has a pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can actually tell a difference in the reduced amount of dark circles under my eyes within 2 days of use. I like the texture. A little bit goes a long ways. This bottle will last me forever. I have extremely oily skin so this product was a little too much for me. I put it on after I washed my face in the morning then I applied my makeup. My face looked like it was shining all day. But overall I feel this is a great product and it works. It just didn't mix well with my oily skin texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"On the plus side, it doesn't have a strong odor or leave behind a residue as some skin creams I've tried have. Goes on easy and smoothly. However, after using for two weeks my skin feels kind of funny and I'm breaking out all of a sudden. My skin doesn't feel dry or anything, just a bit odd. I think this isn't the product to use of you have combination skin, like I do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This came right in time for me as my old Neutrogena moisturizer just ran out! I always look for SPF in my moisturizer so I liked that it had SPF15 right away! It went on smoothly and was not greasy which is always my biggest fear because I have oily skin. If you have oily skin this will work well for you! Also there is no strong smell, just a slight clean scent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect day cream and started using it immediately. After a week I noticed results. My face was smoother and so soft. I love that it has an SPF 15 sunscreen. It has a light pleasant scent. This cream didn't clog my pores or break my face out. I am excited to see what happens with long term use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did notice a difference in the look and feel of my face. Every evening when I washed my face I couldn't help but notice how much younger my skin looked. I felt very pretty without any makeup on! Be careful around your eyes though, it will sting if it gets in them. Thank you L‘Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I broke out a little after using the cream for a few days and I think it is because I don't yet have dry skin. I am not 50 yet- what looks like the target age for this cream- so I think it was just too much moisture for me. The cream went on fine and felt fine but I don't think it is for me yet, it should work great for older consumers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Loreal day cream is great! it applies on your skin so smoothly and feels so good on your skin. Its not to thick or too runny, its just right. This product also doesnt make your skin feel oily. My skin felt smooth all day. This is a cream that I highly recommend. For each and every day that you use it, you will notice a difference on how your skin feels and looks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical about using a daytime cream. Most make my makeup look almost oranges in tone but this didn't. It went on non greasy which is a must. Overall I think this product could easily make its way into my cabinet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't usually use day cream because it turns your skin orange when you add foundation. That hasn't happened with this cream. Works great and doesn't feel greasy. My only complaint is that the day cream and the night cream both come in white containers. This makes it hard to tell them apart when I take my contacts out. I really have to look at the label. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great because it makes your face feel moisturized and refreshed without leaving a greasy feeling. It did not make my face break out which I have had problems with other creams. It was easy to apply and it left my face feeling nice and smelling great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream is a really good skin cream. Not greasy, leaves your skin feel smooth. I don't like that you need to reapply every two hours, but I imagine that's because of the SPF protection. I have sensitive skin and am always leary about trying new products, Loreal Age Perfect doesn't bother my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
WHEN I was 17 my mother told me to put moisturizer on my face everyday. Now being 57 I'm so grateful for that. I do not have wrinkles. I have some fine lines but only noticeable to me. With age it all begins to sag. I have been noticing this for a few years. Using Loreal Paris Age Perfect day and night cream I've notice my skin looks and feels firmer. It has a tighter look and feel. THIS is a wonderful product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Feels so good on my dry post-wash face - my skin literally drinks it in! Love the SPF factor. I've only been using it for about a week, so no big difference in skin tone etc., but definitely keeps my face soft and hydrated. A good basic everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a bit skeptical at first with the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream making my face extra oily. However after a couple days and a little less product (a little does go a long way!) my face feels great! My skin feels hydrated and I can actually see a difference and it's only been a little over a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried this product for 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. I see a change in the smoothness of my skin and its doesn't have the seasonal dryness anymore. The smell is soft and not overwhelming and the cream is smooth and nongreasey. I would highly recommend both the night and day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The look and feel of this product is delightful. As I opened the container, I was pleasantly surprised and the inviting smell of the facial cream. The texture is soft and smooth against my skin. My only complaint is that it does take a while to settle into the skin causing my foundation to clump as I applied it in the a.m. I had to rub it in with a towel the next couple days to allow it to dry faster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day cream and night cream every day for a lil over a week and I've noticed a change in my skin, it no longer looks or feels dry. My husband was unaware I was using this cream and he noticed the the difference in my skin, he said it looks smoother and it feels softer and even lighter. I wouldn't give it a 5 star if I didn't felt it worked on me but it has. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product smells wonderful. I typically have normal skin, oily areas and dry nostrils this product evened these issues my skin is super soft all over. My wrinkles are few yet deep (pronounced) after using for about a week I notice they are not as deep looking. I wish I did a before and now picture, but since this is all new to me (1st campaign) I didnt think to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the day cream very much. The fine lines around my eyes and wrinkles all appear to be getting smoother and softer looking . My neck also is looking smoother and less saggy, I will continue using this product and will recommend this to my sisters and many others, I would have preferred it to be fragrant free though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oréal age perfect day cream feels a little greasy in your fingers which isn't bad. The cream smells a little like perfume. It's not overwhelming. After putting it on I can feel my skin absorbing it well. Didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I felt like it does absorb good. Now remembering to apply it every two hours was hard to do when your in the sun. But it did help with with the firmness of my skin and I love the way it Feals on my skin and would recommend this worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't used this product that long, only about two weeks and I can say so far it works great to hydrate your skin. It makes it feel super soft and touchable. I didn't like the strong perfume smell of the product. Most people love it, I don't care for perfumes or the smells at all, so waiting for this product to dry to make the smell go away seemed like for ever.

"I have had a hard time trying to find a skin care line that works with my 30-something yr old skin. I REALLY wanted to love this cream, and I might in the winter when my skin tends to get a little dryer, but as of now, it did nothing but unfortunately cause me to break out. It has a wonderful smell and feels awesome on, and I loved that it contained an SPF, but alas the breakouts were a deal-breaker for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion works great and it has SPF in it so during the day when I am out in the sun I not have to worry about covering my face and it is not heavy at all.. definitely will be telling my friends about it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was pleasantly surprised that the scent of this product is very light. The product felt great on my face and I even started using it on my hands. I will say that I wasn't happy with all the ingredients of which I couldn't pronounce and the mineral oil. I'm more of a natural ingredient user but will try most Prost products at least once. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the way my face feels after using this a few weeks. It feels smoother and has more bounce to it now. The fragrance is pleasant and I had no adverse reactions to the product at all. It does leave a bit of an oily film, but it does well with makeup over it. I actually scooped some out and put it into a container for my mother and she LOVES it. She bought some after she tried it for 3 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been a loyal clinique user for years. I am a new believer in the L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Day Cream! It made my face so smooth and soft and I love that it has SPF. The cream has a very nice feel to it and goes on nicely, soaking in and isn't greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since i have received this product, i have been putting it on (daily) and i love the way it feels on the skin. it doesn't make my skin feel oily like some lotions. It does hold my foundation/make up very well as well. i have enjoyed the cream very much and i would recommend this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is an excellent moisturizer. I've only been using it for a few days and I already notice a difference in the softness of my skin. As we move into the winter months, I know that this is something that I can use to combat the dryness that comes with the cold. It's thick and rich so a little goes a long way.

"I know the product says for mature skin, I'm only 31, but don't let that put you off if you are around my age. I have been impressed by the softness and hydration of my skin since I started using the product. I have been using it as a moisturizer before applying my makeup. Even though the consistency looks thicker than my other moisturizer it doesn't feel tacky on my skin. The cream does have a scent, although subtle, it does linger.

I have this for couple of weeks and been using it and I love how my skin feels with this cream. I was just looking for something that leave my skin soft without feeling oily or greasy and L'Oreall Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream do just what I want and need. Even though is for women on their 50s and I'm still in the beginning of my 40s I try it and don't regret it. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used these two creams every day. The cream goes right on, not greasy, and has kept my skin so soft since. I used the day cream after my shower and put my makeup on and it went on beautifully. I will continue to use the L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Cream every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream, especially because it has SPF 15 protection in it. The cream is nice and thick and has a very powerful moisturizing affect. I have noticed a large difference in the appearance of my wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. My skin feels soft and nourished all day long. I would recommend this product.

I absolutely love this facial lotion. I have combination skin. Either its super dry and flakes and its acne. Since using this lotion within a week no more dry flaky skin and it didnt cause my face to break out!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is a great product. It was smooth and made my skin soft. I didnt notice improvement in my complexion but i have only used it for 1 week so far. I loke that it has spf included and one less product that need to worry about adding to my regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L' Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream is really good. I wish it's SPF was higher than 15 though. It's not greasy and smells great. It goes well with my make up and feels wonderful on my skin. You don't need much for your skin to feel nice and protected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the day cream a lot, it goes on smoothly and it doesn't fee too greasy. The scent is nice too and I'm very sensitive to smells. I haven't noticed any drastic improvements on my dark spots yet, but have only been using for a couple of weeks, but it does feel more tight and lifted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product is great, I have only been able to use it for a little over a week. I like the way it makes my skin feel. As far as a difference, I really can't tell at this point, I think to give a better review, I would at least need to use the product for a month. With what I can tell from the short time I have been able to use it, it works great for the moisturizing and hydrating of facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit skeptical at first to try out this cream because it is labeled as ""for mature skin"" but after using this everyday along with the night cream every night, I can see a huge difference. My skin feels perfectly hydrated (and I live in dry climate) and the dark spots are fading without any additional treatments. One thing I do not like is that you really need to work the cream in because it's thick (trust me a little goes a long way) but otherwise it's a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for a few weeks now. I have dry and sensitive skin. This cream is moisturizing and I love that it has an spf. I haven't noticed a difference in age spots yet but my skin overall feels nice and soft. I will continue to use and hopefully see a difference in age spots! The product comes packaged in a very nice container. Easy to use, looks fancy for a drugstore brand! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far after using this product for a week now I am already seeing and feeling results. First off the smell is so great, not to overpowering but has a sweet smell. The way it goes on my face is like butter. I have very oily skin so I'm very careful what I put on and this makes my skin so soft and glowing. My husband even mentioned how much awake my skin looks. He's even used it a few times haha. Love this product and when I use it all up I will continue to buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These 2 products are amazing! Day Cream is light, refreshing and smells wonderful - a light clean smell! It's great to wear under make up - doesn't make your face oily or greasy during the day. Less noticeable wrinkles and very hydrating! The night cream is light as well! I love night creams but most are thick and feel heavy on skin but not this cream! I love it! Softens, hydrates and plumps skin! Look and feel younger! My new essentials! LOVE THEM!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the fragrance as well as the feel of the creams. My skin felt really soft and many of the fine lines seemed to disappear . I would buy both these products in the future although, it will take me some time to use both jars. I truly love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the texture of this day cream. I normally don't like to wear a cream during the day because it makes my face appear oily. This face cream is great for day time use. I was shocked that my makeup stayed out and with zero shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After washinf my face and using astringent I applied the L'oreal Day cream each morning. I like the nice scent and texture. It glides over your skin and absorbs well without that heavy greasy feel. I have trouble with certain facial products breaking out my skin but NOT the L'oreal Day Cream. It's lessening lines and adding moisture that I really needed so I'm pleased with L'oreal Day Age Perfect Day Cream . I'm 55 and I'm pleased with the results.

I wanted to know if the product really work before i get the product and now that i has try it i know that it works. My skin was really dry and now is really better. I know that trying and knowing that it works i will definitely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product works really well. I didn't notice any considerable changes but I did like it for keeping my usually dry face moisturizer. I also love that it has spf because I'm really bad about protecting my skin. It has a great consistency where you can really work it in, not too thick and not a liquid. Seems as it might be a little too heavy for the summer time though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try a new moisturizer routine. As winter aprroaches, I need to moisturize my skin more. The packaging is nice and clearly marked day or night. I didn't love the fragrance of the products, but it's not unpleasant. Both the night and day time moisturizers have a thicker consistency but do not leave a greasy feeling on my face. I've only been using the products for about a week, and my skin feels softer. I'm overall pleased with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually don't use moisturizers but i love how my skin feels and smells after using it. Its not greasy or heavy on the skin. It has a pleasant light fragrance. Can't say that i noticed a difference with my fine lines but probably after months of use. My skin has a nice glow after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm in my mid 50s and have a difficult time obtaining a smooth palate for my makeup. This day cream provides just that. My skin feels and appears smoother. I love the way my makeup looks complete and not blotchy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how smooth it is and went on, and the smell was pleasant. I have used Lacome face cream and I think This is just as good. Cant wait to see after using it for a month to see how young I look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did like this cream but I have rosacea and it makes me skin be super sensitive to sun, so I need more than SPF15 in my day cream. However, if that werent the case, I would still purchase this one. It doesnt feel too greasy, and it works well under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far so good. I don't notice any change as far as firmness, brightness, etc. However, I've only had them about a week and a half. Love the feel of both. The nighttime is, of course, a little greasy but not bad. I've used worse! But I think that's expected for a night cream. I use both daily so I am really excited to see the results at the end of this trial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first impression when I opened the bottle was the pleasant smell which was not too overhelming. I wanted to try it for a while before I review it. Liked the feel and the ease it is absorbed on my face gave a fresh hydrated feeling . Loved the sun protection factor it had. My skin feels silky nd looks great. Definitely would buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The first night was great my skin was changed by morning After a few days using it my skin seemed just like before I think with these kind of products you need to use it daily for at least a month to have an effect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't wear moisturizer normally, so I was anxious to try this moisturizer. I really like it! It is smooth to apply, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling great. I am pleased that after two weeks it makes my minimal make up look smoother. The only negative is the glass jar makes it a bit cumbersome for my personal life, but the results are worth it. I would love it even more in a tube though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"the day cream feels a little heavy and has a slight smell to it, not unpleasant, but if fragrance is a issue for some people may not like it. absorbs into skin very well. leaves skin soft to the touch. would recommend product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. The lotion is thick enough to provide that great moisture we all want, but light when it goes on. The scent is very light and delicate. My skin stays moisturized all day and the SPF is a great addition. I like to mix in a little of my foundation with the lotion to make a tinted moisturizer and it blended in nicely with this formula. The hydrating power of this lotion really prevents wrinkles and makes me look like a teen again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the smell of L'Oreal Age Perfect! Feels light on the skin. The only down side is it leaves my skin a little oily. The upside, I can definitely tell its working, My face feels firmer. And love that it has sunscreen in it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal really has done a wonderful thing for skin with this product. It moisturizes wonderfully and I can see a difference in my skin since I've started using the product. It's more supple and my wrinkles are not as visible as they were before. I will definitely continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris Age perfect day cream has a nice light fragrance and not over powering. Kept my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized all day! I knew my face was being protected from the sun because of the SPF 15 sunscreen in the cream. I really enjoyed using this cream and will be my new daily moisture cream I use. Love the product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Kept my skin hydrated and protected all day! Light and moisturizing without adding extra unwanted shine. Will definitely be my go to moisturizer. I do wish the scent was lighter but other than loved the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Again, I tried this product even thought it is meant for skin more mature than mine! It has a really nice scent, but goes on too thick for me. I found that when I used this in the morning and then put on make up, I felt as though I were wearing a thick mask. I think this product will be great when it gets cold and my skin gets dry. I will likely use it on days where I choose not to wear any make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"No really, all kidding aside, now that I have been using the Age Perfect day and night creams for several days I am definitely noticing a difference in the texture of my skin. It is so soft, and it's feeling more supple. You'd think at this age (48) there'd be less breakouts, but even that is improving. I Love.This.Stuff! It is now my go to facial moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love love this moisturizer. It feels so light on my face but my face feels as soft as baby skin. Plus it has added spf so if I forget it's already in my face cream. You will NOT regret this purchase at all and your face will thank you by looking young and feeling soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product may be designed for women in their 50s; but, it worked beautifully on my 34 year old skin. It helped even out my oily t-zone, & gave me a great base for my makeup. My only complaint is the scent. Although it's very subtle, something in it drives my sinuses crazy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In only a few weeks of using this day cream, I can tell a dramatic difference in my skin. It is more hydrated and fine lines in my forehead seemed to have disappeared. My skin doesn't feel greasy after applying it. And it doesn't leave a shine on my face. It is perfect to wear under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like this product. I've looked at face creams in the past, but always change my mind because of the cost. However, after a few days of using this cream I noticed that my face started to break out. I have sensitive skin so I shouldn't have been surprised. Unfortunately I wasn't able to continue with the lotion because I couldn't deal with the acne it was causing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using L'Oréal Age Perfect Favual Day Cream for about a week or so and according to the package I should notice my skin feeling more hydrated. Well truth be told it's a nice cream,it smells nice and absorbs well but I can't say that it made my skin feel any more hydrated than another brand I use that's a little less expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is the facial cream that I have ever used. It makes my neck, face and supple, soft and glowing. If you are thinking about purchasing this product, I would give it five stars. The only hindrance is that it is a little costly for drug store products, but worth the success that experienced, I would pay the cost to achieve the look that I am seeking. Compared to the product I used prior to this , it is the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As someone who is of ""advanced age"" and spends a LOT of time out in the Arizona sun, it is hugely important that my face cream has adequate sun protection. The cream itself goes on smoothly and feels great on my face. I have sensitive skin and no problems with it so far. Too soon to tell if it is making a huge difference but I am really liking it so far!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like these products a lot. I am a former smoker and avid sun worshiper. My face has a lot of damage, that and old age. I like the way these products work. I like the smell and it makes my skin feel terrific. I also noticed a difference in the texture of my skin on my face. Will continue to use both products. P.S. I don't know how to sent a photo. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just like the night cream, I like the way it goes on and absorbs. I like the way my skin looked later in the day. The smell wasn't bad, but I didn't like it as much as the night smell, and it gave me a little bit of a headahe after a while. Putting my makeup on over it did help. That won't stop me from using it though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way the product smells. It goes on a bit greasy but eventually blends in. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks but have already noticed a softness in my skin and a smoother complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I waited till last minute to review because I wanted to use it for awhile to see if I had any results. I had tried a couple other products before this one. I like the non greasy formula. I just tried skin cream by Avon and was greasy. I also used a day/night serum from Perfectly Posh and my face broke out! Neither was the case with this one. I haven't seen really noticeable results yet other than a great moisturizer but am going to continue to use and hopefully see some great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day cream. It seems really thick when you sink your fingers in, but after you get it on your face, it almost immediately soaks in. I find that my face doesn't end up with a greasy feeling. I like the fragrance of it, it's quite light, but smells nice, and clean. My face feels nice afterward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really surprised when I received this full-size product to try and write a review! First of all, the scent is nice. I don't know about you guys, but if it smells funny, I just can't use it. The cream is really nice and thick. I loved the way that it went on smoothly--like my skin just drank it up. It left no ""heavy"" feeling or shiny look. I liked the way I could actually tell that I had this cream on allllll day. It really made my skin look and feel wonderful. I'll actually buy this product from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Cream was moisturizing but not oily upon application. I felt like it definatley helped keep my skin hydrated and supple all day. One of my main concerns has been some discoloration in my skin that I have had since my last pregnancy I am not certain yet whether or not they have faded but will keep using this cream to see if it helps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day cream is pretty thick and greasy, to the point it doesn't feel comfortable with makeup. I loved the smell but it really seemed like an everyday, usual sunscreen, in a pretty bottle. Really, I prefer to just stick to a foundation with an spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As someone with very sensitive facial skin, I am always careful when trying new products to lookout for contact dermatitis flareups. Luckily I did not experience any issues with this product. The cream goes on smoothly and absorbs well. The SPF 15 is enough protection for daywear and it seemed to make my skin smoother and more supple. All in all a win. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris Day Cream is perfect as a moisturizer and makeup remover! The texture is non-greasy, non-odorous, and silky fine. I loved using this as to remove makeup because it moisturized my skin as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The day lotion went on smoothly and easily. The only thing I was not fond of was the scent. The scent was a little overwhelming and I prefer unscented facial lotion. The lotion itself was great at keeping my face moisturized through the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this cream for 8 full days before writing this review because I wanted to be sure it didn't break me out. I have sensitive skin and am very prone to breakouts when using a new product. Surprisingly, I did not experience any irritation. The cream goes on smooth, and soaks in well leaving a nice healthy glow to my skin and it has a pleasant scent. I have noticed that my fine lines are starting to diminish around my mouth and my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the thickness of the cream, like the night cream, a little goes a long way. I noticed that at night when I took off my makeup my face felt still moist. It is a great value since a little is all you need and it gets the job done. My face looks better after using it for only a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal's Age Perfect day cream is an excellent cream, in that it is very moisturizing and very hydrating but not too heavy. It is great to wear on its own or to be used as a primer user makeup. I really have enjoyed the effects it has had on my skin. My skin tends to be on the dry side and this was a wonderful moisturizer that really added softness and supleness to my skin. The smell is also very pleasant without being overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product along with the night Cream. It has a good scent, not overbearing and it is not greasy. I used it for about 10 days. In the first 3 days I noticed an overall better appearance of my skin. I struggle with large pores and they were decreased dramatically. The crows feet lessened after about a week. These are great products and I mist certainly will be buying more. My skin is sensitive and it was fine with this. You gotta try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i have been using this daytime moisturizer for about two weeks. it is very nice smelling and feels very luxurious on my skin. i especially like that it has sun block in it to protect my fair skin from the sun. my face never looks dry during the day. i have applied makeup occasionally over the cream and i've also used it without makeup. in both cases my skin stayed hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So usually, I have dry patches on my face. I have been using this product daily for almost two weeks and have seen a noticeable difference in the tone and moisture in my skin. The only problem I have is remembering to use it. I am 35 and haven't thought about using anti-aging product, but since I have started using this, I realize that my skin could be better and I should be taking better care of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not only is the smell of this product great, but it does a great job of moisturizing my dry skin. It also performs great under my foundation, in fact I don't need to use a primer now! I have also noticed some of my age spots and acne scars starting to lighten. Overall, I highly recommend for the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try Age Perfect Facial Day Cream as it was packaged beautifully! What I look for in a day cream is protection against the elements -- sun, wind, etc. without losing moisture or Irritating my skin. As I am someone who has very sensitive skin and has had trouble with other brands, there were no issues at all with scent or harshness -- YAY!! That is a big deal for me. I also used the Age Perfect Facial Night Creme, which is very moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just got back from a vacation and had a pretty good sunburn on my face. the cream helped grandiosely. it feels good on the skin, not oily and didnt clog the pores. i would definitely purchase the creme in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product . It's fresh, not greasy. My skin feels and looks great. There is no heavy feel to this product just a soothing clean light feel. No strong fragrance, very fresh and moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I applied a nice thin layer of these cream about an hour before applying any makeup and it was like it was never there. It helped hydrate my skin, by the end of the day my skin wasn't all dried out like it normal is. I would recommend this product to anyone who tends to have super dry skin like me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have received the combo set of both day and night cream. The Day Cream: The Day Cream is wonderful. It did not have a greasy feeling and doesn't seem to clog my pores. I put it on first thing in the morning and apply my make up over the top. It gives my make up a soft dewy look and helps great a flawless look. Even on days I do not wear make up it keeps my skin hydrated and feeling silky smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been reluctant to try any kind of facial creams, even now as a ""mature"" woman, due to the fact that I'm still blessed (?) with slightly oily skin. But I'm finding that the Age Perfect cream doesn't add to the oiliness and leaves my skin nice and soft with no breakouts. I would definitely recommend it to others who might be a little bit hesitant to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Ferfect Facial Day Cream for about 2 weeks now and I love it! It doesn't feel greasy, I can apply make-up immediately after applying. I love the fact that is has SPF15, one less thing to worry about. My skin feels softer and I am seeing a reduction in fine lines! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Couldn't really tell you how well it did or didn't work because after 5 days I couldn't get any past the strong perfume smell. Just want a cream that works and doesn't smell like anything or very, very slight scent but something much more subtle [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received product 4 days ago so haven't been able to use ling enough yet to notice any difference. I am trouble with how it feels, doesn't seem to fully absorb leaving a greasy feeling on my face. I've been using less & less to see if it will absorb better, but so far no change. It feels similiar to sunscreen which may be why it doesn't fully absorb.

"I believe that I may not be of an age that this product is what I am looking for. I am 33 years old and the formula caused me to break out. If you are prone to breakouts, like me, this might not be the product for you. On the plus side it did smell really nice and felt very smooth going on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I appreciated that this product has SPF 15. I am terrible about remembering to wear sunscreen. I was not expecting this product to be labeled for mature skin, so I was concerned that the moisture level would be too much for my naturally oily skin. It did not feel greasy, and I would recommend this to anyone a little bit older who needs added moisturizer and SPF coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I have only used this product a couple week, I have noticed my fine lines have reduced and my skin feels a lot more moisturized ..It soaks into the skin and leaves it feeling soft. I would purchase this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is amazing. It makes my skin so soft, it puts moister back in my skin. It is making my skin look more even and it don't break my skin out. I will definitely be buying more of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried ALOT of moisturizer and this is by far the best one I have ever used especially for the price. Usually I have to use oil and a cream as my skin is really dry, but not this this, and I use it for day. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the day cream as my daily moisturiser. I love it for that use, it is not oil and rubs in smooth so that I can still apply my makeup. As for helping with Aging....I cannot say that I see a difference from when I started. The sunscreen is a huge positive though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 for approximately 2 weeks now and love it. It's rich, silky, and goes on smoothly. I will admit, it's a little thicker than my previous moisturizer, but it doesn't leave you feeling greasy. It also has a nice, yet subtle scent. About a week after using it, I started getting compliments about how great my skin looks & ""what great skin"" I have. I also feel like my skin has become more supple & fresh looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is great!! I could truly see and feel a difference in my skin after the first use. It was amazing. I haven't been using this cream long enough to see a lightening in my sun spots, but even so, I am very happy with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very emollient and does not leave the skin greasy. My skin soaks it up and leaves my face nice and soft. An added plus is the scent.... smells wonderful. I only gave it 4 stars because the ingredients are not natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream is so light and gentle. I used it as soon as I got out of the shower. It was very easy to apply. It absorbed in quickly and did not cause any issues when I put my foundation on. I also noticed that as the day went on, my skin didn't feel overly greasy. I was very soft and felt as though the overall texture and tone as more uniform. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial cream does not leave your face oily or sticky. It absorbs into your skin beautifully. I love the light floral scent. It smells so good, and doesn't linger all day. It's not over powering. I am a softball and football mom, so I appreciate the SPF 15 already in the face lotion so that I don't have to apply a greasy sunscreen. My skin has been so soft and I no longer have dry spots. I absolutely love this face lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After trying L'Oréal Age Perfect day cream I noticed the dark spots on my face lightened! The smell and texture are great and it also works as SPF! It did not leave my face oily at all which typically face creams will. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am pretty impressed with this product. I am an old school Mary Kay user. After a hot summer in Kansas I developed some weird skin dryness and imperfections. I have been shopping and trying samples of all different types of product. I was not expecting to get some great benefits from L'Oreal Paris! After using for 2 weeks my dryness and irritation was healed and my imperfections are hardly noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not too natural on the ingredients list, but the day cream has a nice feel and is easy on the skin. It kept my skin soft but not oily. I would have to use it longer to see if there are any long term benefits. So far no change in my skin tone or elasticity. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a hard time using creams on my face. They normally leave me feeling super oily, and I hate that. This one though, was just right. I could tell the difference in the moisture of my skin without it feeling weighed down. My face started to look less tired as the days went on, which having 4 kids is saying a lot. I'm a licensed cosmetologist, so I've tried more than a few face creams, and I can honestly say that I liked this one best of all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The day cream made my skin silky smooth and wet feeling. However it made my skin break out, and I used just a dab after about 3 days I developed a slight redness. The night cream made my skin feel tighter but after two weeks I don't see a visible difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream leaves your face feeling wet for quite a while. It gets sticky as it dries, but does go away after a while. It does make your skin feel softer though. It took a few days of use before I started to feel the smoothness. I don't think I cared for this product as much as their night cream which has a quicker response to results. May need to give it longer to see full results than what the box says [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Even though I am only in my early 40's, I thought I would try this product and see if it worked for me. I am using both the day and the night cream and I have noticed that my skin is feeling much softer and smoother and even my lines are less visible. My skin is typically a little oily and I have noticed that this actually helps even out and moisturize my skin. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have dry skin and am always skeptical of products claiming they hydrate. I tried this product and really like it. It is rich and creamy without being oily. The only thing I don't like about it is the rose like scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about 14 days now and even though I can't attest to the cream fixing sagging skin or lightening age spots, I will say that the cream does nice work on dry skin. I have soft, even skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'oréal Paris Day Cream is wonderful for my dry sensitive skin. Being a redhead, I need extra protection from the sun. My skin dries out during the Fall and Winter months so the moisturizer is great! I applied the cream as a base layer and then applied my makeup on top, which worked out well, as it seemed to make my makeup last longer (added bonus!) I will continue to use this product to keep my skin soft and protected. I recommend his product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was an OK Day Cream, the scent was a bit irritating to my rosacea-prone skin (and my nose). I did feel it was not as moisturizing as similar products and I like a lot more SPF during the day. DO TRY - The night cream version of this same product - it's simply divine and leaves my skin deliciously soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is already starting to work within just a week. I have noticed that my skin is smoother and brighter. I usually have dark circles under my eyes and they are starting to lighten up already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 is a wonderful product, I paired it with the night Cream on a daily regimen.

"I love the Age perfect facial day and night Cream. It leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. Both creams have a light scent that is great.

"Like that is not greasy or has an odor like so many creams.This does not break me out & goes on nice & smooth.Probably would not have tried this if not for Buzz so want to Thank them for opportunity. This would be a good product to try & see if works for U as has for me, will continue to use as is quite inexpensive compared to other's out there.

I've been using this cream every morning for about a week and a half or so. I have noticed that my face has been a little bit less greasy at the end of each day and the areas that I had that have been dry are much better. But I am also noticing that I am more broken out than usual. I will continue use of this product for a other week and see how much skin continues to feel.

I think that the L'Oréal day cream is a very good product.it gives the sun protection I need.if you are wanting to purchase this product I would definitely recommend it.you may also want to know that it is spf15 and therefore need to apply often.the product is wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this cream. I love that it has SPF 15. It's a light, yet easily absorbable day cream that fully hydrates dry skin. I'm in a very dry climate with high sun exposure so this is perfect. I need sun protection after having skin cancer in the past. Nice feel, easy to use and my skin feels great! I love the scent, not overpowering yet very subtle. I would recommend it for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using these. I thought they smelled great, didn't feel heavy on my skin, my skin felt soft, and after only a week I thought my skin definitely looked a little smoother. Something I would definitely buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the fact that there is an SPF in the day cream. It felt luxurious and creamy yet wasn't greasy. It absorbed well into my skin. The scent was light and ""clean"" smelling. Not too overpowering. I wore under my make up with no issues. It comes in a glass jar which I prefer over plastic. All in all I would purchase again. I did find that my skin felt well hydrated. I'm not so sure of the anti-aging effects yet but I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the way it goes on it's smooth and silky but not greasy. I have no redness or irritation on my sensitive skin from this cream. My skin feels softer. It would get five stars except I do not like the scent. It is not a heavy overpowering scent but it's not a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. I was a little hesitant to try at first because I have always been an olay type of girl, but when I opened the jar I could tell I was going to love this! The smell of the product is great, it's not greasy at all, and a little bit goes a long way. I have been using this product for one week and I can already tell that my face feels better! Someone even told me I was glowing yesterday! I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really like that this face cream has spf15 in it!! It's a little thick so I think it sometimes makes my face look oily but I've been using this for about a week now and I can tell a difference in my skin tone-my skin looks better hydrated and my freckles/sun spots appear less noticeable! Can't wait to see what my skin looks like in a month!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pretty impressed with this day cream. It seemed to absorb well into my skin and wasn't greasy. However, I have pretty sensitive skin, and I noticed that my face sometimes looked a little blotchy after applying the day cream. I'd still continue to use it as most skin care products seem to have this affect on me and this one did a pretty good job of moisturizing my skin most of the day.

"This product is a great addition to my face routine especially since it helps to soothe and clear my complexion. I have dark spots and this is definitely helping to reduce the pigmentation. If you're looking for a product to help with the signs of aging, this is it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream came just in time! My skin was dry and in need of extra hydration, and I needed to find something new. This cream has been great! Each time I use it, my face instantly feels hydrated and caressed by the smooth cream. The cream goes on easily, does not feel greasy or sticky and the scent is pleasantly light. Using this cream has left me with a confidence that I can easily leave my home without make-up! This one is a keeper!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never been good with sticking to my facial routine morning and night. However, with this I am happy to report I've been using it religiously. It doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. I enjoy the light scent. I love that the day cream has an spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok I've been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day and Night cream religiously for a week and after 2 days I noticed a BIG difference in my skin. I had dry patches on my lower cheek area that no matter what I did never seemed to go away..and after 2 days they are GONE!! My skin is so much softer and my make up application is now flawless... And the product smells so good!! This product is now part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Loreal Age Perfecg day cream is great. I have been using it since I got it and I love it. Its hard to find the right products to use on my face because my face tends to be sensitive. But these products work great. I've been using the day cream in combination with the night cream. Very pleased, will purchase once I run out, and will recommend to all my friends/family.

"I think L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream SPF 15 is a quality product however, I am someone who is apt to break out with a little too much oil or something clogging to my pores! I appreciate that I was able to try this cream and be able to give my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall I think this is a nice day cream. It is very moisturizing but does bit leave you feeling greasy. My only hangup is the scent. It is just too strong for me. I think facial cream should either be very lightly clean scented or unscented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream with SPF 15 is wonderful. I have being using it under my makeup and a world of difference. The makeup goes on smoother and stays all day. My skin is softer and looks better each day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This L'Oreal day cream is the best I have ever used. Very quickly I have noticed firmer, softer and fuller skin. When my husband noticed a change and commented on it, I knew it was the right cream for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the L'Oreal night cream. It is thick enough to feel luxurious without being heavy on the skin. The fragrance is pleasantly light and I'm seeing the effects after only one week of use. I have oily yet aging skin and my skin actually feels LESS oily in the morning. I haven't used it long enough to see the long-term anti-aging effects but I'm sold so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this day cream! It has a very pleasant scent, it's smooth and creamy, and doesn't make me feel gooped-up. I don't wear makeup, so I am not used to the feeling of stuff on my face, which is why I'm glad this day cream was so light that I didn't notice it. And it definitely improved my dry skin issues. I never got the chance to try out the SPF protection on this cream since it is now late fall, but I will definitely try it out next summer when I am out and about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this cream is the best after using just for a week I could really tell the difference fine lines started to disappear. I love that I can use the cream and it's not oily so there is no shine . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was creamy at first, but as I rubbed it in the texture got gritty. I didn't notice any change in my skin. The firmness didn't change either way. It will make a good sunscreen. The smell was also pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is wonderful. I used both cream...one in the morning and one at night. It made my skin feel so smooth and clean. I would have never thought that it would be this amazing. thank you so much for this opportunity. I can't stop telling all my friends how great this product is.

I tried the L'Oreal Age Perfection Night and Day cream for Mature Skin and I have to say not only does my skin feel hydrated but it is also tighter. I have never tried a night cream before and I love this cream. It makes my skin feel so much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Night Cream really moisturizes and improves my skin's elasticity. It has brightened my skin while reducing the appearance of fine lines. After using for a week, I have noticed that my skin is smoother and softer to the touch. I find myself stroking my cheek while at work feeling the softness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is nice and light. Not oily or greasy. I like the SPF so. I separate product is necessary. Good size container, should last a while. I've been using it every day for 2 weeks with no complaints, no negative reactions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using the products for a few days, but so far I am loving them. I like the light creamy texture of the day cream and how it absorbs into my skin. It has not been very sunny where I am this past week, but I am sure the spf 15 will be beneficial when the sun finally comes out! I also like that it has not made my naturally oily type skin, more oily. I will continue to review as time goes on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have noticed a change in the appearance of the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. I love that this cream keeps my face feeling moisturized all day long. My skin is usually pretty dry but it does not feel dry at the end of the day when using this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Honestly I was expecting far more from all the rave about this item. I stopped my normal routine and replaced it with the day & night cream. In order to get a true result I used it for 10 days. I didn't notice any reduction in lines sadly. I liked how lightweight it was, that was a nice bonus. I was not a fan of the perfume smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the day cream for the past 4 days and so far i like the way my skin feels. My old moisturizer didn't take as much time to set in as this does but my skin definitely feels smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Age perfect Facial Day cream makes my face feel nice and smooth. It absorbs quickly into the skin. I am over 70 years old and do not as yet see any improvement under my eyes or above mouth wrinkles. I have only been using the product for 2 weeks so maybe it is too soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"On first impression I loved that it had a very light scent. On application it was light weight and did not leave my face feeling smothered or greasy. I wear powder as my foundation and this did not ""gum it up"" or make the application streaky. My face felt hydrated all day without being too heavy. My skin can be sensitive to heavy perfumes or chemicals this did not cause any itching or redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I finally got my kit! I am so inlove with the smell of Loreal Day Cream, good fragrance. Once applied, it is absorbed quickly on skin - not greasy at all. I like the silk powdery feel of it on my face. After two days I noticed I have softer skin and I can't wait to see more improvements on my dry skin. Thank you.

"Woow finally I received this great product. It is a great cream. It is really light, smooth, fast absorbed and effective. You can feel the anti-sagging and anti-age spot really quick. It took me only 3 days! That's amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think im in love with this day cream. It made my skin so silky soft and smooth. Loreal is one of my favorite company's to use products from.. Its simply awesome. Cant wait to review the lovely night cream i got. The day cream has a very lovely smell to it unlike other products that ive used in the passed. It made my skin have a very lovely and shiny glow [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After just five days of using the Loreal Age Perfect Facial Day Cream my kids have noticed a definate improvement in my skin. My age spots have completely faded, the elasticity in my skin is so much better, no more crepe neck, softer more radiant glow to my face! My daughter says I look five years younger! THANK YOU LOREAL THIS IS AN AMAZING PRODUCT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my bzz kit last week and I'm skeptical with the product. I have never used a daily facial cream before. I find the product greesy and heavy on my face. Maybe this is normal but I'm not sure. Currently I don't wear any makeup when I put the cream in. I plan on using the facial cream for six weeks to see if I notice any difference. Hopefully I will have a different opinion at the end of the campaign. I have a before picture to see if my face will tighten up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this is ok, not truly convinced that it is super yet. I really didn't like how this product smells. I would prefer a face cream to be unscented. This also made me break out. Overall it did make my skin feel softer so it was ok, but not great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprised to receive full size jars! I started using it right away. It went on smoothly and my skin absorbed it with no greasy feeling at all. I've been using both day and night versions, and though it haven't been using it long, I could already see and feel the difference! I'll keep you posted... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! I have been using it for a week now. I use the day cream in the morning after I get out of the shower and before I put on my make up. I have sensitive skin and I have had NO break outs with this cream.It has a wonderful smell and makes my skin silky smooth. My skin feels more tight and I love that it has sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product can really help anyone with dry skin. If you lean more toward combo or oily I would suggest another L'Oreal product. This smells good, feels good and I after 10 days I'm starting to see finer lines reduced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Day three using both of the L'Oreal day and night age perfect cream I really like how my skin feel it absorbs quickly the only thing I don't care about is the smell it has a strong perfume smell but keeps my skin moist [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Loreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Lotion that I got to try free from BzzAgent for about a week now. I can definitely feel and see a difference! My face is smoother and just looks pretty and healthy. I would recommend it for this reason.It also went on smooth and felt light and not greasy at all. As far as diminishing wrinkles, it says it takes three weeks and I haven't been using it that long so I can't review on that part. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given the opportunity to try both L'oreal Day and Night cremes. I love them !! They are not overwhelmingly greasy , they smell good, and they leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshed. After just 4 days of use I began seeing results in my skin. Usually my face is really dry around this time of year esp. Near my nose. I would definitely buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the day cream for how well it hydrates my skin. I notice when I first put it on it leaves a little bit of an oily sheen, so a little worried about acne. My face didn't feel tight after applying it as it does with some moisturizers in the past and it lasts all day. It is quite thick and I feel like I am using way more product that I should be. It would be an expensive product to continue using. So far I am pleased using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I love this day cream. It is light on my skin, absorbs quickly but not so quickly it doesn't feel effective. It helps me stay confident about signs of aging and sun damage. With SPF it protects my skin from harmful rays of UV, and keeps my skin moisturized in humidity or bitter cold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have sensitive skin so I am leary about what i put on my face. This cream was a little tingly but nothing major and it went away. My skin is also greasy and this isn't a heavy cream. Would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this product! I have been using it for about a week now and you can tell the difference. People have begun to notice. And living in the south having sunscreen included in a product is very important to me. I will be continuing to use this product as part of beauty routine. I just can't say enough good things about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using this product for a few days but can already tell a slight difference in my skin. My face is more moisturized and does not get dry and chapped by the end of a windy day. Also, it looks like some lines and wrinkles are starting to disappear, but I will judge that more in a couple more days. Overall, this product is working great so far, and I look forward to continued usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first my skin would turn bright red from it but by the third day that stopped and all of my rough dry spots are gone I really like how my skin feels and looks and my make up goes on a lot smother [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Can you really improve your skin in a day? Yes! This cream does a great job of making your skin feel more supple. It's light and has sun protection. I have sensitive skin and this cream caused me no problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day cream keeps my skin feeling hydrated throughout the entire day. I have naturally dry skin, and this seems to keep it soft, smooth, and feeling great. Normally my skin will just absorb any kind of lotion and will go back to being dry a few hours later, but this gives a nice coverage through the entire day without feeling oily and/or greasy. Also there is no overpowering smell. Overall I'm pretty happy with this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer has a very floral scent, which I find pleasant and refreshing. The moisturizer absorbed into my skin quickly and left my skin feeling moisturized all day. I only take off one star because it made my face shiny. Using a mattifying product with this is a must. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the cream smells great, and is a good consistancy. I have normal skin and I don't like how it has left my skin feeling a bit oily. I tried it for a few days, but I think it was too moisturizing for me. I would recommend this to a friend who has a problem with dry skin. I definitely think this would help anyone who is dealing with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I wasn't sure how my skin was going to react to this product, so far my skin loves it! I've been using this cream for the past couple of days and let me tell you I'm impressed with the fact that it has SPF 15 and it doesn't feel heavy on my skin. The scent of the cream smells very clean. I'm excited to see how my skin will look in the next few weeks. So, if you're thinking of getting a good day cream, you must try this one.

"After one weeks of trying the L'Oreal Age Perfect Facial Day and Night cream, Both cream day / night really work deeply moisturizes my dry face feel so softer and nice. Leaves my face smooth without feeling greasy, Love the scent but i think it a little to strong , However i'm okay with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked it. So far I have used it for 7 days, and I have noticed my skin looks much healthier. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the the product has a bit of a greasy feel for about 15 minutes. The first day I used it and applied makeup right after, it caused the make up to cake. As long as I waited before applying makeup, it was fine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these products! First, let me say a little goes a long was just a quarter dab in your hand will moisturize your whole face. You can feel it working my face feels softer and cleaner.

"I've been using this product for a week now. I'm very leary on face products but this cream has not only freshened up my face, it has out lasted 2 weekends in a row of being outside watching my son play select baseball. I typically get sunburned not with this cream. I was actually amazed at first and gave it another try this weekend. It smells good, very refreshing, not oily and nothing is better than pretty skin at the ball park. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for almost one week and I can already see a difference in the skin texture around my eyes and on my neck. The cream is very hydrating, feels like silk when it goes on and adsorbs quickly. It does have a very strong smell although it does not bother me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love this day cream. It's very light going on and doesn't require a lot. I like the fact it has SPF15 in it, which makes it easier. Now I don't have to use a multiple creams for my face and neck. I've been using my day cream a little over a week and none of my others. I plan on using this one permanently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product feels so soft and smooth it's like applying liquid baby powder. It smells fresh and light with a long lasting fragrance. I have replaced my normal sunscreen with this amazing product and use it several times a day. My fine lines have lessened and I'm certain that with continued use they will continue to recede.

I think L'Oréal age perfect day cream is the best moisturizer I've ever used! This is the first product I have been satisfied with that has an SPF in it! It is not greasy and has a light silky feel. It smells fantastic too! My skin feels so soft and appears to be more radiant and plump! I use this in conjunction to the age perfect night cream and couldn't be more happy with the results! Thank you L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like how smooth my face skin feels and how radiant it looks already, only after a week of having used the cream!

"This is my first time trying any of L'Oreal Paris products, I've never thought I would benefit from using any type of facial creams I can feel the smoothness of my face before I go to bed and when I awake in the morning , it doesn't have that awful smell . I never felt I had time to moisturize , boy was I wrong . I plan to incorporate this in my morning and night routine . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed this cream a lot it is thick , but not heavy. My skin can be sensitive , but this cream didn't irate at all. I like it has SPF in it for my very pale skin. I noticed my skin looked healthy and plump when wearing it. My only complaint is the smell which is strong flowery smell and not my favorite. I am continueing to use it everyday because I like and it and my skin is looking healthier since using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of L'Oréal Age Perfect Facial Day Cream and I have got to say this is the best cream I have ever used on my face. My skin feels so soft and hydrated.

I love this moisturizer! It is not oily and it smells fresh. It blends in my skin very well and even has a sunscreen! I have an issue with different moisturizers either smelling like sunscreen or being very oily. This one is a great balance! Give it a try. Best of all- it's very affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this smells and how moisturized my skin feels after applying it in the morning. My makeup seems to stay on better and gives my skin a nice texture. It does make my skin slightly sticky but seems to go away throughout the day. Overall I like the product so far but not sure about the price. Seems a little expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really was excited to try the day cream after trying the night cream. Honesty I was not wowed with the day cream like I was with the night cream. It smells nice but it leaves my face feeling greasy and a little tacky. I thought maybe I used too much so I adjusted that and rubbed it in a little longer but it really didn't make a difference. I do however like the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have struggled all of my life with large pores. I have tried so many products to try to reduce them but I haven't found one that would help without resulting to a chemical peel. This product makes my face feel amazingly soft & reduces the size of my pores drastically. I have been using this product for about a week & I can already tell the difference.

"I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream with SPF15 is fantastic! I have used daily, for over a week now, and have already noticed some improvement in facial lines looking smaller, not as noticeable. I feel confident when I go outside that my facial skin is protected with the SPF15 that is in the cream, and the wonderful scent is a major plus! This is truly a great product worth trying.

I think the L'Oreal Paris age perfect facial day cream is a wonderful product it doesn't make my skin feel oily. It makes my face feel fresh and clean. It does not make my face feel like my pores are clogged and I like that. It's not heavy feeling either. I'm not quite sure how it would be with make up because I don't wear makeup but I would recommend to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I prefer the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream SPF 15 over the night cream. I felt like this product offered great hydration to my face without making it feel oily. I love the added benefit of built in sunscreen as well. While I haven't noticed any changes in fine lines or wrinkles, my skin does feel more hydrated. I will continue to use this product to see if I have any more benefits from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the cream was wonderful on my skin. My skin feels softer after using this for four days. I am taking better care of my skin because of this product. Now, before I got this product I would want to know if it was unscented or scented. I am used to using unscented products. This has a strong smell to me. But, that's because I'm not used to products with a scent. I will continue to use it. The smell is nice, just strong! The product is great. I love the way it feels on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
For those who are not into fragrance I have to say that you're going to feel a little bit of fragrance but trust me when I say that is very light scent and once you apply it and use the other makeup like your serum and foundation you're going to be fine.

Overall comment: I will continue using this product because I like the moisturizing feature. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed trying the L'Oréal Daytime facial cream. I used this after doing my normal morning routine and the cream soaked into my skin rather quickly. It left my skin feeling cool and moisturized for most of the day. The scent reminded me of the cold cream my grandmother used to use every night. It's not overpowering and not something that bothers me. Over all I am really impressed with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I've gotten older, I've begun to realize the importance of moisturizer and the importance of sunscreen! I hate the feel of sunscreen on my face though. This day cream doesn't leave that odd sticky feel that sunscreens normally do. I found this cream definitely isn't greasy and goes on fairly well. I normally like my day cream to feel a little more ""creamy"" than this but I've been very happy with this product. I'd say that its definitely worth giving a try!

"Iam very impressed with L'Oréal day cream, I was reluctant to stray away from my previous daytime facial regiment, but after using this product for 7 days straight, I find my skin softer and refreshed all day.

I love this product! My face feels noticeably smoother all day. I am very pleased that there is a sunscreen in this product.

"Winter is starting which means dry heat and winter skin. I started using this product about a week ago, the first time I tried it I knew I loved it. Dry winter skin was starting to get bad and I have tried other moisturizers but they just weren't working I still had dry patches. After the very first application my skin just felt better. After using it everyday, my dry patches are all gone and my skin feels completely hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the L'oreal age perfect cream it hydrates my skin and keeps me safe from the sun. Half my day I am in the hot blarring sun working and the cream is not sticky or getting in my eyes when I sweat which is a great deal. I am loving this product.

"I don't think that my skin is as ""mature"" as this product is intended for, (I am only 30) but I do enjoy it and was pleased with the SPF and that it is non-greasy and not crazy oily like a lot of products I have tried. Smells good and does the job of keeping my face moisturized throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received the product Saturday, so this is only the second day. On Sunday it was great but I wasn't wearing any makeup. Today with makeup on it seems a bit oily.

"I've been using it for about a week and I like it very much. It is lightweight and not greasy at all, and leaves my face soft and moisturized. I haven't noticed any lightening of the age spots on my face but I expect that will take some time. I was afraid that since it was a cream rather than a lotion it would be heavy, but that isn't the case at all. I really like the way my skin feels after using it. It hasn't made my face break out or caused any blocked pores, either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Nice product for the day time doesn't look greasy at all. Been using it for about a week skin feel nice and soft and hasn't caused me any irration or break outs. Living in sunny California I also appreciate the sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is the best product that I have ever used. After washing my face I use a generic moisturizer for combination skin since the results are that my skin feels oily in a few hours. But not with L'oreal Age Perfect For Mature Skin Day Cream. It never feels greasy and my skin looked wonderful after only using it for a few days. My daughter even commented that my worry lines looked less noticeable. It actually looks healthy! A bonus is the sunscreen. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think it smells great, it goes on smoothly, and has left my skin feeling soft. I just received it 3days ago, it hasn't made any affect yet that I can see. I like how it does make my face feel dry and stiff like other products ive used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love the luxurious feel of my skin afterwards. So soft. This moisturizer has managed to fix some really dry patches in only a few day. It's nice that the day cream has spf as well because lets be honest I don't use sunscreen daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a firm believer that as you get older your skin care regimen needs to change a little bit with your changing skin. I was thrilled to learn about L'Oreal age perfect line which is for mature skin. I'm using the L'Oreal Age Perfect day cream which has an SPF 15 for extra protection.. They offer anti sagging and anti age spot benefits. They are specifically made for mature skin. My skin feels smooth and nourished. I will be buying this again.

"i've been using this product for about 5 days and my skin does look brighter and feel soft. I love the smell, but it is a bit greasier than I like, but not so much that I will stop using it...it seems to soak in after awhile. i will keep using this and hope for amazing results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It makes my skin feel so clean and I can already see my face tightening up. It's taking the dark spots from under my eyes already and it is light. It's not like when you put on lipstick and its all heavy. Its like not having anything on. I will be using this long after it's gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the day cream every morning after washing my face since I received it. I like the way it feels going on and the fact that I don't have to use much to cover my entire face and neck area. It feels light and not greasy, being absorbed quickly. After a few days, I noticed that my skin felt tighter, more firm and smoother. I like the way it feels very much and I like the look of my skin. I will continue using this product even after my first container is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Felt great on my skin, didn't do much for lines sagging skin, but worked great. Just wished it worked better with the things it states it will correct. Night Cream was a little too heavy for my skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"...this may not be the product for you. I put this on and the scent was too much for me - very perfume-y. I washed it off. Because of the smell, I could not try this longer to see the benefits it promises. If they offer an unscented version, I will try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What a great product! It was very refreshing and moisturizing to my face, and the smell was very nice! When applying this product I could feel my skin absorbing the moisture immediately! I didn't realize how dry my skin was until using this product. Over-all, my face felt hydrated and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very impressed with this product and it's price. It smells amazing and does not leave a greasy film. It works perfectly under full makeup without feeling heavy. My skin stays moisturized and supple all day. The price is great for all that it does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am definitely seeing a change in my facial skin. My skin feels and looks smooth and soft.My skin also looks brighter and makes me feel more confident in my appearance. At 63 that's a wonderful feeling! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ok, so the smell wasn't awesome, but it was much better than most creams with spf in it! I really liked that it wasn't greasy or heavy and soaked in pretty good. I liked this product, but I'll have to stick with my normal moisturizer this time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is creamy going on. It Smells terrific! For me , it speaks to my skin, it has an spf which is important to me. And it's readily available and affordable ! That is a complete win win . You don't have to use a lot of it. Use on a clean face, your skin just Absorbs it nicely. It's non greasy ! Will definitely purchase in the future. L'oreal Is a trusted company that has been around for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that it has an spf but it is lightweight. A lot of drugstore moisturizers with sunscreen have a heavy feel and seems as though it sits on top of the skin. This product absorbs well and feels smooth instantly. Hopefully it will lighten some dark spots!! I'll do another review after more use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"ii never think about how much important is to take care of my face skin, i start to use the cream and i feel a diference in the texture, color, damagee everything, definitrvly this gonna be my favorite producto forever [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried to fade age spots on my face for about 6months. I've tried numerous products to fade them with very little results. In less than one week of using age prefect for mature skin (both day and night cream) I am finally get the results I wanted to achieve an even skin tone. Thanks so much [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I uesd this day cream and immediately seen the improvement of my face. It not extremely moistures it makes you're skin look very supple.I seen results he very first day.

I love the Day Cream. I have always wanted to know about this product. I can't wait to put on the night cream. I can't wait to show my co-works how my face feels and looks. And then I'm gonna brag about what I have been using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Age Perfect Day cream is amazing! No greasy after feel. Easy to use a little goes a long way! My skin is so soft! It is light weight and absorbs right in. It has SPF 15, contains Soy Seed protiens. I am in love with my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in my mid 30's and found this day cream very hydrating. The smell was ok but a little too much for my taste. I also found my makeup didn't hold up well over this product. By the end of the day my makeup was a mess. I would think it would be better for very dry skin. I also think the SPF could be higher, 30+ would be better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream! It made my face feel so smooth. I really like that has a suttle scent and spf in it. My skin was hydrated by the next day. I have only used it for a few days and can't wait to see more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been really enjoying using the day and night cream. My skin is showing signs of enforcement from dryness and flakiness. It feels very smooth to the touch. I haven't used it long enough to notice the dark spots disappearing yet but in sure they will in due time. Thanks so much for the opportunity to try these products I will take pics soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I Have Tried Both products I Love them both! I have very sensitive skin and only use sensitive products so this was defiantly taking a risk but I have never loved a product more than this I will defiantly buy more it has made my skin so soft and vibrant I love it .. Thanks for showing me this wonderful product.. Cant wait to BZZZ some more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it is a great product. For having an SPF it feels non-greasy and has a very pleasant scent. I like that it is light weight and after only 2 days my skin feels soft and my makeup applies evenly and stays in place. I haven't noticed any diffence in fine lines but it has only been 2 days so I will report back later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely loved it. It made my skin soft. My face and my hands felt great. I will definitely be buying it. It has sunscreen in it so your face won't burn. I would want to know the ingredients.Its worth it all of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Well so far I have used the day cream for a week , so far I love it my face feels so much softer and hydrated. I love the smell of the lotion it makes me feel happier so to speak . I am noticing my pores getting smaller but not really noticing wrinkles shrinking but I will give it more time and I am excited to add this product into my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed all day. I typically use a daily moisturizer with SPF and usually it feels more like sunscreen than a moisturizer. I was really impressed with how well this moisturizer works in addition to provide protection from the sun. It works well with my skin type (not too oily, not too dry). I would definitely recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product, fantastic price. For those who are not into fragrance I have to say that you're going to feel a little bit of fragrance but trust me when I say that is very light scent and once you apply it and use the other makeup like your serum and foundation you're going to be fine. Act like me I bought two, one for me and one for my mom who's in her late 50's. Buy it for the upcoming fall and winter season. Highly recommended it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I admit I am very leary of day creams. Past experience has left me with greasy dirt grabbing residue and sloppy looking shine. Wow! Not the case at all with L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream. It goes on smooth and no greasy feel or residue. My skin is more even and healthy looking! The smell is pleasant but strong at first but it fades fast and I couldn't be happier with the initial results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my L'Oreal Age Perfect Day and Night Cream 2 days ago. After using it only twice my skins feels great. It moisturizers perfectly and my skin feels smoother and looks healthier. I cannot tell the difference of reducing any wrinkles but again it's only been 2 days. I'll buzz again after a week or so and let you know how it's been working out for me!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so excited about this cream. L'Oreal really did it right with this one. Normally creams can make my face very oily. However, this day cream doesn't do that, not even by the end of the day. There is no overbearing smell to it either, which is another plus for me. If you're looking for a cream for aging, I strongly suggest giving this one a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At my age, I was excited to get to try a face cream to help with wrinkles and sagging skin! I've only used for 2 days but it leaves my face feeling smooth and refreshed. I don't normally like face creams with fragrance but this is light enough and smells delightful so I am all in! Hope to be able to share a significant improvement in the next few weeks of using it along with the night cream.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this product. I have used the day cream the last 3 days. Having the sunscreen on is such a help. I spend a lot of time outdoors and normally burn quickly. But not even a little this week. My skin feels wonderful too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using for 2 days. So far I like it. It has a nice light fragrance and is very creamy. It goes on smoothly and feels nice on my skin. My skin does feel a little greasy and that is the reason for my rating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this wonderful product 2 days ago and I can feel a nice difference in my skin. It leaves it smooth and moist and the cream is not greasy. I am expecting to see a nice difference in a week or two! A great product from a reputable company. I recommend trying this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to dry the day cream. The first time I used it I sweated even more than usual. So I thought why not try it again. On my second use, I tried to use it lighter than before. I still sweated profusely and my face felt gross only a few hours later. I was not doing any physical activities just sitting around relaxing. I don't think I would purchase this or use it again. Just to heavy for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently had the opportunity to try loreal age perfect day and night cream, thanks to bzzagent. I struggle with my skin, dry patches and oily spots. This cream was wonderful. It seemed to help balance all the issues I had. I applied the day cream before applying make up and my skin stayed smooth all day and did not get dry and flaky a few hours later like with many other creams. I have actually found a cream that leaves my face looking and feeling more firm and youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love it. It doesn't leave that greasy feel that most lotions do. It absorbed quickly into the skin and within a few days of using the cream I noticed that my face is much smoother and firmer. It's perfect for applying underneath makeup. My skin is more supple, smoother and looks younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This day cream went on smoothly and absorbed nicely into my skin. I guess I have the right skin type for it to not leave it oily at all. I did wash my face first before applying and would say my cleanser dries my skin a little bit first . My cleanser is after all to help with oily skin. It's also has a very pleasant not to overpowering smell to it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very acne prone skin with wrinkles being a close second to the problems I with the skin on my face. When it comes to anti-ageing creams they tend to be a little more ""greasy"" and I break out even more. This cream has been pretty nice to my skin so far, it's kept it completely hydrated without overdoing it. I haven't seen a decrease in my wrinkle, but, I have only been using the product for a total of 4 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually don't use to much facial cream because I worry it will make me break out but a few days into using the Loreal Perfect Age day cream and yah no breakouts. Sadly I still get breakouts at my age but my skin feels hydrated and my makeup goes on over the top just fine. I haven't noticed reduction in fine lines yet but I do feel better about how my skin feels. I also like that it feels creamy but not sticky. The smell isn't overpowering and is just a fresh scent.

"I'm 33 and due to a hysterectomy 2 years ago have been trying many different products trying to put the moisture back in my skin that has disappeared since then. Love this product. Smells amazing, is super light feeling when you first put in on but the only downside is it felt like a heavy lotion after I put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is wonderful! First off, it has a great smell!! It is not one of those thick moisturizers that you put on and feel like you need to wash your face because of the greasy feel. I put it on this morning and put my makeup on, I noticed later that my face didn't feel dry at all.. which is a big selling point when I buy any moisturizer! Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the fact it was a full product sample. Thank you so much. I tried both the day and night. I liked the smell and the texture of the product. I deff felt a difference in my face and neck. I deff will buy and tell others about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loreal age perfect day and night cream are amazing, I have only been using them for several days and nights now and it makes my skin feel absolutely wonferful, very soft and clean feel.

"I received my L'Oréal Age perfect day and night creams and I instantly began using them. They made my skin tighter, smother, minimized my fine lines and hydrated my skin outstandingly!

"I have been trying various face creams for years looking for that perfect lotion. Light and non-greasy, yet moisturizing; affordable; healthy with spf; and easy to open and use. I no longer need to look any further because I've found it in L'Oreal Paris daily moisturizer. The light fragrance is just an added bonus. I'm so glad I got to test this lotion and realize this is exactly what I have been looking for! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This day cream leaves my skin sooo silky smooth- so surprised! A lot of times lotion with SPF for my skin type leaves me really dried out, so I was really happy to try this product and not feel like a prune afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Loreal day cream is amazing! I am even more surprised by the day cream then the night cream. Again, the smell is amazing, and the feel of the product is even better. My experience with thick creams like this cream is they usually leave a greasy feeling all day. This cream however, you will find that you have a nice feel to your skin all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream not only smells awesome, but it made my skin feel silk smooth after one use. I cannot wait to see how it feels in a week. I will definitely be adding this to my skin regimen. It seemed a bit thick at first, but my skin drank every drop. There was no greasy residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only been using the day cream for 2 days. So far it makes my skin nice a smooth. Doesn't have the overwhelming smell the night cream does. Not greasy which is a worry for my T zone. No noticeable changes to skin as of yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this Day Cream this morning and it is a bit thick however easy to apply and absorbs rather quickly. I like the subtle scent and it isn't overpowering. I applied a small amount and I felt it opening up my pores and felt refreshing. Let us see how it withstands the sun today. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Today is my first day using the cream and so far I really like it. It is thick so you can feel it hydrating your skin. The part I'm really enjoying is it soaked in quickly and didn't leave my face feeling like there was anything there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream has a really nice creamy texture that goes on easily, absorbs quickly and really makes your skin feel soft and hydrated. I love that it also has spf to protect my skin everyday from the sun. It is scented but it's a fresh light scent that doesn't bother me. Overall a great product worth trying for yourself!

"It feels great on my skin, non greasy formula, and it gives it a natural glow with firmness! I feel like its giving me baby skin, while it also gives me the sun protection I need when I step outside.. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the day cream this morninh. I was expecting it to feel thick and sticky like most facial lotions do, but loreal has proved me wrong. My face felt like silk after using this one time. I hope over continued use I notice a diffrence in my skin. I felt a slight tingle around my eyes, but a good tingle. Like it was working. It also has spf in it. And that's great for my poor old aging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprisingly shocked at how light and non greasy L'Oréal Age Perfect day cream was. If you use others, you understand they can be too heavy or smell like like sunscreen. This has a pleasant and airy texture. It rubs right in and gives a certain glow. I highly recommend trying it alone, but if you c oils also add the night cream you will be in heaven.

Loved the loreals day cream made my skin feel very hydrated. I have very sensitive skin I was worried about breakouts had none.

I think this product is amazing! I suffer from dry skin and as soon as I put it on my face felt hydrated & healthy. I Put it on this morning before going to work.

I believe this is going to be my new fav :) Give it a try! #GotItFree #BzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"this is one of the most productive products I've tried. There are so many products that claim to do what they advertise but seldom follow thru. L'Oreal Paris is high quality and top of the line, and the prices are more than reasonable. My dry skin now glows and is as smooth as a baby's face. I would not hesitate to continue buying and using this product, as well as their foundation and hair care products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way the Loreal Age Perfect Day Cream feels on my skin. I usually don't wear day cream because they all seem too heavy or oily. This seems to soak into my skin, is not overly perfumed, and feels light. Have used the night cream often and am really enjoying the day cream now.

"I received the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Day Cream two days ago. I was so excited that I immediately cleaned my face and applied the lovely smelling Day Cream. It was a sunny day, so I got to test out the SPF 15 factor of the cream. I was impressed! My skin felt velvety all over and smooth to the touch. No sunburn here..... Love it!

My skin is normally really oily and flaky sometimes. I really like how this smoothed out my skin and made it feel less course. It was extremely helpful with dry skin too and I had no allergic reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this smooths on and my face completely soaks it up! It's thick and creamy but feels light. It has a nice coolness to my skin too! I felt a instant slight tightness around my lips and cheekbones too! I love this stuff! It has spf 15 in it so I think that's where thickness comes from. I usually have dry skin and it makes it feel smooth with out feeling like my pores are being clogged. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Definitely makes my skin feel smooth, and doesn't give me a shiny skin tone, maybe more of an undertone, and never feels greasy or heavy on my skin, like the light fragrance, and like it spreads smoothly and evenly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Intended for mature skin (50+). I am 47 and have always had combination skin. Just starting to get a few fine lines on my forehead but otherwise relatively wrinkle-free. This cream may be a little heavy for my complexion but it makes my skin feel ultra-smooth and luxurious. I think it will be great for the cold dry winter months coming up, but do feel it would be too heavy for me in a humid summer environment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the fact that this has spf in it! The cream itself is light and goes on smooth. My slightly dry skin felt moisturized after just a few uses. It has a light fragrance that I enjoy. Definitely a product I would like to continue to use ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Feels light and fresh, with a comforting scent. The cream itself looks luxurious. It's a good feeling to know that my skin has SPF protection without feeling like I'm wearing a mask. I'm not sure why, but I waited a few minutes after putting on the cream and my makeup went on easier! That was a pleasant surprise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used many day moisturizers. High end brands also. I figured I would give this one a try. And wouldn't you know, it's by far the best one. Not heavy on my skin, doesn't obsorb right away or stay heavy on my face. It's just oerfect. My skin feels hydrated all day! I have such dry skin that it's unbearable even without touching. But this feels so good as it goes on and stays that way all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would want to know the product is more for 50 +. Aside from this being the targeted audience I really like the product. I have been waking up with smoother skin from the night cream and using the day cream during the day. The cream is not oily and has a nice scent. Overall I would recommend.

L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream is non-oily and I'm glad it has SPF 15 included. Has a fragrant jasmine smell which is amazing. Moisturizing but not greasy and works well with or without makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just tried the L'Oréal Age Perfect for the mature skin day cream for the first time as soon as It arrived in my mail box. So far I have noticed a nice clean smell that leave no traces of oil.

I love this product! I am not big on using creams and lotions on my face for the fear of breaking out on my skin but I tried L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day cream and I love how it makes my skin feel! I applied the cream and it wasn't oily or greasy and once I washed the cream off it left my skin feeling so soft and it smelled great! I would definitely use this product again and I am really looking forward to trying to Nightime cream as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I guess I'm up in that age where my skin is mature. Using the L'Oreal Age Perfect day cream. The cream feel like a water based but it's not super thin. Only need a quarter size to cover my whole face. Immediately I could feel and see my skin is more hydrated. And I can easily where under my makeup. It doesn't have a harsh smell so adding this to my daily routine will be no problem! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"If you are anything like me you are probably overwhelmed with what is available on the market! I just want something that works, doesn't smell and is reasonably priced to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles on my face. The first thing I noticed was the cream smells great. It went on very smooth and absorbed very quickly without leaving my skin feeling oily. I will report back in a few weeks to let you know my results.

Now that I hit my 30 year mark I'm really concerned about preserving my skins integrity and keeping the fine lines at bay. This cream does a really good job at hydrating without the extra oily feel. It smells great too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing I noticed when opening this is the smell. For an SPF15, it smells pleasant! Its not greasy in any way which is very awesome becaise no one wants to put something greasy on their face everyday. It says reapply every 2 hours, but its not something I'm going to carry around in my purse, there's enough stuff in there. Maybe if it came with a travel size that you can put in ur purse? All in all great product that will last awhile! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"After, I tried the day cream for the first time, I felt my skin to be ultra moisturized, smooth & hydrated. Love the fact that it comes with SPF-15. Nice fragrance.

I have a very dry and sensitive skin and am always hesitant to try new face products. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Day Cream SPF 15 works well but not well enough for my skin. It feels great on the skin and makes my face feel soft for sort time but doesn't deliver a lasting effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product holds the name because it feels really good on my skin .And as you get older you don't want to have you skin wrinkly and not look good .And it's vet important to me to feel really good about myself [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked that there was a specific day and night creme. They felt lightweight and not greasy. Personally I like to use a day creme that has an SPF of at least 30 but 15 will work for me during the winter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used L'Oreal products for many years. I have tried other cheaper brands, but always return to L'Oreal products. this cream makes my face skin smoother & fades my dark spots ( of which I have many). I have in recent years learned, to stick to what works."
I am almost 50 and I take very good care of my skin. I use sunscreen daily and don't sun bake either. I was excited to try this day cream from Loreal since it seemed more focused on my issues like softening those fine lines. I like that it has SPF in it but I would like to see it SPF 30 but other than that it really has been working nicely to keep my skin looking soft and dewy. The fine lines look a little better too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Thought it was too thick for daytime. Didn't do much for my age spots. Maybe I haven't given it enough time. Broke out in some spots. Left my skin soft. Hopefully in a few weeks I'll see more of an improvement. Might try using it at night instead. Or maybe use more in winter time when my skin feels a little drier. This might be a good hand cream also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A good day cream - although I did find the scent a little too heavy and the formula too thick for a day cream for my liking. I like having the extra SPF protection. After it absorbs it sits nicely on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i was using a VERY expensive product for two years and was quite satisfied. However, I had the chance to try Age Perfect and my skin feels much firmer and resilient. I liked that it moisturizes without leaving my skin looking shiny. I would, however, prefer a lighter fragrance or no fragrance at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. Like the Age Perfect Night Cream, it has a fragrance but it's not noticeable once it's applied. I appreciate that it has an SPF 15 sunscreen added since I'm not always careful about applying sunscreen under my makeup. Great moisturizer. I would recommend it to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a fabulous day cream. It is well priced and the container is a very generous size. When applied it almost immediately is absorbed and my face feels like it did years and years ago. It leaves a slightly dewy finish. I would LOVE it if it were unscented. I like products that I use on my face to be unscented. Other than that it is perfection [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"excellent product, very smooth, doesn't make my makeup wear off wearing it underneath, no breakouts especially along jaw line, most important I have a healthier glow , fine lines are diminishing overall' very happy with product and will keep using product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been very impressed with the day cream. It's not greasy, feels really good and I've seen a noticeable improvement in fine lines, crow's feet, etc. During vacation recently, I noticed I was the only person whose face didnt get burnt. This was due to the SPF in your cream as I forgot to apply sunscreen on my face. I will definitely continue using these products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful day cream! It is non-perfumy and non-greasy and seems to soak right in to my moisture-starved skin. I also love the fact that it has a built-in SPF 15 sunscreen. Having used this for over a month now, my skin is definitely softer and smoother. You don't have t o spend a fortune to find a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. From the first time I used it, it felt very soothing and I can see visible results after the first week. I like that it has a sunscreen as I spend many hours in the sun and use it under my makeup. My sun related age spots are gradually diminishing and are almost gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After a week of using this product, the result was amazing. My skin felt smoother and the fine lines on my face was truly reduced. I recommend this Day Cream Moisturizer to all women out there who are still in search for a product for a better result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Top notch in every way. Felt great when I applied it, and my skin looked plumper and more supple all day. When paired with its nighttime partner, it offered an easy affordable regimen. Priced right, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using this product for the past two weeks along with the Age Perfect Night Cream. I spend a lot of time outdoors so I was looking for a day cream with some sun protection. This product is non-greasy and lightweight and makes my skin feel hydrated and protected. The combination of the night cream and the day cream is perfect for my over 50 face skin leaving it feeling smooth, supple and glowing. And the reasonable price is an added bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Age Perfect was easy to apply and pleasant smelling. Once again, like the night cream, there are 3 alcohol products. I would like to see more natural products used including Moroccan Argan Oil. I did not notice any difference in skin tone, firmness or lessening of smile lines. I liked the idea of including SPF15 sunscreen. I do not have age spots but will continue to use this product until it is finished and then I'd like to compare the before and after skin. Thank you for selecting me to test your product - I enjoyed doing it."
"I'm 57 & have been using both the day & night cream for about 4 weeks. I have noticed a definite decrease in the depth of my forehead wrinkles & the ones between my brows. I actually took before & after pictures, & my skin looks firmer around my jaw line. I'm very happy with both products. The night cream makes my skin very smooth & soft when I wash my face in the morning. I will continue to use both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very good moisturizing cream! Most moisturizers give my skins an oily look but this did not. Made my face feel good and made the fine lines less noticeable! I will definitely but again! Only wish it came in a pump instead of a jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this Day Cream for approximately four weeks. I love the fragrance and the way it quickly absorbed into my skin. I cannot say that I've experienced any great improvement in the firmness of my skin, but it does appear to be softer and my makeup glides over my skin. I really like the product and will likely purchase it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I could not use this product because I was allergic to it. I did not care much for the smell but this product soaks into the skin nicely leaving it smooth and soft. I also like that it had SPF 15. Wish I could have used it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Loreal Age Perfect Day Cream for approximately four weeks now and have seen a great improvement in the smoothness and texture of my skin. My face continues to feel firmer after each use and my fine lines and wrinkles are more hydrated and definitely less noticeably. This product is a great value to my skin and to my pocketbook! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is very rich and left my skin feeling greasy at first. That feeling does dissipate after awhile, so it is no doubt moisturizing. However, when I first used it, it made my face tingle and turn a bit red. I also had to use another sunscreen on top of this cream, because it does not include either of the three most effective for completely blocking out UVA/UVB rays; titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or avenbenzone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the day and night cream for a trial run. This review is for the day cream. The product is amazing!! I have extremely dry skin and this cream gave it a beautiful dewy appearance. Everyone at work asked if I was using new make-up! I was happy to share why my skin looked so refreshed. Thanks L'oreal :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this day cream in conjunction with the night cream for the past few weeks and love the look and feel of my skin. This cream is perfect for daytime use as it is light with a nice clean smell. My skin looks vibrant and clearer throughout the day which makes me feel great. I would recommend this cream to other women with mature skin as well as those with younger skin who want to keep it looking that way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought the day cream felt heavy on my face. It moisturized really well. And as I have dry skin, that felt great when I first put it on. But as the day wore on, especially since this is the height of summer, it just felt like too much. It provided really good sun protection. But it is just too heavy for me to wear during the day, especially during the hottest part of the year. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say I have used a lot of moisturizer in my days, but this moisturizer is a keeper!!! Just what I've been looking for! I love it's texture... It's not a light moisturizer, but it does not go on heavy. The smell is awesome! I will stick with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. I love how my skin feels. . . soft and firm. It is not greasy and my makeup goes on smooth and stays on all day. As I am I my 60s, I would recommend this product to anyone who is having a hard time finding the right moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really nice day cream. goes on smooth and my skin feels much better after using for the last four weeks. I can definitely tell a difference around my eye area. My skin is more luminous and less sallow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Give this day cream a chance. The first 2 weeks I wasn't impressed, but I'm almost a month in and like it now. I was looking for something to update my skin care routine, having used the same products for almost 30 years. Initially I thought it was too heavy and just sat on my skin, making it too shiny. Now it feels like it has become a part of my skin and I am using more of the cream as it feels like it is absorbing in. I love that there is SPF built in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very dry skin. Was skeptical that I would like this day cream but I absolutely love it. Very good hydration. Also my skin has the appearance of less sagging. I have been using with the comparable night cream. Would definitely buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this day cream for about 4 weeks and it has kept my skin hydrated and moist. I did see an improvement in the firmness of my skin. I do have a small area that has a brown spot and I did notice that it has faded since I've been using this product. Because I have oily skin I do not need a lot of hydration and at times I felt it was too hydrating. I like the SPF but it has a tendency to irritate my eyes. I would recommend this for dry skin. I may purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My face is aging drastically these days, so it's nice to find a product for mature skin that includes a sunscreen. Anything that helps reduce my under eye wrinkles is good for me. My face feels light and refreshed after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit hesitant to try something new for my skin but after trying the l'oreal age perfect day cream I am happy I did! Age perfect is a refreshing, nourishing and creamy face cream. lovely scented and so soft. It fully absorbs into my skin. Also love the sunscreen protection since I spent a lot of time outdoors. This is the day cream for me, just the right moisture and my skin feels hydrated all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this for the three weeks instructed with the sample and have never used the product before. There was a noticeable reduction in discoloration from age spots and small lines have become barely noticible. Moisturizing yet not greasy feeling. I will most likely purchase this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the feel of this cream on my dry and sensitive skin. It's creamy but it soaks right into your skin instead of sitting on top of it. I will continue to use this cream because I have noticed how bright and smooth my skin is since using this and I can get by wearing very little make-up now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a luxurious and great smelling product. I definitely noticed a light exfoliating with the first few applications. After that came the visible improvements. Small pores and dewy complexion. Perfect sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a good product. It is creamy and lightweight. There is no greasy feel to it. I am particularly happy that it has sunscreen. The ingredients are very good and I have noticed improvement in my skin's overall appearance. The fragrance is a bit much for me though. Would like it if that could be toned down or free.

"I love it, love it, love it!! As a girl growing up in the desert climate, at age 10, I used anything that was a cream or lotion, no one told me that I would need to stay moisturized so thankfully I had the sense to know this. I really feel my skin is moisturized and you actually can see a difference in only a few minutes! Thank you soo much!! I am 57 years old and I look younger than most females of any age. Thank you again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift products for a few years, so I was excited to give the Age Perfect products a try. I've been using the Day Cream since June 10 and even though at first I was concerned that it was too thick for day wear, I've been happy with it. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my face, but it does a great job moisturizing and protecting it from the sun. Plus I've noticed the skin on my neck and chest is smoother in tone and texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was having problems with the moisturizer I had been using for years. I wanted to use a cream that was not too heavy and had sunscreen. I found this to be great under my makeup and good for my complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this products for just a few days I felt like my skin was becoming firmer. I use it as an all-in-one moisturizer - I don't apply a separate one for under my eyes. It goes on smooth and helps my foundation go on smooth, too. The jar seems to last forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised at the results that I received from using the L'Oreal Age Perfect Day Cream. I noticed less wrinkles and that my skin felt more moisturized. I also had the benefit of having the look of firmer skin with more youthful skin tone color. I will definitely keep buying this product as I was pleased with everything about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very pleased with this day cream! My skin feels moisturized with a slight gleam but not greasy. All I need is a little blush and lipstick for most day-time occasions! I would like to see the SPF at 30 rather than 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a believer...and over my 65 years I have tried everything ...BUT this product combo Age Perfect Day and Night Cream is terrific ...I went and purchased the companion eye cream ...my age spots have been dramatically reduced ...skin is smoother and brighter...all the things that mature skin needs help with....thank you L'Oreal this is a great product and I will continue to us.

"I have been using this cream aftter receiving a sample. I am impressed with the visible difference in my skin!

"This is the perfect moisturizer for dry skin. Unlike many deep moisturizing products, it doesn't sit on top of the skin leaving a shiny residue. It absorbs into the skin and restores elasticity all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"After four weeks, my skin was softer and smoother. It felt more elastic. However, SPF15 is not adequate protection and I had to use sunscreen as well, which is way too much product for me. I found the fragrance too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this Day Cream! The SPF is a definite bonus. This cream absorbs quickly and leaves no sticky residue. My foundation goes on more smoothly and It really adds a dewy finish to my skin . My face is so much brighter after using this for just a few weeks- in fact I noticed that almost right away! My skin is also much more supple feeling. This cream has little or no scent which I just love! This cream is a keeper ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has become my daily go-to product! Living in Southern California, I need to use sunscreen every day so I love that this great moisturizer already includes it. It's definitely made my skin feel softer and made fine lines a little less prominent. I would recommend this cream to anyone - I would bet the earlier you start using it, the longer your skin stays younger looking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using Age Perfect Day Cream for 3 weeks, I noticed my spots were starting to fade and the lines around my eyes were looking a lot softer and less deep. with that happening in just a few weeks, my lines and spots should be almost nonexistant in just a few more weeks! Very happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Age Perfect Day Cream SPF 15 for 3 weeks and love it! My face and neck feel firmer and fine lines have been minimized.

"This is a lovely, rich cream that goes on smoothly. It blends in very easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I don't have any real age spots so I can't speak to how it works on them. My skin did feel good using this product. I love that it has SPF protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this in conjunction with the Age Perfect for Mature Skin night cream. I immediately noticed a difference in how hydrated my skin felt and looked. It really does make the skin look less ""crinkly"" and more youthful. I like the texture, the smell is pleasant, and it is readily absorbed upon application. All things being equal (nothing else different in routine), I have definitely noticed a visible improvement in both the look and feel of my facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for 3 weeks now and I do like it. Nice texture and does lighten spots, but haven't notice any lifting as of yet, but maybe with continued use. I find this a little too heavy for summer, (I have combo skin) but will use again in the winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a wonderful cream with high end ingredients. The texture is great and it's not oily or drying. It is so strongly scented I could not keep using it. I would gladly use it if there was a fragrance free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a very nice Day Cream - easy to apply with good sun screen protection. I use it daily, and it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth. My skin is generally very sensitive, but I had no problem using this product - no itchy patches, and no break-outs! It also works great on my neck and upper chest area, and has visibly reduced the appearance of fine lines in those areas. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a woman in her 6th decade, I'm interested in having fresh, radiant skin. This cream was pleasant in texture and scent and moisturized well without a greasy, heavy feeling. The SPF was appreciated, as well. The skin on my neck looks better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this! I was using another brand (starts with A) for over 20 years. In the last couple years I wasn't so happy with it. I started to notice little bumps (almost like small pimples) on my forehead and down around the sides of my face. I tried Age Perfect and the ""bumps"" are gone! I am very pleased how soft my skin is now. Also, it is much lower priced than the other brand! I'll be buying this from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is dry and flaky especially my cheeks. Around the sides of my mouth and neck show deep dry lines. I have tried Oil of Olay and other $$$ products. This is the only one I would recommend. It moisturizes without staying or feeling greasy or making me break out. My skin looks great and seriously shows its dry when I don't use it. I'm 61 yrs old thanks to great gens and this moisturizer I don't look 61 lol.
"For years, I just used Oil of Olay moisturizing cream. Finally decided to try something different, because it just wasn't helping my skin. I started using your Age Perfect, for mature skin, and I love it! So far, just using the day cream...now I must get the night cream also! Love, Love, Love your product! Thank You!"
"Honestly, I might have given this product a 4.5 or 5.0 rating if it wasn't for the cloying, overpowering perfume scent, which I can't seem to get out of my nostrils after applying it to my face. I don't feel it is necessary to ""heavily perfume"" products to make them desirable. Yes, it makes my skin feel nice and smooth, but I can't get past the odor so will not buy it again. There are plenty of other alternatives. Thought I would try this since I normally like L'Oreal products, but this one is getting bumped off my short list!"
"I love love love this moisturizer! I've been trying different brands over the years and none of them I cared for. This product however, I will continue to purchase. It makes my skin soft and look great. I've had compliments from other women on how great my skin looks!"
"I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE BETTER THAN GARNIER AGE DEFYING CREAM, BECAUSE IT'S LOREAL, BUT IT'S NOT. NEITHER ONE HAS DONE ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR ME AND GARNIER HAS A BETTER TEXTURE (NOT GREASY) AND FEEL. LOREAL AGE PERFECT IS GREASY TO ME SO I ONLY USE IT WHEN I'M HOME AND NOT HAVING TO WEAR MAKE-UP. SORRY I THREW OUT THE BOX OTHERWISE I WOULD TRY TO RETURN IT."
"I would buy it again, but it will have to be unscented, it is a little to strong and you know it is on you for awhile. am sensitive to perfume scents early in the morning and would prefer no scent at night. So, I am checking yes to buy it again, if they have unscented."
"I was using an expensive department store brand of skincare, for over 30 years. About a year ago, I decided to try L'Oreal Age Perfect Skincare. What a find! This cream moisturizes so well, yet it is not greasy. It, along with the Age Perfect Re-Cushioning Serum, gives my skin a radiant glow. The jar contains 2.5 oz., too! (My department store creams were only 1.7 oz.) This cream also has an SPF15! FIrst, i apply the Re-Cushioning Serum to my face and neck, followed by this cream. WOW!"
"i felt different applying this cream that i bought here. The same cream i bought in wallgreen shop was so silky. this product feels little rough and doesnt feel silky at all. So next time I will buy in some shop rather than ordering here.,"
It feels good on my skin. I would like to believe that my skin is soaking it up. I have used the day cream and the night cream for many years and would not think of changing to another brand
I like this L'Oreal face cream because it has sunscreen and is a great moisturizer. It is good under makeup- makes foundation glide onto my skin. The price is not bad for the benefits.

This would be a good daily moisturizing cream to use alone. I find that it is so thick that I can't get my makeup to smooth on over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My trial period of the day cream was interrupted by a hospital stay, but I've now started using it. Like the feel. I'll see how it does. The night cream was wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LIKE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE CREAM AND LOVE THAT IT HAS BROAD SPECTURM SPF 15 TO PROTECT AGAINST THE SUN. IT MADE MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND SMOOTH BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE SCENT. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This day time cream goes on easily and feels light and nourishing. I have sensitive skin and often breakout with other day creams. Never have a problem with this. SPF 15 is helpful, too. Highly recommend."
"After using this product for about 2 weeks, I noticed that my skin looks more radiant and supple, my skin doesn't look tired any more. I also use Age Perfect eye cream and it works perfectly."
I love the feel of this product when I 1st put it on but it is way too greasy for me. I still use it when I know I wont be putting on makeup or getting out of the house.
"The odor while pleasant is stronger than some perfumes. Why would they make a face cream that smells so strong, that competes with shampoo, conditioner, hair gels, and body lotion? And the extra ingredient can't be good. I'm a big fan of Loreal products and will continue to use them, but this is going back."
Yes it is a good of a lne of cosmetics as Lancome with the same qualitye

Loreal age perfect helps soften my lines and wrinkles. It has an SPF 15 which protects me from the sun's rays.
I would not recommend this item to my friends. It gave me a rash. It also made my skin really dry and itchy.
