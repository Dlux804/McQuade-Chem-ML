"I have been using this product for years. I started out with one of the big department store expensive brands which kept getting more and more expensive so I thought I should find an alternative and I did, L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Face and Neck Moisturizer. I use the day and night moisturizers. They both work very well and I save money. It's not sticky or greasy feeling. I especially like the night moisturizer. Not an overpowering scent, but nice. Works for me."
It DOES what it Claims...Firms face & Neck!!!
"I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Anti-wrinkle & Firming - Face & Neck Moisturizer for several years and I love it. It feels great when you put it on your face, not greasy, and smells good as well. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thanks, L'Oreal."
"To date, this IS my favorite moisturizer. Great humectant, and over time, I know it has worked to keep my skin cells plumped and elasticity restored and maintained. As a former beauty advisor, I know one of the keys to a beautiful complexion begins with exfoliation, as the skin cells cannot receive the nourishment of the product unless the old skin cells are removed first. I have used this cream for years now, and because of its many benefits will continue to use it, as it is a great defense against the woes of aging!!"
Good item with a reasonable price .
"creamy, thick smells nice.....very good."
I liked this face cream overall. It felt very smooth on my face and made my skin feel good. The only thing was; I had a major break out on my skin after the first few times I used it. Other than that; it worked well.
"I have used the comperable Walmart, Equate brand and have like it better and it is half the price. It is an okay moisturizer and the price is not bad but I would not call it exceptional or anti-wrinkle or firming."
smells similar to the old ponds cream. I did not see a difference at all. Tried this to see if this would work in place of Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration. Olay won out 10 fold.
Not good under powder or mineral foundation.
"I recently started using this cream. I am 65, but not too many wrinkles. I will say that my skin looks brighter and my neck seems tighter. On the down side, it has a very strong, soapy fragrance and it never seems to completely sink in. My face feels tacky and sticky all day. I don't wear makeup, I don't know if that would make a difference, but I don't like the way it feels or smells. Too bad.. it does seem to work"
I can't tell you how upset I am about the change you made to this product. You added a perfume that is so powerful I can smell it on my face all day. It's horrible! I have used this product for many years and now I have to find something new. Please give me back my old face cream!
although this cream feels nice on the skin it caused my skin to become irritated..i think it may be due to the fragrance...i stopped it for a few days and then tried it again and the same thing happened. if you have sensative skin this is not for you.....
"I brought this product a month ago and I love how my skin feels soft, moisturized, and even tighter. It's an amazing moisturizer, I also noticed that there is an improvement in the decrease in the appearance of my wrinkles. It smells great too!. I will continue buy this product again!"
"As I have gotten older, my skin has become sensitive and the wrong combination of ingredients sends my skin into shock and it breaks out. After chatting with your skin experts, I decided to try this cream and it was heavenly. No breakouts and I can already see a change in my neck area and cheeks."
"The cost of the box went down, however so did the amount in the jar. A 16% increase in the cost per ounce or gram. I understand that the cost of materials and production go up but 16% in a short period of time is unreasonable. The packaging was re-done for a ""new look."" Is this the cause of the increase in cost? The ""new Look"" is not that different from the ""old look"""
"I love this product!! Had a jar for a while. And forgot i had it. My skin has been really dry, especially in my forehead, and when i put it on THE CHANGE WAS SO EXTREMELY VISIBLE, i went and bought another one same day, cus i had nothing left from the old one. Hehehe!! I LOVE IT!!! And so RECOMMEND IT!! Every woman should try this!! It works like no other product!! L'Oreal is a magnificent company!"
I have been using this cream night and day for many years. I have very sensitive skin so I loved the fact that it did not bother my skin. However the most recent jar has caused the skin to flake and itch. I will not be buying anymore do to the change made in this cream. I have no idea what changes were made. I really had a hard time finding cream that made my skin feel and look great! I am looking for one as good as this one used to be!
This is one of the ones I couldn't leave without if I could I'll get ten of them at same time lol I love this brand name
after one use the line that was starting to appear on the side of my face was gone. Those postmenopausal sags are gone now too. This is really a great product.
I was in search for a heavier moisturizer during these winter months. Being that it said anti wrinkle and forming was a bonus. This product makes your skin super soft and it lasts all day.
I have been using this cream for years. It is part of my everyday routine and I always apply it before I put make up on. Love this product and I will continue to use it in the years to come.
"Using this product at night helps my skin look refreshed in the morning. Although I don't use it during the day, it has an SPF if you wanted to leave the house without makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
WONDERFUL!!! My skin looks so smooth and it is so soft. Quite a difference from the other products I have been using. Make up goes on smooth...acutally glides. VERY IMPRESSED.
I have used this cream for the last couple of years; it does pretty good; I do feel as thought it keeps my face around my mouth and my neck area pretty firm! I will continue to use this product as its affordable and does a good job.
Received some about 20 days ago. Started using it and even my husband says there's just something different kinda like you lost 5 years off your face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is my favorite night lotion. No fragrance--very important. I've been using it for three years and my skin looks and feels great. I'm forty and I won't need fillers for years if I keep using L'Oreal's products.
I love this cream. My face was looking fry no matter what i did. But with this cream its now looking softer and isnt dry antmore. Thumbs up to this product
Broke my face out after 2nd use it does make your face feel soft but sensitive skin look out
This is non greesy and light weight. I put it on 2-3x a day. My face is starting to look and feel healthier.
"Great product! Tried one a couple of weeks ago ordering on Walmart.com. Liked the price so much, I ordered 2 more. Isn't greasy and soaks in nicely."
"It goes on really smooth, no strong odor. Absorbs quickly!!"
"I use this every night. I like this night cream the best. It's not greasy, but my skin feels moisturised."
I bought this product about two months ago and I see the different [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using 2 weeks ago and I get compliments on how healthy and happy I look. My skin feels supple and soft, I am loving this cream."
It's been only two weeks that I am using it and love it so much. My skin has never felt this soft and smooth. Would recommend it to anyone.
"I love it this facial cream , my skin got very smooth and make my skin feel good. After I one use the line that was starting to appear on the side of my left side of my face was gone . As well those postmenopausal sags are gone now too . Wonderful product and I'm very impressed !!! I really tecimebde it !!!"
"I made the mistake of switching to another product in the revitlift line and regret it. When I used this one, I had no peeling and my skin was soft and full of moisture. I was able to use morning and night with no problem, and my skin was the best it's ever been. Switching back ASAP."
Love it!! Works in an instant!! You can't go wrong.
not as ordered. Had to exchange in local store
I HAVE USED THIS FOR YEARS AND LOVED IT AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT AND THE RESULTS HOWEVER YOU HAVE ADDED A SMELL FOR SOME REASON THAT I CAN NOT TOLERATE - I HAD TO WASH IT OFF WITHIN MINUTES - I HAVE A LOT OF ALLERGIES ESPECIALLY TO SMELLS AND THIS NOW IS LIKE A KILLER SMELL TO ME - I CANT FIND ANYTHING THAT I CAN USE NOW - I AM LOST WITHOUT MY LOREAL
I felt results faster than I saw them. This is an amazing product and I am so glad I got to try it out. I will use this from now on. Love the consistency. Has a fresh smell and not greasy!!! Well done L'Oréal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Actually this cream is my favorite out of all the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle. It is not too dense and it penetrates really easily. Leaves the skin very soft and moisturized for the hole day. I have vey sensitive skin and this cream did not make me break out. After a month of trying it, I can feel that my skin is more firm now and healthy. Absolutely recommend it to anybody out there who wants a nice beautiful skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Revitalift Firming Face and Neck Contour Cream is a dream. I thought my face and neck were fine for my age. Apparently I was wrong. This contour cream made my face and neck look firmer. Plus it really helped out with my eye bags and frown lines. What a welcomed surprise! I have very sensitive skin, this contour cream does not irritate or dry out my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for almost a month. I'm still not really sure the purpose of having this product seperate from the others as it had the same effect, smell and consistency. It had a hospital smell,stayed kind of tacky for most of the day and didn't work well under makeup.this is definitely not something I would purchase for regular use, it just felt like an unnecessary step. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm giving this one three star just because I just didn't see a difference. Not saying it doesn't work, just saying I don't really think it was a product I needed. I will say it has a really nice texture and blends in nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck cream and it feels great on my skin. Texture is very rich and creamy but not oily, perfect for my normal to oily skin. Keeps my skin hydrated all day and night. I really like this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't give a super positive nor a super negative review about this face/neck contour cream. I've been using it for nearly a month and haven't noticed any firming. It feels nice on my skin, but that's about all I can say that I really like about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've read that everyone is using their phone so much and looking down that it is creating more wrinkles in the neck area - enter the Anti-Wrinkle Face/Neck Contour Cream. This is a thick cream, but perfect for nighttime as it has plenty of time to sink in. It is easy and smooth to apply and spreads easily. I also enjoy the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream for four weeks. I did not see any changes in wrinkles or lines. However, the overall condition of my skin has improved dramatically so maybe with more time this will work as intended. My face and neck are so soft and smooth! I was worried this product would make my skin oily and it hasn't, my skin feels great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product everyday for the last 3 weeks. I put it on in the morning and then again at night. I will say that it does stay on and makes your skin feel great. I think I will buy this product again, because I like the way it feels and lasts. It might be too soon to tell if it will help reduce any wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the firming Face/Neck Contour Cream. It was light and easy to apply and by the end of 4 weeks, I did feel like there was some improvement in skin texture. I don't think I could quite say that I felt like it firmed or tightened, but the skin did feel less crêpe-y. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the Revitalift Anti Wrinkle and firming Face/Neck Contour Cream for a few weeks now and I can really see a big difference in my skin. My neck and jawline are so much tighter and I look years younger. I get complimented on my appearance often and I just feel really good about myself since using this contour cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this night cream a lot. I enjoy the moisturizing part to it although im not certain its done anything other than that. Ive received all 4 products from Loreal and have enjoyed the size & quality of the products, i cannot honestly say they work. Myself or family around me have not noticed any changes in my skin. I appreciate the opportunity to have tried them though. Thanks Loreal & Bzzagent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So all in all, my neck is not that bad yet. I have minor wrinkling. I have to say that I am a fan of L'oreal products. I have used this Neck Cream and while it feels great, it moisturizes but doesn't feel greasy, I don't see a big difference yet. Maybe because my neck isn't that bad yet?? I'm hoping with continued use, it will prevent my neck from getting worse. Time will tell and the brand is pretty consistent with everything else. No quick fixes here. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OMG!!!!! Old age is starting to catch up with me and it's starting to show on my face and neck. Help with wrinkles and fine lines is much needed. Right away, I could feel my face and neck starting to firm up when I put this on before bed. I could see the difference when I woke up and looked in the mirror. This will be going into my regular beauty regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never had any concerns with the skin on my neck so I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when trying out this product. So going in I had a pretty open mind. All I hoped was that it wouldn't cause breakouts, rash or irritation. So I found that I like this cream for its consistancy and hydration. I wish it had an SPF added because I like it better than the regular day cream. Scent is not over bearing but I could do without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this cream is a little on the thick side. The first couple of times that I used it I didn't think I was going to like this. I don't have a morning and nightly face regiment so all of this was new to me. No I can say I really like it. I think my skin just needed the moisture so it was uncomfortable until it was moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this product. It has a nice smooth texture, and the scent has a little oarfume smell to it but nothing overpowering. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I already notice a difference. My skin appears to be tighter and brighter. The only negative is that it feels a bit greasy and doesn't totally sink into your skin so I wouldnt recommend wearing it under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for about 1 1/2 weeks and what's amazing is how significant of a difference it is from the more ""expensive"" product I was using right before this. The only small item I would change is the fragrance. I would prefer my cosmetics not to have a fragrance but that's just me. I'm very impressed with L'Oréal and the items I received in my kit! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a good firming and anti-wrinkle cream. After using it for about 3 weeks I definitely can say that my neck skin is firmer than usual. I apply it twice a day and it keeps the skin very well moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First didn't like how hard it was to see which product it was. was it the day face or neck. I ended up marking the top of both lids with a sharpie. ...neck and day as to make sure of using the right one. these products (except eye cream) all left my skin feeling slightly tacky. the price point was good if you want a moderately priced product. I will not purchace this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream on my face and neck once a day for the last few weeks. My skin is so soft and smooth. I get compliments all the time on how hydrated and great my skin looks. I also love how great it smells, so fresh and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Firming Face/Neck contour cream is smooth as it goes on your face. I didn't have to keep working it in, like some other creams. Sometimes the creams are really oily, but this one is not. I recommend getting this product since it's easy to apply and doesn't leave a film. I have been using this product for a week so I haven't seen results yet, but plan on continuing to use it, because I believe it will work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used to see night creams ads on TV a lot and wonder, what's the big fuss. Well after trying my new Loreal night cream .. I FINALLY GET IT NOW!! What a unique and refreshing experience! My face felt really hydrated and moisturized each morning which in turn gave me that extra boost of confidence I needed to start my day!! Who knew? #BzzAgent #LorealRevitalift # Got itfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the L'Oréal firming face/ neck contour cream for more then a week now, and it seems to be working. My neck is definitely much softer and I use it twice a day. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Revitalift Anti wrinkle neck cream and I have been very pleased with this product. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I am impressed. First it's A very light weight formula, so my skin doesn't feel greasy after I use it. It's got a pleasant scent to it also. The cream absorbs well into the skin and I am really noticing a difference in my skins texture. I was able to notice a difference within the first week. Highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a bit skeptical of beauty products and their claims, but this product delivers. My skin looks and feels so much better now than it ever has. I'm definitely going to continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never really thought I had skin with much wrinkles or lines, but with this cream I have been using for the past few weeks and noticed a difference. Softer skin with less lines around my cheek and neck, so nice and not an over powering fragrance. I definitely see a nicer difference even though I wouldn't have thought I needed it in the first place. Definitely recommend for those ladies who just need that extra poof of youth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Every night for over two weeks I have used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream and I have yet to see any improvements around my neck area. Therefor, I can safely say this cream failed to reduce the visible signs of wrinkles and aging around my neck as it claims to do. It does a fine job of hydrating, but not all it's hyped up to be. Glad I was able to try it, so maybe I can buy a product which will work better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Face/Neck cream on my neck for the last three weeks. My neck definitely feels softer, maybe even firmer. I'm enjoying using this cream, it feels great when I smooth it onto my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face and Neck Contour Cream for over a week and I am thrilled with the results so far. At 41 years old the skin on my neck has become loose. It makes me look older than I am. Since I have been using this product the skiing on my neck has tightened dramatically. There is a visible difference that my friends have noticed. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour cream and was not impressed. I expected it to make my skin feel firmer and softer, but the only thing I felt was a tackyness. And the fragrance was too strong. I was very thankful to have the opportunity to try this product but, sorry, I am not a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face / Neck Contour Cream every day for the past 4 weeks. When I started my husband would tease me about my ""turkey neck"". Now he can't believe the change. The Neck Contour cream removed all of the wrinkles that I had. I now have a smooth neck that no longer looks like it belong s to someone 20 yrs older. The only problem that I found is that if you miss a day some of the lines returned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you are looking for a lightly scented, creamy, skin firming cream, this is it! You don't need a lot as a little goes a long way and it makes your skin feel firmer. I didn't notice any difference in wrinkles but, my skin feels much firmer. I would recommend this product and I will continue to use it. Here's hoping that, with continued use, I will notice a difference in fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit confused about the differences with this product and the other day cream - it would be nice to have that a bit more clear. Other than that, I really liked the texture, and felt like it did a good job of protecting my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I have enjoyed using this product. It goes on smoothly and has a light, pleasant smell. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. My skin feels lightly moisturized and not greasy. As far as contouring, I haven't noticed much of a change in the appearance in my neck. But overall, I'm pleased with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this a few weeks ago and I feel like I can already see some improvement in my next! I am not old by any means but things are starting to show some wear and tear. But I feel like I can already see that my neck has trimmed up a bit. It looks younger already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is a good moisturizer. I didn't get to use it for the recommended 4 weeks to see if it reduced wrinkles but I also don't have many wrinkles. Therefore I can't judge its wrinkle reducing capabilities but I can tell you it moisturizes well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think for me the wrinkle cream is a little oily for my skin. But once I got the cream rubbed in real good after a few weeks of routine it seems to be slowly making my frown lines actually disappear. This is a keeper as long as I use the right amount for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is wonderful! I'm 61 years old & I can tell a difference in my face & neck after using this for only 2 weeks! It makes my skin soft & it looks tighter just using it! I highly recommend this product to use on a daily basis for all ages! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think I have found the Fountain of Youth when I started using the Revitalift creams from L'Oreal. It is a very pleasant smelling product that works, and absorbs into the skin so quickly with no greasy feel. The creams work together to smooth and firm your skin around your eyes, your face and neck. It is the complete skin package. I used the face/neck cream, night cream and eye cream. I love them all. I have actually had friends notice a difference. Love it/ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Night cream. I feel like I'm waking up with soft, firm, moisturizer skin as it works on my skin as I'm sleeping. Again, it has a great smell and is a bit thicker of a cream which is nice for night time yet still not too heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is thick but not heavy once you put it on, and the scent is very mild too, which is nice. I haven't been using it long enough to notice any significant effects, but I want to give it more time... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oréal Paris face/neck cream seems to be a good product. After a two week trial I can see a slight difference in my contour, but no as much as I had hoped. I do feel my skin on my face and neck is a little more taunt, so it does work. Product is not greasy, dries quickly with little to no sticky feeling, and it smells pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Has my skin soft. I love the product. I use it on my hands face. It not oily on your skin. It don't get all on your cloth's. It pairs great with make up. It don't weigh skin down. It last on your skin for long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream feels phenomenal. It smooths and contours the neck. I apply it during the day and night and I can see the difference in my before and after pictures. I will continue to purchase this product. It is amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to the product. When I was putting on the product, I didn't like the scent of it, it had a weird scent that made my head hurt. The cream was too oily for my already oily skin. After I put the product on, my face turned red and started burning. So I was unable to use the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After 3 weeks of use there has been a noticeable improvement in the skin on my neck. This is an area that I feel quite self-conscious and after use I feel more confident and comfortable with the appearance of this area. I will definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Another great product from L'Oreal! I've always just used my day cream for my neck area, but it's nice to have an additional cream made to firm up early wrinkles. I plan to make this a staple in my daily regimen and stave off any drooping skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a pretty decent product. It was easy to apply, smells good and isn't oily after application. I don't really see a decrease in fine lines yet, but it's only been about 3 weeks. My skin definitely feels and looks better, though. You don't really need to know anything before trying this product. I have pretty sensitive skin and I didn't have any problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great cream! It keeps my skin soft and feeling hydrated all day. I love how it feels on my neck and face. I recommend this to anyone who wants a great quality skin cream to make their skin feel great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I needed help! You could tell I was tired simply by looking at my face. I needed a pick me up and this was just the ticket! Super easy to use and took no time to apply. I don't want to have the dreaded turkey neck! RevitaLift to the rescue! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After a couple of days using this product I was very happy and my skin was looking moisturized and fresh and then on the second week I woke up full of breakouts on my face and my neck area. I have a kind of oily skin, so find a good moisturizer can be tough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These RevitalLift line is very good with their quality and function. This contour cream improves elasticity. My problem was I usually got confused with Contour cream and the Day cream because they are in the same shape container in same color. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream is light weight so it doesn't feel like it's clogging my pores. It's easy to apply, absorbs fairly quickly, making it a quick, speedy, effortless process to moisturize and care for a frequently neglected area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far i have been using this for about 2 weeks and i love the way it makes my face and neck area feel. My skin feels softer and smoother all around. IM hoping by the end of the jar my skin will appear firmer. I have not had any redness breakouts or irritation while using this product. This also has a nice floral scent not too over powering [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm the type of person that dislikes heavy creams. This product surpassed my expectations by being light weight and very hydrating. The scent is very little and actually very calming. Having my neck taken care of along with my neck, speeds up my night time ritual. This product really surpassed my expectations and I can't wait to tell my friends. After 2 weeks it was surprising to see results that my skin was glowing. This is a keeper product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never used a neck cream before, but this is nice. Barely noticeable fragrance. I loved how soft my skin felt. I didn't really have wrinkles on my neck, but I hope to prevent them with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After 2 weeks i am noticing effects of using all of the creams and I am loving it! I can't imagine how my skin will look after 6 months! But ones things for sure that i will be finding out because i am purchasing more of this!~ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I admit it. I didn't really see the need for a Contour Cream. I mean, my neck and jaw area looks the same to me as it always has. However, after trying this cream for the past 3 weeks I am a believer! There is a definite difference win the tightness of the skin on my neck, and my jaw line looks firmer. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nice texture, but did nothing for firming or smoothing my neck & chest. No noticeable difference in the two wrinkle lines across my neck, offered no firming of my chin. Nice and moisturizing though, with no waxiness or oil residue that I have experienced in the past. Probably will not purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only use this product on my neck and decollete (not my face). The consistency is great - not too thick or thin. There is no strong smell and the cream does not irritate my skin. My skin feels soft and although my neck was not really a problem area, I feel that this will help me maintain the area and prevent wrinkles, jowls, etc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I have been using this cream on my neck and RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Cream on my face. There is very little scent to me. It feels nice on my neck skin and hasn't caused any breakouts so far which is always a good sign for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never thought to use moisturizer on my neck. I don't do any type of special care for my neck. I noticed within 3 days that the texture of my neck changed. It is so soft and well moisturized. I like the smell, not overpowering. It's easy to apply and absorbs quickly and is non greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am thrilled with every product I've tried so far. The nice smell and smooth texture are nice to apply, I feel like I'm leaving a facial. I'm a believer in this product, after using the philosophy brand face cream for years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this cream and I really noticed a difference on my forehead. It kept my skin feeling very soft and conditioned. The negatives are the smell, it's not terrible but for me it's a bit too much perfume. I also thought it was a bit greasy, it was great for my forehead and neck but if I put it on my cheeks or nose I would break out. Overall it's a good cream with great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3 stars becasue my skin does feel softer since Ive been using it but i havent noticed and firming. Does feel a little greasy as well. Maybe it takes a while before you see results? Im not convinced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm in my early 30s and my skin really isn't that loose yet, so I don't have much need for this firming face/neck cream. I used it for a few days and did not see any visible changes. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming at all, and I love the texture of the cream. It smooths on the skin very easily and a little goes a long way. I did not have any adverse reactions to using this cream and I would totally continue using it if I had need for it. Overall, I'm satisfied! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that L'OREAL revital lift anti wrinkle neck and face contour cream is a great product I have been using this coupled with the L'OREAL eye cream. And the L'OREAL anti wrinkle day cream for the last two weeks and I love it. My face and neck has really improved in the appearance of wrinkles . My deep lines have been reduced . I can definitely tell a difference in my before and after pictures . I do recommend these products . This has made a difference in my appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! The product name is a mouthful! And it lived up to its name. My neck was beginning to sag and embarrass me. No more- after one week- noticeable improvement. After 3- fuggedaboutit! Loved the light, creamy texture and clean smell too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this cream has helped the skin on my neck feel firmer and less like crepe paper. I have very dry skin so I have a lot of trouble with this problem. I generally have to use products longer to see the results I have seen using this cream than i have L'Oreals. It is a help to my daily skin routine that I will continue doing.

"Now that I have been using all of these RevitaLift products for a couple of weeks, I can see that I have fewer fine lines and my skin feels moist and healthier than it did when I started. I can hardly wait to see the difference after 4 weeks! I even apply the face and neck cream to the backs of my hands and I see a difference in them as well! I will turn 60 next year, but that doesn't mean I have to look it, right? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the Revitalift Anti Wrinkle Firming Face/Neck contour cream is AMAZING! I cant even put into words how good it made my skin feel. I am not used to putting cream on my neck, so it was a new experience for me, but i felt like it made my skin not look so ""old"" . This will be a new part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wish I would have tried this sooner! I loved the way the cream felt on my skin. It didn't burn or itch and was light to the touch, not heavy at all. I used this along with other Revitalift products and my skin is thanking me. Everyone asks if I'm wearing a BB Cream or if I've slept well and the truth is neither! Having a newborn and having time for makeup is hard, so after using this cream my skin looks and feels great even if I don't feel so rested. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Used this lotion along my jawline, over my neck, amd chest. The consistency is great, not too thick or too thin. Allows the lotion to absorb in fully. Leaves your skin soft and smooth. Theres a light scent, kinda flowery. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved this product. It is so rich and thick, yet goes on smoothly and is not greasy. I could feel my skin absorbing the moisturizer in this product. My skin didn't feel dry later in the day as it does with other products. Didn't notice any difference in my wrinkles or in firmness of my skin, but definitely could tell my skin was not as dry. Would highly recommend this product for anyone with really dry skin, like me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream is a really great product. Loreal face creams just feel so nice when applying, especially this cream. It feels so refreshing and makes your face and neck feel soft. I apply fort thing in the morning to make me look awake, fresh, and soft looking. I can not express enough how great this products. Thank you Loreal for your amazing products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been wanting to try the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have enough hours in the day for it. In the morning I use the day cream and the eye cream. I go to work. At night, I use the night cream. I don't know when in my day I should be using the face and neck cream? So, I am saddened that it is still sitting in it's box. I think I will try it on my neck only and go from there... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this, but to be fair, not as regularly as I should. I have not noticed much of a difference on my neck. My face does feel a bit more hydrated, but I have also been using the firming day cream. I don't have much of an opinion to offer other than it does not seem to have done much yet and I've been using it a couple of times a week for about a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the Revitalift Anti wrinkle and Firming face/neck contour cream. I have a bit of flabby skin under my chin and neck area, due to weight loss, and after four weeks, I've already noticed the skin is tighter and firmer. I'm going to continue using this product long term! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually use another brand but I decided to buy this since I have had many friends going on about it for quite some time. After about a week or so I started seeing results and people started asking me what I was doing and telling me I looked younger. Revitalift is worth the money! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never really thought about my neck needing a little lift before, but upon further inspection it does need help. I use the face and neck cream and focus on my jaw line really well. The cream is a light weight cream. It doesn't affect you wearing make up. The cream is a pleasant smell and not overbearing. I really enjoy using the system and I love that the steps are on the outside of the box. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream works wonders. I used it for several weeks and have seen not only younger looking skin, but my skin feels firmer too. I used it in the morning and evening and within a week I was able to see a difference. If you really want to get younger looking and feeling skin, this is something that you should invest in. Yes, it can be a bit costly, but can we really put a price on healthy looking and feeling skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This isn't my favorite of the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift products, but as I wasn't previously using a firming cream of any kind, I feel like I'm helping my skin to remain firm and taught, while yet soft. And it's great to know that I'm regularly moisturizing my skin--which I know I needed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't try this product as I had an allergic reaction to one of the other products in the line. I'm sure it is an amazing product and wish I could try but with my sensitive skin i am reluctant to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I gave this product to my mother in law to try and she loved it. She has been using it for about two weeks now and can see a significant result. Her neck and face feels smoother and her skun around her neck is firmer. You have got to try this product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Similar to the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream, I found the Face & Neck cream too greasy. It didn't seem to absorb into my skin. I also found the fragrance too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal's Revitalift Face and Neck Contouring Cream is the bees knees! My skin has never looked better! I have been using this every other day in conjunction with the eye and night creams, and I'm absolutely in love! The contouring cream tightens the skin, but keeps it looking fresh and vibrant. It has a light delicate scent, and absorbs really well. This is my new beauty regime! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream. At first I was leery of the thickness of the cream as a day cream. It felt more like a night cream.Kind of thick, but it absorbs fast. The smell is light but goes away quickly. My skin stayed moist all day. I don't think it has done anything to firm my skin but the moisture has helped plump up some wrinkles on my forehead and I am hoping with continued use more wrinkles will lessen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used the L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream for two weeks, and I'm not very impressed. It didn't seem to do anything and didn't seem to soke into my skin leaving it pretty oily. I was sad about thing because I e been using this L'Oreal product line and I love them all, except the L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very impressed with the LOreal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Cream. From the first till today (3 weeks now) Smell is pleasant, look of packaging and jar is appealing and absorbs effortlessly into my skin. My face and neck with out a doubt feel smoother and firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream was a great surprise! I am in my mid 40's and have started to notice that the skin on my neck and upper chest has started to show some age. This product has really improved the look of that skin (even if it is really for the face/neck) in a short amount of time! It is a medium thickness and is really smooth going on. It absorbs quickly and does a great job. There was no noticeable scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this faithfully, morning and night. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream has a nice feel to it, is not at all greasy. I must say it seems to be firming up the area under my chin, and the lines on my neck are much less noticeable. Someone recently asked if I had any ""work"" done - I never have. Obviously the difference is noticeable, I hope with continued use this will make even more of a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i love this product so much. i was really nervous that it would sting or be too thick,and i was so pleasantly surprised. it has such a lovely scent,and such a nice texture,that it feels like it belongs in a high end department store. it absorbed very quickly into my skin and it feels very indulgent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Day 14 and I see improvement. Very happy with the results. My face feels great. It's not dry and itchy like it usually is. My face feels tighter but not in a dry way. My foundation glides on my face. It really says something when you can use 3 separate products one after the other and it doesn't feel like you have layers of gunk on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my first time trying a face and neck cream. I'm only in my early thirties, so I never payed to much attention to my neck area. This cream has a great texture, perfect for the neck area. I do feel this cream hydrates well as for the firming affect I believe it will help me keep my skin nice and firm with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product works well but I don't think it had much effect on me. I didn't end up seeing a big difference with my neck area, but that could just be me. Overall it's a good product that smells good and applies easily. I probably won't keep using this product at the moment, but may keep it handy if I decide to give it another try later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So happy with RevitaLift anti wrinkle and firming facial day cream. My skin looks and feels so moisturized . The lines and creases have plumped up and I feel great. The funny thing is that I actually feel more confident. I guess I was more self conscience that I realized.my daughter ( in pic with me ) noticed my skins improvement and mentioned it to me as well. Thanks RevitaLift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't expecting the results that I see so soon. I'm pleasantly surprised how well this product works. The scent isn't overwhelming and the texture is so creamy. I'm really surprised because my face pores isn't as pronounced as before and I wasn't expecting that added bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It feels smooth going on and feels light on your skin. Does not leave skin greasy which is great! Has a slight tingle so you can feel it working. My skin looks better after 3 weeks of use and box says results in as little as 4 weeks. Will definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I decided that being a more mature woman and grandmother, I did not really want to look old and full of wrinkles. I decided to try the Loreal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Face and Neck Cream. I have been using this in conjunction with Loreal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Day Cream. I have been very happy with the results I have been seeing by using these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neck cream is not something that I have used in the past and was interested in trying a new product. I thought that the consistency of the lotion was perfect, not too greasy and left my skin soft. The smell was pleasant and not too strong. In researching the product purpose, I don't think it is something I need to be using at this point which is why I don't feel as though I saw ""results"". However, it is a product I will use in the future as I believe there are benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product and not just on my face and neck. Being in my late 40's I have started to get the cleavage wrinkles. I used this not just on my face and neck but also on my cleavage and have seen a big improvement there. It smells good and is light and not too greasy. It's also easy on the pocketbook! Will definitely be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not quite sure if its for me. it dried my skin out instead of moisturized it. however, my roommate tried it and she absolutely lovea it. that why the 4 stars. it might just be my skin type and time of year cuz usually I love their products. bummer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The directions stated to apply this cream to your neck and jaw line to help to smooth fine lines and contour the area. I was hesitant at first, wondering if this step was really necessary. However, I have seen a significant improvement in the smoothness of my neck and jawline. This cream looks and smells just as nice as the other creams in this line but it is a bit richer so I wouldn't use it all over my face, just on the jaw and neck. Overall, a very nice effective product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given a sample of RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream to try through BzzAgent. I've not used the cream a lot, have only had it a few weeks. I have noticed it's a thick, smooth cream that goes on nicely, absorbs quickly and isn't greasy. It claims to tighten skin after repeated use. I haven't seen that yet, but again, haven't been using the cream more than a couple of weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just love the RevitaLift face and neck cream. It absorbs quickly, isn't greasy and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. I have combnation skin and it works great for me under makeup or even if I choose to go without makeup for the day my skin still looks great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to admit I am bad about remembering to take care of hydrating the neck and underneath the jawline. Because these areas were so neglected, it was very easy to quickly see the impact of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream. It absorbed super fast, like my skin was really craving it. I don't think my neck has looked better since I was a teenager, and my jawline definitely seems firmed up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used it for a few days. I am not seeing any changes yet. My skin still looks the same. I don't have any problems with it either. I'll keep using it and see if my skin will be firmer after a month of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to try this free sample. I used it in combination with the rest of the regime. I'm not sure if I have noticed a visible difference yet but my neck feels softer and moisturized. I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product. I'm definitely going to keep using it and hopefully I'll see some improvements over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Two weeks have gone by since I started using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream in the morning and at night. The cream is light and goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly. I see some good firming of the skin on my neck and am anxious to see further results after more usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product seemed to give a tightness to my skin, It wasn't drying but seemed to be more firming than the L'Oreal Facial Day Crème SPF18 which seemed to be more moisturizing. I did find it to give my skin a tighter appearance while not over drying. It has a nice light smell also. All in all this is a good product for those of you who are looking for a tighter, firmer appearance to your face & neck areas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The thickness of this cream was great! I really felt like it soaked into my skin without feeling greasy . I applied it both at night and in the morning and really loved it. My skin is starting to show wrinkles on my forehead and I really felt that this plumped up my skin and made those wrinkles less noticeable. A little bit of cream goes a long way which I also love. Overall, this was a great product and I would continue to use this cream both morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream made my neck and jaw feel super smooth. I don't have too many wrinkles in that area (yet!) so I can not comment on wrinkle reducing in this area, however I will continue to use this product for the skin softening benefits! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt a burning sensation on my face when I applied around my eyes. It also smelled overly floral and unnecessarily scented. All moisturizers for the face should have NO SCENT AND MINIMAL INGREDIENTS. I would never buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed rubbing this on my neck and chest before bed. I woke up with noticeable smoother skin after the first use. If you have dry skin on your neck or just want a product that will keep you youthful as ever give this a go. Not only is this product extremely affordable but it is a very large container and isn't in a tube or bottle so you truly get every last bit. I'm looking forward to continuing to use this product and have even convinced my mother to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i have a weight issue so i tried the firming face and neck contour cream to help with my neck area and i was pretty pleased with the out come. it did not do any thing drastic but it did hydrate and plump up my skin. there again the only thing bad i have to say is i dont care for the smell but i can over look that because of how well it works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that the face and neck cream was great. I usually have issues with oiliness and my face breaking out from lotions, but I didn't have that problem with revitalift. It has a pleasant smell, and I noticed some firming . I actually don't mind using it daily and actually look forward to it. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using it a few days and have not seen any type of difference from before I started use. I do think it's too early to see a difference though. I really like that it goes on smooth, and it does not make my skin oily. Hope to see changes by the time I finish the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Cream is a good product, I did like the way it moisturized, was not greasy, a really good product , but just not sure about using it after the facial day cream when either product to me seemed to work about the same.

I thought the Loreal revitalift face and neck cream was a great product. I noticed smoother skin within a couple of days of using it. As I kept using it my skin felt firmer too. I love using this face and neck cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never thought much about using a firming/contouring cream, but I was interested in giving this cream a try. I've been apply it every morning under my makeup and I've noticed that my foundation does seem to go on smoother and not settle into the creases. The only negative is it works too well in keeping my face hydrated. My the end of the day, my face feels more oily than normal. For those with oily skin, apply sparingly.

"At my age, 63, I can use all the help I can get so I'm always looking for something that has firming abilities, especially for my neck. I've been using this firming face and neck cream for close to three weeks now. I will continue to use this luscious, thick and creamy Goddess cream, morning and night as I'm already seeing results. L'Oreal Revitalift Anti-wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream is a winner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The RevitaLift Firming Face and Neck Contour Cream was my least favorite of the products I tried. It was heavier and greasier than the other products and made my skin break out. I have never used a face and neck contour cream before so maybe that is part of the problem. I ended up giving this to my husband and it made his skin break out too. This one didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only been using it for a few weeks, and I see actual improvement! It mostly has improved the skin quality of my face, and I can visually see that my wrinkles have been reduced a little bit. I don't look like I'm 16 again, but it has helped my skin look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not sure I saw the results I thought I would, I tend to have a normal skin type, t-zone oily, and it tended to make that super greasy and especially my cheeks! I did however LOVE the way it made my neck! Firmy? Maybe.....but it was super smooth (I don't have a tonew of neck wrinkles) Worth a try....not sure I'll buy for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not so sure if the wrinkles are going away but my skin feels softer andnot so dry and cracked. I know its a 4 week formula and when used everyday will show if uts really working or not. I havent used it quite tht ling but just the change in my skin feel makes it worth it. There hasnt been a greasy feeling, no excess acne, and im not allergic which is great i have tried similar products and was allergic to them from the first use! So this may just work for me!

"When I received the firming neck and face contour cream, I have to be honest, I wasn't sure why I would need a special cream for this. Even so, I decided to give it a try. I haven't really noticed anything different and I'm still unsure as to why I would need this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love having a special cream to moisturize and firm my jawline, neck and décolletage. These areas are usually neglected but are often the first to show signs of aging. This is a perfect cream for those areas and it feels wonderful. I've already noticed a softening in the creases on my neck and chest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have dry/oily skin combo and this moisturizer is not only light but great at keeping my face nice and supple throughout the day. When I need sun protection, I'll apply the SPF version right on top and it's still not too heavy. Works great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin and it gets even worse with the weather becoming more and more dry. I used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour cream for about 1 week and I can honestly say, it worked for me. My skin no longer looks flakey. It also makes my makeup look more natural and less flakey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a fantastic product. Feels great. Smells wonderful. Goes on and absorbs like a dream. Face is smoother and softer. Can tell a difference in the firmness already. This is a home run. Definitely will be buying from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I hadn't really thought about my neck and chest area as needing to be firmer as my attention is always on my face. However, after only a few days of using the cream I noticed my neck looking better! It was definitely firmer and I would say it almost looked like I had lost weight. I hadn't been using anything specific for the neck so moisturization alone may be responsible for some of the change. I've kept using it and I feel it really is making my neck look much better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After getting in the daily routine of using these products, I started noticing a difference in my skin and I loved it. My skin was softer, firmer and appeared brighter than it ever did before. I would totally recommend anyone to use these products and even better, it doesn't take a whole lot of cream each use so it lasts a lot longer for your money!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a hard time finding products that don'the leave my skin feeling very oily, but this product was great. It felt amazing when I put it on. It felt very lite weight but after just a few minutes you could feel the difference. The moisture levels are equivalent to a heavy cream without the heaviness.

Just got my sample today and I love it!! Cream is just right thickness to nourish skin without using a large amount. Scent is refreshing leaving you feel freshened. Lotion is creamy and rubs into skin easily and does not leave a greasy feeling. Skin feels nourished/revitalized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I noticed a smoother texture and maybe some slight firming. Someone asked me yesterday what I am doing different with my skin, yay! I believe the word that was used was flawless. I will be buying this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm getting closer to 40 so now is the time to start a good habit with face creams. I really like this neck cream. A little goes a long way and I don't feel like it leaves your skin feeling greasy. I've been using it twice a day so I'm hoping it will show some improvement soon. The smell of it isn't terrible (nothing to mark the rating down for) but I wish there were different scents but that is just me. Overall I really like the product and will most likely buy it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a good moisurizer. I didn't have a chance to use it long enough to notice any firming, but I did notice it moisturizer my skin. I am not crazy about the smell, but I am pregnant and have super sensitive smell. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been trying the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream for a couple weeks now, I really liked its a creamy smooth texture with a light fragrance. I didn't notice it doing anything for my neck and face area, no improved elasticity or firmness... I did not like that when you would put it on later in the day if you rubbed your face it kinda flaked or peeled off your face like dead skin, that was a very unpleasant feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed getting to try this moisturizer; it was light and non-greasy but kept my skin feeling smooth and hydrated all day. I did not receive the sample in time to test the product for a full four weeks, so while I cannot evaluate the efficacy of the anti-wrinkle and firming properties this product claims to have, I intend to continue using it as part of my daily routine. Would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very much pleased with this product - and the other creams of RevitaLift. While I only used it for about 10 days, I think I saw a bit of a difference. My skin seemed to feel smoother and I only used a small dab of the cream. Once this bottle runs out, I will most likely go out and buy another one. A very nice product, especially if you are starting to have problem with sagging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Coutour Cream and I love it! It is smooth going on and does not leave a greasy feeling.

I love this product! I have seen a difference in my neck since using this. It is not oily. I use it in the morning and in the evening. I would definitely recommend it to someone and will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is decent moisturizing cream - my skin felt soft, and I really enjoyed that part of it. It didn't really have a whole lot of effect on skin tightness, even after 2.5 weeks of using it every day. Additionally, the scent of this lotion is just... not my style. It reminds me of the lotions my mom and grandmother used, and just smells gross. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks now, but I am completely in love. I have really noticed the loose skin on my neck area has a lot less elasticity to it. I think I've taken a good 5-10 years off my face/neck in just 2 weeks. I can't wait to see how great I look after 4 weeks! Definitely a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like using this along with the night cream from the same line. As this product contains ration-A, it does make my skin clearer and younger. So you gonna try it if you have acne or you are having wrinkles. It is a light cream that is very easy to absorb. products contains ration-a [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that this is made for your face and neck. It feels a little greasy when you are putting it on but that goes away quickly! You are left with smooth moisturized skin. I felt like I had an invisible layer of protection on my face all day. After a few uses I can definitely see a difference in the firmness of my face and neck.

I don't usually use specific cream or lotion for neck as I use sky regular face neck up to my neck but this cream from L'Oreal is amazing as I see good results. My skin from my neck down to my shoulder and upper chest are smoother and tighter than it used to. The smell is really good and I love it as it easibly absorbs by the skin. I recommend this product to all and apply cream to your neck and back and shoulder to have an even flawless skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this cream for the last few weeks and I have noticed that my skin does seem firmer and less fine lines on my neck. I like how smooth the cream goes on and does not have a strong smell. I have been using this cream as part of my night time routine along with Anti Wrinkle + Firming eye cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Like the other creams in the RevitaLift line, the scent is wonderfully refreshing. This face and neck cream really moisturizes the skin to make it feel soft and smoother without a greasy or heavy feeling. I highly recommend this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for two weeks and am surprisingly pleased at the noticeable tightening of the skin on my neck area. This product absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue to absorb into my clothing. I look forward to seeing more amazing results over the next two weeks. If you have the beginnings of a wrinkly neck area, give this product a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my first time using a product specifically for my neck, but I'm at that age that I needed to address this area. After 2 weeks of use this product helped my neck skin to be hydrated and not appear as crepey looking. I use it on my jaw line where it is softening a line under my chin, I smooth it right down to my decollette for added anti-aging benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream . I put it on before my makeup. It is creamy and makes my skin supple. It is light and never feels greasy. It improves the texture and look of my skin. No more turkey neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle & firming face/neck contour cream is awesome. It goes on creamy, yet absorbs quickly. It feels great and is not sticky or itchy. I see great improvement in the couple weeks that I have been using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have purchased products for my eyes, my face, etc. I never really thought to purchase a product for my neck, but it does make sense. I was excited to try this out. I'm now 36 and therefore more interested in finding the right skincare routine. I did notice it made my skin feel better and look more moisturized. At the price point it is at I would definitely repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this cream. I have been using it morning & night for 2 weeks. My skin is firmer and less dry. This is a great moisturizer. I use it before putting on my makeup and it doesn't make my face oily. Thumbs up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this cream because it goes on so easily and doesn't feel greasy after it's been applied. I have not used any kind of product before that is specifically used for this area of the body. My skin feels smoother and firmer in my neck area. Using the neck area cream was a very pleasant surprise and I know I definitely will purchase RevitaLift Firming Face/Neck cream in the future.

"I don't have many wrinkles on my neck so I think this is a good product to use for preventative care as I am getting older. I have been applying this to my neck two times a day, at morning and at night. My skin is feeling a lot softer than normal and it feels very hydrated. This cream has a nice subtle smell and it isn't overpowering like other creams. I am looking forward to seeing more results as I continue to use this product.

"Since receiving the loreal product line revitalift with anti-wrinkle and firming Face and neck contour cream , I have been using it every day . I love that it does not feel greasy there's no strong odor and it goes on smooth. I use it with the 4 step line and I'm loving the results . I feel better using this versus other products I have tried in the past . The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 I really wish it came in a pump or squeeze tube .

I have very sensitive and dry skin and as soon as I put this cream on my skin feels so much better! Also I have lost 70 lbs and my skin was very loose and saggy and now more people are complimenting me on how good I look wish I would have taken before pictures!

"Although I don't have any wrinkles , this product I find is a great product for skin moisturizing. I like the jar it comes in and the smell. I like that you can apply it to your faces we'll as your neck as a daily moisturizer. I also think the price is a reasonable and affordable price . This product also have SPF 18 Sunscreen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I am of a ""certain age"" I do like to try products that might help with wrinkles and firming of my face and neck. Went on smoothly and hydrated my skin but the wrinkles never did get any better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the face/neck cream, I must say, I am satisfied. After Turing 40, I've noticed more of a ""turkey neck"" and that was a concern. Of course, a cream can't work miracles, but I do feel like from the front view, my chin and neck appear more streamlined, possibly also from the side. I'll continue to use the cream for a month or so, to see if I continue to notice results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the smell of the cream and love how it feel on my skin after apply it. Does not leave my skin feeling sticky it feels so smooth and soft. I do not even notice I have put it on after I apply it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried thick cream for three weeks. Visually I must say I did not see much difference. I think I will have to use it a bit more to see results. It was very creamy and it had a musky man smell to it that I liked. I saw no lift or tightness in my neck or jawline. I will keep trying it and maybe it will start forming up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the product for the last two weeks, and out of all the Revital Lift products I have been trying I can actually say I am not the biggest fan of this product. I have not noticed any difference in my neck jawline area. It does keep my skin from drying out but I don't like how it does not have any SPF. Its just ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this cream for a few weeks and am hoping it will help reduce neck wrinkles as the weeks go on. The cream is best put on at night because it tends to be thick and then has all night to work. One of the better neck creams I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream is a product like no other. Have been using for two weeks now along with RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream, RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream and RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream, my face looks younger, refreshed and ready to take on the world! The packaging is simple and easy to use, goes on non greasy and leaves my skin feeling velvety smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high hopes for this cream. But for the duration of time that I used it, I saw absolutely no change. The texture and smell were fine. It did leave my skin feeling slightly greasy as well. I think it would serve someone with dry skin better than someone with naturally oily skin, like myself. I was not impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Thanksgiving my neck won't be on the chopping block this year! Thanks to Loreal Revitalift Face and Neck Contour, no more turkey neck. See, Loreal has identified B natural lifters that are present in the skin that work together to give skin its youthful appearance. Firming while it lifts!

"This is a decent face and neck cream. I actually preferred it to the day cream because it has no SPF. It has a powdery scent, which I'm not a huge fan of. I would have preferred something unscented. It feels a bit heavy and tacky on the skin, but provides moisture. I've only used it for a couple weeks so I cannot speak to the firming effects, but it seems to be a nice cream that I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think using this cream was the best move ever. Sure, I love the face cream and the eye cream, but this is my fav! I have a double chin that is very noticeable in pictures, ugh. After using this cream for a week I noticed my skin on my neck was more firm. I'm floored! Now, it's not a miracle worker, but it does help! Sure, my double chin is still there, but less noticeable. Hallelujah! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using the day and night creams for 4 days. In that time, I have seen a drastic improvement in my complexion. The texture of the night cream is a little thick for my liking. It seems to take more to cover my face than the day cream does. My face also seems to be a little more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this cream simultaneously with the Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18. I've had great results with that cream and this one is no different. Just like the day cream the face/neck cream goes on smoothly and doesn't leave any greasy or oily feeling afterwards. I can't imagine not continuing to use the face/neck cream as well as the day cream for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream is awesome. I do not have wrinkles yet but I like my face and neck to feel firm and fresh.

"I was very excited about this neck cream, as I've got some sun damage in the form of redness and wrinkles from summers in the sun. This cream, while it did make my neck feel softer, didn't do much to lessen the appearance of redness or wrinkles. I only used it on my neck, so I can't say what it does for the face. The smell, like most of the other products in this line, leaves much to be desired. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream at night before bed for several weeks. At 35, I don't have many wrinkles yet but I feel like this may have helped get a start on what could be an issue in a few years time. The cream is a little heavy which is why I opted for using it at night before bed. It doesn't have a bad smell to it and spreads on easily and is not greasy. I would just say a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Trying out a new face product routine. I'm loving the lightness of this cream. It leaves my face so soft and smooth. Using it help provide a little extra help to my skin. I've gotten sun damage on my left side that I'm trying to reduce. Doesn't help that those pesky wrinkles are starting to make and appearance. It's been a week and I have no problems with any of the products. The cream also provides sunblock protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was having some sagging skin on my neck and was very self conciuos. After a few days of using the neck contour cream, I noticed a difference. Im on my second week and am very pleased at what its doing for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using the neck and face cream since I got it. It works great. Doesn't have much of a smell. Which I really like. Has no oily feeling. It's definitely tighting my face and neck. Leaves my skin soft. My grandkids rub my face now and say you feel soft Nana. I wasn't sure about it working at first but the more I used it in could see and feel a difference.

"In just 11 days I have noticed the skin on my neck tightening, meaning less wrinkles- yeah! The cream goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely into the skin. This leaves my neck feeling soft and silky. I look forward to even younger looking skin in the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have many wrinkles per se, but I recently lost a lot of weight, so my chin tends to sag a bit and this definitely is helping tighten it up. I have only been using it for about a week and I feel like I can already see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. So easy to use. Goes on so easy and smooth. Just take a little product goes a long way. Only takes just a couple of minutes to apply. Doesn't have a strong odor, very nice. I have noticed a change in my neck and face area. I look forward to using the product in the future. The jar is the perfect size, fits right in the palm of your hand. Jar is very easy to open. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the Revitalift face/neck Contour cream. Wow, the cream is silky smooth,not greasy...and absorbs quickly on your skin. It gives your face an amazing glow. Im in love with this cream. It smells light and fresh. Definitely a must have now for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product! It has only been a three day's and I can see and feel the results. My skin is smoother already. A little bit of cream does a long way. It's Non-greasy like stated on the product and leaves a wonderful glistening shine all day long. I have looked foward to waking up and putting this cream on every morning the past few days. Can't wait to see the results in the next few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not exactly sure what the purpose is for a neck cream. To be honest, I don't normally moisturize my neck. Haven't really found a need to I guess. After trying it for a little over a week, I haven't really noticed a difference. Still the same great feel and smell though. I use it but probably wouldn't buy it on my own. I think the day cream works just as well. In fact, I may just save this and use it as a face cream when my day cream runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream every day since I received it. I just love the feel of this cream, it is so luxurious. Once applied it isn't at all greasy. It makes my skin feel smoother and tighter. I am just loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did like this revitalift face and neck. I feel as if you use the revitalift anti wrinkle +firming cream that the face/neck cream is not a necessary step. This product can be used for a woman in the way earlier stage of aging and can transition into the wrinkle/firming cream later on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Like a lot of women, I have never given much thought to moisturizing my neck (face yes, neck no). I have been developing a ""wattle"" underneath my chin for several years. After using the Revitalift Firming Face and Neck Cream, I can already see a slight improvement after one week. Can't wait to see the improvement after the recommended 4 weeks! Definitely recommend this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Does not smell or break out your skin. Makes your skin feel a little firm like the Anti Wrinkle ingredients are working. I believe it has worked nicely on my neck but might take a little longer for my face. The pic. is my neck [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not so sure about the neck cream. I haven't seen any change. This could be due to the fact that the skin on my neck is still fairly tight. I did find the neck cream to be a bit sticky on my neck, after its applied. I might have to come back to this cream in a few years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very pleasant scent and it was the perfect creamy texture, not too runny or too thick my neck is kind of thick and has deep creases really felt like this is going to help with that... plus can also use it on your face so that's always nice too. I am very pleased with this and gladly add it to my collection of beauty must haves! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would be lying if I told you I did not grab this one first and rub it all over my face and neck. I really enjoy the light scent and the refreshing way my skin feels after I have applied it. It feels so great in fact that I bought a bottle for my office too for that afternoon pick me up. The fact that it firms my 50 year old skin is just one more reason to give this product a try.

"I'm such a skeptic. I never dreamed this cream would work and asked to try it just to make a point. Oops....I failed. This cream made my face and neck feel so soft and smooth and even those little lines called wrinkles are starting to fade away. I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much for making a non-skeptic out of me. Who knew? Well, I do now!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt like the L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream is almost the same thing as their Day Cream and I do not notice any different after using it. It feels like cheap hand lotion and does not smell very pleasant. My skin was slightly softer after using it but I noticed no other effects from this cream.

"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream for 7 day. This product is a lightweight moisturizer that I used on my neck area only. Unfortunately, this product caused my neck and lower chin to break out a bit. I did use it for a full 7 days to see if it would indeed give my neck area a lift. I did note a slight difference in the contour of my neck area. If not for the skin break out, I would continue using to see what more time would reveal .

I am a very big fan of this product line makes my skin super soft. The smell is pleasing and it doesn't feel greasy like all other lines. I am 46 and am starting to get that little under the chin thingy I dreaded so this is my new superhero cream. I will apply it religiously. So far it seems to be working well.

"I have been searching for a neck cream to use since I turned 35 I noticed creases in my neck and visible signs of aging. I'm so glad I tried RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Countour Cream! This stuff is amazing! I really like that this cream is not greasy at all. It absorbs into your skin leaving it soft and moisturized. After 3 weeks of use, I'm already seeing results with the crease lines in my neck looking less visible.

"In just 3 short weeks I already have noticeable changes. The contour areas are tighter and softer then ever. This is a great product. There is no odor, this product actually has a pleasant smell.

"Well so far I have used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anit Wrinkle+Neck Contour Cream 3 times. I have been happy with the odor, which is light and not chemically smelling like some products I have tried. The cream is easy to smooth over the skin and I have not felt a ""greasy"" feeling afterward. That is one of the thinks I like the most. My skin seems to soak it up. My skin feels a little smoother. I am anxious to see if my skin will look more supple after a little more use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Worthy product! I have tried so many of these....I have lost count. This product will produce results beyond belief!! No more under circle lines by my eyes! It actually lasted the entire night!! Please consider this product! I know I will! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Once again, I find these line of L'Oreal anti-aging creams tend to be thick and oily. I don't mind it too much on this particular product, when used by night, but it didn't help my oily T zone during the day. I still think is a good product. I really like the smell of it and if it helps prevent aging, I take it. I liked using it on the neck, where the oiliness wasn't a problem at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel like my skin is happier since using this daily. It is light enough to wear under makeup if you choose or perfect to apply and go. Pleasant light fragrance. This is silky feeling without being greasy - I have no shine after using like I get with other product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for approximately 14 days. I'm 46 years old and I normally don't use a neck contour cream but I have been using this and the product goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way. I really don't see much difference but my neck area does seem to be softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I ve always had a double chin with a bit of neck flab! Nothing would work until I tried Revitalift Anti Wrinkle/ Neck Contour Cream! It goes on so smooth with no heavy scent...that's a Plus! After using this for a week my neck started feeling firmer and less noticeable by others! My cheeks seem to be smoother and more pronounced. I really like this cream. I will be using this from now on and will be telling my friends about it! Thanks Revitalift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using Loreal RevitaLiftAntiWrinkle + FirmingFace/Neck Cream Contour Cream for nearly two weeks now, I have noticed a visible difference.

I love using all the products and am looking forward to the long term results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the entire system though the face and neck cream was my favorite. Thick and rich going on it quickly absorbed and left my skin feeling soft and supple. I have never been more impressed by a skin care line. Anyone looking for a complete system would be happy with this one. A little goes a long way with each product. There is also just a adolescent, pleasant but not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
WOW this is one of the greatest products I have ever tried and trust me I have been using products for many years but this one was immediate satisfaction and was very noticeable for everyone around me. my sister again wanted to keep some and I wasn't parting with even a small amount I let her try mine and wrote down the names so she could go out and buy her own I love her but this stuff is that good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product as I felt like it brightened up my face after use. It is a little thicker so you don't need much of it each time. It wasn't clear how it was to use be used so I had to look it up and see if I used it on top of the other cream or when i should use it. I did use it once under my CC cream and I noticed it took longer for my CC cream to try as a result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the RevitaLift Firming Face/Neck Cream on my neck and chest nightly for a week, and am very impressed so far with this product! The cream is very rich, applies easily and absorbs completely. There is no obnoxious scent. I have never tried a neck cream - didn't really see any point in it - well, I have seen the light !! My skin actually looks younger - so smooth and bright - I like using this cream - this will be part of my on-going routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always been told I looked younger than my age of 58, but my neck has been a problem area. I have tried several other more expensive products with minimum or no results. I do believe I have seen some firming in the neck area with use of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using this product for 6 days now. I like the way it makes my skin feel-it's softer. It has a light soft fragrance but it seems to be a bit heavier when you put it on- it takes a little longer to smooth it in your skin. I haven't noticed any firming of the skin yet, maybe that will come with longer use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Cream is a great product! I have been using it daily to reduce my wrinkles and firm my skin which is needed as we age on our face and neck. The cream feels great on my skin and keeps it hydrated for 24 hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this product. In a weeks time it has made a complete difference to my face. My skin is so smooth and hydrated. I walk around telling my coworkers to feel my face. It is a non-greasy lotion that rubs in very easily. I enjoy the light fragrance that it has. I will continue to purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My 66 year old mother reaped the benefits of a sleek lift. The contour cream did as it stated it gave a lift and I know she is truly happy with her results. We used this product in a numbered order nightly so her face was slighty damp, result may very but I have to say, ""You need a lift?"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very pleased with this product. As I've grown older and lost weight, I noticed more and more wrinkles in my neck which made me look even older. After using this product for just two weeks, I can already tell a difference. I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had never used a night cream before (mostly because I assumed a normal moisturizer worked just as effectively) and after just a few days of using this I noticed my skin was much more softer and smoother to the touch. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy after I have applied it. I also see that my skin has firmed up and I feel more comfortable with little to no makeup on. I would definitely recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for 1 week and I actually think I am starting to see a little bit of a difference. It is a pretty thick cream that is a little more difficult to smooth on, but it is an awkward place to put cream so that might play into the difficulty. The cream is very rich, but not greasy. There is not an overwhelming smell. I'm pleased with this cream and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've noticed that my face and neck are starting to look less dry, more firm and I have gotten several compliments since I started using the Face/Neck Contouring cream. It's a very nice, smooth product. The price point is a little high and I think it could use a little adjusting. But over all, the scent and ingredients are spot on for the product. I'm seeing results and people are as well. Job done, Thanks Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This might have more to do with my age, but I didn't see my neck becoming more firm as I have been using this product. I have seen my eye area becoming less wrinkled and more firm. Overall it seems to be doing minimal change, but being only 30 I don't have many wrinkles to start with. Also, I am honestly unsure if this is a necessary step in the system because the night and day cream are also being used [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was great! I used it every day. I loved the was it smelled and how smooth it made my skin feel. My skin has not been this soft in a long time. It made my face feel good like I didn't have anything on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I must admit that this was my first experience with a designated face/neck contour cream. My neck is definitely appearing firmer, less wrinkled, and feels much more moisturized. I only wish I had been aware of such a product earlier. It seems to me that a woman's neck is very revealing as to her age. This would be a product high on my list of recommendations to friends.

"I was extremely eager when I received the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream; I had been considering buying it. So far, I am very satisfied with the product.

"I started using the Face/Neck firming cream two days ago. Soft and smooth texture, easy to apply , does not feel heavy on the skin. Retinol is a great anti-aging addition to any skin regimen, as I was told by my dermatologist. I anticipate the two big lines on my neck to start diminishing soon.

Love using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream! It goes on smoothly and feels luxurious. It doesn't cause breakouts or redness on my sensitive skin.

"I have tried the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream about 1 week ago and so far it seems too early to tell if it has made much of a difference.

"I have always had combination skin on my face and I was afraid creams and lotions would make my skin more oily and worsen blemishes.

I've noticed the skin on my neck is not as wrinkled and a little more firm which is pretty good considering I've only used it for a short time. Will continue to us and hope to see even more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this product to be too greasy and scented. I only used it on my neck which is an okay place to have a scent but my face is not a place I want people to notice a scent! Maybe because my neck doesn't have many wrinkles I didn't see a difference in appearance, but I recommend passing on this product and using a face cream that is less greasy and less scented. The one positive thing is though greaser than my liking, I did not breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok, so I am guilty of forever having ignored my neck. I seriously have NEVER moisturized my neck until this product and now I realize I have been missing out. I had some pretty obvious creases in my neck and I actually do notice an immediate firming with this product. I will definitely be buying it again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have any complaints regarding this product but I am unsure if it doesn't something beyond what the day or night cream on that are would provide. I didn't feel or see anything different with this product than I think I would have just extending the use of the day or night cream down along my neck. Yes, it moisturizer and left my skin soft but I'm not sure it is unique in that regard? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"From day one i noticed a difference in how smooth my skin is now. The cream itself is Very light weight, couldn't tell I had any on, noticed immediately how soft muy skin was it literally was smooth like a baby's bottom. Haven't used it a whole month yet but I have noticed my skin is smoother, brighter and firmer. Would def use this full time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited to try out this firming neck cream but unfortunately yet have seen any noticeable improvements. I haven't given up on this product yet because it probably just takes some time. Aside from that is a great moisturizer for your neck and it isn't greasy. The scent is barely noticeable which is good. Overall a good product that has potential. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I received this I won't lie I wasn't that excited. The packaging is beautiful. The cream goes on smoothly and smells good. I've been wearing it for about a week and I'm pretty sure there is a bit of improvement. I'm reserving judgement, but I think this may be a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream. It is so thick, but it absorbs easily without leaving me feeling oily. It has a pleasant scent that does not irritate me. I do experience some tingling on my face after applying this, but it isn't painful nor does it make me break out. I have yet to nice any firming in my neck in the two weeks since starting this, but I will continue with it because I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Firming Face/Neck Cream is very light and non-greasy. I applied it after my shower and found that it is quickly absorbed. There is a nice silky feel and a great preparation for foundation. It did not make my pores feel clogged. I would include this in my daily routine with foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that this line has a face/neck cream not just a night and day cream. It's nice that they have a product just for that area. The texture is thinner and not super thick. I like that it goes on well without too much work and lasts throughout the day or night. I think it has made the area smoother. I like that the products have helped the texture of my skin without making it too oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a very smooth cream. I love how thick it is, you don't need a lot and your skin will thank you. I've only used this about a week but already my neck feels softer (skin wise) but much firmer and looks great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say I had my doubts, but after using this product for a week it is doing its job. My neck is firmer and I do notice fewer wrinkles. I would definitely would recommend you try this out, you wont be disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This neck cream has become a nightly routine for me. it goes on so easy, the smell is very pleasant and it is not slippery or greasy feeling. My neck feels softer and less dry from the few weeks I have been using it already! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this on my neck and my face, it does not irritate my skin, and is very light weight, you do not need to use a lot of it, I was getting bad wrinkles on my neck from tanning so much, and since using this , they have decreased, I put my makeup on after I use this and go on with my day with no problems . Very good price on this as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel that this neck cream really is seriously smooth and relieves dryness. It goes on so smoothly and because of the texture it feels as though i have great coverage and it really moisturizes my neck area. I am not sure how effective it will be but because it has such a great texture and it has not caused any irritation I will continue to use it and see what happens. So far so good.

"Anti Wrinkle + firming face contour cream, This cream is a thicker cream and works well on a dry neck. It smooths the skin and leaves it soft. It go on the face and the neck nice and is not grease feeling. My neck and face still feel soft even it I do not have the cream on. The scent is a little to strong for me in all the creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love all my options but I'm not sure about this one. Why the extra? Can I not get the same benefits from the daily with SPF and the night cream? I have been using this on my neck and chest at night and in the morning and they look great, just not sure why I need another product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of the best moisturizers I have tried so far. My skin tends to be on the dry side and this helps with moisture. It is a white silky creme that absorbs quickly. It has a light, nice fragrance to it. So far no adverse reaction..Very good product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this a couple of times so far but I can't seem to tell a difference between this and the other moisturizer. I probably would just buy the day cream over this one but I don't have a lot of wrinkles on my neck yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the creaminess of the product. It is thicker than other facial creams I have used in the past, however, the product just seems to sit on my face. It isn't easily absorbed by my skin, and I do tend to have drier skin. I haven't seen any anti-aging (wrinkles, firming) results from the product after a week of use. I think the fact that the cream isn't absorbed into my skin would prevent me from wanting to purchase this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this cream for 7 days I have noticed a marked difference in the lines on my neck and my skin is firming up nicely. It has a non-greasy feel to it and the smell is quite pleasant, reminding me of my grandparents and even great-grandparents and the face creams they would use, though with these added benefits. Definitely would recommend the Face and Neck Contour Cream to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I seen a lot of older people that their neck looks 20 years older than their face and I have always thought there should be a product that helps you neck age as well as your face. I think I have found it! Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't really know how a cream is supposed to contour my skin but it does leave it feeling very soft and even seems to help out in evening my skin tone as for firmer I think I'll have to wait longer to see but is a nice smelling cream with no irritation for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the firming face/neck contour cream for about a week now. I really like that the cream is moisturizing. I have not seen any visible changes to my neck, but I do like that the cream is lighter and doesn't seem heavy when putting on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using skin care products recommended by a skin care clinic out of a doctor's office. However, I have never had a cream specific to the jaw and neck area. I love this cream. It feels very nice going on and leaves this area feeling very nice. I can't say wheter it firms the jaw and neck, since I have only been using the product about a week. But I like it enough to continue to use it. I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used a face cream before. Have only used 3 days, but I like it. Not highly scented, not greasy-does not change the appearance of my make up, and no breakouts..,,the 3 things I was concerned about. Most of my wrinkles appear around my eyes, but I'm hoping for tighter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've always heard that the part of the body that gets overlooked is the neck. I love that this neck cream is going to relieve some of that aged look and will give that youthful appearance I'm hoping for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is wonderful! I was beginning to see small wrinkles on my face and I also noticed the saggy skin under my chin area. I started using the Revitalift Anti Wrinkle+Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream the day I received it. My skin still has wrinkles but they are not as noticeable and the saggy skin under my chin seems to have firmed up. My skin is smoother and feels softer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has these problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never used a neck cream before and so far I have really enjoyed this product. It has a fresh scent with a creamy texture and is very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. It is not too heavy or greasy at all and I will definitely continue using it to see what type of results I will get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I do love this line of products!! I have been using this one for two weeks now. It has a great texture and consistency and spreads on very easily. I do feel it has made my face seem very greasy under my makeup and kind of uncomfortable. I will keep trying it for the next two weeks to see if that changes and what other changes are in store for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this product. It feels great on my skin and provides a very pleasant scent. It seems to be working well on my face and neck and providing adequate results. I love the rich and creamy consistency of the product. I also love that it doesn't leave your skin greasy or feeling like it is covered in lotion. Overall, an amazing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is pleasantly scented and has a nice smooth creamy feel to it. I haven't used it long enough to say it definitely does what it claims to do but I do know that my face feels smoother. And smells good too! This doesn't make my skin feel like I slathered on a bunch of grease. I am going to continue using this and see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do like how easy this product was to apply to my face, but it left my skin kind of tacky to the touch. I haven't used it long enough to know whether or not it works on wrinkles and to firm up skin, but it does do a good job of moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
my neck is that of a 32 year olds anyway. i do have some fine lines and creases but within 2 weeks i noticed a slight difference. its as if my neck has smoothed out a little more and even feels a little more elasticy. i dont know if this is suppose to be a perk but i have noticed fewer breakouts on my neck as well since i started using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this cream is similar to the night cream. I like it but am not overly impressed by it. The cream is non greasy and rubs in easily. It doesn't cause acne or skin issues in me anyways. I do like that is feels like it really moisturizes my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I know they say you can tell a woman's age by her neck and her hands. I'm always on the hunt for something that is moisturizing that does not feel too thick or greasy, since I have sensitive skin. I think I may have found it!! Most neck creams are usually too thick for my liking and I am only able to use them at night before bed. This cream has a great texture and keeps my neck feeling supple and moisturized!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has only been a week and 2 days since I started using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti wrinkle and firming face and neck contou cream. To be honest it is too early to see any changes. I feel like my face is less oily during the day but as for firmness, no change. I am hoping to see changes once the 4 weeks is up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this everyday for a week now and my skin on my neck is so soft. I love this because I have really sensitive skin and it does not cause me to break out. I will be getting this again when I run out! I love that it smells good and does not leave a greasy feeling. I would highly suggest this product if you need some life back in your skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am sad to say I have neglected taking care of my neck. I can't believe I haven't heard about this product before. This stuff feels so nice and cool when applied. No irritating smell. Best part is it appears my neck and under chin area are a bit tighter and the skin doesn't appear as ""saggy."" I am really enjoying using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Loreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Face/Neck Contour Cream for 7 days. While I don't yet see a difference in the elasticity of my skin, I can definitely feel a difference in the texture of it. My face is softer and remains hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream, because I can feel the tightness around my face and neck. I don't really have wrinkles, but I'm hoping that by using this product I am reducing the amount of wrinkles I will get. What I don't like is the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff is amazing. After only using it for one week I can tell a huge difference in the way my face looks. My makeup goes on better and some of my wrinkles are fading. I have told everyone I know about how amazing this product is! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I can already see the improvement. My whole face just seems to glow from the whole set of RevitaLift Creams. This one is a little less thick then the day and night cream which I liked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I enjoy using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream, I think I've seen the least results with this product (out of the 4 in the kit). Like all the others, this product goes on smooth and is weightless and non-greasy, but I've experience better results with the facial cream, eye cream, and night cream. I plan to continue using the product in its entirely to see what the results are once I've used all of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First I want to mention that I only used the product on my neck, since I also use the day and night facial creams. The cream is very light and non-greasy, probably my favorite quality of the all the RevitaLift products I've tried. The fragrance isn't strong. After only a week of using this product my neck feels so much softer and smoother. In the past I never even thought to moisturize my neck, but I'm enjoying the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I don't usually have sensitive skin this cream ended up causing red splotches on my neck, but they'd end up going away fairly quick. This cream doesn't have a strong scent at all which I think is a huge plus and it doesn't take much to cover your neck and jaw line. Although I haven't used it long, I could see at least a slight difference after just a few uses. I'd highly recommend others to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never used a neck cream before but got this in the mail at a perfect time to start. I am in my 30s and trying to take my skin care routine more seriously. A few days of using this and I can already tell that my skin feels tighter. I will continue to use this product as a preventive care cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the L'Oreal RevitaLift face and neck cream for about two weeks. I love how my skin appears, and feels. My face is supple and smooth, and my neck appears tighter and smoother than prior to using this product. I was skeptical at first, but I have finally found a face and neck cream that I will absolutely use on a daily basis, and with confidence. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream. This is my problem area, and it seems to be working. My neck and chest area look firmer to me....keeping my fingers crossed it keeps getting better. I only gave 4 stars because I want to see what happens after 3-4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream had great coverage but again was heavy and thick. That might appeal to some but wasn't good for my skin, I broke out within hours of using it. Finally had to stop use, so I am not really sure how it works as far as firming/contouring. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this product is awesome. My skin feels great. my friends and family even notice the difference. thank you so much for letting me try before I buy. after the product sample is gone I will be buying this. I have already told friends and family about the product and i will continue to let people know about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't have any complaints about this product, but I am not exactly sure what it's purpose is. I have never felt that my neck is saggy, so I can't say that it is any tighter after using it. It might work if this is a problem area for you, but this is just another lotion to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product I love! I just wish it had SPF. I love wearing this during the day because it is a light formula. I again am not really a fan of the fragrant scent but I love that this does not make my face grey throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have seen and felt some firming in my neck area . I love the softness it gives my neck and face after applying and no strong scents. I will keep using this product. can't wait to see more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product,thanks Loreal. This is the first time I've tried a neck cream. I Iiked how it made the skin on my neck area smoother and softer. I saw less wrinkles too after using the Revitalift product for a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream along with the day and night cream and it seemed redundant. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase a separate product for my neck. I like the day and night creams better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I usually use another brand but I decided to try this since I have had many friends going on about it for quite some time. After the third use or so I started seeing results and people started asking me what I was doing and telling me I looked younger. Revitalift is worth the money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle+Firming Face/Neck Contour Cream. I didn't know a product like this was out there. I have heard you should always put face cream on your neck but it always used it up so much faster. I loved that there is a cream dedicated to that area. It made it so soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First time trying this product. I had very dry skin, no matter what I used I could not get rid of the dry patches on my face and neck. After using few days, the results were amazing. My skin is soft dry skin gone and fine wrinkles are disappearing. It absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly, does not leave a greasy feeling. Nice clean refreshing smell. Highly recommend this cream . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This contour cream is really nice! The first thing I loved was that it is a HUGE jar of product. Enough to last quite a while. This is supposed to be applied to your neck and jaw line. At times, even though I am still young, I have felt like this area needs a little help. After using this for just about a week, I feel like the skin is more firm and much better moisturized. I even feel like my skin is much more smooth as well. I would definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that so far, and its only been 1 week, that I am seeing my chicken neck not as pronounced. It feels and looks firmer. So far, i'm really liking RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Face/Neck Contour. I put it on and instantly see a difference like my jaw if more rounded and the skin under my chin is not hanging as much. Again, its only been 1 week but so far this product is working well. Its not greasy, it glides on like silk. I love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the L'Oreal Revitalift face and neck cream! It is not overly oily, which is great for combination skin! I have been using it for about 4 days and it has been great so far, and I cannot wait to see the results in 2-4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think...I really like this one. it goes on a little greasy but it soaks in really fast so that goes away. it is nice amd light and not much scent to it. I will have to try it by itself to confirm its the day cream with the heavy perfume smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I have oily skin that is somewhat prone to breakouts so I have to be careful what I use. I did use the face and neck cream at night under the night cream but I think that was too much for my skin as I broke out with a big spot. So I stopped using for a couple of days and all seems to be better . It smells great though and is very silly . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't ever used a cream that's solely for your neck & décolleté, but this one was great! It left my sking feeling wonderfully moisturized & was a nice way to pamper some areas that don't usually get such focused attention. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was my favorite item!! I love the idea of firming my face and neck. A lot of people forget that we need to moisturize our necks to prevent losing elasticity as we age. I love this and use it all the time.it leaves your skin soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this product hydrates my face and neck. It isn't oily or greasy like some of the other products I have tried in the past. I would highly recommend this product along with the other products in the line. I have been tanning lately and this product is great at keeping my face hydrated as well!

"I have only been using this product for a week and have used it daily on my face and neck and truly see such a difference, especially in the neck area. It is fast absorbing and leaves your skin feeling so soft and looking smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these creams! My skin is very sensitive and I am unable to use most products. I have experienced no allergic reactions and my skin definitely looks brighter. It take 4 weeks to show any real results but I am planning to continue and see what happens. The products have a pleasant scent are non-greasy and absorb quickly. Being a non-makeup person, I do find it takes more time to get ready in the mornings, which is kind of a pain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I decided to try this product to see if it could help he wrinkles that are forming on my neck. No wrinkles on my face yet but my neck seems to show my age unfortunately. I started using this product 5 days ago and can't wait to continue to use it. The smell is very nice and it leaves my skin feeling soft as a baby's bottom. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone I know and have already had my mother try it. We both agree it's awesome. Buy this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream is another winner from L'Oréal. The cream leaves my skin soft and smooth. I am excited to continue to use it to improve my skin's texture and tone while I sleep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only started to use this one so have not seen any results yet. I love the creamy feel of this on my face and I use it everynight. I will report it in a few days and I am impresssed so far. The skin dryness goes away after first use and thats a plus when going into fall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a super rich moisturizing cream but, what is the difference between this and the day cream? I read the product inserts and I am still not sure. I like the idea of a neck/ décolletage firming cream but when using all of the 4 products, these 2 seem to be the same consistency, and feel the same on my skin. Maybe a bit more information in the future would lead me to purchase both creams instead of just one and using it on my face/neck/décolletage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to apply for a few days to see if there was a change in the neck area and chest. after, exposure to sun for years I felt so obvious that I had let this happen. I did the"" tacky test"" about ten minutes after application two fingers together and tapped the neck and chest area --no sticky grab ! clothes on and no problem.i applied it in an upward motion to the chin line . I willcontinue with this product I like the cream it goes on smooth and no residue--- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream smells nice, but is a little on the thick side; however if after 4 wks 96% of women saw firmer skin and I end up being one of them, that won't matter to me. The results are what matter. You apply a small amount to jaw and neck area morning and night. This has Stimuplex and Pro-Retinol A, is non greasy, dermatologist tested and noncomedogenic. This cream also smells very pleasant. and a little goes a long way; It contains 8 natural lifters! Whoa! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It never crossed my mind to care for my neck nor did I think my neck needed any attention. After using the face/neck contouring cream on my face and neck I can see the difference. Those lines and wrinkles in my have diminished and the softness of my skin is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream was smooth and easy to apply, it settled in and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. I am happy with this great sample selection. This moisturizer fulfills its promises, especially since I typically apply other products on top of it. This product meshed well with my other products making my morning routine very pleasurable. I love the added SPF 18. This has done wonders! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok here it is! This product is amazing! Im now on my 3rd day and I have seen a difference in my neck and face. I have such a glow and a shine that I've never had! I have used so many different products that have done nothing I'm very amazed and so happy that I've been able to try this new product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Will surely continue use, I very much appreciate this product in the way it reduces the looks of fine wrinkles in both the face and neck areas. Also the SPF additional protection for wind and sun exposure. With winter upon is here in the northeast, I believe this substantial cream will be exactly what will be all thats needed..

"I used this on both my face and my neck/chest area; It works great and has a pleasant smell which doesn't linger more than you want it too. It is not greasy but very moisturizing, absorbs quickly,goes on smoothly, and long lasting. I would use daily after your shower or bath. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was a complete surprise to me. I was always a faithful user of moisturizer, but only on my face. I had never even though of my neck and chest area! How could I have missed this? Your neck will thank you for this great cream. It goes on easily and quickly. It soaks in and doesn't leave a funny feeling on your skin. You can get dressed right away. Bring on the V-neck blouses!

Just started using this firming face/neck contour cream last night and really like it so far. The cream is light and very easy to apply. Not at all greasy. The scent is also light and pleasant. I have been wanting a product that is specific for the neck since it is one of the areas that is easily overlooked. The skin on my neck looked smooth and moisturized--I felt better knowing that I was giving this area attention! Will continue to apply this every night so that it can work while I sleep.

"I never really thought about taking care of my neck until I tried this cream. Wow, my neck looks so much better! Wrinkles are fading and my neck is looking firmer and smoother. This is a nice, lightweight cream with a slight pleasant scent. I will never forget to take care of my neck again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm so thrilled with using the L'Oreal ReVitalist face and neck cream. It goes on smoothly and evenly and has a pleasant scent. Best of all it's helping my sensitive skin to look and feel better without any breakouts since it absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy feeling. I've always used L'Oreal makeup, and now I'm adding this to my staples. Great effects without having to spend a fortune! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

L'Oréal revitalift products are very creamy and pleasant to use, does not sting my skin at all , make up goes on perfectly and my skin stays moisturised all day, and most importantly - even after a few days I can definately say that wrinkles appear reduced.

I still like to show off my neck and shoulders even though colder weather is here. I have used the Revitalift neck cream for three nights now and I see a difference already.

"The consistency of this cream was very nice. It was thick without being too greasy and absorbed well. After a few days, I could notice a difference in the skin in my neck area especially.

I have never used neck cream until trying the L'Oreal RevitalLift Neck Contour Cream. I have never payed much attention to my neck. I will now! My skin is so much softer. I have noticed a real difference since using. It is not greasy which is great and you cannot beat the price point! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My sister was lucky enough to be at my house when my my Bzz kit arrived. We excitedly ripped open each box putting them all over our faces and necks and sniffing each one. The neck contour cream was actually my favorite. It was a nice thickness with a mild scent. My neck literally felt like silk about 10 minutes after using it. My sister even mentioned that she would be changing to this brand next time she shopped for anti wrinkle cream! whoo hoo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that this is a great daytime moisturizer without sunscreen. I hate how sunscreen feels on my skin and I live somewhere that, especially in fall/winter, it is just unnecessary a lot of the time. It went on smoothly and absorbed well. I'm excited to see if I get noticeable results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used a neck cream, and now that I have, it's the best so far. No sticky or oily residue and smooths on and dries quickly without leaving your neck feeling slimy. The smell is great as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just received my package to try and rate the L'Oreal Revitalift Products. I opened the Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Face/Neck contour Cream and smoothed a bit onto my neck as I already have makeup on my face. I absolutely love the smell and the feel of the product. I will keep you informed of the results as I will use on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This cream is a little more heavily scented than I prefer, but it isn't a bad scent. It does dissipate after a while. This leaves my skin feeling very moisturized but not greasy. No breakouts because of it either. I like it. My skin seems a little brighter as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With only having used this product for 1 week. I have seen signs of firmer skin on my waddle (neck area). Its a very silky feeling cream when applied. It absorbed quickly and it was non-greasy. But this product also has a fragrance to it, that I'm sure I could get use to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"sO FAR I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It has been really smoothing on my neck area so far. I cant wait to continue using this product.

After just one week i can tell a difference in the texture of my skin in the neck area.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received my neatly packed box with these FULL SIZED jars of youth today and I am more than excited to give them a try! After cleansing my face I applied Revitalift face/neck contour cream to the skin on my neck and jaw line. Honestly, I think I've forgot about this area of my face for all these years. Although it's too soon to see results, I do love the glow and dewy look that I have after using this tonight. The scent is very light which is a plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 35 and a new mom and I was really starting to feel the effects of no sleep. So I tried the revitalift face and neck cream to help smooth out some premature wrinkles and help my hormonal skin. I really liked the product because it gave my skin a nice glow and I look refreshed. My skin also felt smoother and more supple. I used in conjunction with the eye cream and I can see the darkness under my eyes fading. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Day 1 in on the Face and Neck Cream combo. I'll continue each day and post during my progress. I was surprised to see some reviews noting the product was heavy as I did not find that at all. I was pleasantly surprised it was as light as it was. Looking forward to continuing with this line and possibly replacing my current generic 1 product line up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was nervous to try this because I've never used anything like this before. My face can be very oily so I'm very careful about what I put on it. Today was Day 1 and I am pleasantly surprised! I really expected my face to turn into an oil pit and all of my makeup to just slid right off, but that was so not the case. My face and makeup looks just as fresh now as it did 10 hours ago when I did it. I'm excited to see how well this does with the firming as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to try the contouring cream for the face and neck. I love this product. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel great.

I have been using this product for a little over a week now and can already see a difference. My skin feels firmer and is also softer.

"This is one of the best moisturizers I have tried so far. My skin tends to be on the dry side. It is a white silky creme that absorbs quickly. It has a light, nice fragrance to it. Very light feel; not heavy and greasy. Absorbs quickly into skin. I will be adding this to my daily regiment. I would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Normally I wouldn't consider a neck cream but i was intrigued. After using this for a little while I have noticed a difference. It has a great light scent like the other products. It goes on smooth and creamy leaving you feeling soft and clean, not oily and nasty. The products actually work and make your skin feel great, fresh, and clean. Absolutely worth the money, easy to use, and refreshing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I opened the container there was no strong smell. The cream went on very smoothly and it didn't feel greasy at all. My neck just seemed to absorb the cream right away. My new k now feels so so smooth I'm actually surprised how smooth it feels right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've had a problem with my neck, jawline since I've gotten older so I was excited to try a produt that was designed specificaly for those areas. My jaw is kind of 'droopy' so I smear this product on my jawline and neck and already it does seem firmer, a bit 'tighter.' And I just started using it. I cant wait to see the results after a few more weeks. Plus I'm a fan of products that smell good and this product kind of smells like flowers to me which is a pretty nice bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As with the other products that shipped with this one I was very pleased with. The size of the jar is decent and I feel like it's a good bargain for a product that smells and feels great on your skin. I am picky about what I put on or near my face because of harsh smells and chemicals. This is so clean and light. I'm hoping with a month or two of use I will be able to see results, I just began and am excited to see what happens! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and I am in love with it. It has a very light fragrance that is not at all overwhelming and it works well with combination skin. I have noticed a reduction in the wrinkles on my neck. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think that L'Oreal Paris provide a lift anti-wrinkle and firming face and neck contour cream is a bit too thick. I found that it doesn't absorb the way that I would've liked. But it does have a nice texture when you apply it to your face. I have been using it for two days and I am very happy with the results I just find that it's too thick of a consistency for my personal preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this cream for the past 6 months, after my 26th birthday. I started noticing that my skin had lost its glow, and I started to notice lines. After a few months of using the cream, I started getting carded for drinks again, and was even told that I looked 19! A cop even stopped me to make sure I was of age. This stuff is great!"
"I'm in my mid 30's and started to notice a lose of firmness to my face. My face looked tried, with a lost of it's glow. I purchased this product and have been using it for 3 weeks now. My skin is already showing results. My skin looks tighter and healthier. I can see a more lifted , glowing look to my skin. I will more than buy it again."
"I love this cream! I have sensitive skin and was nervous I would break out from it clogging my pores, but it has done nothing but help my skin! My face seems brighter, and looks younger. I would recommend this for sure. I also use the eye cream and it is great! I love the l""oreal products!"
"My aunt started using this line a long time ago. She told me how she liked it and I should try it. I did, because she looked pretty darn good. Love this cream - it is a mainstay. I have tried others, but keep coming back. It consistently does what it says, does not irritate my skin and makes it look refreshed and softens the wrinkles. Also use the eye cream, and it too, delivers."
I've been using this product on my face for about 6 months and loved the results. I noticed that my neck had developed deep wrinkles. They looked like rings around my neck. I felt like an old tree and you could count my age by rings!! I started using this cream on my neck and the wrinkles have virtually disappeared in 4 weeks.
I use this product in the morning under makeup and at night. I've noticed VISIBLE results! I've used it for about 3 weeks so far and have no intention of stoppping. Also it doesn't clog my pores and cause pimples like most moisturizers tend to do for me. I fully intend to check out other products in this line!! Happy Happy Happy :)
I didn't see results until the second month I used it. Would recommend it to anyone.

"I liked this but again, this worked like a moisturizer to me and I did not see any changes like firming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream is very thick. It also has a very strong smell. I like the smell just wish it wasn't so strong . Other than that I like the cream so far after 2 weeks of use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I haven't felt that the anti wrinkle cream aND firming lotion have made a huge difference yet. I do like how soft it is making my face and neck though. I have been using it for 5 days so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very silky smooth cream. Nice clean scent. Takes very little cream to go a long way. It does leave a bit of a oily feel to the skin after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really haven't seen any results yet. I will keep using this product. I know that there is not going to be instant result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loreals face and neck cream made my face and neck feel tighter and smoother within a few uses. I recommend this product for firmer, younger looking skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the face and neck cream but it seems to be about the same as the daycream and night cream. I'll have to give it a lot more time to see if it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This one felt very thick and I did not like the way it felt layered with the night and day lotions also made me feel like I hade caked on makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was nice and light, with a very subtle scent. Often people forget about the neck when applying firming and moisturizing creams so I like that this is a neck and face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the cream for 1 night so not long enough to see results yet, but this cream feels nice on the skin! I cant wait to see the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think this product is gonna do some great results in a few weeks. So far it has seemed to tighten and firm my skin some. And it doesn't take much to go along way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Just turned 32 and starting to get those wrinkles around my mouth, eyes, and forehead. This moisturizer not only diminishes those wrinkles, but it makes my skin feel baby soft and smooth! Great product!!"
"This product is wonderful. I recently visited my sisters, and they commented on how young my skin looks. and so smooth. They stated that I look younger the older that I get."
"I love this cream. The jar. The smell. everything. My skin has never felt more smooth, lines are dissapearing. I have a glow. Please don""t ever stop making it."
"This is a smooth, unscented cream that goes on well, and when on, seems to minimize the thin ""crepiness""/wrinkling that's occured on my neck in the last year or so. However, it does nothing to actually ""fix"" the problem...temporary results at best."
I've used the cream for 2 days so far and I like the results.....so far. Hoping it continues to moisturize and do the antiwrinkle thing. I have very good skin and have moisturized for 34 years.....
I like the ease of use and smoothness it gives my skin.
"I love this cream and have not broken out from it at all! Very firming and has reduced my lines and wrinkles. Will purchase it again, thanks."
Like the cream and just have a few days with it so really cannot comment on results yet.. Only complaint is the fragrance is so strong that it is annoying and gives you a headache. If only Loreal will cut down on that fragrance.
This is one product that really works and will buy again.
It did a great job of moisturizing my skin
"Non greasy, works well"
convenient and safe
