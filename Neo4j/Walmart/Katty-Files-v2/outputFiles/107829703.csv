"Does not make my skin extra oily. It seems to keep it under control and provides the amount of moisture I need for my face. I always apply sunscreen first then I use this lotion. At first it's wet, but then it dries. The only thing to watch out for is that it's very runny. It comes out fast! You have to be careful and be gentle while squeezing the tube. A little bit goes a long way."
I love this product it really made my face smoother and my face is not oily anymore even after I apply Iimage sunblock. I've used other products before but it always turned my face oily and more oily after applying a sunblock.
