This is the only lotion that works for me. It doesn't make my face oily and it helps keep my acne under control. Love it!
"This is the only product on the market that works on my hormonal acne. I have tried everything else and when this is missing from store shelves I find myself in dire straights. This is the perfect blend of products, doesn't dry out my skin, but takes care of the pimples quickly."
"I'm 47 and STILL I have sensitive, acne prone skin. This is the only product that works for me. Moisturizing while controlling acne. I seriously can't live without it!"
"I love this lotion. I'm forty, but somehow still get pimples. Using this daily really helps."
"Unfortunately, it is harder and harder to find this in stores."
Purchased this item about a month ago and the speed of delivery surpass timeliness. I did not realized that I was out of it and I cannot trust any other product/brand to keep my face in tact. Thank you for your efficiency and the price was amazing.
"I have been using this product since August 2010. It has been part of morning and night routine everyday and I cannot live without this in my life. I have used similar products from Neutrogenia, Clean and Clear, etc. but nothing has worked for me the way this product does."
I am 63 and still get breakouts but skin is sensitive to many products. I love the way this lotion helps to keep my face clear but when I have used about half it is very difficult for me to squeeze the rest from the tube. I have RA so some might not have a problem like I do. A pump dispenser would be nice.
"I started using this product awhile ago, and I am very glad I did. It's made a big improvement on my faces texture."
I brought this product and start usin it for my acne and nothing works I been using it for weeks y'all products are fake and they don't really works.
I noticed a difference in a day. Very pleased with this product. Seems to keep any further breakout at bay.
I have been using this lotion for years and just love the way it smells and makes my face feel. It is not greasy and always makes my face feel clean and moisturized!
I love this stuff but it's getting harder to find in stores so I just ordered online.
"I love this lotion, but can't find it in the store. I'm so glad that it's available online."
This works well as an exfoliant and helps reduce breakouts. I would like to see no fragrance or coloring agents in it. Some folks are very sensitive to perfumes and dyes.
I purchased this for my12 year old daughter who suffers from acne. We have tried proactive and other acne medicine but they seemed to not really take care of the problem and leave her skin so dry. This lotion (used after cleansing and a witch hazel toner of course) is the perfect closure to a nightly face cleansing routine. So far so good and we have only added it to the routine for 2 weeks.
"Gentle enough for sensitive skin but extremely effective in keeping my skin moisturizer (not flaky!), reduces redness, and keeps my acne flare ups at bay! I was happy to find the price online was cheaper than the price in stores. Yes, I would recommend to a friend."
"This the single best acne product I have found. I am 41, and suffer occasional hormonal breakouts. On top of that, my skin just sucks. This makes it pretty again. Doesn't dry out my skin. I have 3 extra bottles under my sink right now. Need I say more? Not sure why I can't find it in stores anymore??"
Got very bad brokeout and subside very rapidly after a few application .
"I haven't been able to find this lotion anywhere in stores, only at Walmart.com. Please don't discontinue this product! I don't have much acne but this is the only thing that controls breakouts and oily skin"
I have been using this product for more than a year now and I feel my skin is soft and clear. I also use it as a base before putting on my makeup. I really like it. I have tried so many different face lotions and finally found a very good one.
"I LOVE this product! It is very hard to find a moisturizer that works with oily, acne prone skin that is also sensitive. This moisturizer is the first I have found that helps clear blemishes and does not make my oily skin worse. It is also sensitive enough to use daily without any drying."
I love this product and have used it for years. I cannot find this product in my neighborhood superstore or drugstore. I can't go two days without using this product. It took me forever to find something that consistently works. It's also easy to use and maintain. I wash and moisturizer twice a day. At my age I don't want to spend a lot of time and effort to maintain clear skin. Thanks for a great product.
"I love this product. I have acne, and this helps to clear my face. Other face lotions will leave my face oily and greasy. This product is one of the only that leaves my face moisturized without being oily. It also takes redness off of my face and focuses on the pimples. The only bad thing about it is that it comes in small amounts, but it worth it!"
"I bought this actually by accident, I was out of the normal stuff I use from Cetaphil brand and I was out of town and I NEEDED an acne cream. This acne cream does not smell bad which is good- it keeps my acne at bay. It also is great for spot treating my acne!"
"I have tried a ton of acne lotions and this is the best that I have ever tried. I always try other products and I always end up going back to this lotion because it is just amazing. If this product discontinues I don't know what other lotions I'll use. I cannot live without this lotion!!! Please, please, please do not discontinue this product!!!"
This is the only product that has worked for me. I am over 40 with sensitive skin and searched high and low for a replacement. Have you discontinued this product and if so why? I have referred several friends to this product as well and none of them are able to find this product either.
"I've battled acne for 20 yrs. The market is full of ineffective over the counter and prescription acne products. Though this is just another salicylic acid lotion, it is a good formulation lotion wise in terms of comedogenicity and contains ingredients that are excellent for reducing inflammation. Neutrogena is very good at discontinuing products and this is getting hard to find. A lot of people faithfully use this and neutr. Would not be smart in discontinuing it."
"This has got to be the best face lotion out there. It leaves your skin feeling soft, not oily, keeps unwanted blemishes away and helps reduce blotches. So why isn't this GREAT product available anymore? There are so many reviews along this one, asking for this product to be put back on the shelves. Why has this not happened?"
"I don't get acne very often but when I do it tends to be awful! All the other moisturizers I used only caused more acne and oily looking skin. This product not only moisturizes, but it fights acne. When I have a pimple I put this on and the size/redness is considerably reduced in just hours! Love this product!"
I have adult acne. My skin is above average oily (all over my face...tons of oil). This product worked the first day. My breakouts have calmed down. My very oily skin is somewhat under control and even somewhat dry on my cheeks now. I have not had any new breakouts either. For the rapid results I would have to give this 2 thumbs up. Definitely looking into other Neutrogena products for acne prone and oily skin to go with this product.
I'm on board with all the others who have written reviews pleading for this product to stay on the shelves. I went to several stores yesterday looking for the lotion. I'm in panic mode now! This product has worked wonders on my skin! I've tried everything and this is the one & only product that has worked for me. PLEASE do not discontinue!!!!
"This product is awesome! Been using it for so many years years. I have tired so many products but this one works so well in keeping my blemishes away and helping me have a crystal clear complexion. I needed to write a review because i don't want to product discontinued. I use it twice a day, works great !"
"This product works very well to prevent acne and clear blackheads. However, with my sensitive and dry skin, daily use was too much. When I tried using this everyday after washing my face, my skin became very irritated, itchy and tiny bumps started to appear. I stopped using this product for a week to let my skin calm down, then started using this every three days, which really seems to work. Overall, this is a good product that delivers, but it may be irritating for people with sensitive skin."
"I decided to try this lotion along with the Rapid Clear wipes because my skin gets dry. Being an adult woman, I need that added moisture while still treating my skin. I really like this lotion as it makes my skin noticeably softer, less oily and clearer. Hope Neutrogena continues this product because it is a winner!"
"I always feared this day would come when it was replaced by something else. I have been using this for years and what I loved about it is that it is the only product to actually keep oily skin under control for about 7-8 hours. Did I mention how good of a job it does as a spot treatment for an oncoming breakout, or how it just worked. I know this will go on deaf ears at Neutrogena, but for the love of all things good in the world, please bring it back!"
"This product is so great!! I went crazy when I heard they are discontinuing it, this product keeps my face feeling good and looking good. I held on to my last bottle as long as I could, and yesterday I went to sadly go look for a new moisterizer and It was there! :) I dont know if they brought it back or not, but PLEASE keep it in stores, its to good to lose!"
I've been using this product for many years especialli in the summer when skin gets affected by the sun and sweat . I have a problem fidding this product in stores near me. It's this product discontinued? Please consider not removing it from stores bc my skin depends on it. Thanks Arsenia
I am a 54 year old man and I have problem skin still. This is the the only thing I have ever found that really works without drying my face and making matters worse.
You have to try it. My kids actually listened to me and it has helped them better than anything they have tried.
"I love this face lotion. It's not thick, and sticky like other products I have tried. It moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling extremely oily and greasy. I can use it under my makeup for protection or alone. It definitely keeps the acne from coming back. Overall It does what it says. My only problem is I wish I could buy it in bulk or they had bigger bottles."
"My face kept breaking out and I couldn't figure out why, so I decided to try this because I thought it was my moisturizer. Within hours my skin had smoothed out, I haven't had a breakout in weeks, and my skin isn't dry at all. This is definitely the best acne preventing/treating moisturizer I have ever used!"
"I love this product. I had the worse acne ever and this really helped. I also have very sensitive skin so this product doesn't burn or make my skin itchy either. I would also recommend the toner and and cleanser with this. Use it and you'll love it! You gotta at least use this for 3 months in order to see results! Trust me, it helps!!!"
"I have been using this for a few weeks now and all I can say is ""WOW!"" In just a few days I noticed a big difference in my skin. And since I've been using it, I haven't had a single breakout and my skin looks great. I use it twice a day and it works."
"I have Rosacea acne and this lotion is very helpful in controlling outbreaks. I use it every day along with other ""acne wash"" products and I have successfully eliminated acne outbreaks. The product provides effective treatment without over-drying the skin."
"I frequently have breakouts, but my skin is super dry. When I applied this to my face it really helped my acne. (I used it once or twice a week) after a a few weeks I noticed my skin was getting super super dry. Do I decided to stop using it. If you have dry skin do not buy this product unless you have a trusty moisturizer on hand!!! (Also after I stopped using it... my acne cane back)"
Not harsh on my sensitive skin. Helps except with hormonal acne.
"I read reviews about this product and how great it was for dry sensitive skin, I works fine but I feel like after a week I had dry patches."
"I have been using Rapid Clear for years. I love this product, it keeps my skin clear and acne free."
My wife loves this stuff. Hard to find in the Walmart store but a good buy on line. Especially with free shipping. Came in a few days.
"I usually don't post a lot of of product reviews but this one calls for it. I really does work fast, and in two days my pimples reduced in size. I think its worth every penny!"
"I like the product but for some reason in the area I live and I have checked in multiple cities and even in different states, the product is no where to be found. Is the product discontinued?"
This does not work as well for me as the Stress Control 3-In-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment. It has a much thicker texture and seems to make my skin even oilier than it is and I haven't seen as much improvement on my blackheads.
This is possibly the best skin care product I have ever bought. And every time I think my bottle is empty I'm able to keep getting more from it for another month. My skin was so clear and soft every day because of this!
I use this EVERY day and it helps clear and moisturize my face. I was looking for this in a few stores and now I can't find it anywhere! BRING IT BACK IN STORES!!!
Best product i have ever used and is really the only thing that clears my skin. Only one store carried it for a while and i found out today is was gone!! PLEASE BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK!!
"This lotion has worked very well for me for years--it does not hurt sensitive skin and works well in eliminating breakouts. Please, please, please do not discontinue this amazing product!"
Lotion goes on smooth and coverage is awesome. Keeps shine down. Does not dry out skin. Helps with controlling acne. Great for sensitive skin. I LOVE this lotion.
"I started using Neutrogena 2 months ago and am pleasantly surprised! i have had stubborn acne, a sensitive and oily skin. the product was not only gentle to my skin but controlled my acne and i can see the old post acne scars fading..."
This product clears my skin and leaves it soft. I love that it is an acne treatment in the form of a lotion because it does not irritate my skin which makes acne worse. This works better than the prescription I was on!
"I am 35 and still dealing with acne, no lines yet though! This moisturizer really helps. No other company makes a product that comes close to Neutrogena. I use this at night and wake up to less acne and redness-a perfect way to start the day!"
This product is awesome since I started using it with the black soap and witch hazel my acne has gone completely away and it is definitely working on my acne scaring as well would definitely recommend.
I've been using it for 20days and my skin is visibly having more breakouts. I don't know why it works for others but not me. I use this nd the spot treatment also. None of it cured my acne but made it worse. I get like one to two pimples daily after i use these 2 Neutrogena products as my skin routine.
I plan on reordering as part of my drugstore skin care regimen. I pair it with the stubborn acne mask and I get pretty good results using these two products as well as the foaming cleanser. I still get occasional breakouts/pimples during that time of the month but that happens no matter what I use.
"Works great, don't use anything else."
Helps prevent breakouts and controls my really oily skin.
I use this daily and it keeps me acne free without drying out my skin.
"I have been struggling with acne all my life from product to product there's days that my face is clear and days that I look like a pizza, and for the past month it's been red bumps and blackheads. I literally started this product last week and my face is smooth, healthy and most important clear and the best part is that my old red/brown pimple scars are fading away! This is truly an amazing product."
I love this product. I been using for few years now and it work prefectly fine. It make my skin soft and it doesn't get dry or oily at all. I can just use it one time in the morning and my face will be moisture. I just love this product a lot and I hope is not discontinued because i cant find it anywhere her in Albany New York :(
Very fast and easy delivery. will reorder in future
This is the best acne fighting lotion ever. I can't find it anywhere right now and it's all I use. Please don't discontinue this product!
I don't know what I would do without this product! It keeps my skin from breaking out or being too dry. Perfect for me!
Truly my lifesaver! My skin type is oily and acne prone also somewhat sensitive but this lotion helps my acne go away also leaves my skin super soft.
"I know tons of people who love this product...I am not sure why you got rid of it. It keeps my face clear, matte and moisturized!"
Excellent product. .. I've try many different products & I finally found 1 that really works..... Thanks
My husband loves this product. It has helped his skin tremendously but we have been unable to find it recently. Help!!!
"I really love this product, it actually works, and doesn't dry my skin out. However I'm having trouble finding it anywhere."
This product in combination with your other products gave me the best skin I ever had! WHERE IS IT? Please bring it back!! I NEED IT!!
"I love this lotion. It makes my skin soft while treating breakouts, it is not greasy and also helps with any swollen, painful breakouts."
I just added this product to my daily skin routine. I love it! It's great to use after your daily skin routine!
"I love this moisturize because its oil free. I have been using it for over 2 yrs and it keeps my skin from breaking out. I do wear makeup, so as long as I keep my skin clean it keeps my adult acne from breaking out."
"I was looking for an effective yet economical acne and scar product, and together with the other rapid clear products I have gotten good results. I will continue to use the rapid clear products."
"I've been using this product about a year now, and I love it. It really does help with breakouts and makes my skin softer. I can't imagine using something else."
"works well, no mess"
"I have struggled with acne for almost 20 years. I have tried everything...prescription, non-prescription, etc. with no success. I decided to try one more acne product before giving up (again!), and I LOVE this! I saw results in 1 day, and after 3 weeks of use, I am totally clear. I have not had this many completely clear days in years! Please try if you are even considering this line of products."
"My son has very oily skin, I was always bothering him to go wash his face. I read the reviews on this product and I am so glad I bought it. It immediately started to control the oil, and his acne is drying out without overdrying his face. I am very pleased with this product."
"I started using this product a month ago. I have never seen any product working so beautifully on acne. Not only acne, it also make my complexion uniform which I wanted for so so long and couldn't figure out how. Every girl out there, should atleast try this product once. You will fall in love with it. Today I received my pack of three. M never gonna leave this product ever."
"This is the best acne cream for any woman, in any stage of life. It moisturizes without drying and cleans your acne right up. I have cystic acne occasionally and I have not had a large cyst since I have been using this. I don't like going without it."
"For the most part it does what it's supposed to. It eliminates problem areas quickly. My problem it that it's very drying. I'm afraid to use it without some type of moisturizing lotion, and when I do I feel like I'm lowering its effectiveness. A fast working product, but use it in moderation."
"I love the rapid clear products but needed a moisturizer to help with some dry skin. I was happy to find this lotion because it was already part of what I was using. It helps keep my skin clear, soft and I have noticed it is a lot less oily. The fragrance is nice too. I am going to keep this as part of my skin care routine."
Rapid Clear does exactly that. I have 2 illness & my medications cause my skin to breakout so I bought this lotion to see if it would help clear up these horrible acne spots and IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY! I love this lotion & I will be buying it on a regular basis. As part of Girl Scouts I will recommend this to the teenage scouts.
"This is the greatest product ever. It mosturizes perfectly, it doesn't dry my skin out, nor does it leave my skin feeling heavy and sticky. And it clears up my break-outs fast. I won't use any other moisturizer, however it's been increasingly difficult to find it in any store around here...."
"Here's my dream...""Back by Popular Demand!"" This product is absolutely wonderful: Calming, soothing, superbly effective on acne of all types! Other sites are running out of it. Why in the world would Neutrogena discontinue this when so many people love it?? Sigh...Let's hope we can change their minds."
"I needed a moisturizer for my face because I'm prone to dry skin a lot, because of the scrub and because I live in a cold climate where winter can really dry out the skin. I picked this up in [...]because I have been a loyal Neutrogena user. After washing my face and applying this at night and also in the morning, not only did it clear my skin up but it wasn't dry anymore! It even made my sisters jealous. This is clearly a great secret weapon for great skin, especially during breakouts."
It works for like 1 week then you get more breakouts.
I bought this a week ago and it cleared my acne very fast
my acne is 90% gone.Thx Neutrogena! Now post marks
The best product ever . Neutrogena please bring it back asap .
"Bought this product based on the reviews, tried it out and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized."
"I agree this product is amazing, do not discontinue. I can't find it anywhere now."
"This stuff is great for sensitive skin. Please bring this back to the store, please."
"This lotion works great for my son's acne prone skin. Keeps it clear, and he loves it."
Moiturizes my skin without creating a shine . Perfect anytime moisturizer for acne prone skin
It works I've been using it for two weeks now and I can see my skin just clearing up I really like it
"I have to search and search for this lotion! It's the only lotion I want to use, it works so well on my skin! Please keep making it!!!"
"Whenever I would clean my face before I go to bed, products will leave my face dry or stuff in some cases. Finally, I can put a moisturizer on my face, and not have to worry about it creating more acne! This is a need for me!"
"doesn't help get rid of them like the 3-1 hydrating lotion with green tea did. also, this product is making me break out more. not a fan. moving on to finding another product."
I love this product. I use it daily (at night before I go to bed) and it is great. I have a pimple now because I'm having to limit my use since I can't find it in Houston. Someone should explain!
"I love this product, Ive been using it for a few years now and it is my favorite moisturizer, especially when I get acne frequently. Its really lightweight the only thing I could ask for would be some sort of SPF, but you can't have everything!"
I Just Bought thus product yesterday and [...] for anyone whose looking for it :) I'm already on the good side with this product hopefully it'll work for me too
"Please tell us where to find this product or sell it here on line. I found this under my wife's sink and cannot believe how well it works on my face, keeping it clear when nothing else seems to work. I am 43."
I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I love it. My face was starting to get dry and I have moderate to sever acne and this product helps keep into under control while keeping my face moisturized. I also use this product along with the Rapid Clear 2-in-1 Fight & Fade Gel to help eliminate some of my acne scars from previous years.
Keeps my face clear from acne just like it says...I love it !! It took me years to find a face lotion that doesn't cause acne or pimples and now that I have; I don't want to use anything else. My only complaint is that it is never in the local stores anymore. I have to order online now but I guess as long as I can order it online then I am fine.
"I have rosacea and sensitive skin which tends to be oily. I've used Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defence Lotion for years. It works well, and I am sad to say it's becoming more and more difficult to find. Please Neutrogena, don't discontinue this product, and thank you Walmart, for offering it online and at a reasonable price!"
"I love this lotion. I usually use e.l.f. blemish primer but it has only .47oz while this has 1.7 and was half the cost when ordered through mobile for pick up. As far as how well it works, it works the same as the e.l.f primer lotion and has prevented me from breaking out. It also works quite well as either a primer or just face lotion."
"I have combination, acne prone skin and decided to give this a try when the store was out of my regular moisturizer (store brand version of c&c dual action). It dried my skin so much, there was no point in even using it, so I just threw it away after about a week and went without moisturizer."
"I had the orinial face lotion from neutrogena since 2006 and i have been using it since, this is the one product that i can truly say works for me and leaves my skin feeling and looking better. Thank you Neutrogenta this is my i cant live without product for life!"
I love this stuff and can't find it anywhere. I really hope they are not getting rid of it
Please do not DISCONTINUE this product. It is the best product Nuetrogena has and I cant find it in stores any longer. Nothing else works like it!
"I love this product, but I can not find it in any store. Please do not discontinue. This product has changed my skin. I love it!!"
if they discontinue this I will be very upset....its the only thing i have found that works on my 42 year old break outs.....can't find it in the store anymore [...]
"I have been using this lotion for several years. They are no longer carrying it in any stores near me. Not happy about having to order online, however I am glad it is available. Very happy with this product."
"This product works, especially if used daily. I've been using it for years, and really notice a difference in my skin. I have fewer major outbreaks and my skin is smoother and more even looking."
A friend of mine gave me this for my acne; and I can honestly say that I didn't see it make any difference at all. It didn't clear it up; but it made my face oily. I was dissapointed because I seen all the awesome reviews for this product. I will not buy this or recommend it to anybody.
"I have been using this for years and I loved it! I stopped using it for a little while and realized that i needed to use it for an upcoming wedding this weekend, and the first day I went back to use it, it broke out my whole entire face within a few hours! I am just very disappointed in what the product did to me."
"Has made my skin much smoother, cleared up most of my blackheads. Has a strong scent at first, but goes away quickly."
"I was dying to try this product because everyone absolutely raved about it. After one night with it on, I woke up to more break outs. I still suffer with acne. If anyone wants to suggest ideas, I'm desperate to take any."
"I have been using Neutrogena products for years and tried just about everything out there (their oil-free acne wash is amazing!!) So, I decided to try this, but it was a bad idea. Ever since I started using it I have been breaking out pretty badly!"
"Bought this to see if it helped my skin, and yes it did, make it soft like they said it would."
"Product works really well, and arrived on time too."
"I like how light it is, and overnight I noticed a difference. It just smells weird."
leaves skin silky smooth and blemish free. works quickly overnight.
I love this product. I use it every morning to keep acne at bay. This stuff really does work.
I really likes this product. It has made quite an improvement in my skin. I will definitely order this product again. Thank you so much.
This was a online store pick up purchase. It was ready within less than 24 hours. Fast and convenient.
Redness got reduced
Would love to get this but too bad you guys don't ship to Malaysia :(
