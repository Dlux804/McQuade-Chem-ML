"Since I found this Eye Makeup Remover, I have never use any other. Love it."
"I use waterproof mascara because my eyes water. It is a giant pain to remove the end of the day. This remover is the only thing that works for me. I have tried store brands other drugstore makeup brands micelar water, etc. It is light and non-greasy. I just wish it had a flip top lid with a small hole in it so I could squirt it onto a cotton pad."
Have been using this for years. Gets the toughest water proof mascara off. As good if not better than the the popular department store brand that costs twice as much.
"LOVE this eye makeup remover!! It works so great, even with eye makeup that has been left on over night. And it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily, like other products I have used in the past."
"I have very sensitive skin and eyes and have had problems finding an eye makeup remover that doesn't irritate. This is that one. For those of you with sensitive skin, I trust you won't be disappointed."
This is an awesome mascara remover! I use a water-resistant mascara and this remover takes it all off with ease and leaves a great smooth feeling to the eye area.
I'm 53 and have been using this product for a few years. Better than any other I've tried.
"Neutrogena Oil-free Eye Makeup Remover is the only eye make remover I use. To me, it works just as well as the expensive (Lancome) brand, but it cost way less."
This product works pretty good for me in removing my eye makeup
I can't review it because it was supposed to be here last week and still hasn't been delivered after almost 3 weeks...
"Have used this product for years, before they came out with their make-up remover sheets, and this is one gentle product on your face. Usually I use a soft washcloth to dab the product on and then it easily removes my day's make-up; especially mascara and eye shadow as well as eye liner. Some women prefer to use cotton balls but I think it is less messy simply using a soft washcloth. Does not burn your eyes using this product."
"This product does work great to remove my eye makeup. It's made by Neutrogena, so that says alot. Does not burn my eyes and is not oily, so no break outs. And, I got this at Walmart, the cheapest price I could find. The local store had it ready and waiting for me to pick it up. Would tell a friend to use it."
"I just washed my face and thought it was clean until I started using Oil free eye makeup remover by Neutrogena. I was shocked when I first used it and discovered never again will I forget to use it, keep using. removes all my eye makeup . it's light enough to use all the time, no reactions to eye area!!"
"Loved it at first - removes eye makeup awesome, however after a week or so of using it, my eyelids have become really irritated. I have really sensitive skin and other neutrogena products have irritated my skin in the past too, so just be careful if your prone to rashes from beauty care products. I read the ingredients and see there is alcohol in this product which can be really irritating to the skin, so I'll be looking for a new makeup remover without alcohol to try next. Good luck!"
This is comparable to my clinique eye makeup removed - similar formula and same result - I love nuetrogena products and would definitely recommend this as a drugstore alternative.
"This is an excellent, gentle eye makeup remover that does the job without irritating eyes. So much less expensive than big name cosmetic names. I enjoy the product and thinking how much money I'm saving by choosing this Neutrogena product."
"I have purchased this eye makeup remover multiple times, and I love it. It does the job perfectly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"been using this product for over 15 yrs. and i honestly believe it has helped to keep my eyes looking younger because it's oily, at first, but then that evaporates, and your skin never feels greasy! it's very gentle!!!!"
"This product was recommended to me when I was talking about how expensive the Mary Kay makeup remover was. I find it very comparable to the Mary Kay product (which I love) in the way in works, just less costly."
Accidentally got this stuff in my eyes while removing makeup and I was left with foggy/rainbow vision. I can't see after multiple attempts at rinsing my eyes. Wont use again. Something weird in it to disrupt vision.
I feel this is the best eye makeup remover because it easily removes all makeup without any tugging or pulling on the eye area. It is oil-free and leaves no greasy residue. I wear contact lenses and this product does not irritate my eyes in any way. I love this product!
"I think this is a great product. For waterproof mascara, you need something gentle and effective, and this is it. My only complaint is that I would love to see you put a lid with a small hole on it, because I (and my daughters, especially) end up pouring too much and wasting it. Please consider that design improvement."
"I. Love. This. Stuff. I had been using the neutrogena makeup remover wipes ever since I started wearing makeup. I love them. I've tried practically every other brand of makeup wipes and they all suck compared to the neutrogena ones. But I felt like no matter how much I scrubbed my mascara off, I'd always find more black under my eyes after showers and sleeping. So I finally tried the liquid remover and my life has been changed. My waterproof mascara comes off so easily with this product. Thank you neutrogena!"
"I was actually looking for a different Neutrogena product (foot cream) when I happened to see this. I have been using Clinique take the day off make-up for a couple of years. This product is 1/3 of the cost of Clinique and I cannot tell the difference. Matte of fact, I like it a tad better than Clinique. I will be using this product from now on"
I could never get my water proof mascara off. I have now found 2 after years of looking. This one is about a third of the cost of the other one. Needless to say this is the one I buy and I have used it for years. Everyone I have referred this product to has also liked it. Great product. Please never stop making it.
This is the best eye makeup remover I have ever used--removes mascara and eyeliner gently and moisturizes the delicate skin below my eyes. I am in Italy on vacation and I left it home!!!! I am now going crazy trying to find it in Rome because my eyes are dry and itchy from using another product I bought in Positano. I will never forget it again!!!
"This is one of the best eye makeup removers I have used. It easily takes off all eye makeup, including my waterproof mascara. I have already recommended this to family and friends, and they love it too! Pros: Great at removing tough makeup, very gentle, can be used on sensitive eyes and skin. Cons: Vision is sometimes a little blurred right after use, but goes away quickly. Overall, I truly do love this and hope to always have it on hand!"
"I've had the same bottle of this product for about a year. I use it occasionally. It does remove eye makeup well. However, I always end up having to use at least 3 cotton pads to remove all of it. Especially the mascara and eyeliner. The 1 thing that I can definitely say is that it doesn't irritate my contacts at all. That's very important. In all, this is a good product to use in a pinch. However, I have to go with Mary Kay or Clinique for the eye makeup removing power that I prefer."
I've been using the oil-free eye make up remover for a month now and I have to say I am extremely happy with it. Couldn't believe how easy my eye makeup came off! And I love that it doesn't irritate my eyes. One reminder to all is to make sure you shake the bottle before using! Someone told me that it was too oily and it was because they were not shaking it before use. I definitely recommend this product!
"you guys.... people keep saying that it says its ""oil free"" but doest feel like it but... it is! it might be greasy but that doesn't mean it contains oil... it's silicon based, not oil based people! but the reason im giving it a 3 is because its really good for removing my gel liner BUT it pulls out my eyelashes even if i dont rub, drys my eyelids (i didnt know eyelids could become dried before i used this O_O), making them feel like paper, and feels like it creates a film on my eyeballs if it goes in..."
I used the neutrogena make up removing wipes for as long as I could remember but recently they started to irritate my skin. I decided to switch to this to remove my eye make up and was excited at seeing it was oil free. To my disappointment it left an OVERWHELMING oily residue on wherever it touches. I had to wash my face twice and exfoliate to feel like I was able to get it off. I was so disappointed.
"I have been using this product for a while now and I love how easily it gets off any makeup that I have on, but it also leaves my skin flakey (my skin type is dry) and it really stings my eyes, I often wear mascara and it is a bit challenging to find a way to get all of it off without getting and product in my eyes."
Much smaller size than in regular stores Very misleading [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is hands down THE best makeup remover available! Better than any high end name brand I've ever tried.
The Neutrogena eye make remover doesn't leave an oily residue like most removers. I've used this for years and am totally happy with it.
Hace una semana empecé a utilizar el producto y mi piel se irritó horrible en el area d ellos ojos por completo duele y su aspecto es muy reseca no recomiendo este producto
Removes water proof mascara without any harsh rubbing or tugging of delicate eye area! Been using it for many years! Tried other brands and came back because it works kinder and gently.
"This stuff is amazing. I accidentally got a lot in my eye and was expecting it to burn but it didn't, and it also removes everything."
"This eye makeup remover literally removes everything!!! I love it so much, have been using it"
"for years now. Couldn't find anything to replace it, and nothing beats the price."
"I love this product and buy the larger bottles to use at home. I now travel a lot, and was very disappointed that the smaller size was 3.8 oz instead of 3.0 oz so it would be TSA-compliant. PLEASE package this in a 3.0 oz (or smaller) bottle!"
I stay stocked with this oh my gosh this is truly THE GOAT ( Greatest of all times ) !
Love the price even more. This works dead on especially with glitter eyeshadow.
Was skeptical...tried MAJOR Department products of similar type...Neutrogena WINS hands down! I wear contacts...and no BLURRY eyes! The best investment for [$]
Really doesn't work that well on waterproof mascara which is what I bought it for. I think once you remove the oil the effectiveness goes down. Works well on the rest of the makeup.
This is the only makeup removal that truly removes waterproof eye makeup and does not leave oily residue. I jave used this for several years afyer trying many others.
I used to use this product constantly years ago. Started using it again recently and it started burning my eyelids and causing a reaction. Had to stop using the product.
use this product literally one time...my eyes are on fire
This is my favorite eye makeup remover. Best price is Wal-Mart. N
Great value and really works.
Good for light make up removal!
Does not burn eyes & removes makeup well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MAKEUP REMOVER FOR 2 YEARS NOW AND I LOVE IT!!!!
works better than the toweletts
"I've been using makeup since I was 2008/09 and my mom always thought the catalog stuff was better than that of the drugstore but honestly its not. She bought me the mary kay makeup remover and this is honestly the same thing and so much more accessible. I've been using this for a few years now and been testing out walmarts/targets, loreals, and garniers makeup removers and they do not compare. If you think this isn't a lot of product heres the trick, buy a little spray bottle and pour it into there. Lasts quite a while."
"I've heard many great things about this product so I decided to give it a try and oh my gosh, this stuff is amazing! I'm a heavy eye makeup user so this stuff is perfect for me! It's very gentle (I have sensitive skin) and doesn't leave a heavy, oily residue like most eye makeup removers do! Definitely give this product a try, it'll change your life :)"
"I love this remover, especially after trying several others at all price points. I have eye allergies and most products bother my sensitive eyes and skin. This doesn't make my eyes sting, I can usually get the waterproof mascara off in two easy swipes. It is not oily, very pleasant scent and feel. It is hands down the only remover I will continue to use."
"This stuff works SO good. It takes off waterproof mascara as advertised, but not only that, my favorite part is that when you wipe the mascara off it doesnt smear to the rest of your face! I love this product it makes taking off makeup not such a chore."
"This is the best drugstore makeup remover that i have tried. The only one i like better is the Mary Kay remover which is pretty much just the expensive version of this one. This is almost an exact dupe!! Absolutely love it! It also lasts a long time,on my 3rd bottle :D"
"If you soak a cotton ball, it removes all the waterproof makeup from both eyes perfectly. It will leave a really greasy residue. I remove my eye makeup before the shower, and before other cleaners, so the greasy effect isn't noticeable. I did try it after the shower to remove the remaining eye makeup, and it felt like i put cooking oil on my face. This is the best waterproof makeup remover I've tried. I just don't like the residue."
"It does the trick for removal, but then you are left with the residue no mater how well you wash. Rinsing with water is a farse, does not remove it all, and the next day, your new mascara is melting during the day. It must have an oil that lingers, and I am watery eyed all day! Used to be a better product, but something has changed!!!"
"I have to use waterproof mascara, regular always comes off and leaves me with raccoon eyes. The remover I've been using is no longer available. Thought I'd give neutrogena a try. Doesn't work at all! Very disappointed"
A good product that removes eye makeup well and doesn't leave oily residue
"Ive been using this makeup remover for years. It's so gentle, but takes off even waterproof mascara without tugging and pulling. It is so much better than Clinique and so much cheaper."
This is my favorite eye makeup remover. Removes the toughest waterproof eyeliner and mascara without burning your eyes. Is definitely worth the money!
"gently takes off even the toughest makeup without tugging, pulling. oil free and doesnt burn or sting, nourishes around the eyes as it removes the war paint!"
"Would you please make the opening of you product finger length! We all spill the liquid all over because you have the opening so big! This has been forever! Just take your finger put it on the opening and waste it all over your hand! We dont use our fingers with pretty little Cotten balls to wash the make up off our face, we're too busy for that stuff! You know this to be true! When I use clinuqe they get the picture...let me buy your prouduct please but as for now I'm over it!"
"This item was recently purchased in hopes it would be a better solution and more gentle form of eye makeup removal than the cleansing cloths. Unfortunately, the product simply didn't remove the eye makeup well. (Please note: eye makeup consisted only of regular, non-waterproof and non-longwearing eyeshadow and mascara, and no eye liners were used)"
"I have been using this product for ages, and I love it! I use waterproof eyeliner and mascara on a regular basis, and finding something that removes it without being harsh is difficult. I put a bit of this oil-free eye makeup remover on a cotton pad, and in a matter of moments I'm free of makeup. True it doesn't instantly remove my waterproof mascara, but regular mascara and even waterproof eyeliner come off in seconds."
This is one of the best products I ever bought. I can't believe i've only been using it for two years when I discovered it. I had to buy some for my sister I liked it so much. She loves it too. it is smooth with no harsh chemicals and cleans my eye area gently even the harshest mascara. My skin feels soft and smooth and no redness. Perfect product . Wouldn't be without it.
"I've tried quite a few make-up removers and a lot of them would take a long time to remove my make-up. This one is great, with one wipe the make-up comes right off. I use this one daily and even recommended it to all the women in my family - my sister and mom use it all the time now too and always ask me to pick some up for them when I go get it."
"This makeup remover is great it takes of long wear mascara however i get a white dry residue around my eyes especially in the corners of my lids, and at times it stings. Is this supposed to happen? Im looking at a new makeup remover which it a real shame because this is a good product. :("
"i used to use some other product, and when i tried to take off my waterproof mascara, i lost soo many eyelashes ): . my mom found this product and gave it to me, and i really like it because after a few swipes, my mascara is gone! (: the only thing i dont like about this is that you have to shake it first :/ i didnt know that and all i got the 1st time was oil :("
This is very effective at removing eye makeup without leaving an oily feeling. I had to buy another top brand once because I couldn't find this product & I hated it. I had to rub so long & hard my eyes hurt. It was like using plain water. I am sticking with this product. Just a few swipes & all my makeup is off. The price is reasonable also.
"I was introduced to this product by a friend almost a year ago and I'm so glad! I'd struggled with makeup removers that either did nothing or were so harsh they caused irritation. This eye makeup remover is so gentle on my eyes yet amazingly effective at getting all makeup off, quickly. The price is amazing value given how long one bottle will last."
"I was looking for something that removes water proof mascara. And this is the product for me. Please do not ever discontinue this product. It is just a tiny bit oily, but i just clean my eye area with warm water. And i wash my face after. So it really is no problem for me. Love it! Thanks Neutrogena Team!!"
"I've tried eye makeup removers from Mary Kay to Merle Norman and this product, by far, is the BEST I've ever used. I wear waterproof mascara and this removes all traces without having to ""scrub"" my eyes. I've also noticed it conditions my eyelashes. The waterproof mascara usually dries them out and causes breakage but since using this I've noticed they are fuller and longer and much less breakage. This is an AMAZING product! Please don't ever discontinue!!! Thank you!!"
"I've had a lot of difficulty finding an eye-makeup remover that doesn't irritate my eyes. Even expensive ones that promised to be very gentle left my eyes stinging well into the next morning. This product by Neutrogena is the first I've found that I can actually use! It leaves my eyes feeling as though they're slightly dry, but this is tolerable and much much better then what products from other companies do. Thank you Neutrogena!"
I have been using this product for a few years and find it to be really gentle. It effectively removes eye makeup (including waterproof mascara) and is not irritating. My eyes are very sensitive so I am grateful to have found an affordable product that works without causing irritation.
"I use waterproof mascara and eyeliner and this makeup remover gets rid of it all, but sometimes it does take a few cotton swabs to get rid of it completely. In addition it kinda does smudge the makeup around your eyes which can get pretty messy. What i love about it is that it doesn't irritate my eyes at all!"
"Takes off makeup really easily, which is great. My only problem with it is that ""Oil-Free"" is a very misleading name for the product - using this makeup remover feels like applying vegetable oil to your face, no exaggeration. I usually have to wash my face with cleanser or mild soap afterward to get rid of the residue. That being said, I haven't found another makeup remover that takes off mascara/eyeliner this easily."
"I wear contacts and always use waterproof mascara. I used to use baby oil to take it off. It worked, but always left a greasy residue that didn't come off easily when followed up with cleanser. This product really does the trick. I am able to remove waterproof mascara quickly and easily with no oily residue. I have used Neutrogena products for some 25+ years and they just keep getting better and better."
This is an excellent product! I have been a user of another eye makeup remover for over 25 years and have never been able to find a better product until recently when I used this oil free eye makeup remover and was thrilled. I find this product to be the best on the market and the price is fantastic! Please place in drugstores as I am not able to find it!!!!
Is one of the best I ever used. removes every drop of waterproof mascara. Love it!
"I love this stuff because it removes eye makeup, it doesn't sting my eyes, and its inexpensive."
"This makeup remover burnt my eyes so much. They got very red, then the inflamation started."
"This eye makeup remover works just as well as Lancome, but why pay the higher price?"
Been using this for years on waterproof mascara. It gets it all off gently
I love this eye makeup remover and i will buy more
Removes waterproof mascara no problem
"This eye makeup remover burns, they need to adjust the formula. The solution feels oily on the skin! WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I love how on the bottle it says no oily residue but every time I use it, it leaves an oily residue on my face."
It's my favorite......definitely recommend this it takes off all of the eye makeup very easily and is easy to use.
works really well. 100% would buy again. i use it to take off my water proof eye makeup and my brow powder
I love this stuff. It is the best I have found. I have sensitive eyes and this product does not burn nor irritate.
This product was promoted while i was watching TV. I felt very dirty cause i could not get off my make-up. With this i was able to get it all and feel clean.
This type of product is my favorite for getting off my eye makeup. I used this and the bottle lasted me a while. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I found that other products do the same thing for a little cheaper.
"i love it but is a little greasy have to wash my face afterwards but overall get the job done nice and smoothly, doesn't irritate my skin at all. and it get all of my eyeliner and mascara off within the first use."
"I love this product because on like baby oil once you used it leaves that oily residue on your eyes. Therefore, this eye makeup remover is perfect, does not irritate my skin nor leaves residue behind once you remove your makeup."
It works great but so does baby oil!! After I use this on my eyes I feel disgusting but the product does work but if you like feeling a greasy monkey around your eyes by all means try this product out!!
"I've used this product for years, so I don't have much to compare it to. But, it works well, always has, and the price is great for the quantity. This is a standard in my bathroom!"
"really, i have tried a few other expensive eye make up removers and they really didnt do anything more! this stuff does the job real well and its inexpensive!!! its all i use now!"
I have tried several different kinds of eye makeup removers and this has been the very best yet. One reason is it dose not leave a residue in my eyes. Also it removes waterproof eye makeup very well. Thanks Kay Jacobs
"Don't get me wrong, this product works great. However, the label reads oil-free but leaves my skin feeling very oily. I do not have oily skin, its typically dry or feels fine. Even looking at the bottle you can see the separation of layers, proving there is an oil substance in it. Maybe a little different labeling?"
"If I compare this product to the makeup remover wipes, I find this product works much better than the makeup remover wipes. The makeup remover wipes dry-out before I am finished using them. What a waste of money! With this product I can use as much or as little as I need. Don't forget. If you purchase this item, purchase the cotton balls too!"
"Love that it takes my makeup off so easily. With just 2 cotton round pads & 3rd but just cause I want to make sure all my makeup came off. Even my waterproof mascara comes off easily without being rough on my eyes. Love that it doesn't burn, nothing. Will definitely purchase again."
"I use the Neutrogena Make-Up remover sheets, but go through them fairly quickly, so I wanted to try their solution. I am happy to say this removes make-up just as well. Not as convenient as the sheets, but will last longer. I'd recommend either products."
"I purchased this product because it was labeled Oil Free, but when I used it, it caused my eyes to feel oily. I have very sensitive eyes and I have to be very careful on what products I use. I have to admit I will go back the product I used in the past."
I've used baby oil to remove my eye makeup for years but decided to try this. I use a lot of Neutrogena products and am very happy with them. This was a little drying for my eyes and I've decided to go back to my baby oil. My 18-year old daughter who wears contacts will use this so it won't be returned. She hates the oily residue after using baby oil whereas it doesn't make me break out and it's like a moisturizer for the skin around my eyes for me.
This eye makeup remover is excellent except for the fact that it does leave a little oily residue on your skin. Anyways the good outshines the bad and I will continue to purchase this product because it works EXCEPTIONALLY well at removing my eye makeup.
"This works amazing and gets off all my makeup every time, however, it is most definitely not oil free. After letting it sit for a while, you can see the oil separating. After using, I have to wash around my eyes with water in order to not feel greasy."
"I wear waterproof eye makeup everyday, and this makeup remover removes everything very well without irritation. I've tried other makeup removers, but I keep coming back to this one. I don't see myself using any other makeup remover. Hope they don't discontinue."
This removes eye make-up very easily esp waterproof eyeliner and mascara. It just takes a little bit on a cotton ball. As some others have said it does leave a bit of a residue but this is the first thing I use at night before I wash my face so the residue is not a problem at all. The other way i use this is if I screw up doing my make-up. Just put some on a q-tip and it fixes the problem easy without having to redo everything. FYI you do need to shake it first bc the liquids separate.
"This is the only makeup remover I use. It works really great. Just put a little on a cotton round, and it really gets everything off easily. It is a little oily, but if you just dab your eyes with some toilet paper after you use it, you should be fine!"
"This is the best! One swipe and all the eye makeup is completely off, no residue left, no stinging and it leaves the area around the eye looking smooth and hydrated. I use a lot of eye makeup and up to now haven't been able to really 'take it all off' without smudging. I'm a total fan of this Neutrogena product."
"I have been using this product for well over a year now. It's a godsend! This cleans off make-eye very quickly without ANY scrubbing, pain, or teary eyes! Even with waterproof mascara! This is the only makeup remover I used now, and have (and will continue to) refer friends to it."
"This product really does work to wipe away your eye makeup, but it is anything but oil-free. It really leaves me feeling dirty, and weighed down."
It Gets all make up off even waterproof makeup but leaves an oily residue behind so you have to wash your face after you use it.
This eye makeup remover takes it all off! Even stubborn waterproof types. It's the best I've ever used.
yes it does leave residue on skin but it says to wash with wash cloth after using. always works no doubt!
I've been using this product for about 8 years and swear by it. You don't need a lot of it to take off your eye makeup either. Great product!!
the oil-free makeup remover works great. it makes my skin feel very nice after using it and has no oily residue.
this product is very effective dont get me wrong but it leaves such a greasy residue that i just could not use it any more.
"This was amazing, it took everything off without any stinging or redness and i even can use it with my contacts, I will continue using this forever!"
"When using this product, I did exactly what is to be done, yet I can't remove my eye makeup without pulling out way too many eyelashes. Overall a bad product. Wobt be repurchasing."
"This product does not work. It leaves an incredibly oily residue, And does tug and pull my mascara. It doesnt even take All of my makeup off. This is a disappointment,"
it always removes my eye make up but it is full of oil i bought it used it once and set it on my counter the nextday i came in all the oil had gone to the top and was floating there and it leaves olily resdius
I've been using this product for several years. It's the only thing I've found that actually gets all of my eye makeup off while leaving my face feeling clean!
I have been using this makeup remover for several years and it works great for all types of makeup including mascara! I have used expensive brands that are similar and this performs just as well for much less money!
"Erasing mascara and eyeshadow has never been sooo easy. Just shake bottle and apply on cloth/cotton ball and erase away! It does leave a soft and oily feeling on my eyelids, but I wash it away with water or face wash. Simple."
"Was this a batch of oily eye makeup remover put into the wrong bottle? It leaves a hard-to-remove oily film on lids,lashes and around eyes no matter how little I used. Ugh"
"A lot of eye makeup removers have made my eyes feel so sensitive! However, this is not so rough around the eyes and it does an amazing job of taking off all my eye makeup and giving me clean skin around my eyes! I am in love!"
"This is the only one I buy. It doesn't dry out your lids, and it washes right off. No tugging necessary - no lost lashes! It also takes off long wear lipstick really well."
It does work well but it feels like my eye got wiped over with baby oil. If it didn't leave such a residue I'd use it again. Very well priced and smells great though. No irritation.
"It takes off any type of makeup, which is why I love it. It leaves so much oil left over, which is why I hate it. I can shake the bottle and dip an oil sheet in it and it gets soaked."
Fantastic product - no greasy residue. Perhaps users who use the product are not shaking before use. I use the waterproof mascara and your remover does an excellent job -- I use cotton pads with your product
"It's so greasy--I can't stand using it. And it does not completely remove my mascara (which is not even waterproof). After using this product, I almost always get mascara particles in my eye. Just terrible. Do not waste your money."
i don't understand why it says oil free... you have to shake it to get the two different liquids to mix together so nasty greasiness isnt the only thing you get on your face. i hate to use it because it leaves my face shiny and greasy
"I ""tried"" this product on a whim... just happen to see it in the check-out at the grocery store. I am amazed, the makeup comes off completely and your skin is really clean after washing with warm water."
"I love this product. Have been using it for many years and will continue to use it. I would be interested to know how people get their waterproof tightliner off. I've been using a q-tip dipped in this remover but then I feel like I have a film in my eyes. It doesn't hurt, I just thought there might be a better way. I've been trying to remove it by dragging the dipped q-tip over my bottom and top tightline. Any suggestions? Still - best makeup remover on the market!"
"I was shocked at the way this came out on my face when I first used it. The bottle says OIL FREE but is if not oily, for sure GREASY!! Even if I will be washing my face afterward there is no reason my face should feel oily after applying a product. You are better off spending your money on another brand."
"ok, so I love neutrogena but this stuff really stinks.. It says no oily residue bit thats basically what it leaves! It is not sensitive to your skin at all especially your eyes! It also takes alot just to remove a little makeup!! Even what the liquid looks like in the bottle looks weird...dOnt buy this!!"
"Excellent affordable remover, always reliable and gentle on my eyes and skin, have had no reactions whatsoever. I struggle a little bit when I have double coat of mascara for party nights (I use waterproof Maybelline and it has staying power!) but for everyday use this is great!"
"I have used this product since it came out, and I can't find anything that compares."
"I love this product, lived at beach got the roughest skin & don't know what I'd do without it."
I ware make up a lot and this is my favorite makeup remover.
First time user of this product and found it works for me!
Takes everything off! and I use primers! It delivers all it says it does :)
Great product. Takes off eye makeup PLUS Covergirl all day last lipstick. Works like magic on the lipstick.
It easily removes eye makeup (even waterproof mascara) without rubbing or pulling. I also like the fact that it's oil-free.
I've used a lot of removers and this one by far works the best. You don't even have to use very much and it takes off everything!!!
This is the best eye make up remover ever. -And the price is resonable. It is comparable to Lancôme but without the pricey tag.
"As what I use to use was no longer available, I started looking and found this to be the best thing I could find."
I use this to remove my water resistant mascara every night. It works so easily and with very little rubbing.
"I've tried all sort of eye makeup removers and this, by far, is the best!! I will never use anything else."
This stuff is great. It is really gentle and doesn't leave your skin feeling oily like some other makeup removers do.
"I used to use CHANEL‘s and LANCOME''s~~and found this one is the best one ever even it feels greasy, it really does its job. Also you need you use cleanser to wash your face after use this, why the greasy feel is a problem?!!??"
"The bottle says 'oil free' but it really isn't. It is so oily and the residue is completely impossible to clean off. When I use it, I use very little, and even then, the oil that they swear isn't in there gets into my eyes."
This product is extremely oily! I literally have to wipe my eyes with a dry cotton pad after using it to get all the oil off! You can even see the oil settling after letting it sit for a while!
"this stuff is actually so extremely greasy and oily, i took off my make up one night, and the next morning my face was really greasy. i would not ever get this again"
"Neutrogena's Oil-Free eye makeup remover is wonderful. It removes every bit of makeup, but leaves no residue. I can apply new eye makeup immediately after using it. It's a terrific product."
it is so easy no tugging or scrubbing.unlike some products there is no need to redo in the AM
This product is not oily and removes your makeup
"My overall opinion: it worked ""ok"""
I've purchased so many of these throughout the years. It's great.
I really like this product it works and does not cause break out as it has no oil.
Good price and great product
"I would recommend this to anyone, it's a very good product."
I've purchased it previously and find it works well.
I can't live more without this product... it is Amazing!!!
Its wonderful. Easy on the skin.
the product removes makeup but left my skin very dry
"It works and it is not too greasy. It works for other make-up, too."
"love this product, greta for taking off waterproof mascara"
"Incredibly effective, cheap and readily available. A great product!"
I just tried this for teh first time and it works great. I love it!
"I love this product, helps rid of my eye products off my eye without irritation."
This says it's oil free but after using it I feel like a greaseball. It's disgusting and tugs at your skin!
I use it with cotton pads for my eye makeup only. Love it . It works just perfect. There is no needs to press or smudge .
Love it!
Didn't care for this product..too oily!! Prefer the makeup remover wipes.
I do not like this product- it is oily and smelled too perfume like
