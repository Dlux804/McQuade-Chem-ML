"I have been using Oil of Olay Lotion for over 37 years!! And have been recommending it for as long, I usually tell young ladies ( My daughters included) to start using it now while you skin is pretty and unlined, and that your face starts from your hairline to your chest!! I am proud to say people believe that I am in my early 40's even though I just turned 57... Oil of Olay! Twice a Day!!!"
"Best face moisturizing lotion, my mother used it daily and she had the softest skin. Doesn't make my face break out great for sensitive skin and just a very light clean scent."
"I use this product every morning and every evening to keep my skin moisturized and to help prevent wrinkles. And, since it is made for sensitive skin, there are no allergic reactions to it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this lotion for years! Non greasy, light, no fragrance, readily absorbed leaving skin soft and smooth. Love that there is no SPF--don't want those extra chemicals on my face. (Don't need SPF because I work indoors during the day.) I cannot find the Olay face moisturizer for sensitive skin in stores, so tried other brands, but they did not absorb completely; they left a residue and/or unpleasant odor. Please put this product back on retail shelves."
"I've tried a lot of different lotions for sensitive skin and always come back to this one. I've learned expensive and more is not always better. It reduces my redness, doesn't sting and has a slight cooling effect. It's also great under powder foundation like Bare Minerals. The one without SPF is harder to find, but Oil of Olay, please keep making it!!!"
Okay is a regular product I use. In winter I can not live without it. My face and neck are so soft and smooth.
"Am impressed that the goods (in green and white box with aloe) were received ahead of time. However, they were not exactly the same goods (in pink and white box without aloe) offered in your website!! I cross fingers they will be ok for my face!!"
"DO NOT BUY !!! You only received 1 lotion not 3, how the desciption said"
Very good product.I have been using Olay moisturizer for many years.Every one that knows me including my Doctor says I look many years younger than I am.
"After trying many other moisturizers, this is hands down the best and most non-irritating. Instantly makes my face smooth and hydrated. Will be using this for the rest of my life, no question."
2 months ago I started using this lotion. My mom used it regularly when I was growing up. I used to love they way she smelled after she applied it. The scent is fabulous!! I love the way my skin feels and I've had several compliments about the way my face looks. I'll take it! Love this!! Thank you Olay
"I have used the original Oil of Olay for over 35 years. When asked way back 35 years ago the secret to my healthy looking skin, I shared with an audience in a beauty pageant that it was Oil of Olay. Why ruin the perfect product now after all these years. Please bring back the original scent because the new scent is no longer original."
It was cheaper in price and not even worth the money I spent.
I like this product.I will recommend this to a friend.
"I tried Oil of Olay years ago but found it still left my face dry; had to apply twice....Not anymore! This is a great moisturizer, and I like that it's not thick and so spreads on nicely. Also, I was easily able to fill a small bottle to take on vacation. It's not SPF so I wouldn't recommend prolonged use in the sun."
"Fantastic for my oily, sensitive, rosaceous skin. Light, spreads so easily, no dragging, sinks into skin, no greasiness, no balling & pilling up, no burning/stinging. No SPF, so GREAT for NIGHT-TIME USE. Very good ingredients. Hygienic bottle packaging, not a jar ! Perfect ! Please DO NOT STOP MAKING THIS. As a matter of fact, INCREASE ITS DISTRIBUTION. It's not found at all stores !"
I have been using Olay Moisturizing Lotion since I was in my early 20's (I'm 63 now). Starting using Sensitive lotion and now I won't use anything else. I was frantic when I could not find it in rural Iowa. I now have to order online. Thank goodness I was able to find it. This is the very best lotion. Works great with any foundation or just alone. I have almost no lines even at my age. I thank Olay for the links to order it online.
i recently bought a new bottle of Original active hydrating. I was disappointed to find out that they changed the fragrance from a soft neutral scent to a much stronger flowery scent. very disappointing. why did they mess with a great product? after 30 years of use i'm now thinking of finding another prooduct.
"I agree with the review below, the cream was an awesome product. I had used it for years. It moisturized my dry skin so well. I also tried this product once they discontinued the cream and it does not even compare to the cream. Olay tried telling me the lotion version offers the same benefits as the cream version did. Why would you have two products that offered the same benefits? By the way they don't, this lotion does not help dryness really. Dry skin needs creams"
"I have been using the Olay Sensitive Skin with UV product for close to 10 years if not longer. It WAS perfect, but when I went to purchase it last week I noticed the box was different. I tried the new formula and it is not for sensitive skin. My face was hot and stinging all day until I splashed it with cool water to get the lotion off. I am very disappointed that the new product is not comparable to the old one that I loved. Now as I sit here typing my face is dry and lotionless, I am going to have to try something else :("
I like the fact that this (sensitive skin) has no perfume that this product absorbs into my skin and that is does not have sunscreen in it.
"My mother used to use this lotion and still does! I started using this lotion and it is the best! If you have a break out this will take it away, which is so weird but great!!"
"I can't find this in any store (without sunscreen), only online!!"
I love this product and have been using it for years... recently it has been extremely difficult to find it anywhere. What's going on? I hope it's not being discontinued. This needs to be back on the shelves like it used to be!
Skin care
"My mom starting using this product back 70's. That's why I also starting using it in my 20's; I knew it was that good. However, since you changed the scent and texture, I'll not be purchasing this product again. Good job, corporate. Looks like from the previous reviews, you've lost a lot of loyal ladies."
"This is a great product for people with skin problems! This product HAS NOT been discontinued. It is still available in a 6 ounce bottle. Don't let others discourage you from trying to buy this product. Look around, buy online if needed, but don't buy into the rumor that this product has been discontinued!"
I have purchased Oil of Olay Complete for 30 + years. This product is absolutely wonderful. I use it everyday and people say I do not look my age. I tell them that is what prolong use of Oil of Olay will do for you. My skin is very soft. Please never discontinue this product.
"I have used Olay beauty fluid ""forever"". I love it because I have sensitive skin & it is not greasey. My problem is I can not find a small bottle (travel size) to carry on a plane. Last time I flew they took my 6.0 oz. bottle from my overnite bag as they said it was to large per their requirements. I have found all minature size of everything else I need/use except my Olay. Please advise, thank you."
"please olay, keep FOREVER. this is a classic and always trusted. my 40 year old teacher uses this and i swear she looks 28 or 29. omg i love this stuff and i hope you keep this around forever... always trusted. from the 50""s and 50 yewars later its still around but please keep it for another 50!!"
"I have been using the active hydrating lotion for years , when i could not find the package with the green lettering i went ahead a bought the one in the yellow package for sensitve skin . I was disapointed . It burned my eyes and it felt heavy on my face . please bring back the old formula ."
"Like so many others, PLEASE bring back the old formula. I have tried the ""Complete"" and it feels heavy and it burns my eyes. Even if you try very hard to not get it in your eyes sometime during the day you will rub your eyes and then the burning will start. And the new product does not work as well. I am about to start looking for another product that will work as well as the old Olay. But I really do not want to but when I run out, I guess I will have to"
I have been using the original beauty fluid lotion since I was 18 years old. I am now 44 years old. No one believes my age. I am told I look not a day over 30 years of age. Thank You Oil of Olay!
Olay recommended this since they discontinued the cream. This is nothing like the cream. This does a horrible job on someone with dry skin. We need thick creams. Please bring back the cream version. Why would you discontinue a classic product
I've used oil of olay for 25 years. In the last year you've changed it so it goes on like Vaseline. At the end of this bottle I'm looking for another product unless you go back to the old formula. Also the new packaging makes it look like a cheap Chinese knockoff product - I wasn't sure I'd got the genuine product at first it was so nasty.
I have used Oil of Olay for 40 years. The new formula stinks so bad that I cannot use it and it is so thick that it no longer feels refreshing and light on my face. I HATE the new formula - please go back to the old one. Until then you have lost a loyal customer. Wish I could give it 0 stars.
"I happened upon an original style pink bottle of Olay in my Arizona grocery store. (used to be called Oil of Olay when I was younger). I had always liked it years back, and the price was great, so I thought I'd try it again. It smells the same which I always loved, and the fluid was the same as before. This doesn't clog my pores, and actually improved the look of them. Very pleased, and will stay with this great old friend."
"Why would you change the formula and fragrance? I have used Oil of Olay for 30 years because my mother taught me to, as she always had before me, and now my daughter uses it. But we won't use it anymore, I opened a new bottle and the smell was horrid and the cream was thick and unpleasant. Garbage. Please bring back the perfectly good product you had."
I have been using Oil of Olay every day for 44 years (since I was 16). I have always loved the scent and the way the lotion feels on my skin. Today I opened a new bottle and was horrified by the new scent. I also didn't like the feel of the lotion on my face & neck. Please bring back the original formula as soon as possible. I won't be using the new version of the Oil of Olay. I am going to return the bottle I have bought for a refund.
"I am 61 years old and have used Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid daily for 42 years. I have always loved the light feel and scent of Oil of Olay and I attribute my clear and wrinkle-free complexion to daily use. I recently bought a new bottle of Oil of Olay. When I applied it, I immediately felt a difference. The new formula is thick, hard to apply and it doesn't absorb quickly. Gone are the light feel and scent that I love. I am so disappointed! PLEASE bring back the old formula!"
"Like others, I recently opened a new bottle & thought it had become rancid. I looked up the shelf life & that's when I found all of these negative reviews. I will no longer buy this product. This saddens me as I have used it for decades. The original formula was light and refreshing, something rare in most facial lotions. Your team needs to listen to the public on this one."
"I have used Oil of Olay for years and this new scent & formula is the reason I will not be buying Olay products again. The original Olay is what made your company famous and now you have totally ruined it by changing the scent! Your signature fragrance and original formula made your company famous! You have ruined it for me and alot of your faithful customers! I have read many similar reviews & I know I am not alone in this! If you care, PLEASE listen!"
"Fast absorbing, fragrance free, non-greasy, non-irritating, no UV blockers. Can be used by almost any skin type. I use it morning and night. In the dry winter months, it's great as a base moisturizer under a more intense moisturizer. I have acne and am on prescription Retin-A which makes my skin very sensitive. This moisturizer is very basic (without harsh fragrances and UV blockers) and is beneficial to my skin. I hope Olay always produces this Sensitive Skin moisturizer."
"I have been a loyal customer for many many years. As was my sister, daughter, mother, & grandmothers. I can't even begin to explain how upset & disappointed I am! Why in the world would you go and ruin such a beloved classic! I really don't know what I will do without it, but the new formula & scent are terrible! Please please go back to the original formula! So very disappointed!"
"I have been using the original oil of olay for over 45 years. I recently bought a bottle and took it back to get my money back because I thought it was spoiled, it smelled horrible. I bought another and the same thing. Took it back and tried one more time. It stinks also. It used to feel refreshing like water. Now it feels like any other lotion."
"I've been using this since high school and I recently replaced a bottle and WOW! The fragrance was absolutely disgusting. Like junior high perfume that gives you an instant headache. Even after washing my face, I can still smell it, it's so overpowering. I am so disappointed. Taking it back to the store."
"I have been buying Oil of Olay products for years. The scent was what I came to know as the Olay signature. I purchased a new bottle thinking I was getting what I was used to and ""yuck"" the scent upon opening the bottle was awful. I won't use it and will take it back to the store."
"The new scent is so overwhelming and disgusting. I loved the active hydrating beauty fluid but will no longer continue to use it. I called Olay to voice my opinion and they sent me a coupon to try another one of their products. Sorry, it's not the same. My skin loved the original formula. Why on earth would you change such an iconic item? I'm now one of the many customers you lost due to this change."
"Been using this product for decades. When I opened the last container I thought it had gone rancid and threw it out. Bought another, then realized it was a new scent. It's awful :( The scent for years has been soothing and signature. Definitely looking for a new product"
"I have used Oil of Olay for more than 40 years, and managed to survive the last time you ""improved"" the product. I opened a new bottle of ""Original"" the other morning. The smell annoyed me, but then my skin itched and little red pimples popped up on my cheeks. Immediately, I washed my face, reapplying with my sensitive skin sun screen Olay. Please pull this monstrosity and return the TRUE Original to the shelves. As others have written here, I do not know what other product to use."
"Frankly this New Look product Sucks!! It stinks !! Just like the product you tried to introduce years ago , it is Not The Same Product!! I am spending a fortune buying up any of the “Original” that I can find...why ? New mgmnt? You are joking about this (Example: review ) below .. right? I have used Olay Original since my 20's I feel that as a Loyal consumer of this product I have been betrayed."
"I am 68 years old, and have used this all my life (as did my mother). The ""new"" product's odor is terrible. I had to immediately wash it off. Cannot tell you how disappointed I am since I did use this every day. Have no idea what I will use now. Actually heartbroken."
"What on earth is going on? After using the same REGULAR (pump) foaming face wash for yrs, it changed & I've scoured everywhere buying up the prev. version. THEN pink cream ribbons body wash changed w/choices of lavendar, strawberry & other ridiculous scents. Ew, I'm not 90 or 12. NOW - you've messed with the ULTIMATE product of all? The original beauty fluid?? When I opened my new bottle, I actually thought it was counterfeit bc it smelled so bad. 20+ years & I am officially done. Sad, really."
"For almost 50 yrs. Oil of Olay has been the only daily moisturizer I've used. I've recommended it to family & friends-especially when they made nice comments about my skin.Sad to say, I no longer recommend it & have gone to the generic instead. Why? Because of the awful smell it has now. Olay has expanded the line (and I use one of the Regenerist night creams) so why the need to make such a drastic change in your core product? Makes no sense. Goodbye to my Oil of Olay..makes me sad."
"I have been using this classic for thirty years and always have a few boxes stowed away ready for use. I just opened a box and thought something was wrong with the product or that I had purchased the wrong formula....so disappointed because I can't use this new, chemical smelling cream....you can't call it origianl olay because it is not!"
"I'm really disappointed that Olay's Original Beauty Fluid is no longer ""original."" It is not the same product anymore and it smells like dead flowers were harvested from a racquetball court. I will not be buying this product again unless it is changed back."
"After using for 40 plus years, I was shocked when I opened a new bottle and immediately smelled a ""petroleum"" odor. I thought the bottle was bad and returned to store for a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement smelled just as bad. I am VERY disappointed and will not be buying this again."
"On first use from a new bottle, I noticed the change in scent. It has a bad ""chemical"" smell now. The old scent was light and floral--just right. I've used this product for 20+ years. My daughter has always told me, since childhood and now as an adult, how much she loves the way I smell, and that is from the original scent of Oil of Olay--I don't use any other beauty products or perfumes. Please change the scent back. I've called the 800 # and asked for my money back and voiced my opinion."
Please return to the previous formula. I purchased the lotion recently expecting the familiar scent and immediately noticed the new fragrance. To me it has an almost acrid odor— a very strong chemical smell like petroleum/gasoline. I had to immediately rinse it off. I looked online to see if it had been recalled. I was relieved to see that others had a similar reaction about a change to the scent. Please be aware that the change is noticeable and I am not able to use the product. Thanks.
The new fragrance and formula are a disappointment at best. The lotion doesn't feel the same and the fragrance is not pleasant. After 50 years of continued use my skin is youthful looking but I won't be using the replacement product. Nor will my daughter and daughter in law as they feel the same way. I will have to search for a new moisturizer.
I have used Oil of Olay since I was 14. I recently purchased a new bottle after running out and immediately noticed the scent has changed. Why? Part of the reason I love Oil of Olay is because of the scent. Why change something that doesn't make it any more effective. I know a lot of woman will feel the same way. Please go back to the original scent.
"Something's WRONG... I've used Olay beauty fluid for 19+ years! Loved the fresh lite scent and the many complements on my 45+ years youthful skin. BUT recently, I ran out and purchased a new bottle. Immediately I noticed a difference. The label had no image of the lady's face or gold emblem. I also noticed the lotion was different and the smell was a rose-scent. I used it once; but I want my money back! WRONG MOVE in changing such a great product. Not Happy... OLAY!"
"I've used Olay beauty fluid for 20 years with wonderful results, but I have noticed a change. The USA-only packaging looks like a cheap knockoff: the label has no image of the lady's face, the font is altered, Olay doesn't carry the Registered symbol, and there's a typo on the box (sooth). Most importantly, the cream seems greasier and it's very rose-scented. I don't want to use on my face because it's all I can smell for the next hour. Sadly, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer. What happened!?"
"My two daughters and I love this amazing original Olay product. Not only does it smell delicious and makes our skin very relaxing and smooth but we especially love the fact that we don't sweat wearing it. Would you ever consider making a smaller size so my daughters can carry it in their makeup bag? Yes, they carry the 4 oz already but we hope there is a smaller size. Thanks"
"My skin turns red hot and gets little red spots with EVERYTHING that has SPF in it, and everything does these days, I know it is important to protect your skin from the sun, so I guess stores stopped carrying this due to the SPF demand. I have tried everything and then posted on FB and someone linked me this site. I used this product all my life, until the stores stopped stocking it. My skin was always youthful and soft, never greasy looking. THANK YOU OLAY!"
"I'm a woman with SLE, and my facial skin is very sensitive and prone to rash. Regular water-based moisturizers are extremely painful and irritating, even ones that claim to be for sensitive skin. Olay's Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid is the only product that has kept me from looking like I ran face-first into sandpaper. The only thing missing is a little SPF protection. If anyone can recommend an oil-based SPF moisturizer similar to this, I'd like to try it."
"I am extremely disappointed that Olay has stopped selling Sensitive Skin cream and other Sensitive Skin Product. This product is simple lotion and does not work as a night cream. The cream was wonderful. The lack of fragrance makes this product, desirable. They should expand this product line. There is absolutely no reason a facial product should have a fragrance in it. Fragrances are skin irritants and airway irritants, as well as pollutants."
"I've been using oil of olay original beauty lotion (in the pink bottle) for more than 35 years,I am now in my middle 50's&(look like I'm in my late 30's) &I have the softest,smoothest,healthy looking skin.I will never use anything else&i don't care about all the stuff they try to sell you on t.v. or at expensive department store counters.I love ""oil of olay in the pink bottle.it is certainly a CLASSIC."
"I'm 50. I have used this since I was 14...I'ts the only one for me. The Product have been able to buy in any beautystore in Sweden all this years, but suddenly now it's inpossible to find. You can't even find it in internetshops in Sweden. Not in store, sold out, item has been discontinued...What's happened??? I'm desperate! Regards Miriam"
"I've been using original oil of olay hyderating lotion for many,many,many many years,I love how it makes my skin soft&smooth&with a nice glow&it has a great scent also.i'm 55yrs old,but I have a beautiful complexion.I hope they don't change or try to improve this wonderful. Original lotion,because its just wonderful the way it is.&they need to keep the original name""OIL OF OLAY""now its just ""olay"""
"I've been using oil of olay hydrating. Lotion(pink bottle) for nearly 32 years,I am 53 &it leaves my skin soooo soft,smooth,with a nice little glow,I am 53 &look 33.I don't wear sloth of make up,ol like the natural look,Also get a lot of compliments on. How young&gorgeous I look_(i even get carded at some night clubs)"
"I just turned 70 years old. I have used this product for at least 50 years. I have been told that I look the same as when I was 50 years old and my skin is beautiful. I attribute this to my use of oil of olay pink, as I call it. I was in Las Vegas recently and a salesperson was trying to sell my daughter cell replacement serum and she told me I did not need it!! What a compliment!! I wish I could attach a photo of my birthday picture."
I have been using Oil of Olay since age 20. My grandmother used it and she was always complimented on how young she looks. I am now 48 and people say I look 30. This product is getting harder to find which is really very sad since I have sensitive skin and a replacement is VERY hard to find. I don't want to wear the SPF version before I go to bed or if I know I am going to be indoors all day. I hope Proctor & Gamble gets what I am saying and makes this product more readily available!
"I have used Oil Of Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin for years. I am allergic to other types of moisturizers. My only complaint that it is hard to find in stores. I am 75 yrs and honestly, look 10 yrs. younger...that is what I am always told by those who don't know me and my age when they find out. I am proud to be 75. And, a good moisturizer cleanser and moisturizing lotion I believe has helped to keep my skin looking very young. Very few wrinkles or creases!"
"This lotion has been used by my great grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, my aunts, my cousins, myself and now my daughter My great grandmother was already in her 60s when she started to use Oil of Olay. My mother was in her early 20s and today does not look her age. I've tried other brands, some much more expensive, but the results were about the same. At 56, I am told my skin is in better condition than many 30 year olds. Thank-you Oil of Olay"
"It goes on & bam ur face it like brand u!! It helps your face feeling it just amazing, I mean a face like u thought before, smooth softer than u felt u days advance. I mean try it & see.how it u feel I never like saying before but ur face never get good!!"
"This moisturizer is so light and super hydrating. I use it every night after cleansing with the Gentle Clean Foaming Cleanser. I love how soft this makes me feel, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I only wish it were easier to find. I rarely see it in stores, and I usually have to order it online."
"I love how this smells and feels great on my skin. A friend told me about it so I'm trying it out, but it hasn't been that long so I m waiting for results. Keep the size that you have but get a smaller size as well to keep with you, which really the size that you have isn't that big either. Thank you."
"Thank you Olay for making such an amazing product! I have a super sensitive skin and have tried everything for many years (yes almost all expensive and non-expensive brands) before I started using this beauty fluid - it works like magic on my skin. My mom started using this product since she was in Grade 6 and she hooked me to this product and I'm in love now. It smells great too! Please do NOT change the ingredients. One request: we need a travel size for this. Thank you, Olay - I'm in love!"
"I love this product and have used it for years. At age 65 I still get complements on my youthful skin. BUT I wish it came in a 3 ounces or less travel size! I travel for business dozens of times a year using only carry on luggage, and I have to pour the Olay into a smaller bottle to take it with me on the airplane (and it doesn't pour well). If the company reads these reviews, please consider making a 3 ounce size!"
"I've been using this product since I was 15 and it's the only one that works for my combination skin. I've tried several others over the years but there's always something that feels wrong about them - too oily, too thick, too heavy, too expensive, etc. I've always returned to the classic Oil of Olay, and have stopped trying other products. Now I'm 46 years old, and I can't say how many times I hear the comment, ""You never age!"""
I was introduced to this miracle cream by my mother when I was young and since then I've had periods where I've tried replacing it. Every time I failed. There simply isn't anything better! This beauty fluid is an addiction -for my skin and I'll admit I panicked when I stopped finding it in Sweden. Desperate I recently ordered it from abroad wondering if that's my new routine. The rumor is that this product was discontinued in Scandinavia but no one has been able to verify this. Is this true?
"My mother introduced Oil of Olay beauty fluid to me and my younger sister when we were young and the three of us have been using this product all our lives. Neither of us could ever think of using another product. Sadly it seems like the beauty fluid is no longer avalible in Sweden, where we live. Are you still producing this product? Where could we buy it, if not from Sweden?"
When I turned 16 my mother let me start wearing makeup and gave me a tube of mascara and bottle of Oil of Olay. It has been part of my daily routine ever since. Fast-forward 30 years and people NEVER guess my true age. When I say I'm 46 many times people don't believe me and insist on seeing my driver's license. I ALWAYS attribute it to this product and tell younger women I meet to start early with it. Inexpensive and it WORKS! I could easily be an ‘average person' spokeswoman for this product!
When I purchased this product it came two in a package. I thought I would have enough for a while. I tried using it twice but the scent is so terrible that I had to wash it off right away. I've used Olay for many years and always loved the product but very disappointed with this one not only because of the money I laid out but for the terrible smell. I wonder if there isn't something wrong with this batch.
I have used the original Olay Beauty Fluid since I was 12 years old. My mother used it every day and she would share here with me. I am now 49 years old and still use the same original lotion every day on my face and body! I am told I look like I am in my 30's and I truly believe I have Olay Beauty Fluid original to thank for it. Please don't ever change the scent or makeup of the product. It is fabulous!!!
"i started using Olay as a young girl because I used to get sunburned really bad. My nose got the worst of it, so much so I looked like I had brown paint on my face. Once I discovered Olay the nightmare was over. From then on I got compliments for beautiful skin. Today, I still use only Olay. Thanks Team Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am extremely unhappy with this product. I started using this lotion in my early teens and have since introduced it to my husband and then eventually to our own teenage children. We have been faithful users for many years and for our loyalty, are left looking for another product. The changes you made to this moisturizer are immediately noticed and felt. It is unfortunate, to say the least."
I Tend to use this one at night and on those winter days when there's no chance of my being outdoors for long. It keeps my skin from drying out due to the drying heat necessary indoors in New England! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product daily for over 40 years. I have tried others when this became difficult to find in stores. Nothing is as light, nourishing and non greasy. I now order it online. Even as a sun worshiper in past years, my skin looks much younger than most my age."
"As a young woman with very sensitive skin, I love this product as is because it is light and thin, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy, as lotions with sunscreen do. It makes my face feel well-hydrated and supple, and causes no irritation, and I appreciate the option of having a facial lotion that does not contain sunscreen. I will continue to buy it as long as I live and the product is available. I highly recommend this facial moisturizer!"
"I love this moisturizer! I've tried several other products but have always come back to this one. It's non-greasy and sinks right into my skin in no time at all, perfect for busy mornings when I'm crunched for time. It's just enough moisturization, even for my dry/sensitive skin. I especially love that is has spf 15 in it since my skin is fair."
"It's not too good of quality compared to other lotions that I've tried from clinique and neutrogena. The fragrance doesn't suit me, but that's just preference. I guess it does do the job and moisturize overnight, which is when I apply it (right after I've taken my shower). My primary dislike is that it feels heavy on my skin."
I've been using Oil of Olay Original since I was in my mid-teens. I'm 54 now. I have sensitive skin and this is the only lotion I can use without braking out into a rash. I put it on my face and hands every day. I couldn't find the original lotion in the store the other day and I almost cried. Please don't stop supplying this product to the stores.
"I need the original. HAS IT BEEN DISCONTINUE ? I am 71 years old and have been using this product for years. I have no wrinkles on my face and people ask me what I use. OLAY THE PINK ONE, THE ORIGINAL. Please do not discontinue. I need this moisturizing lotion."
"I have oily, acne prone skin and this is the only moisturizer I can use that doesn't cause breakouts. It soothes my sensitive skin year round. I love that it doesn't have fragrance or spf, two things that irritate my skin horribly. Thank you so much for this product, it's a lifesaver!"
"I'm sensitive to Titanium Dioxide. I don't think the original lotion included it, nor does the scented version. I purposely avoid most sunscreen because of Titanium Dioxide. I'm not sure why you insist on adding it to this lotion. Titanium Dioxide can also discolor clothing. That's probably why you have another reviewer on here who's upset about his ruined shirts."
"I use to use the Oil of Olay products for many, many years. Then the product came out with more fragrances and I could not use them as I am sensitive to them. I purchased this product yesterday, put it on my face today and had to remove it immediately, due to the smell. I'm taking it back later today or tomorrow and try to find another fragrance-free product by Olay."
"I have used Oil of Olay for 40 years and I have very few wrinkles. I have to use the SPF now because I had a little cancer on my nose about ten years ago,because of to much sun. But other than that my skin is in great shape especially for my age. My daughter who smokes's skin has more wrinkles than I have. Fay"
"I remember my mother using this when I was a child. Product is light and I love the smell. I started using it at age 16. Since turning 30 I have bumped up to the Total Effects line, but still occasionally go back to the old tried and true original. Hopefully my skin will look as good as my mother's when I am her age."
"I have been using the Original facial moisturizer since I was in my teenage years. I use it everyday, and honestly a lot of people tell me I do not look 51 years old. So that just tells you that it is a GREAT product. I will never stop using it. Thank you Olay"
"I have been using Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid Lotion - Original over 20 years. When I was working I was in & out of the weather often, my skin is very sensitive & this lotion kept my skin very soft and youthful. Many people I meet cannot believe my age. My skin feels moist all day, I wash my face at night & reapply the lotion at night. I love this lotion."
I have been using the Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid Lotion every morning along with the Olay Age Defying Night Cream as was recommended to me on the Online Questionnaire. I have used it for the past 41/2 months(that is how long the jars lasted me) and I no longer suffer from dry skin and my wrinkles have either disappeared or decreased. I am 47 years old and for the first time I don't have facial dry skin and do look younger. Based on these products I highly recommend Olay.
I've used this for decades & up until menopause it was great but now going to switch to the regenerating/age defying product line. Noticing eyelid dryness not helped by this product & acne is a continuing challenge. Had to stop Proactiv for cost reasons- coming back to Olay.
"This is the best lotion I have tried. Sinks in nicely. Loovvvee that there is no fragrance and is not sticky. I use at night and wake up to fresh, bright skin. Wish it was sold in more stores and hope it is never discontinued. Now if I could only find one this good with SPF I would be set. Thanks Olay great product!!!"
"I have been using Oil of Olay's Hydrating Beauty Fluid for 35 years, since I was a teenager. I am starting to use other Oil of Olay products now. I get told regularly that I look like I could be a sister to my 3 daughters. It keeps my skin looking and feeling very young. I have tried other moisturizers once in a while, only to come back each time to Oil of Olay. This is the best."
"this is like a fragrance free version of the olay complete night fortifying cream! i love that it comes in a bottle. it's so gentle and non-irritating, the ingredients are great and my skin loves it! vitamins e, b3 & b5, aloe, chamomile, green tea.... great stuff. i use it at night with my olay eye gel and use my olay complete uva/uvb lotion for sensitive skin in the morning. i'm so happy that olay offers fragrance free products!!! :)"
My grandmother turned me on to Oil of Olay over 30 years ago and I have been using it everyday since. I love that it is not greasy and soaks into my skin. I'm NEVER without it. I always have a bottle in my purse and it goes where I go. Living in the desert you have to use some type of moisturizer and I am so thankful that grandma gave me this gift that I will always treasure. Thank you Oil of Olay!
"The classic pink beauty fluid was originally recommended by a dermatologist friend. After years of using this product, with forays in to other, more expensive and time-consuming skin care regimes, I find myself consistantly returning to Olay classic moisturizer. My skin feels and looks good with regular use, that's all I ask!!"
"This is the perfect everyday moisturizer for me - I am 23 and have dry, sensitive skin - Olay's beauty fluid feels great as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a heavy, greasy feel. I have noticed an improvement since using this product - in the depth of my expression lines. Will continue to purchase, thanks Olay!"
"My 83 year old grandmother used this product all my life. I began using it in my teens, because she was the youngest looking grandmother I knew. 2 strokes later, she's still the youngest looking 83 year old I know, and at almost 33 I still get carded for rated R movies. Non greasy for my oily skin, and doesn't break me out like most other Olay products I've tried. The original is still the best!"
"I love the original Olay fluid better than any other moisturizer they make, but wonder what happened to the Olay for Sensitive skin that DOESN'T have UV spf in it. I cannot find it anywhere, and have to use original Olay because I have a reaction to most things with any sort of sunscreen in it. This is a good substitute if you are not making it anymore, but please consider bringing it back. I know of at least 3 other ladies in my area that are looking for it and would love to be able to find it again."
"Not familiar with the previous version of this product, as I am a new user, but I have been very happy with it as it is now. I have acne and I dry my skin with products to clear it up. This moisturizer works really well to rehydrate my skin so it doesn't over compensate and produce more oil (and therefore less acne)."
"Please bring back the cream version of active hydrating sensitive skin! The lotion is not the same! It does not provide the same moisturizing benefits as the cream. The original cream (non sensitive version) is pink and it stinks! I would never use it on my face. If I can't buy the active hydrating cream sensitive skin, I will not buy any Olay product."
"I agree with the reviews below. Olay really doesn't offer a good heavy cream for dry, sensitive skin anymore since they pulled the cream version of this product. They have recommended to me the fragrance free version of the total effects but it is still more of a lotion type of product. Those of us with dry skin like those thick creams. Olay, please bring back or come up with a new cream for dry sensitive skin."
I have tried many different facial products even different olay facial products but nothing has worked like this product. My skin is very sensitive and this product works amazingly. Skin is silky soft now. I would recommend this product to anyone with even sensitive skin.
"I have used this product for several years, but then went to purchase another bottle and saw that the packaging had changed. I was so hoping the lotion hadn't changed, but it did. I loved the old lotion and like others was all I could use. The new lotion makes my skin and eyes burn. It also has an irritating fragance. Please, please bring the old lotion back."
"Grew up using Oil of Ulan which transpired into Olay. This is the only skin care I have used and grade it excellent however I purchased a pottle of Olay in the USA in April and the smell is slightly ""old motel wet synthetic carpet"" Returned to NZ and purchased Olay Complete, made in Thailand and the mild perfume is so much more acceptable. Why? Lived in USA for many years and only now after returning to NZ notice the difference. (Still have the US container)"
"I have used this product for 40 years, religiously, everyday. I would not think of putting any other cream or mosturizer on my face. I have not even used a sunscreen, relying successfully on the SPF protection in this product. Comparatively speaking, my skin is younger looking than most women my age or even younger. I need only minimal make-up to achieve my everyday look. Thank you Oil of Olay!!!"
"Everyone I know can tell you... This is the only moisturizer I will use. I have tried others only to have my loyalty to this product confirmed. Others are usually too heavy, seep into my eyes and coat my contact lenses, and often give me what looks like rosacea. Even the Olay Complete irritates my skin with stinging. Please don't discontinue this product. It is the only one I will ever use!"
"I have been using your ACTIVE HYDRATING BEAUTY FLUID -ORIGINAL for 20 years and recommended it to everyone. My two daughters have been using it since high school, about 8 years. My husband uses it too. It is a perfect product. No irritants, no residue and mild for all skin types. We love it!"
What happened? This product was amazing and smelled great and felt great. NOW it is really not good. Please go back to old formula. The new formula is sticky and smells bad
"PLEASE DONT DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT and PLEASE MAKE IT MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN STORES! It is lightweight, non-sunscreen and fragrance free. Perfect for sensitive skin."
Why would you change a perfect product? The new formula is horrible & the new smell is disgusting. Are you even listening to your customers? Do you care?
"Have used this as a loyal customer for years, just like my mum. Loved it, loved the scent. Hate the smell of the new product. Now I have to find another, good work clever marketing folk. Were you not selling enough?"
"AS a user myself and with medical degree ,I can say that this product is better than lots of very expensive ""serums"" ,lotions...Please note this is without SPF and IDEAL for night use"
I've been using Olay of Olay everyday for about 35 years. The Sensitive Skin is the only one I've found that doesn't irritate my skin and make it swell up. I use it especially after shaving (I'm a guy) as it keeps my skin from drying out.
The best skin product I have used on my face. My Mother and mother-in-law law both in their 80s have used this and have always looked 20 to 30 years younger. No exaggeration.

"Been useing this for two years now. Absolutely love this works great, smells wonderfull, and does not feel sticky or greasy at all.and sold at a amazing price. Highly recommended for you to RUN and start useing."
I had very bad dry skin from the cold weather and cold air and my face was basically chapped. The product took it away in less than 2 days. I even tried a rx my Dr gave me and it didn't work this good.
I've been using this product for many many years I wash my face with dove than use oil of Olay nobody believes lm going to be 60 I look so much younger thanks to oil of Olay
I have been using Olay moisturizer for years but not only myself but my mother as well. The moisturizer feels like silk on my face and the smell is so wonderful and a comforting smell from my childhood.
I have very sensitive skin and have been able to use Olay Moisturizing Lotion - Sensitive for many years. It doesn't irritate my skin like other products and goes on smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for along time and would'nt change. It gives me the results I want and need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just wanted to know if this product has changed ? it seems soo light in texture and is just watered down type lotion, something like from the dollar store. I want the old one back."
"Where is the original sensitive with sunscreen, in the jar? I can't find it! The pour bottle is not the same product, it's much thinner. Return the jar as originally produced!"
"I've used this lotion for more than 25 years. Everything these days has SPF in it, but I'm allergic.I hope this product NEVER gets discontinued, but worry it will because I have trouble finding it sometimes. I'll be 52 in August"
I've been using this for 25 years on my face for my hands elbows and feet. Wouldn't use anything else. keeps my face smooth and soft and my heels no longer crack.
It's a lil heavy feeling like you know you just put lotion on but it tends to fade in a couple minutes. Most of all need to improve on the smell of it. It don't smell very good if the smell of it was way better I would continue to get.
"I have been using this for years because my skin is sensitive and I can't use anything with SPF. When I smooth this on, my face just drinks it up and it feels divine. I hope you won't discontinue making this because I would be lost without it."
I am a twenty-four year old with combination skin and I use this every morning after I cleanse. It's wonderful because it doesn't make my skin feel greasy in the oily parts and doesn't under-hydrate my dry cheeks. I enjoy this product...yes I do.
I am 32 and have been using Olay since I was 12. I have tried other brands that are more expensive and promise too much. I always come back. This does not clog pores and it's not greasy. I love it!!
Is this moisturizer discotinued or is it have a new name. PLEASE used this product for over 10 years. Its my fave this is the BEST ever found.for my face thank you.
I have been using this for years - my grandmother gave it to me when I was in high school and she noticed my dry skin. I love it! It is just right - not too greasy and not too light.
"Best product ever, i stopped using it for a month or two and had so much acne when i never ever had it. Then realized it istarted using it again and within weeks it is so clear and i love it! I am so happy with this product!"
"I am extremely disappointed in the formula change for this product! I have used olay for years, but this new formula stings my skin and has an unpleasant odor. Please bring back the old formula!"
I have used Olay since I was 17 and it shows. I have been told I don't look my age and I know why. 55 is beautiful and I will continue to use Olay its my little beauty secret that I love.
"I love this lotion, it is light, non-greasy, and it doesn't make me break out. I hope they never change the formula because it is perfect as is! Great for soothing sensitive skin like mine. Thanks Olay!"
"Non-greasy, quickly absorbed and light. I've been using it for years and love it."
Love this lotion because it leaves my face very smooth especially for those with very sensitive skin.
Love this non greasy lotion. I just wish it came in a travel size so that I could use it when I travel with just carry on luggage.
"Clean feeling, moisturizes without leaving your face oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"like the moisturizer, goes on smooth and not greasy. also like that its fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This hydrating fluid is perfect for my dry skin, and it's totally non-greasy and really absorbs into the skin. Not expensive at all. Thank you Olay!"
This product is very good and good results i would never use any thing different x [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer seems thin and kind of watery. I will purchase Olay again but might try a different product, maybe the Regenerist."
I use this daily for years and love it. But now i found out I can not use anything with soy. Dose anyone know if it has soy.
"I could not find it in the store. So I ordered online. It was here on the second day. Great service, I,d say."
Have been using this product for 30 years now and when I tell people my age they can't believe it just love Olay!
"This is an excellent product for beginners. It is very moisturizing, but not greasy at all. I just wish it contained a high SPF."
I have been using this product every day for 46 years. My mother had always used it so as a teenager I began using it and LOVE IT ! ! !
"incredible results, something about it has been changed over the years, doesn't work as well anymore. My mother who is now 58 swore by it."
I can remember my grandmother using it! She made me a believer! I am 40 and no wrinkles so far!! Look forward to using it every night.
"This product changed ingredients in early 2015. It was spectacular until then and my daughters and I used it all the time. The ingredients listed above on the website are the old, GOOD ingredients. PLEASE bring them back!!"
Please expand this product with a moisturizing cream for sensitive and a sensitive night cream.
I tried several types of lotions and nothing has worked like this product has.
"The Scent is very fresh, I didn't experience any redness or irritation, with this product"
I would like to use on a regular vasis in the winter. And for my face to get the full effect.
I love how the product leaves my skin feeling. Soft and moisturized!
I tried everything but this is minimize my pores than anything else...!
"Used forever thru dryness, stress, hormones, & acne."
I have used the orginal beauty fluid for over 45 years and my skin is still soft and wrinkle free!
"Light, not greasy, absorbs easily, feels silky smooth"
"I use Olay than the expensive salon's, and very satisfied."
