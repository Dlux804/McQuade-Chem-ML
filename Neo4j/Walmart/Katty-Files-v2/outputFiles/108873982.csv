"I'm a big fan of Olay 7 Signs products. Many people think I am much younger than my actual age as a result of Olay products, healthy eating, and staying hydrated. I'm in my 50's."
"No real cleansing, but wonderful. Even have my husband using it. PS, don't use foaming formula, NOT as good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sincerely speaking! My mum cannot do without this product, she literally influenced me in loving this particular product. Nice packing as well Speaking of expectations -mind blowing if my mum cannot do without this product for someone that is a bit picky, then trust me its the best"
"Favorite face wash for now. Takes off all my make-up, including mascara, effortlessly with no rubbing. My face does not feel tight after using it which indicates that it does not strip my skin of its natural oils. These came in time and were packaged nicely"
Okay total effects is what I use daily and I use the face wash that goes with it. Your face will be radiant after a couple days. I recommend this if you want beautiful looking skin.
Good product for your money....dont need to spend a fortune on it. Was very happy with this product. Sometime the big name product dont work on everyone. It very gentle . You can use it on sensitive skin.
"Im not loyal to a cleanser, but Olay is my top drugstore brand. And Total Effects is my go to line. This cleanser is divine. I like for a cleanser that gets my makeup off without leaving my skin feeling dry. This cleanser leaves my skin feeling like heaven while completely removing my makeup."
"Olay Total Effects Cleanser is a great every day cleanser. It foams nicely, it smells very mild and gets my makeup off. The cleanser washes off easily leaving my face feeling clean and rid of my days dirt and grime. Using Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Facial Cleanser has boosted my skins health. My makeup looks so much smoother after using this cleanser."
Gentle. Feels clean without stripping natural oils. Still feel like I have to follow up with a makeup remover wipe to ensure residue isnt left on my skin...
I love using this as my base cleanser. It lathers on well and it doesnt make my face feel dried out after use. My face feels much cleaner and there isnt any build up. I have total confidence in this cleanser!
"This is also a great cleanser that I love. It foams into a creamy lather and smells amazing, I have used this product quite frequently. It is a good value like the other Olay cleansers. Keep it up Olay!"
I love the feel of my skin after using this cleanser! Smells good but didnt irritate my face at all. It only takes a dab to clean the entire face so it's a great value!
"At first, it worked perfectly fine. But the versatility of my face and pores ruined my experience with the product. It helped only for a specific amount of time, but wasn't able to adjust to my advancing pores."
"I originally received this product through a sample and used it while I was in the hospital after giving birth to my daughter. I absolutely love Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Facial Cleanser. It has a very lovely scent, not too strong and leaves your face feeling smooth. It does not leave my face dry and I love that about this product!!"
"While it smelled delightful, it don't really make my skin as soft as I had hoped. I'm the type of person who likes to touch my face a lot (weird, I know... but I do) so I like to keep my face really soft, however this product didn't do that for me. In fact, I think my face was a little less soft after using. However, it did smell really good."
This cleanser is really gentle and great. I have combination to normal skin that occasionally gets pretty sensitive. This cleans my face really well without irritating it at all. It also does a good job taking off my makeup. I will continue to purchase it.
"I really enjoyed this cleanser! It smells really good without a harsh chemical smell. I wanted to go away from the known face cleanser companies & try products that I havn't, so I gave Olay a try. Just to mention it cleared up my skin drastically but also moisturized & brightened my skin. Thankful for the product! Will be buying in the future. I recommend this product for about any problem, it helps with a lot of targeted things."
"I feel this is so good like thr best so far because it nourishes your skin.. first time using gave a great work and the product was packaged very well it's very effective and the product works very well.. yes i would love to buy it again, and i strongly recommend it."
I use this product on the regular. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It also seems to decrease any age spots on my skin. Olay is a tried and true brand that I would recommend to anyone that has any sort of skin sensitivity. This product is easy on the skin
"i would say that this cleanser is definatly not for oily skin or combination skin people.i Feel like it doesnt do the job well and leaves my skin super greasy, i dont like its effect.Maybe this will work for people with dry skin.Will not be purchasing again."
I saw results in about a week. This product did not irritate my skin and instead made my face feel moisturized. The scent was very nice and appealing. It wasnt like the other cleansers that are more like perfume but an actual cleanser. I dont see any need of improvement.
"Soft, gentle, and removes makeup! I love this in the winter and colder months as the lack of moisture outside and heat inside wreaks havoc on my skin. This smoothly cleanses and leaves no residue. I recommend and always like to have an extra in my guest bath!"
"I bought this product last month and have used it almost every day since. It really helps make my skin brighten up, and makes it feel so smooth! My skin also breaks out a lot, and this for some reason helps me out. It not too expensive, and is very effective. Totally recommend this!"
"A little goes a long way, does not leave my face dry. this has not caused me to break out one bit. I definitely see a change in the look of my skin without make up. It looks smooth and blemish free. Best I've seen my face in a long time! I highly recommend this product."
I use this in my shower daily! I have been using this for years. The smell is wonderful and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It is great for removing makeup at the end of the night. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean. I will keep using this product for as long as they keep it on the market!

"this nourishing cream is very good, it gives skin hydratation and softness, it fight signes of aging. and the good thing that it is for all types of skin so we use it me '' normal skin '' and my sister '' oily skin '' . the cream smells good and the price is correct"
I love how Olay total effects nourishing cream cleanser makes my skin feel fresh and clean. It is not to heavy and rinses off well. I would for sure buy it again being it is my favorite to go to. I honestly recommend it cuz it does great things for my face.
"Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Facial Cleanser works great on my gently aging skin. Easy open and close packaging. It's a great product for the price. I enjoy Olay products and this facial cleanser did not disappoint. I recommend you give it a try, it's totally worth it"
"This is honestly an amazing product. Works like it's supposed to and does what it says it will. Would I recommend ? Of course!! The price is totally fair in my opinion.. if you can, i highly recommend getting your hands on this product.. preforms great"
"I am finding that it is more cost-effective than I thought because I only use a very small amount every night. It takes off the makeup and other products of the day, but this cream does not make my face feel tight and dry. I have also found that I need to use less moisturizer after cleansing than I did before. For those people with dry skin or even people who want to try a cream cleanser, olay total Effects Nourishing Cream Cleanser really works!"
Omg... This is awesome..... !!!! It us amazing cleanser. Skin really looks changed and fresh after single use. Clears all dirty pollution on your face.. Still no irritation. No redness. I guess one of the very much effective facewash I have ever seen. Love it.
This facial cleanser is a WINNNERR!!! I use this facial cleanser as a part of my skin care routine and it's just a perfect addition! I highly recommend this product and it doesn't dry my combination skin out at all. I highly recommend this product to everyone to try it.
Oil of Olay is one of my favorite brands! Its a classic that has been around forever for a reason. It's an affordable product that is as effective as the high end products. It has many different varieties for every age. It's worth it and highly recommended.
"This is iiiiight. It's just soap, it doesn't do much for me. My face feels clean and all, but its nothing life changing. it can be a little drying too, but then again I have dry skin so ya! I would try it out if you're looking for a basic cleanser but, it doesnt cure acne or anything wild like that."
"If you have oily skin do not try this product you will not like it. I have used this product until the bottle ran out and I hated it, left me so oily all day and it made my make up very textured on my face. I thought maybe it was bringing everything from my pores but it just continued so I never bought it again. Maybe if you have dry skin it will be better but me personally I would not recommend this product."
This cleanser doesn't dry out your skin after the application. I wash it off with warm water and a washcloth.
"I pretty much love any product that Olay puts out. This cleanser is gentle, yet effective in removing makeup, dirt and oily spots."
I love this product. Makes my skin smooth and soft and smellsbgood. My mom has always used Olay so I'm sort of partial to it.
Very effective and way to apply. Leaves kin feeling hydrated and nourished. Would definitely recommend this product!
Love it so much. I used it day and night and nourishes my skin to a youthful glow. Definitely recommend this product.
Very amazing cleanser very nourishment and fresh for the skin I love this cleanser you guys have to try.
This cleanser is zingy and fresh. I love to use this on my face during early morning showers. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and new.
Wasnt a fan of this. It was very watery and kinda reminded me of paint. Hated the smell. Definitely would not recommend this to anyone
"This product was great for my skin, it cleansed it and nourished my skin, I'm a repeated user and use it almost daily. It always meets my expectations and feels gentle on my skin, I couldn't recommend any room for improvement"
I love this product . it leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh. And is well worth the money that you pay. It is a great prod if ct for hydrating tmyour skin.
I use this daily and it has went above and beyond to repair my skin and clear my acne. It's the only cleanser that has consistently worked for me. It comes in great packaging and is easy to use. Very effective product. I recommend it to everyone.
I use this daily to wash my face and get rid of my daily makeup. Leaves my face smooth and clean. No residue left behind like other products and no oily feeling. Keeps pores clean away from blemishes as well
I think these were this worse Wonder on your face it goes like it works at your pores also and it definitely makes my face Look Alot more refreshed then most products that I use I wish that I could afford more of different kinds and more of this
"Such a soft facial cleanser , I'm very picky about my skincare as my skin barley takes to any products to well, I liked this one it made my face super clean and smooth with a little toner and moisturizer your on a roll!"
"Such a soft facial cleanser , I'm very picky about my skincare as my skin barley takes to any products to well, I liked this one it made my face super clean and smooth with a little toner and moisturizer your on a roll!"
"Amazing way to start off your day like it cleans out your face really good. I been using this for a while really good. And it's very affordable, I really didn't expect it to be this good but it is like you would be surprised to see the result"
My skin is generally very dry and so a good cream is a must. This cream has helped my under eyes soften up and I have seen a very big difference since using it. I'd recommend this cream to anyone specially with it being olay
Such An amazing facial cleanser at such an amazing price ! I will rebuy this over and over again because of the amazing things it has done to my skin !
It's ok I wasn't a good fan of this I feel that it didn't really do anything for my skin which is ok because everyone's skin is different but I personally wouldn't recommend
I love this cleanser so much! It gets all of the makeup and oil out of my pores leaving me feeling very refreshed and hydrated. I think the packaging is easy use/cleanup and it is super cute! It is effective and I would buy again. Would recommend
Every other facial wash. Not much difference. Does remove dead skin and oil from the face as well as black heads around the nose and T-zone. A bit expensive for a face wash.
This facial cleanser is by far my most trusted! Every morning I start off by rinsing my face with this cleanser. It makes you feel rejuvenated and is very effective! I no longer worry about those unwanted blemishes as long as I have my cleanser!
leaves my face soft and not tight like most cleansers do. It took off my eye makeup very easily. I have never tried a cream cleanser before until now.
"Gentle and works well. Olay is a trusted brand for me. I'm pleased with the results. My face is clean and smooth after use. You'll be happy with the results as well. Happily recommended to others. Like I said, Olay is a trusted brand."
I love this facial cleanser it's amazing I have use it over a dozen times it leaves my face looking smooth and soft I love it and I would recommend it
LOVE IT and it very effective it works making my face felling fresh and clean. Olay is a brand I could always trust being that I am repeat user in using this product I am very satisfied and will continue to purchase and use.
This cleanser is great for soft skin. I used it in the morning and sometimes at night but I don't use it all the time because it can cause your skin to break out but it's a great produce for smooth skin I would recommend this for you.
This fácil crema cleaning is pretty good it was a good value and not that price it was my first time using it I bought one for my mom to and she loved it.
This product is decent! I only used it a few times. It's very expensive. I will only buy with coupons/promotions. It's very creamy and smooth and creates a thick barrier in your face. Would recommend.
A great face wash! Cleared up my acne fairly quickly and is definitely a good one to use for those with sensitive skin! I talk about sensitive skin so often but it's so important to take care of your skin!!
I was hoping to have a better clean since it was Olay. I usually get a better product from them but the change in formula seems to have affected how good it is.
Love the texture and the way it leaves my skin feeling. It's gentle and not oily. The packaging is beautiful as well. The price is right and I recommend to all.
This cleanses my skin without making my face feel dried out. I dont have to use a lot to get the job done either. Face feel cleaned and smoth after I use it
"Great cleanser for sensitive skin. Smooth texture, smells nice. I've only used this a few times, but it's never disappointed me. In a convenient squeeze bottle, would definitely recommend for travel use!"
"This facial cleanser is extremely moisturizing, feels even better when you use the cream after, but yeah you don't need too much to start and it really cleans your skin"
This is also a great product it keeps my skin very moist and helps me to apply makeup for my day. You can see and feel the pores coming out of your skin as soon as you wash your face and rinse. Highly suggested for anybody who has dry skin.
Nourishes and keeps your skin feeling fresh. The packaging really stands out as to why I tried it and it turned out to be pretty good for the pricing. Not something I'd buy all the time but would still recommend!
I usually use Philosophy products but I completely ran out one night. I went to the store and grabbed this in a pinch. It was actually pretty nice. Not as good as what I normally use but for a fraction of the price I'll take it.
"This Olay total effects nourishing cream facial cleanser is something I would try again. I used it once and it worked well. Seems effective, need to try it one or two more times though. Felt cool and fresh!"
"Absolutely love Olay! Occasionally on a heavier makeup day it takes two washes to get everything clean, but it leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed every time!"
My facial cleanser is one of the best products for dry skin. I love using the cleanser because I do not have to use another product once I'm finished.
I actually like this product. The texture is like a lotion and oil. Also great to remove makeup and residual left behind. Very effective and gets the job done
"great products, very cream and moist, I love the little botanical beads that's in the product, which help to get in the deep pores and diffidently remove all black heads."
Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Facial Cleanser performed well! I will use this in the shower and my face feels softer. It is priced very reasonable so i will be sure to purchasr again once i run out.
Great product helped clean out my skin. First time using this product and I enjoyed it. Good value for what your getting and an effective product. Would. Recommend to a friend to use this cleanser. :)
This is a good product! I've only used a couple of times but it did the job and didn't break me out. It does make your face feel very clean. I used this because it was my grandmas and she LOVES olay face products! Would recommend.
Love this product! It is very gentle on my skin and it feels so soft after using it. I'm a repeat user of Olay in general because I love their products. The packaging is really nice and the product smells great! I'll definitely use again ⭐️
"I bought this recently. I usually always go for facial cleansers made for acne prone skin/combination skin. But this, I love & just purchased another one last weekend. It helps minimize my pores & leaves my face clean & really soft."
"It was an amazing product to use. Smooth on the skin. I really like the nice colour used. I have problems with most skin products but, this one was really good. I would recommend this product to everyone!"
Great facial cleaner! Definitely helps rewind time on my face and protect it from harsh environments. It last a long time and is creamy and rich. You can tell it nourishes the skin. Would buy again :
"I love this product. It is worth the money and it leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. Your skin feels tighter too. It is a wonderful product, very effective."
It left my face feeling clean and soft. I didn't have to use much product at all while cleansing my face. It was all for the right price too. It was super gentle on my sensitive skin. 10/10 would purchase again.
"it's incredible, I leave my skin very soft, the facial lines diminished, it also has a rich smell, I did not believe it until I used it for 1 month, I'm delighted with this product"
"Easy to find in most stores. Not too expensive, you get your bang for your buck. My face did have a glow & felt smooth after using it. It last for a good while"
Doesn't have an overpowering smell which is a huge plus to me! Made my skin feel soft and moisturized after using! It didnt dry my skin out. Overall I thought it was a great effective product!

I do love using this with the Oil of Olay total effects 7 nightly skin cream. Together they work great! I did noticed a slight burning sensation when using it but not enough to hurt me. But if you have sensitive skin just be careful. Be sure you rinse it off with cold water to soothe any burning feeling. Could be because the alcohol and acid ingredients cause this but after rinsing with cool water the slight burning goes away. It doesn't cause redness after just be very careful when using if you have sensitive skin.
I love this product for my face nice and refreshing after washing face I love the product!!
Daily cleanser for your face . Keeps your face smooth and clean . Gentle on the skin
This product hydrate the skin in a wonderful way and leaves it very soft. This product allows you to show a more radiant and healthy skin.
Love this product! Great make up remover and for daily use! Feels smooth as butter. Definitely recommend!
Great products. Easy on skin. Cleaned makeup wonderfully without being too rough and also not leaving skin greasy.
Olay total effects nourishing cream facial cleanser is my favorite! My skin is soo soft after using!
"Just okay. Looking for a facial cleanser that just does the job, then this is fine. But if you're looking for that glowy effect, then keep searching."
Great for a first thing in the morning. Especially if you're not a morning person this will get you going
yes! I love it! It moisturizes the skin and makes it feel so soft etc.) so I definetly recommand it!
"Love the clean and fresh feeling that this cleanser leaves on my face. It's gentle and my Face feels nourished, not dry at all. Definitely a go to."
I love those random memories that make me stop and just smile when I get to the sky is filled with clouds the sun still
Face cleanses is a must and I love this soo much it's so smooth and amazing will definitely buy again
This is a Good cleanser! It does NOT over hydrate over dry out your skin. The smell is so amazing! I hope they have body was like this stuff lol
After removing my makeup I love to use this on my face to wash away the days grime! Leaves face feeling clean and hydrated!
This item is awesome. It works just like it says it would. I would recommend this product to everyone.
I grew up using Olay products. My mom always swore by them. She kinda passed it down to me u guess. Great products
I really like this product. Works well non drying and. It lasts a long time. Very reasonably priced as well.
I really like the way this makes my skin feel right after. My skin feels totally clean and moisturized. So many benefits.
A little expensive for the lack of results. It was easy to find in any department store but didn't really do much for my combination skin.
I like the touch that leaves on my face and above all. Notes on the brightest face and good looking from the first day. I recommend it 100%.
"Olay is one of the brand I always opt for without thinking twice. They are cheap, very effective and also good to skin."
"Perfect, can't be better, just what I needed. Doesn't let me down, everyone should by It! Make sure of It"
awesome product so gentle and great for price takes off all makeup pretty well i have bought it so many times
Makes your skin silky smooth and it smells really good too! Still not sure about long term effects but overall good!
I got a sample of this from a store and I didn't care for it because it restores moisture and my skin is already oily
This is a great product.I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.I will keep using this.And I will buy it for gifts also.
Absolutely love this product. Does what it says. Smooth light scent which i love. Works non irritating. Doesn't cause breakouts
It is okay but definitely not one of the bests O had. It is kind of harsh on my skins and not what I expected
Amazing! Has worked so well for myself and the smell lasts forever we love it and the conditioning is amazing!!
One of my favorites. Leaces my skin feelimg so soft and fresh. I have used this product many times and im never disappointed. Very effective
Olay is a great brand but this product didnt sweep me off my feet. Left me feeling very oily and sweaty. Overall good tho
Very refreshing and your pores feel clean when finished. Just started this product and my face has cleared up tremendously
Great for cleaning your face and for anti-aging! And plus it does not irritate oversensitive skin which is a plus in my book.
"Very great facial cleanser,a little goes a long way.This product always last my a very long time.Great quality!"
i actually didn't really mind this product but it pretty alright it came in a full size so that's cool
That's very nice product if there free sample it awesome to have and better product from anyone which is currently in market
Cleanses very nicely and also does a great job to actually nourish the skin which most products ive tried have certainly not done a noticeable job.
"I have sensitive skin, and the cleanser works well without irritating my skin.. It doesn't dry out skin.."
I think this lives by its name. Very nourishing. Didn't leave my skins dry. Left it very soft and glowing
This doesn't work and the texture of the product makes it yucky to put on and it didn't meet my expectations
"The product has a soft scent and a smooth texture.Since,its perfect for dry skin and i truly recommend to buy this product."
This olay total effects nourishing cream is fantastic it keeps the skin glowy and very affordable i truly love it highly recommended
Olay is with out a.doubt the best bang for your buck. I'm would choose Olay products over any high end creams on the market.
Amazing moisturizer me and my mom lobe this product its perfect for dry skin i recommend you buy this product
Olay totql effects nourishing cream has a soft scent and smooth texture I noticed a change this produxt made skin soft
Love love love this it was my go to for a while but now I can't seem to find it in the store I go to but wish they would get it back
Great face cleanser. Leave my face feeling fresh and clean. It is not my favorite but it definitely does the job. It does not dry out skin.
"I have sensitive skin, and the cleanser works well without irritating my skin. The moisturizers have left my skin softer than it's been in years."
Good make up remover which also removes all dirt nd keeps the skin fresh without any dust remaims om skin
Love all olay products they are so good. They really work they do. This cleanser make my face feel so clean and Smooth it's does when I use this
This product really cleans the face good. Good value and inexpensive for something that does the job
Works great and feels so good on your skin. Would highly recommend to all who feel as if they have dry
"The skin is well nourished without losing its essential oils better than other types, especially because my skin is mixed"
I don't think I noticed a huge difference using this product. I felt like it helped keep my skin from being so dry but that's really it.
I love olays total effects cleanser! It leaves my skin super soft and it does not try out my skin at all! Love it!
Olay anti-aging cream didnt really make a difference in my dark circles or under eye bags after two weeks
So good on your pores. Gives you a clean feeling after words with no dry skin feeling. Smells amazing and you skin feels really smooth and clean
Definitely cleanses the skin! I sometimes use this to take off my makeup and it does a pretty good job of it. It's worth the price.
Wonderful and magical product I always recommend it because I trust the products of this distinguished company
Love this nourishing creme rapid relief. Great for dry skin I used it for deep moisturizing on both myself and clients.
Amazing product! It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. Its affortbal & easy to find. Its very good I love it.
"I love this cleanser, it makes my skin feel super soft and it's very gentle! The price is a little much but I think it's worth it!"
Great product! Keeps my face clean! Love it! Would recommend for others to use! I will absolutely buy this again
This Is not my go to cleanser but it gets the job done. I do not recommend if you have oily skin since this is more of a creamy cleanser.
Cleans off makeup and moisturizes. Great price point. I continually buy this. Works just as well as prestige brands.
Cleans off makeup and moisturizes. Great price point. I continually buy this. Works just as well as prestige brands.
It's been a while since I've used this but it left me wanting more. My skin felt dull and a little dry.
"I love Olay basically everything. Some things are a little pricey, but it's definitely worth it. The body watches always leaves your skin so soft and smooth. The face washes cleans really good,and leaves your face soft and refreshed afterwards. It's such an amazing brand I'd recommend anything by them. They're beyond amazing trust me!!"
"This is my favorite facial cleaner by far! It's super creamy! I love the smell ( very light) and I picked it up at Kroger for a very reasonable price! This cleanser cleans your face with one application about a quarter size and all make-up residue is gone from face. Now this is a good product to use. Nice scent, good cleansing, value with sales, coupons, and rebates. I prefer this brand to the scrub as I do not care for the rough feel of the scrub."
Im always trying out new products for my oily acne scaring face. So I decided to give the face cleanser a try and i just cant believe the results. My face has a softer feeling and brighter look. It has minimized my pores. Such a cheap price for an awesome pruduct.
"I have used this cleanser for years. I used to hate cleaning my makeup off at night, but with just a little bit of this cleanser everything comes off without tugging or pulling. I even use it to take off my eye makeup. I've tried more expensive cleansers and they just don't come close! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is awesome, it does just what it says it will do. My skin is smooth and I have had people tell me I look so young and asked how do I stay looking like this. I tell them I use all Olay products and have used and will always use Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found this product when I went to purchase the same brand I had been using for years and did not find it. When I washed my face with this cleanser I realized that my other cleanser was not washing my face as well as this one and from that time this is the only cleanser that I can trust in making my skin feel soft and smooth and really clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Total effects 7 nourishing cream cleanser is truly a phenomenon. It acts as a cleansing Food which feeds and gets to the core of tired, dry skin to nourish and rejuvenate it while cleansing it with the gentlest, most soothing, calming care! Immediately, one is able to feel and see the uniquely refreshing, rejuvenating, healing effects that even normal or flawless skin would specially love and always want to experience when cleansing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for many years and have nothing but praise for it. Just like I said, It leaves your face feeling simply clean, not greasy, not oily, not heavy, just fresh water clean and perfectly moisturized! Wouldn't know what I would use if I didn't have this product! It's a must have!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for about 6 years . It's gentle cleansing is great for my sensitive skin since sudsy products have a tendency to irritate my skin. The scent is not overbearing and delivers just the right amount of moisture so the skin doesn't feel dry or tight. Total Effects cleanser feels like come of the other more expensive products out there, but at a more affordable price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser is so effective but yet so gentle! With age I started having random breakouts and needed a cleanser that wasn't harsh but would throughly cleanse my skin and not allow future breakouts. My skin looks so wonderful since using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used both the cream and foam cleanser and I love them both. I have been using Olay products since I was 12 sneaking my mom's room to use her moisturizer. I am now 57 and a grandma and thanks to Olay it does not show. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great gentile cleanser. Easy to wash off. Light scent. Effective and moisturizing.
Great product I got this as a free product for review and I just love it. I love olay.
Love how soft it leaves my face. Leaves a clean non oily feel on my skin.
"My face is usually sensitive but this does not give me redness , makes my face smooth"
Absolutely love this product! I use it daily and my skin has never been softer or clearer:)
Very cheap and effective. Does exactly what it says love this !!! Go get some for you.
Looooooooooove it so much and would completely buy it again very shocked at the way My face felt
This product is perfect! Every women should have one of these in their daily morning routines
After using this product your face will feel so fresh and clean. Try it I am sure you will like it.
"Great product! For the price you get everything you could want, leaves my skin feeling soft!"
It cleans deep your skin Love it good brand and good quality recommend it for everyone
I am a huge fan of olay since years but this specific facial cleanser did not do any wonders for me
I love this product it's amazing! I would highly recommend this to anyone and would purchase again!
I like this cleaner very much. It does a great job at what it is supposed to do. Makes skin feel clean. The packaging is good. I have used this several times. I used them a lot in my 20s. I would definitely recommend.
I want my face wash to clean my skin but I also like it when my face wash has more benefits like anti aging. Olay Total effects 7-1 anti aging cream cleanser with blemish control is that kind of face wash
