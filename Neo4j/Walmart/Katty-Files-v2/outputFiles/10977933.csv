"Olay is the best as always. And $30 for what other brands would charge $200 for. Same price as in the store so, it was lovely to have it delivered to my door free of charge."
"Really nice, goes on smooth and creamy (not slimy). Does what it says it will and this is from people commenting how rested I looked, new haircut, lose weight? Wow!!"
"Haven't been using it long enough to be able to report a major difference, but I like the product. It's very light but provides excellent moisturizing. Feels good. I'm sure to buy it again."
"Economical, and works great."
I have used this product for several years now. It is fabulous. I love that it is unscented and very moisturizing. I haven't found anything else that works as well.
i have been using the wrinkle smoother for about 3 weeks and i see a big difference already. i walk a mail route and i am always in the sun and this product is bringing back the life in my skin. i have also been using this on my hands and i am impressed that it has also helped with that. i am 52 and want young looking hands as well as my face. works super and i am going to continue buying the prox wrinkle smoother.
"i belong to vocalpoint.we occasionally try products for companies.well i was just fortunate enough to try this cream.it is absolutely wonderful,its not greasy,it plumps the lines over time,really holds in the moisture.i was lucky enough to get the full size and a little goes along way.well worth every penny."
I love this product. I'm 63 and need everything to keep my skin love nice. Been using Olay since the 80's. It must be doing its job. because ppl can't believe I that age.
"I've been using this for years. Have tried other, more expensive creams but always come back to this. It is light, non greasy and I can see a difference."
"I've only used this product a little over a week. So far I like it as well as other Olay products I've used, no better, no worse. This spreads on easily with no greasy feel. Maybe in a month or so I can provide a better review. I've used Olay products for over 20 yrs. so I would recommend this product as well as any other Olay product."
At my local store they charge $49.99. For the same thing Walmart charges $28.00. It's great stuff and really makes wrinkles disappear.
I just use this for one week an I love it and yes I will let everyone know they should try it I wil give it 5 stars
This cream has improved my skin over time. I don't know what to say except that my skin just looks better.
First time buying this particular product but I was very disappointed. I wish I could attach a photo. When you rub the product onto your face it peels and flakes. I've tried applying it before and after my other olay product and it doesn't matter. The result is the same. I feel like I wasted a lot of money.
"new formula smells very bad and feels greasy, I was a long time costumer of this product but will not purchase again. called customer service, they say they added artichoke extract, but it smells like self tanning lotion. Why ad odor to a skin care product?"
I am 39 yrs young and I started using Olay products when i was a teen. As i have gotten older i have continued to use this product as it truely works and makes me and my skin feel amazing. I am sure i will always use Olay and have shared it with my girls and will also share it with my granddaughter when she is old enuff to use this wonderful product to. Thank you for such an amazing product Olay!!
"After using this wrinkle smoothing cream, I could tell a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin!! It really moisturized my skin and my fine lines were much less noticeable.. I even got a compliment from my Dermatologist last week. She said that I didn't look anywhere close to my age!! Yes!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pro-X smoothing cream is a great night cream. I've tried several other creams and none have the same effect on my skin. It's so important to keep your skin hydrated at any age but especially when you get older when skin tends to be dry. With the wrinkle smoothing cream used a night I wake up glowing.

"Olay professional Prox wrinkle smoothing cream. I am 54 and have used this product on a daily for 10 years. Even though the price is a little high ,I always found a way to buy Olay when I am low on funds. My face tells me I need it. I feel dry,cracking without it.Olay works for me.Love the way it feels on me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely love the way it makes my skin smell and feel. Doesn't leave skin dry after. It's been a week since I've been using the product and so far I barely have to use lotion it keeps the skin moisturized throughout the day. The smell is definitely a keeper.
"This is such a great treat after the end of a long day. I'm the worst at washing my face before bed, but knowing this cream is in my bathroom cabinet motivates me to do it. It feels wonderful and works overnight to repair the damage of a demanding day. Thanks Olay for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried this product and now I am hooked on it. I am addicted to the cream because it makes my skin feel so smooth and I have notice that a lot of my wrinkles have disappear. never will use nothing else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a smooth moisturizing cream. The only draw back to using it on a daily basis is the price. It is a bit pricey. I brought one for me and one for my sister and we both would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product goes on light and non-greasy. It makes small lines seem to disappear in a matter of weeks. I have tried many other products and this one works the best. I really truly like it more than any other. The entire Regenerist line is terrific. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the anti-wrinkle cream and I'm very pleased with results I also have the spin brush for your face that I believe the combination of the both of them helps reduce the look of wrinkles and I definitely would recommend this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Olay ProX wrinkle smoothing cream for several months and am very happy with the results. No, it does not magically eliminate my wrinkles, but it does moisturize my skin and minimizes the look of fine lines. It has a smooth and creamy texture which feels so nice on my face; after a few minutes my skin feels soft and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have used other products, but this Pro-X has been one of the best. I am a faithful user of Olay products. When using a product like this, don't expect overnight results. If you don't see an improvement as fast as you would like -- remember your winkles might have been worse if you had not used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way my face feels when I use this product at night. I am 69 years old so I have a lot of wrinkles. My wrinkles still look the same as they did when I started using this product so I can't really say if it is helping or not, but my face feels smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product line. I have been using the Pro X microdemabrasion line for about a year now and I have to say it has exceeded my expectations. It is very easy to use and leaves your skin feeling very clean, soft & younger looking. I will continue to use this product because I can SEE the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love oil of Olay products! My mom is 85 and has been using it for years and people always tell her how great her skin looks! I started using the new one at night and completely erased a deep worry line on my fore head! It would be awesome to win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I heard this Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream from my friend, her experience made me willing to try it out. I bought it in a drug store and start using it. after applying for two weeks, my skin looks much younger and soft. I would like to keep using and recommend to my freiend too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I have started using the pro -X line with the wrinkle smoothing cream the deep lines and wrinkles have softened and small wrinkles are almost gone. I am 53 years young and look like I'm in my 40's! ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Olay for years and one place I always use it besides my face is on my neck. As you age you can get the dreaded ""turkey neck."" I don't have that and it is because of the wrinkle smoothing cream I use everyday!! Pro-X !!! This amazing cream nourishes and smoothes my neck to give the appearance of a much younger woman. I love it and so will you !!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm 55 and no one believes that I'm 40. I use Pro X products and have not found anything better, no matter what the price. I constantly recommend Pro X to my friends and anyone interested in improving their looks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Pro-X Wrinkle Smoothing Cream has worked miracles on my skin. Lines are less visible and my skin has a smooth, younger feeling.My skin looks like I'm 50 and I'm really a young 69!! When I look at photos from before I was using the product and compare them to now it is an amazing difference. I'd give it 10 stars if I could! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face is smoother and brighter when I use this product. I have tried less expensive brands and returned to this product quickly. The other product goes in the trash. So if you consider the cost of the unused cheaper product this product is more economical because I use it all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this as a gift. I have really enjoyed using it. My face feels so refreshed and smooth. It's also very easy to use and cheaper than the high end stores. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family members. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product. At 49 years old I realize I should have taken better care of my skin in my 20's! I find that this product smooths away some of the wrinkles and gives me back some elasticity. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use the pro x wrinkle smoothing cream every night before I go to sleep and I couldn't be happier. When I wake up, my face feels smooth and never feels dry. I just love it and so will you! I am 54 years old and my skin looks like I am in my 30's!!! I will continue to use this product for a very long time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall great product. Sometimes it seems to not absorb into my skin very well. I will apply make up later and some of the moisturizer seems to be rubbing off. Otherwise for the most part I really like the texture and how it makes my skin feel. It is very clean feeling and I like the thickness better than some other products. I've used Olay products for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the wrinkle smoothing cream! During the summer I use it at night and the day cream in the morning. During the harsh Midwestern winters I use it morning and night! I've seen a definite difference in my skin's texture and my sun spots have lightened. The icing on the cake is that the wrinkles in my forehead have gotten less noticeable - enough that I can pull my bangs back again!
"of all Olay products, I probably like this the most as a nightcreme..although...it does work under makeup better than Microscuplting creme (less greasy). If I could only choose three Olay products to take to a deserted island, it would be this product, the toner and the new Olay bodywash. I've been using this product for over 5 years on my face, neck, upper chest, and backs of hands, and while I still don't see 'significant' results, I do like how it makes my skin feel pampered at bedtime and so I will keep buying it.."
"Love this product! It makes my skin feel really good, especially during the winter when the air is dry."
"This cream is thick but at the same time so smooth. It leaves your face with a silk feeling. It's not sticky at all. It feels so good to the touch. So far, all I can say is that I LOVE IT!!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"ehhhhhh, I don't know about this. I tried this because my step mom had some she was going to throw out. She is all about all natural skin care and definitely has plenty of wrinkles to be needing this type of thing. Well I'm getting to that age as well. She went for a brand called Lumavera. I am debating whether I should try it. I usually shop at whole foods and I am an animal lover and can appreciate the fact that Lumavera is all natural, plant based stem cells, all virgin botanical ingredients and antioxidents."
ingredients are not what was expected...may be good for oily skin...I dont know..will not buy again.
