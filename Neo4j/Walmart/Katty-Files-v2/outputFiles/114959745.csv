I have been using this Olay cleanser for awhile now. I like the fact that it is a mild scrub and never leaves my skin feeling dry. The fragrance is subtle but very pleasant.
This facial cleanser is fabulous. I use others cleansers but they don't come close to Olay scrubs cleanser. I wouldn't use anymore cleanser. I am done. I'm going to stick with Olay. My face feels smooth and looks clean and vibrant. Also remove dark spots. I really do love it!
"I have tried other scrubs in the past, and they have always been to harsh. This one is perfect: Scrubs gently, and smells great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my all time favorite cleanser and Total Effects is my favorite Olay product line. I highly recommend each of the products in this line and you should know I get many compliments on my skin thanks to Olay Total Effects. Rush out and try some!!
I've been using this product for about 6 months now. When I bought this I wasn't expecting much I was just looking for a new facial cleaner for my face. To my surprised it removed a couple of blackheads that had just appeared out of nowhere on my face. Plus I've gotten two random compliments on my face about how smooth it looks. So this is a keeper. I've recommended it to all my sisters.
My skin is healthy looking
Beautiful and people away given me completment. They said I don't look my age.
Olay Total Effects Refreshing Citrus Scrub followed by the Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Moisturizer has been my recipe for an acne-free face! Love these products and even have my teenagers on the same regimen!
The way it leaves my skin so smooth. I also enjoy the scent. I request a tad bit more scrubbies. Maybe a bigger Bottle guys? Maybe about a 8oz size for the price it sells for. Thanks Olay! Love Ya'll!
"I can't actually review the product because after the 2 or 3 time of using it, the black that is on the bottle started to come off on my hands. Every time I picked it up my hands had black flakes all over them and I'm not going to rub that into my face. Very annoying"
"Thank you okay!! I love this product my skin is looking beautiful , I was peeling my skin was braking out and thankfully for this my makeup goes on perfectly my skin looks better then when I was a teenager"
Nice and refreshing face wash!
I have bought this product several times. I just love it!
I love these facial scrubs my face feels so fresh
& clean.
Omg im so in love with this face wash makes my face feel so good and clean
this is the best face cleanser I have ever used. My 2 teenagers struggled with acne and this along with Olay Total Effects moisturizer has kept their skin clear
I don't start my day without it! It has such a nice light and lovely citrusy smell and it does such an excellent job of washing away the oils on my face without stripping it completely dry. ❤️ it!
"I have eczema on my face. I broke out the first or so time(s) I used this, which is a usual reaction for me whenever I try a new product; once my face became familiarized, it didn't cause a flare anymore/my eczema to worsen. I feel a tingly/slight burning sensation when applied. A little of it provides enough lather. It smells nice. It definitely does clean (my light make up gets fully removed). I sadly haven't noticed any skin impovement. With all that said, I won't be purchasing again."
This product is amazing! It works well to remove dull skin and keep my skin looking healthy. I use it every night before bed. The light citrus scent is not overwhelming. It's helped minimize my blackheads and pores. My skin has never looked better! I wrote this as an honest review for a #contest for @influenster however all ideas and commentary were my own.
"Wanted to try something new but didn't want to spend that high end money. I settle on this cleanser, heard awesome things about it and I got a few stuff from olay. And I love this cleanser, it's so refreshing, really wakes me up in the morning. It doesn't burn, has my face feeling hydrated after"
"Olay Total effects refreshing citrus scrub cleanser a is totally exhilarating experience! I start each day with a new face, literally. How cool is that? If you haven't tried it yet, you simply must, and get the facial scrub brush too. It's a 60 second morning ritual you can't live without, or at least you won't want to.

"I have used this product for over a year and it is amazing. I use it and the regenerist products. Associates at cosmetic counters tell me that I have beautiful skin. They are shocked when I tell them that I use Oil of Olay. The cleanser is great for my pores and removing dead skin. People can hardly believe that at am almost 63. I always tell them, its the Oil of Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this product and I am in love with it. I use everyday in the shower and it makes me feel alive and feeling so fresh. The smell is amazing!

"I look forward to washing my face every morning with the citrus face wash! I feel so clean and my face looks awake/refreshed. I hope that Olay continues to provide this in the total effects line of products. I plan on using it indefinitely, I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just purchased this facial wash/scrub 2 weeks ago, and I'm amazed by it. After washing my face (anytime of the day) it has this orange like light scent that somehow felt like it gave your skin a burst of energy, plus smoothness. My new favorite!

"I love the 7 Ageing scrub and moisturizing cream. I am 67 and I can't tell how many people, including my facial consultant, has told me I have great skin and looking younger than I am. I will never change my skin program. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I prefer to use cleansers by Olay because they never sting my eyes. Products that do sting must be too harsh for my skin, so I avoid them. I always get great results with anything Olay, it smells really good and is a real value, as well."
