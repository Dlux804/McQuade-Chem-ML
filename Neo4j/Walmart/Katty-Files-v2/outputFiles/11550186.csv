"I started using this product about 6 weeks ago. I have both dry and oily skin prone to breakouts, as well as, aging skin. So, finding one great product can be difficult. I am very pleased with how quickly my skin started clearing up and becoming smoother. The price is reasonable too especially compared to many others I have tried. It's too soon to say anything about how it works on the deeper wrinkles, but fast results on the fine ones."
I have always used the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes. I am 70 years old and people think my skin looks much younger.
"I've tried more expensive serums but this is the ONLY one I'll use! Any time I've tried other products, I've been disappointed within 3 months or so. But this serum always make my skin feel smoother and more moisturized. It helps with the appearance of wrinkles without irritating my skin like some products with retinol."
"I've only had this for maybe 3 weeks. I really like it. I feel a difference, I tried using it everyday and I started flaking. So I back off 4 days and then started using it everyother day. I think I can see a difference. I should have taken a picture. My skin feels softer and tighter. I also bought the mullti vitiamn lotion for my face. Both just takes a little bit to use."
"I purchased this product (in conjunction with Neutrogena's Microdermabrasion kit). I've been using both for about 3 weeks. My skin tone has really improved and my deep wrinkles have softened. They look a lot better. Mind you I am 70 years old and don't expect miracles. I plan to continue both products. I also use Neutrogena rapid skin repair serum in the day time. I've tried lots of wrinkle products, but Neutrogena has the best by far,"
I can't say enough about how much this has improved my skin I've been using this for 8 months and the difference is incredible My wrinkles have faded my dark marks have almost disappeared and my skin is firm bright and clear I won't use anything else
"After one week of use, I noticed changes in my skin. It felt softer and looked smoother. Even my husband said he noticed a difference! I'm excited to see how my skin looks like after a month. I didn't experience any irritation. My skin-type is dry and my skin-tone is light but can easily tan to a dark olive tone."
I bought this a few months ago and fell in love with it
Product works better than expected! Been using it now for several years and 95% of all the wrinkles out of my face are gone !
"I don't know if wrinkle serums work or not, but I've been using this for a few years. People are surprised when they hear my age. Is it the wrinkle serum? I don't know, but I'm not going to stop using it to find out."
"This product is easy to use and does make a difference. I have used face lotions which cost over $100, and using this as a base under an less expensive face lotion does just as good a job. I highly recommend trying it."
"I've used this product for years, and people think I'm in my 30's. Can't seem to find it in the stores anymore, so I was very happy to see it on the website. Excellent product."
"I use this as my daily moisturizer. No odor and no skin irritation. I think it's reduced the appearance of wrinkles. When I tell people I'm 64, they never believe me."
"I am a 54 year old busy Mother. I have been using the Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Deep Serum for 5 years now. My skin has improved dramatically! I receive so many compliments on the youthfulness of my skin and I'm often asked ""what is your secret?"" I owe it all to Neutrogena! I've tried the more expense brands and they do not compare."
I bought my first bottles months ago and had trouble finding another in the stores so I ordered it online
"Hi, I have extremely dry skin. I have had such a hard time finding a product I can use my face that doesn't cause breakouts. It's been a horrible nightmare looking for good product use on my face. Until, I found the Neutrogen. After 2weeks my face looked healthy and beautiful so for me, I found the neutrogen to be the best product at a very reasonable price."
Thank you Neutrogen for saving my skin.
I bought this a few weeks ago and I can see a difference already.
"Superb serum! My skin texture and made my pores smaller. After cleansing, I put this serum on first before the Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle Day Cream w. SPF and I'm good to go. After two months of using this combo, I really see a big difference in my skin. I hope Neutrogena never discontinues this particular line of products because they work!"
This serum is perfect for my skin. I use it under my regular makeup and I see results since the very first time I used it.
"I brought this product almost 3 weeks ago. After a couple of uses a lot of burning , stinging around eye area and slight rash were I applied product. I have used retinol before and never experienced this before."
"Feels so good, I feel my skin more soft."
"I love this product, but I had two shipped-one was leaking and dry."
I have very sensitive skin and I've been using this product for years with great success! It's the only moisturizer that does the job without leaving your face oily or greasy feeling. It would be great if it had different packaging though. I feel a lot of product is still left in the bottle even after it won't pump anymore. I did invest in a small makeup spatula to get into the bottom and them seems to work.
"I bought this product one month ago to see if it would get rid of all the wrinkles around my mouth from when I smoked for 7 years. I'm 47 years old, but those lines made me look like a shrivelled up apple gone bad. The lines are almost completely gone and I look so much better. I would HIGHLY recommend this product."
"Great product, have used for about 1 year in my daily routine, since I am in the ""senior"" age bracket, that would mean I need and use a lot of products. It smooths my lines, adds a smoothe texture and base before my moisturizer and I will continue to use it. Wal Mart has the best price and with $.97 shipping because my Wal Mart is usually out of it, it is a great bargain. I have used really expensives products, but this works just as well."
"By age 50, I had developed two deep vertical lines between my brows. It took about 6 months for this serum to plump them out. I am now 66 still using the serum once a day and still with only faint lines where those deep wrinkles used to be. BTW - My 53-year-old sister is always lamenting to people how much less wrinkled my face is than hers. I've credited Neutrogena, but she's not one to take advice..."
I have been using Neutrogena products for over 30 years. My mother who is a nurse said that all of the dermatologists that she worked with All highly recommended Neutrogena products. This is truly the top of the line in skin care. I am 51 and everyone thinks that I am 38. This is a name you can trust.
"Almost immediately after applying, my skin began to burn. I had to wash my face several times before the fire subsided. It left the area under my eyes dark red and caused “rash like” bumps to appear on the sides of my eyes. This was about a week ago. The red circles have disappeared but the rash hasn't. I've used other retinol products and have never had this type of reaction. This experience has caused me to swear off Neutrogena products!"
I have been suffering from acne scars for years and i have been using all brands names products just to see a little improvement until I tried this serum and I could not believe my eyes.my skin started to be firm and even. I thank the company for making this affordable product and i hope they will keep it in the market.Thank you so much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I have been using this product on clean skin at night for many months and really love the results. Even my grown daughters comment on my fresh and supple looking complexion. I don't even travel without it! Wish your products came in unbreakable travel size, too!"
I just bought the product for the first time -- this after reading the rave reviews. I'm in my early 70's -- will it work at all? It feels great gooing on. I've been using Neutrogena productrs for about 35 years: my dermatologist recommended the product line -- and I still have good skin. I give a lot of credit to the regular use of Neutrogena products through the years.
"I used this product every night for the first week and it burned my skin really bad. I looked like I had a really bad sunburn that peeled and left raw spots on my face. The skin under my eyes was became really swollen and and dry as well. After all of the healed, my skin looks much better!"
I have been using this product for 2 years now and my skin looks fantastic! Firmer and softer than before I started using this product. I have no deep lines on my forehead and the fine lines around my eyes are much less noticeable. Please note that to see full results you have to give it 6 months. That's how long it takes for your current skin cells to turnover completely. Be sure to use in conjunction with a good cleanser and toner to accelerate the exfoliation process.
"For the past 6 months attempted to battle the vertical lines at the mouth. I bought this not knowing of its properties and quit after a week only to return several weeks later after reading that Neutrogena had the best OTC Retinol products to be had. I bought everything in the Retinol line.. but this product has shown significant results. After a week, lines are less deep, shorter. Astounded!!! I am clearing my medicine chest of any thing not Neutrogena!!!"
Please don't get rid this serum. This is the only serum that works in my skin. I used this this before and the wrinkle is less noticeable. This is the only serum that works in my skin. Please continue this product and I've been looking for this serum all the stores that close to my area. I have deep wrinkles but since I use this serum the wrinkles are getting less and it really works. Please do not get rid this serum.
I've tried just about every wrinkle product out there with no real long term results.this product is not a gimmick and simply does the job of giving you really healthy youthful skin. I'm nearly 40 and thanks to this product I've been told I look like I'm in my 20 s.I'm so glad I found these neutrogena products that don't cost the earth and for the first time I feel that I havent been conned or tricked just Honest products by a company with morals.how a company should be.
"I have used nearly all skin care products, but they are all temporary wrinkle deterrents which cost a lot. I decided I needed a product with retinol and purchased this product.. It does a great job on my skin. I am very pleased with this wrinkle serum, and I have now ordered more skin care products from Neutrogena"
Within the first three days I noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin. Lines are significantly reduced and looks and feels much smoother. Thank you Neutrogena for coming out with a product that I can use and that doesn't cause breakouts! I would love to give the product 5 stars but the all time best product I have ever used from Neutrogena is the discontinued 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment with 2% salicylic acid. I wish you would bring it back!!!!
As a kid I was always told to wear sunscreen or I will get wrinkles. As I kid I didn't care once I turned 18 I began paying attention. I used this about 2 years ago and got rid of the deepest forehead wrinkle. I will forever buy this! I love neutrogena :). Best accidental buy ever!
Using this nightly has made a huge difference in my skin- especially around the eyes and mouth where I once had the beginnings of fine lines. I will never be parted from this- I have told everyone I know to use it. Much more effective than I ever could have hoped for.
"I have been using this product now for 2 1/2 weeks. I use it every other day because of the burn, which doesn't last long but now I have redness where my crows feet are. I then put the Hydro boost on for moisturizer and get a burning sensation from it and it lasts about the same time."
"I have been using expensive anti-wrinkle creams for a few years now and have only seen marginal results. I decided to try Neutrgena's Intesive serum, and have found a great improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles. Love the price too! thanks-- Jenny,"
"Decided to try this. Traveling for work. Slight tingling, applied lotions and vit e on top. Have used this for 1 week and have seen a great improvement. I wear minimal make up. Skin is smoother and softer. Have gone last few days with no foundation (I do not wear) and very light on only bare mineral veil powder. Lots of compliments this week on skin. Will be 52 in Feb."
"Have been using this product for about 2 weeks and can actually see and feel some changes in my skin. Wrinkles have lessened and my skin is softer . . . pretty impressed since I have used numerous, more expensive, doctor recommended products with less success. Also like the consistency of the serum -- it's easily absorbed."
"I have always liked Neutrogena products, and started using this serum about a month ago. Very happy with results, laugh lines are definitely softer. Product absorbs quickly and does not leave any residue. Have tried a lot of department store supposedly high end products, and with Neutrogen you can get day, evening and treatments for what one product would cost with quicker results. Also love the microdermbrasion. Found the serum to be a little irritating using right after that. Great Product and noticeable results. Love It!"
I love to use serums and I think they are a MUST for aging skin. They can be expensive so I love this one to use at night. I can really tell a difference in the short time I have used it. I am amazed at the compliments I have gotten. Give it a try you will love it and a little goes a long way.
"I bought this serum with the purpose of few wrinkle on forehead, under eye also, there has been a dramatic difference in the appearance of these lines. The only down size is the flaking and slight tingling as it is mentioned on some of the comments. Other than that, I will continue to purchase....:)"
"I have been using this product for a week now, and am already noticing a change in my skin, my fine lines are diminished already! I am 38, and have used a night cream for years so have always been told I look younger, but due to a stressful year I developed a lot of lines an dryness very quickly. I am so glad I started using this serum, it's giving me my skin back."
"I started using this 2 weeks ago and could see and feel results after about 2 days. I don't ever want to run out of this. When I went to get another bottle, they were out at the store and I had to find it another place. This is a fantastic product. Please don't stop making it."
"I am in my mid-twenties and have been struggling with adult acne for several years now. I find this serum is a great light-weight moisturizer and wrinkle treatment at night and actually seems to help my acne clear up a bit. I love that it's non-comedegenic, and when I use it, I get compliments! This stuff really works!"
"I have used Neutrogena products before, and liked them. They have worked well for me. So i tried this product and the first time i feel a little burning sensation so i used the next day and it burned more and i noted it was more red so i read the instruccions and it said to expect some burning so i used one more time but unfortunately it got WORSE it looks BURNED"
Neutrogena serum is light and goes on silky smooth. A little goes a long way and makes skin feel refreshed
Been using two weeks and already making a difference. I wait twenty minutes after I wash my face. Dermatologist told me retinols work better by applying that way.
"The neutrogena deep wrinkle anti-wrinkle serum has for me, reduced the appearance of the deep wrinkles I had on my forhead as well as those on my neck. Thanks again for yet another outstanding product!!"
I have been using the Anti wrinkle serum for only 4 days and have seen significant results! My fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing! Love this stuff!!!
I have gone through three bottles of this and cant live without it. My face feels so smooth and my fine lines are less noticable. I even like it better than the Lancome. I use it every morning as my only face moisturiser. I am almost 50.
This serum works! Skin starts looking smooth and supple about a week after use. the skin feels soft and more even toned. I love the results; put on at night.
This stuff is great! Iv'e been using it for about two years now and my skin looks great! This serum with the rest of my skin regimen is the best combo.. Please don't stop making this.
I use this product every night and after a few minutes I use the anti-aging night cream. I would never use another product. The results are great and not expensive.
I purchased this product and the microdermabrasion system and began using both around middle of Sept. Wow! This product does what it promises!! And the microdermabrasion system is awesome! Very happy with Neutrogena!
"Typically I use only Merle Norman or Estee Lauder products, but tried this when I purchased by Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System (love it!). Have to admit, this stuff really works!"
"I am 39 and have been using it for 2 years. It was recommended by my dermatologist I love it like others. It does sting initially, but it goes away after a couple of days. It makes skin smooth."
"I bought this product like 2 weeks ago and by the 3 days it starts burning, my skin started feeling rash, and peeling my skin I cannot put my moisturizer because it fell like its burning my skin."
"I bought this product and it caused me to have redness, itchiness, rash and burning feeling. I would like to say I have no know allergies so I have no idea why I would have this kind of reaction."
"I have been using the serum for 6mths now , I had fine lines on my cheek area and now are totally gone , I am 63. I often get comments on my skin , wouldn't use anything else."
It plumps up and softens my 60 year old skin. It works better than expensive prescription anti-aging creams. Please do not ever discontinue this or any of the Ageless Intensive Deep Wrinkle moisturizers.
I started using this product a week ago and I can already see softening of my deep wrinkles. This product feels great on my skin and it is not greasy at all!! I would recommend this product to anyone!
I like the way this product make my skin feel. I canât say it stop the wrinkle but it do improve the wrinkle but it has not improve the line around my eyes.
I have yet to see if it works. Came as expected. Poorly packed with 3 larger
I used it for about 2 weeks and made my skin red and burning
"This product works great, and is a great value! I have been using this product for about 45 days, and I'm very pleased with the results."
Gave it a (4) only because it is short of helping me entirely - I'm 67 and should have never waited this long. :}
I'm so thankfull to neutrogen for making this product it has erased the ugly wrinkles I had thank you so much for makeing me feel pretty agin
I used this product a couple of days in a row and then my skin came out in a painful red rash which has not subsided 4 days later.
most retin A products leave my skin itchy and red. I can put this on face and neck without those side effects
"This is an amazing product. I use it at night, and am impressed with the smoothness and smell! I would definitely buy this again!"
"Smells a little strong but it feels great on the skin. The price is ok, there's not much in it though."
"Not good experience to use this product. My face got burned with red spot, last weeks by now. Still in pain after two weeks to use it."
I have been using Neutrogena ageless intensives over my top lip for 10 weeks. thatis the only place I have wrinkles and there has been no change. I'M NOT HAPPY
"Burning and redness occurred after 3 days of use; however, directions state one drop for entire face. I used more than a drop for each eye. I will let it heal and try again"
Use twice a day
Prevents wrinkles
"Using it for years. When I run out, I panic. So now I buy two at a time."
I find it does exactly what it claims to do. I am very pleased.
Love this fragrant free product. It softens wrinkles considerably after a week of daily use.
Have seen definite improvement in texture and fine lines. Skin is so soft and smooth. Great value!
Lots of money spent on other products without any results. This stuff is great and it works!
My fine and deep wrinkles are now hardly noticeable!
The product is easy to use and seems to be working.
I have used the Deep Wrinkle Serum for some time. I skin is definitely more refined and smoother.
"I don't notice any difference, but maybe it will slow down the aging process."
"I've been using it for over a month now, and I see no visible difference like I did with Roc Deep Wrinkle. Very disappointing."
This product is amazing to me it's the best product I have used. You will see a difference relatively quick.
"If it says Neutrogena on it, it's good. Not sticky. Love it. I have had skin cancer so I use it only at night because I need a sunscreen in the daytime. If I wore foundation with a high sunscreen rating, I'd wear this 24 hrs a day."
"I have been using the product for about 2-3 weeks and I find it burns and doesn't appear to have any good benefits. In fact, the skin under my eyes look even MORE wrinkled which it wasn't before. I'm thinking of asking for a refund! It seems another (moisturizer) product I've used before seems to do a better job."
"I saw results almost immediately. My face just sucks it in, like when watering a dry plant. My wrinkles are much less apparent, with or without makeup. Just one pump does the trick, so one bottle lasts a long time. I no longer feel the need to try other products."
This stuff is a game changer. I had mild acne and now hardly get a single blemish. Totally worth the price.
"I have used this product 3 times in the last week for the first time and skin is flaking off my forehead and sides of face, I only used a small spot of the cream on my finger, but with your help I would like to persevere with it . Can You help me please,I am in my 70s. I will be very grateful. Thanks"
I started using this product 2 weeks ago & I love the way it works. I noticed yesterday & today I have skin peeling off. Started on both temple areas & now 1 cheek. There is nothing indicating this kind of side effect so I just wanted to let others know.
It didn't do what it said in my opinion. Everyone is different but won't be using it again..
Absolutely love it! And not because if was inexpensive. This is the real deal. Why pay $600 or $700 for a mattress when this one is just as good?
"I am 53 and Neutrogena serum has helped me reduce my wrinkles, diminish my crows feet and minimize my pores. I work in the community and get comments all the time on how smooth, and firm my skin is. . Thank you Neutrogena."
"Love this product, i read a review on line and used it before."
"This product does help control facial wrinkles, it doesn't erase them."
"I love this product, but I am afraid to use it under my eye without clarification"
