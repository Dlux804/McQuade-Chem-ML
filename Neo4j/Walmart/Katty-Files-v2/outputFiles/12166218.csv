"I have sensitive skin and I was worried about breaking out from this product. It doesnt feel overly greasy or oily. Even with my own moisturizer, I found my face feeling somewhat oily towards the end of the day, but with this moisturizer I really dont feel that way. I am pleasantly surprised and over all happy with this purchase. The color is not orangy, it blends well and really makes me feel like I have that sun kissed look I was searching for. Just be sure to apply it under your chin and a neck area."
"This product has been perfect for summer use. It has a very subtle natural look/glow. I love that it is moisturizing without being overly oily. I love this product, would definitely recommend! Does not cause breakouts which is fantastic for me because I have very sensitive skin. Also contains spf, great value!"
This stuff does what it says that it will do. However the fair to medium was a little too dark. I mix it with daily moisturizer to make it lighter and it is perfect.
"Multi tasks - light, fast absorbing moisturizer with SPF 20 and BONUS - gradually (use it every morning) gives you some color too. I have my friends using now too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the subtle glow of this and use it every morning. I do not apply this on areas that get the sun even through my sunscreen in the summer, such as my forehead. This cream blends in well and helps you look good even without foundation. It costs a bit more than I'd like but I still faithfully use it all year round."
"I'm not sure I will buy this again but it doesn't streak, the smell isn't so bad, and it has sunscreen in it so you can use it during the day. I maybe should have bought a darker complection because I don't notice much difference. Or maybe I just haven't given it long enough."
"I thought it might be too heavy or greasy, but it is light and the fragrance is very subtle. Gives skin a nice warm glow - just what I wanted for summer to be able to not wear as much makeup. The SPF is 20 which is a good solid range. Recommend this for year round use!"
"I bought this product about 2 weeks ago and I am so happy with the results it is amazing! no streaks, no odor, and a beautiful flawless look. I have been looking for a product like this for so long and this is the ONLY one that has worked. I would suggest this product to anyone who wants a natural looking tan."
"I have been buying the Jergens Natural Glow Face Moisturizer for quite some time now and love the way it makes my face feel. In the winter months when I am very pale I use the Fair to Medium. In the summer months when I have some color, I use the medium to tan. I really like the subtle glow, it is not shiny. Plus, I have found that for everyday use I don't wear foundation anymore, I just use the Natural Glow. My face thanks me for that as I am not clogging up my face for hours on end. I save the foundation for dressing up."
"It feels soft when applied, color appeared evenly and looked natural. Did not streak. After the color appeared, I applied it every three days, in the morning. Allow it 30 minutes to dry thoroughly. Works great for a pretty, natural tan, without going too dark."
"every spring i break out the natural glow products. I love the look and the feel of the face lotion. The scent is reminiscent of ginger bread, so I find it quite enjoyable. It is easy to apply, and I love the color it produces. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I was relieved to find their new formula was still non irritating to my skin. the only con is that it can come out streaky if you apply it too thickly, so apply lightly."
I absolutely LOVE this stuff! Just finished my 3rd tube. ( One bottle usually lasts me 5 months) I buy the fair to medium and it looks so natural. If I want some extra color I apply it twice a day. I've tried lots of self tanners and read reviews that talk about - this so and so product has no self tanner smell. And for whatever reason it smells so bad for me. But this Face self tanner has no smell (which is important because goes on my face!!)
I have tried this product several times in hopes that it would work better. It gives me only a small hint of color on my face unlike the Daily Moisturizer that I use on the rest of my body. I wish that this product could give the same results.
I have been using this product for close to ten years and I love it. I use it as my daily sunscreen moisturizer. When I want a more covered look I wear a light make up. I also use the Natural Glow body tanner on my legs and arms.
Yes I just bought this and it's not like other ones I have bought in the past! It is coming as as a white cream instead of being tinted? Is it suppose to be like that?!
I absolutely love this stuff. I use it as a daily face Moisturizer
I wish it gave more color and the packaging is very small for how much you pay.
"I was hesitant because I have very fair skin color and did not want to look orange. I saw results within the first day and I use it very other day. The only issue to be aware of is if you have any age spots or melasma, this does darken these areas. Its a negative for me but I still like the color it gives the rest of my face."
I have very pale skin and this gave me a nice glow that looks natural and not orange. No strange smell either.
I tried in the past different kind of those and this is the best. Just use a little and let it dry. Love it!!
The coolest thing about this is it has moisturizing properties and sunscreen along with the tanning effects. Great stuff. Keep in mind once you exfoliate the tan comes right off. Okay to use every day without getting too dark.
"I see reviews from several years ago speaking highly of this product, but I've been using it every single day for 2 weeks and I see no results. I'll be going back to other gradual tanners that always work well on me. Zero results. Waste of money."
"I bought this hoping it would work as well as the body moisturizer. I've used it nearly a month every day and it has done nothing. Can't tell I've used anything. The other Glow moisturizer works great, as does the Instant Sun. This was a complete waste of money."
"I have been using this product daily for three weeks and I have not noticed a change at all in the color of my face, even when using the Medium to Tan shade. I will continue to use it because it does go on my face nicely, but it does not do what it claims."
"I have been using this as my daily moisturizer for years. I love the 20 SPF. I have very pale skin, but this gives me some color all year without orange skin or strange smells. Also, I am prone to break-outs, but this product does not irritate my skin. :)"
I used this product during and after vacation. It has an SPF which is wonderful! I got some color without the damage that comes from the sun. Came back from vacation with a healthy glow and continued to use it for weeks after. It has a nice coverage and does not feel greasy or sticky. I will continue to use this for a healthy glow year round!
LOVE this product! it's lightweight and doesnt stink!
"This has become my go-to when I'd like a little glow. I have very pale skin, and I use the fair to medium moisturizer with no complaints. Lightly scented, gradual color. It's great!"
Unlike most self tanner products this one does not leave your skin feeling greasy! It has a natural color tome to it and is not messy to apply. I am always concerned w/facial items making me breakout and I have had no issues while using this!
The SPF didn't work. I was driving and my face still got red. I only use this for added color at night. It leaves a brown streak around my jaw line and I'm very careful not to put on that dark. It also comes off when you wash your face for the night or morning.
I started to use this recently and it does give a healthy glow. My skin is fair and just never seemed to look alive. Since useing this I feel it makes me look healthy and gives me just enough of a glow. Best I have ever tried. It also feels light on-not like a heavy makeup
I love the natural glow that this moisturizer gave my skin. Sometimes it's hard to get that natural glow on your skin when you're working all day and don't get a chance to see the sun! So having a great alternative like Jergen's Natural Glow makes me happy!
"This is my favorite drugstore Facial moisturizer & it gives the skin that perfect sunkissed glow! The buildable tan is simply amazing and perfect year round but especially to transition into spring & summer! As we know, self tanners can be insanely expensive & even drying to the skin, but not this one! The price can't be beat & it makes your skin look gorgeous! Jergens hits a home run, AS ALWAYS!"
I love how great Jergens Natural Glow works on your skin plus has two different ones that works great with your skin tone . Jergens also is great for your skin because has sunscreen to protect your skin from the sun rays . I also love great Jergens goes on your skin without leaving your skin smooth and not greasy .
"I use this in conjunction with the Natural Glow body tanner and love it. I always have a tawny glow to my face. People are always asking me if I have been to the beach or the pool and the answer is ""no"". It is all thanks to Jergens Natural Glow. Love it."
"I have been using this on my face for approximately a year. I like that it gives me some color since I generally don't wear foundation. It is easy to use, has no bad smell. Just be sure to wash your hands after applying. I also use it on my older sons face when he needs sunscreen, it doesn't bother him as much as other types."
I love this product for the price and the results. The color it gives is natural and build able over the course of a few days. I mix it into my regular moisturizer for a subtle effect. I've never had any problems with blotchiness or streaks when using this product. Great purchase for the price.
"I received this product a few weeks ago and LOVED the smell. After using the product for a few days, I love how my face was not greasy or oily. It goes on smoothly. I totally recommend this product. BONUS: Its inexpensive as well. Well worth the cost."
"I loved my free sample of Jergens Natural Glow so much that I bought it right away. The reason is that it just gave me a natural look. I'm chronically ill and am pale because I have to avoid the sun because of medications, so I love a product that gives me a nice glow. without making me look orange. It works well, has no bad odor, and the price is right. I highly recommend it!"
"I loved this moisturizer so much. first off the price is amazing for such a high quality product. and the packaging immedietly caught my eye with that beautiful bronze color. It was perfect . But, the moisturizer made my skin really smooth and soft. i have extremely dry skin and this made the dry patches just go away. It started feeling hydrated only after a couple times of using it. It really is a great product that I will continue to use forever."
Day two of using and I look like it's summer time.
"I love this face lotion! In a week of daily use I have noticed a significant difference in my skin tone, and it looks completely natural. I don't even feel like I need foundation anymore, and it makes my skin so soft."
"Sampled this product this past month, and I would consider this to be a great moisturizer for the face. Gives it that dark sun tanned look. I will purchase this product again."
I bought this last summer and was really impressed! I am very fair and usually have a hard time with streaks but this worked really well for me! I exfoliated really well first but this smelled good and went on easily and dried fast!
I'm fair skinned and use sun protection on my face daily. This Natural Glow product for fair skin is good for evening out the skin tone and well as providing sun protection.
I received a sample in the mail and loved it. It is a light moisturizer but gives you skin a little coverage and a healthy glow. After trying the sample I was so pleased I bought the product.
I am on meds that exclude any real time in the sun and I have the pallor of a ghost. Natural Glow really helps with little effort. Don't hesitate! You know what time of the year is coming....
Love it...have both shades (which I use depends on time of year). Especially great while I'm pregnant. I get a healthy glow ... makes me feel better and pretty :)
I bought this product a couple months ago and I really like it. It gives me a gradual natural tan without streaking. I would recommend Jergens Natural Glow to anyone looking for a gradual tan.
"You must have this product, specially if u get the moisturizer lotion u need this also. Makes you face skin tone look darker and keeps it moisturizered also. Love it"
I tried Jergens Natural Glow and I highly recommend this product. It is a very nice moisturizer which goes on clean with no oily feel. I absolutely love it.
I received a free sample I absolutely love this product it is not greasy it does not make my face look oily it gives a very natural tan glow I used the medium to dark shade I am blonde with light skin and this shade is perfect for me
I've used this for years. Makes my pale skin look healthy. Love it!
I have fair skin so I used the lighter color. I loved the way it felt and looked. Just a soft glow to my skin. Love it
I have started to use this and have a very nice even color. I love it! It doesn't have a strong smell either.
"A friend bought me this product. I had not tried it before, but when I did I fell in love! It gives you such great color!"
I tried a free sample of this product and loved it would definitely buy it and recommend it to others
This cream is absolutely amazing it is so light and firms my face. I love the color how it's subtle and not so overwhelming I look orange.
"This is the best, natural look, self tanner on the market and even better is the price compared to similar products."
I use this weekly to get a good glow to my skin and it does the trick. I live in Arizona so it looks very natural but healthy!
I love the natural glow I get from Jergens. It doesnt make me look orange at all. It is easy to apply and isnt messy.
"i am 75 and love this gentle light look with a glow , very subtle and I have light skinn"
i dont breakout! finally a lotion that i do not breakout from!
Loved the natural color on my face instead of using foundation.
Jergens Natural Glow is a great product!!! Thank you
"Great product easy too put on and very smooth ,nice to have a 2 in 1 product saves time."

So easy to use and no bad smell. This one is a keeper.

"This works really good, but after a few hours, I need extra moisturizing"

Great smell and just the right amount of colour. No streaking.

This product really leaves my face moisturized without feeling greazy.
RECEIVED THIS AS A SAMPLE AND LOVED IT AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYBODY THAT I KNOW.
Like the fact its a gradual color. I do use it daily.
I like that the color is very subtle and you can build up to the color you want.
Smells great but its still doesnt keep my skin moist..stil dry out my face and give blemish
