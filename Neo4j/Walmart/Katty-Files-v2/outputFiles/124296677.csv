"I like the fact that this is pretty much a natural product and it has a nice creamy texture and has a nice color. However, it did not give my skin much of a glow. I mixed some Loreal Magic Lumi primer with it and the two together make a good color and glow to the skin when you don't want to put on actual makeup which is pretty much all the time with me."
I got this product as a sample when I bought the micellar water and I loved it so much that I went out and bought a full-size. I use this every day (I don't wear foundation) as a tinted moisturizer. It doesn't add a lot of color (which I like for school) but has just enough to make me look glowy. I have used this every day for the past two months and I recommend it to all my friends!
"I put this on over my moisturizer and before foundation, then let it dry. Next is foundation, powder, etc. I think this is a FABULOUS product, and I will be purchasing it again!"
I can't understand why several people gave bad references.
"I used this today, & it was good. Its different from other face scrubs. I like it better than aveeno. Its more gentle."
"It did make my face glowy, & my face felt soft. My skin was a little dry but that's ok cuz I just put my Neutrogena hydro boost gel cream after. It worked out well. This scrub also brightened my face. Thank you, garnier for making good products."
"The product is a soft, supple gel. It didn't feel bad on my face, but I didn't leave it on for long. I splashed water on my face, applied the mask and decided to apply more water to use as a scrub soon after. My skin immediately felt soft and smooth! It also looked very clean and fresh! I'm very pleased with these results and highly recommend this product! I just didn't like it sitting on my face for several minutes."
Garnier Glow Boost Illuminating moisturizer by Garnier SkinActive really moisturizes your skin and it looks more youthful instantly. It has a slight tint and shimmer which gives your skin a glow. Also make-up seems to blend well while using this product as a base moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub is ok. The consistency doesn't feel like a scrub or a mask, kind of like a thick jelly. The scrub feels like it does nothing (not much scrub to it) and neither does the mask (supposed to make skin “glow.”) I broke out all over my chin after using it. The only thing I liked was is smells good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't a fan of the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Fave Mask + Scrub. When using as a mask it would burn my skin, but when used as a scrub my face didn't feel clean without having to use another cleansing method after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Garnier's SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer is a nice, light touch- non-greasy and very lightweight. A silky texture and very subtle, tasteful peachy glow. Adds a little touch of summer to the skin any time of year. I'm a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I rcvd this full size product sample from Pinch Me, and I'm thrilled that I did! I'm usually not that crazy about this brand, but I love the new line up.

The Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial mask & scrub was not for me. I used it several times but I didn't like the feel of it after I used it.

"I wasn't a fan of Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub. It has little plastic beads in it that don't dissolve and if you wash your ears or around nose, they get stuck in and around the area. I gave it to my little sister and I'm sure she will use it. I would not buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so surprised to receive a full size sample! I found it weird to have both a mask and a scrub in one. Did not like using it as a mask but maybe I need to use more water. My skin did not feel super soft after exfoliating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the peachy-apricot smell of the Garnier SkinActive Glow boost illuminating moisturizer as well as its consistency which makes it so easy to work with, without giving that greasy feeling.

I really like Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer. It works great as a moisturizer and gives my skin a faint glow. I mostly like it because it works well as a primer under my make-up. It seems to smooth out my skin so my make-up looks flawless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garnier SkinActive moisturizer kept up to the brands name and quality. I love this product, my skin sucks it up and the “illuminating” effect is subtle but present. I have very dry face which is prone to acne but I have noticed no break ups since I've started using the Glow boost illuminating moisturizer. I will purchase after this sample is finished :). The only down side for me is that I have to layer it on in order to moisturize my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer by Garnier SkinActive is my new daily go too. For the mornings I just have to wash and go this is a quick fix to looking a bit more recharged.

I thought the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub was a great product. I've used an apricot scrub in the past and this worked just as well.

I'm pretty sure all the positive reviews are from people paid to use the product. My face is disgustingly oily after applying this moisturizer. There's a greasy film all over my face. I do not feel glowy or peachy. Just gross.

"This is a great multifunctional product. It has a nice smell & consistency. When you use it as a mask it has a nice little tingle to it, & as a scrub the little powdered shell bits exfoliate nicely.

I received the Garnier skin active glow boost 2 in 1 facial mask + scrub for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I've been using the scrub 2x a week and it's been working great during this dry season. I use it in the shower leave it on for 3 mins or so and scrub away and it leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth and doesn't dry out my skin. However I knocked off one star because I don't notice a glowing effect. Smells great too and will continue to use regularly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a free sample from PinchMe. My face didn't appear to be glowing after I used it, though it felt clean. I have a hard time getting all the hard bits of apricot pit off of my skin.

Garnier SkinActucs Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask and Scrub was surprisingly nice. It smells good and my sensitive skin didn��t react.

I was lucky enough to try a sample of the Garnier Skin Active Glow Boost scrub/face mask. Overall I was happy with this product. I used it daily and it did leave my skin feeling soft. The scent was light and refreshing. I wouldn't consider this a face mask though. More if an exfoliating cleanser. My skin was soft to the touch but unfortunately it didn't help with my acne. I saw no difference with that issue. But overall good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received the ""Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask and Scrub by Garnier SkinActive from PINCHme for review and I must say it surprised me. When I opened the jar the texture was a bit off-putting and I was expecting it to be very oily and greasy on the skin but it wasn't, it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I'm not sure how much exfoliating it actually did, as it feels very gentle. I would definitely recommend this for people with oily, sensitive skin.

This was a good product. I use it a couple of times a week to exfoliate my skin and release a dewy glow. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized after each use with no drying of the skin at all. I have oily skin so I thought it may keep my skin too oily but didn't have that at all. It was the right amount of moisture. I definitely recommend this for those looking to rejuvenate their skin.

"I enjoyed using this face scrub by Garnier, however, I didn't care for the scent very much. I've been using more natural products lately and the peach scent smelled too fake in my opinion. After I got past the strong scent, the actual product worked well. I really needed a glowing boost to my winter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the scrub for 2 weeks straight I took pics everyday and was able to visibly notice a difference, the best part of it was when I came in to work and a coworker actually said “honey you're glowing” BEST FEELING EVER! Garnier you have a new customer I'm in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have used Garnier SkinActive Products before and have liked them. So I was excited to try the Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub. It had a nice scent and was a good exfoliator. However, I did not feel like it gave me the deep clean that I would like. This product gives my skin a weird waxy-like texture if I just use it alone as my cleanser. So I typically use their charcoal deep clean facial wash then follow it with the Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a complimentary GARNIER SKINACTIVE GLOW BOOST 2-IN-1 FACIAL MASK + SCRUB from pinchme , and I've been really happy with this product. I love that it can be used as either a scrub or a mask, so you're getting double the value from this one product. Both uses work well, I just wouldn't use it more than a couple times a week. Because it exfoliates effectively, it can be a little harsh on my skin if I use it too often. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received Garnier SkinActice Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub as a free product from PinchMe. I love a good exfoliator and was excited to try this one out. As a mask it tingled a bit but didn't irritate my skin too much. Afterwards I did look a little glowy and definitely had smoothier, softer skin. I didn't love this product as a scrub - it was a little too abrasive to just keep rubbing into my skin. But I will continue to use it once or twice a week as a mask when my skin is looking dull.

"I received a sample of Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2 in 1 Facial Mask + Scrub from PINCHme. I loved the texture of this scrub. It is almost like a dough and was very easy to use. It smells good, but is not overpowering. I didn't notice a glow boost, but maybe that is because I only tried it as a scrub and not as a mask. It can be used daily, because it is not abrasive. I would prefer if it was in a squeeze bottle instead of a jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have used the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub as a face scrub in the shower and overall I liked it. The way it feels on my face is pleasant. However — and this is the reason why I probably won't use it as a mask — the smell when you first open the lid and put it on your face is very artificial and makes me think as if it's not as organic as it'd like to be. The smell is kind of off putting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Garnier SkinActive's Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub does what it says. The mask is cooling and you can use it as an exfoliater by rubbing your fingers in circular motions on your face activating the exfloiliant beads.

"The Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub is absolutely amazing. The naturally derived, vegan formula leaves your face feeling soft and smooth without any residue or stickiness. It is gentle enough to be used as a regular exfoliant and works amazingly as a relaxing mask that leaves your skin feeling hydrated and relaxed. I can not recommend this product enough! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a sample from PinchMe to try Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask+ Scrub. I like that you can use it as mask or scrub or both. It removes dead skins and exfoliates really well. It's not too runny or too rough, in my opinion, just right for both mask and scrub. I especially love the smell, and it has naturally derived ingredients!

"I was so happy to receive a sample of the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub!!

Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub was an interesting experience. I didn't know what to expect. As a mask I wasn't quite sure the benefits and as a scrub I wasn't sure of it's effectiveness. Overall I think it is a interesting concept but needs more fine tuning.

"I got the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub as a freebie from PINCHme. I've only used it a few times since I got it, but it works better than I thought it would. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it isn't too harsh on my skin. I've got quite sensitive skin, plus it's aIso dry. Overall, it does the job and I would get it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this smells ok. Since the mask step has to stay on my skin for 3-5 minutes I would prefer something not so strongly scented. If I only used this as a scrub the scent strength is just fine. This does do a very good job at exfoliating my skin though and makes it soft and smooth. I plan on only using this as a scrub from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Garniee SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub is an AMAZING product. It smells so yummy! It makes my skin smooth, shiny and gorgeous!

Thanks to PinchMe and Garnier SkinActive I received a full size Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub. I have used the product a few times a week and it makes my skin glow. It��s so simple and I apply it while I am showering and then wash it off. It has a great fragrance and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought for sure this was going to be to harsh for my skin but it was not! I love this mask. I use it once a week as a mask and love how my skin feels and looks after using it. My skin looks brighter and vibrant. The scrub is not too harsh but it is just right to get dead skin and dirt off my face. I usually try to do it on the weekend when its a no makeup day to let me skin rest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub to test out for my honest opinion. The product came in a nicely sized container, a little goes a long way so I'll definitely have this product awhile. It smelled a bit fruity, like a papaya, but the scent wasn't overbearing. I use it more as a scrub and love it. The exfoliation isn't harsh at all, and afterwards I can definitely see a nice glow to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Garner SkinAcive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub smells nice but the texture was a little too goopy for me and I found that the little exfoliating pieces were overpowered by the goo of the mask so I didn't feel it gave that nice scrubby feeling I would have expected to have.

"I love this product. Believe it or not I look forward to washing my face before going to bed and when i wake up.

Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub was an awesome scrub and can also be used as a mask. I loved the product as a scrub but didn't see the additional mask benefit to it.

I was given the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub by PINCHme to sample. The mask smelled great and was easy to apply and remove. It was even great on my sensitive skin.

"I've been using the mask & scrub for a couple of weeks now, and have tried it as both the mask and the scrub. the product is thick, but not grainy like some other scrubs can be. When used to exfoliate my face (or other body parts), the scrub does its job. The mask washes of easily as well. An easy, double duty product to add to my regimen!

"I received Garnier SkinActive's Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub as a sample for a promotion. I was hesitant to try it, as many other face scrubs irritate my sensitive skin.

This product will be the one staple in my bathroom from now on. Thanks Garnier! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub is OK. Both chemical (the fruit enzymes) and physical (the apricot seed powder) exfoliation. It didn't do much for my skin, positive or negative. The apricot seed powder is finer than the gritty stuff in St Ives' scrub though, which is nice.

The Garnier skinactive glow boost 2 in 1 facial mask was unlike any other skin care product I had tried before I have to admit that I did not expect it to feel so silky because I thought this was an exfoliant it turns out when you first apply it it feels very silky and smooth and then as you apply water adventure turns into an exfoliant I love this product I will probably be buying this again.

I was sent this product for an honest review by Pinchme. Garnier SkinActive has been putting out some really nice products and this one is no exception. Glow Boost 2 in 1 Facial Mask and Scrub is creamy almost gel like consistency. I love this texture!

"I love the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask and Scrub! This product can be used in 2 ways depending on what you need. Either use it as a mask and then as a scrub when you wet your face, or just use it as a quick face scrub if you don't have the extra time. My favorite way to use it is as a mask first. My skin truly does glow when I rinse it off. It leaves my face feeling smooth and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Though it feels like straight silicone, it is smooth going on with mild grit. It sinks into the skin within about 10 minutes leaving the exfoliant behind. I didn't notice a big change in my skin or anything and I'd prefer it to be more scrubby [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the Garnier SkinActiveGlow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub that I recieved for free by PINCHME. It has a citrus scent and I loved it. It's a time saver by being both a mask and a scrub so I could get a good facial cleanse in the morning. The scrub has just enough grit to exfoliate but not too much to where it leaves your face raw. It also did not dry my skin out. I call this a win. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub as a sample. I loved the fruity Apricot scent as soon as I opened the jar. It's great that this product can be used as a scrub or as a mask. I used it as a scrub and felt that my skin looked and felt smooth, fresh and less more radiant than before. I recommend using this if you need to add a naturally-derived exfoliant to your skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub free from Pinchme in exchange for my honest opinion. This product was too harsh for my face. The smell wasn't my cup of tea. It does however make a good foot scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

When I used the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub as a mask it felt a little cooling and refreshing. When I used it as a scrub after I masked with it I feel that it was a pretty good scrub. The only thing wrong ith it was that I didn't find that it made my skin glow but it did feel good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Garnier Skin Active Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub is amazing. I used it as both a face mask and a scrub and I was not disappointed. It was gentle while also removing the dead skin cells and left my face feeling refreshed. I will say that the citrus did leave a little tingly feeling and it may burn/sting if lotion is applied immediately after. So I would recommend waiting a couple of hours to allow pores to fully close. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried the Garnier SkinAcrive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask and Scrub for free through PinchMe. This is my first scrub for Garnier and I must say that i really like it! The scrub feels so fine in terms of granules, yet thick in terms of texture of product. It's easy to use and store right in the shower. I think the scent smells a little lie hairspray or shampoo, but it's nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am thankful to Pinchme for giving me a full size Garnier SkinActive's Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub to test and provide my opinions! This scrub is different - it almost feels a little waxy but it does not contain wax obviously. It has a thick consistency and has scrub particles that are not harsh on your skin. After using the mask I did see a glow and I love it! It is a good me-time product :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Garnier SkinActive's Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub was an interesting experience. It started to tingle after having it on for awhile. I didn't appreciate the strong smell. It seemed very unnatural even though it claimed to be naturally scented. I have dry skin and my skin felt dry after using this but it did exfoliate well. I did break out after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Thank you to PINCHme for allowing me to test Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub. This product was just ok for me. It didn't apply well as a facial mask.

I really liked the fragrance of the product and found the consistency to be great to cover my whole face - a little goes a long way!

"This has a rather strong smell but I didn't mind it. It looks like it's the same texture as a salt scrub, but it's not at all! It's like a squishy, jelly-like consistency. I put it on like a mask and then after letting it sit for a while I scrubbed my face with it before rinsing. It is a nice treat that helps exfoliate and makes your skin feel nice and clean.

I recieved a full size sample of Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2-in-1 Facial Mask + Scrub. I enjoyed using this product. Ot is first used as a mask and then a scrub when the masking time is up.

I will be purchasing this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is more of a lighter scrub mask that provides a nice glow after rinsing. It has scrubbing beads but it isn't overly abrasive. It has a gritty, oily texture but did not leave my face oily. I use it sparingly as to not overly exfoliate my sensitive skin and it works very well at clearing dull skin and providing a fresh glow afterwards. I do recommend this product.

I used this in the shower for a week straight before I left a review. I noticed that my skin was left feeling soft but I still had dry skin left on my face. I used moisturizer every single day. I use the Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin enzyme scrub and after on use of that it takes all my dead skin off rather than this I used it every day and was still left with dead skin. I will continue to use it until it's gone but I won't be purchasing after the product is finished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am upset at the fact that I just discovered this product and not sooner. GARNIER SKINACTIVE GLOW BOOST ILLUMINATING MOISTURIZER is amazing all around! It smells great, feels light, and left my skin with a beautiful natural glow. At first I was tempted to apply a lot but a little bigger than a pea size is enough. I usually wear this alone or under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer is very nice moisturizer. It is lightweight and not greasy! Gives me a glow but not too much- I can add some pressed powder if too glowy!

"I love Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturer! It's so simply and gives me a healthy glow each morning. I don't have to wear makeup up still feel like it's a done look.

"I was excited to try the Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer by Garnier SkinActive since it stated that it worked with darker skin tones as well. I tried it as a primer as well as a stand alone product. As a primer, it went on smoothly but it provided no extra umph for my complexion. As a stand alone, it just made my skin look moist yet greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer free from PINCHme for review. I absolutely loved this moisturizer. It was perfect for my combination skin because it didn't make my oily areas more oily and it provided plenty of moisture to my dry areas (cheeks). It also had a nice fresh scent to it that I enjoyed. Most of all though, it gave my skin a radiant glow that I received many compliments for. I will definitely be buying another tube when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The glow boost Illuminating Moisturizer is really great under the makeup! I received this product from Pinchme to try. I think it gives such a nice glow to the skin.

I did not care for the Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer by Garnier SkinActive. It felt like it sat on top of my skin instead of sinking in and moisturizing leaving me feeling like I had a greasy film over top of my face. When I went later to put foundations on after using this product they never looked very good and did not last very long. All in all I would say unless you have dry skin and are just looking for a little extra glow on bare skin this is probably not a product for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer for about two weeks now and I'm impressed. It has a nice tint to it that provides enough coverage for when you just need a little color but not too much. It is light-weight and provides a good base/primer for foundation. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does feel a little greasy, but it's nothing a little powder can't fix. I received this product for free from PinchMe.com [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer as a free sample from PinchMe.

"I was really excited to test out the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer. I have medium skin tone and this added the perfect amount of shimmer. The only negative thing was that if I overworked the product on my skin, it broke up and started to ball a little. Added lots of moisture and gave my foundation a nice finish. Would also look great alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I first tried Garnier SkinActive Glow Boosting Moisturizer when I got a free sample from PINCHme. Overall I quite like it. It smells nice, but isn't overpowering. It does make my face look glow-y. I haven't noticed my skin being oily when using it, though it is winter and my skin is dry so that may change in the summer. I don't wear makeup so I can't attest to how it does under that, but without, I think it works well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I wanted to love this, especially at its price point. But I really don't. The moisture doesn't absorb into the skin well and it flakes when using it as a primer (as suggested) I felt that it didn't really give me glow but it actually excentuated the redness on my face.

At first when it comes out of the tube it's a peachy color and I worried, I put it on and that peachy shade didn't show up. It leaves your face feeling really soft.

This moisturizer left my skin looking and feeling really greasy. It seems to sit on top of the skin and not sink in at all. It doesn't really moisturize my skin either. This would be better for someone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As a moisturizer the Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer was a little too heavy for my skin. It wasn't greasy at all which I was concerned about since it is illuminating. I would use this moisturizer in the winter months when I need a heavier formula only. It is nice how the Garnier SkinActive line adjusts based on your skin tone so it works as a glow for every different skin tone. It is definitely worth a try!

"Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturize was absolutely incredible!

"I like this ""moisturizer"". It's really more of a makeup primer than anything. It mattified my skin. I'm a bronze complexion. Though I consider it a primer and it is tinted a coral peach, it definitely did NOT give my face a white cast. It blends in with the skins tone, as it goes on more so clear. It did not moistirize, for me; for that Ingive it only 4 stars. It made makeup application nicer. Great size too! A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried Garner SkinActive Glow Boost Illumating moisturizer for a week on my skin but I I had to stop after the 3day it was making my face more greasy then Illuminating. So because of that I give it 3 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works well to moisturize my skin. It says you can use day and night, but I prefer to use it as a fat cream because it's lighter and has a subtle sparkle. It comes out in a very tinted tan color, but no worries it doesn't really show up as any color just like glowing looking skin. I'm very satisfied with this product but it is very subtle so not for the fans of extreme highlights. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier SkinActive glow boost illuminating moisturizer almost hit the target but was not quite there. I felt it did a great job at providing glow but did not moisturize my skin enough. My skin felt a lil bit tight after using this product. But over all not too bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer thought Pinchme.com. I was not a big fan because I have oily skin so anything that makes me shine even more just isn't for me. If you don't have oily skin and want a glow under your makeup or on it's own then this product is for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is lightweight and contains some shimmer to give you a glowy look. I think the shimmer gives a nice effect but I will say the moisturizer though lightweight, doesn't keep my skin hydrated all day. Additionally, it has the potential to break out my acne prone skin, so I wouldn't use this daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I live in a very hot area so my face is always dry. I was excited to recieve the Garnier Skinactive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer!! After the first use I had saw immediate smoother skin.

I have already recommended this amazing product to all my friends and family!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garnier SkinActive smells good, does provide great hydration, and definitely can give you a glow. I have naturally oily skin. If my skin was dry from the winter or needed to use it under makeup then this product would be great for me. But as daily moisturizer for an already oily type of skin, this would needed to be pat down quick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier SkinActive Glow Boos Illuminating Moisturizer does a great job of making your skin shiny, but in a good way. While it does have some tint, it wouldn't replace a BB cream, and probably not even a tinted moisturizer. It does however add a glow when used as a primer. Makeup goes on smoothly and stays well. I got this tube as a free sample from PinchMe but will probably buy a new one after it runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer really does have a skin brightening effect. The moisturizer has a bit of a peachy shimmer that does look pretty.

I received this garnier skinactive glow boot illuminating moisturizer full size free from PINCHme.com. it was okay but not great.

"Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer, upon initial application, left me looking glowing and dewy. I have quite a oily complexion so I thought this product would leave me feeling extra greasy a few hours later, however, my skin looked fresh and youthful during my workday. It made my face feel more plump and radiant and made me overall feel confident and ready to tackle on my day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier's SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer is a fantastic addition to my daily routine. It leaves my face feeling young and healthy and vibrant. It's not heavy and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It's a must have! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Usually with all the humility in my area I tend to leave moisturizer off my skin care routine. This one not only makes my face glow and make it actually look awake; it also keeps my face soft without being oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer that i got as a sample From PinchMe. It goes on smooth and light. Doesn't have a greasy feel and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy or heavy either. I love the hint of glow it leaves too, I also love that I can layer it for a more darker noticeable glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer to be good. Not great, not terrible, just good. It was definitely glowy, but on it's own it can verge on greasy looking pretty easily. I would only use this under makeup, that being said it didn't really function as a moisturizer OR have the qualities I like in a primer so I can't give it high marks there either. Get this only if you want glow and for no other reason. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually use expensive facial moisturizers but was surprised that I like the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer as much and even better than most of the more pricey counterparts. It smells great, goes on smoothly and does truly give my skin a glowy look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer. Like most Garnier products this moisturizer smelled amazing and a little tangy. Unfortunately, this product wasn't the best for my sensitive skin, meaning I turned pink. If you don't have sensitive skin though I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this new Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer from Garnier SkinActive. It is super moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy. It melts into the skin and makes the perfect base for makeup, or alone for a hydrated look. Not glittery at all just the perfect touch of shimmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer as a sample from pinchme. The product has a wonderful smell and goes on lightweight. It has little specs of glitter which I really didn't care for. The one thing that really stood out about this product is that my once dry skin turned very oily and greasy when using it. I never noticed any brighting effect either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I used Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer, I could immediately notice the glow effect. I was very pleased with how it made my skin look.

I received a full size bottle of Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer from pinch me. It was a free sample. That was the best part about it. One thing I did not like about this product is that it left my skin feeling sticky and oily. I tried it as a primer for my make up and hated it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didnt really like it. I have tried it for 2 weeks and i dont see a chance. My face is still dry. The cream is easy to apply, but it feels somwhat thick in the face and ot takes really long to be abosrbed. I also did t like it because it says that “ illuminates” the face and i really dont see it.

I would definitely purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked how the Garnier SkinActive made my skin glow. It left a bit of that sticky feeling some moisturizers leave after putting it on. I don't think it improved my skin that much, and the smell was pretty fake. But immediately after I put it on my skin looked glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed the smell of this product and wearing it alone or as a primer. I truly think they should sell this as a primer over a main moisturizer. I loved this more as a primer. The smell was great and it gave a glow to my skin. I did need to use a little more foundation throughout the day due to the moisturizer. It was overall a great freebie and look forward to using it more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Garnier skinactive “Glow Boost Illuminating “ is nice and very absorbing. I personally prefer thicker creams but this goes on quite well and leaves a nice dewy glow. nice pleasing smell and didn't cause any break outs so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVED this product! After I washed my face at night is when it worked best. The scent was very pleasant and the consistency was very smooth.
"I would NOT use it as a primer or under makeup in the morning because it does peel off if combined with another product. Other than that, as a moisturizer, it works great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I brought the new Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer with me on a trip to Central America. I normally get super dry when I travel, but this moisturizer kept up with my needs without being overly greasy. It's great under makeup or alone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I felt it smelled almost like medicine. I'd prefer a fruity or fresh smell personally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

But this adds a glow after all the matte products on my face so I look more natural. It smells good and the scent isn't overwhelming. Feels great on the skin and can be worn alone!

"The new Glow Boost Illuminating Moisterizer from Garnier SkinActive is amazing. Its not the type of moisterizer you would expect. The cream is a papaya color instead of white, but it blends in so well that you can't tell. And you gives you a nice subtle glow. I've worn it alone, with an SPF moisterizer and under makeup as a primer. It's very versatile. I love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was given the chance to review Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer with a free sample Pinchme. It is the first moisturizer I have used that had a darker color. It smells great and is a good moisturizer. However I did not notice a glow at all or any ""illuminating"". It was good as a primer but as just a moisturizer, it left my face feeling a little sticky and oily. It isn't as light of a moisturizer as I like but I am not saying it is a bad product, just wasn't right for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combo skin which can be a bit dull at times. Garnier skinActive glow boost illuminating moisturizer works well for what it is, it brightens my skin decently enough. I don't seem to notice it a ton under makeup so I'm glad for that. But, it did seem to make my skin a little more oily under my matte foundation with setting powder. I don't dislike it, but it doesn't necessarily work amazing for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love love love Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer because it makes my skin so bright and beautiful. It really gives me a ling lasting glow without any greasy feeling left on the surface of the skin. Some moisturizers tend to just sit on the surface and never dissolve into the skin.

"Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer comes out a orangey tan color but fades into the palest of skin. It didn't leave a glitter appearance. It just stay on the surface of the skin making the skin look healthier. It allows any kind of make up to glide on. For some it's not ""glowy"" enough or they won't like that it doesn't get soaked up into the skin like other moisturizers. This is a great drug store moisturizer though.

"I am still trying this product out thanks to pinch me!

Garnier skinactive glow boost Illuminating moisturizer is a great idea but it doesn't last and is a little to oily I guess u can describe it.

I will definitely purchase in the summer, but I will put it away for winter."

"I received the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer, from PinchMe in return for my honest feedback. I love that the moisturizer is all natural and free from chemicals. But, I have oily skin which already gives me a glow anyways and this product just makes my skin feel even more oily as the day goes on. This product might work for some people with different skin types but if you have oily skin this will only make it worst. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that Garnier skinactive made this natural/healthier moisturizer for skin.

I use it everyday as a makeup primer as well. It really is an all purpose moisturizer. Plus it smells great and doesn't make your face feel oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

If my skin was only dry and no blemishes/redness this stuff would be perfect; but since I have such bad skin I need to add other products to my skincare routine to really get the job done.

I highly reccomend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been testing the Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer for a good week now and I have to say I quite like it. It has a subtle sheen and smells and feels nice. The only thing is I feel like it doesn't help control oils for anyone with oily skin but it doesn't cause extra oils either. I also have super sensitive skin and break out very easily and this hasn't broken me out yet. I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer is really good! I really enjoy using it, as it makes my skin look glowy and healthy. It is not greasy st all and absorbs into the skin almost immediately. There is no residue but it still manages to make my skin feel supple and hydrated. It does not make me look oily or shiny. It gives me the “glow from within” look, which I absolutely love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Garner SkinActive Glow boosting illuminating Moisturizer has taken me by surprise. I honestly wasn't expecting to see much of a difference between this and my current moisturizer since they are both drug store products but this moisturizer has already taken the place of the one that I've been using for years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer feels good on the skin and it definitely glows. My only concern is that when I out it on my skin it darkened it. It makes my face look like an orange compared to my neck. I feel like it'd be fine for people with tan skin. But for me it doesn't work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is by far the best moisturizer I've used! So excited to try this product when it came in. I love how it has a tint to it. Feels my skin soft and glowing. This isn't greasy at all. Will be buying after used this all up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using Garnier skinactive glow boost illuminating moisturizer for about a week and it's awesome! It smells amazing and the color is nice and sheer and would look good on anyone. It gives you a nice dewy glow and you can layer makeup on top of it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because by the end of the day I felt a TINY a bit greasy in the forehead area. But overall I liked that this gave a natural glow!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost 2 in 1 Facial Mask and Scrub. I tried both ways, as a mask and as a scrub but neither did it for me.

Disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
