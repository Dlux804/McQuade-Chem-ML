I absolutely love this face mask exclamation point I received a sample in the mail and words can't describe the before and after difference and feeling! The smell is amazing!

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a fun mask to use! It's blue, which seems to be more for the experience than by nature of skin enhancing ingredients, though I'm no expert. I do enjoy this mask, it feels like it really cleans without stripping the skin. I guess that's where the comfort comes in. The scent did not bother me like some. I definitely want to try the others in this line and I would recommend it to friends. I received this free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have pretty normal skin but this mask just didn't work for me. I did like how it smelt and my skin was soft after using it but it caused me break out. I usually have pretty clear skin but when I started using this product I broke out. I don't recommend it if you have normal skin. I received this product for free for testing purposes.

If I could give this product 6 stars I would! I was a little reluctant at first in buying it but I bought it about 3 weeks ago and the results are much higher than my expectations. I would DEFINITELY recommend!

It's soft on my skin, smells great - which I wasn't expecting at first - and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth! I am a fan! Paired with the cleanser this makes for a great weekly skin care routine with that luxurious spa feel minus the spa cost!"
Thanks to Influenster for my complimentary sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this sent to me as a complementary gift and I'm in LOVE! It doesn't dry out your skin and make it tight like most face masks. It makes my skin look fresh and clear. I love the exfoliating scrub within it. It's definitely worth the money! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used so many different face masks I have trouble differentiating between them. However, this one left my skin feeling super hydrated and all my dead, flaky spots just peeled right off. My face was so smooth after, and not tight and dry like other masks. Love it."

"I received this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Honestly I'm not a fan. Most masks that contain clay dry your skin out, but this was worse. I've moisturized as much as possible and still cant get my face back to normal. I'll spend the extra few dollars and use posh instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this mask! It has changed my skin! I never really had a lot of texture on my skin but some and this has helped my texture. I have such smooth clear skin! I love the way it smells. It's thick in consistency and I love that it has also has some exfoliating beads. It has sort of a cooling effect which I also love. This mask has easily become a holy grail! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This pure clay facial mask is most definitely one of my new go to's! I love the clay texture of it. It most definitely got rid of any dead skin cells and improved my skin texture. Although this is a powerful blend of clays it was still easy on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this mask! I received this mask through Influenster in a vox box for FREE to test. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask is incredibly soothing. During application and the 15 minute setting, it was super relaxing. It rinses easily and my skin felt great after. I used the L'Oréal Clay Cleanser to wash after- great pairing. I will be using this mask once a week as recommended from now on! I received this free from Influenster for testing purposes, but these opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this mask! I have only tried a few facial masks but I have to say that this one is my favorite! I have oily skin and this has helped control the amount of oil on my face significantly!

Recieved my complimentery Pure-Clay mask in my VoxBox and on my first use it gave me the results i was looking for. Left my skin feeling smooth and amazing! Went above and beyond my expectations. Would definetely recommend to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I still remember the first time opening the packaging and I felt the texture of the mask. It was very smooth and soft. It glides on my skin like butter and there were some beads in it. The scent was very refreshing. After rinsing it off my skin felt very soft and smooth like babies butt. I like how the beads exfoliate your dead skin as you wash it off. absolutely love this product. And I got this product for free to test. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I got this mask about a month ago to review. I only use it once a week just for personal preference. I did see a great difference with my skin getting alot cleaner with the cleanser and this mask. The mask leaves your skin super smooth and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the lemon scent of this mask. It went on smooty and came off easily. It did not dry out my skin whatsoever. I could feel it working within minutes. I left it on for 20 minutes and was very pleased with the results even days afterwards I felt a difference. It has improved the texture of my skin since using it for almost a month now. I received this in a complimentary VoxBox from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this twice in the past week and I will admit I see and feel a difference. My skin feels smoother and cleaner than normal with a really nice softness. The mask did not worsen my dryness either. I would recommend this to a friend although I wish it didn't have so much a artificial tint to it. I was afraid I would rinse it off to find Smurfette looking back at me! I received this complimentary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent this mask through Influenster & fell in love! This mask not only smells amazing but leave some your skins feeling silky soft.

"First of all, this mask makes me look like a cool blue alien. I have an oily t zone with sensitive cheeks. This cleans my large pores and is gentle on my skin that my skin doesn't react. It leaves my skin soft WITHOUT drying it out. No strong scent although there is some scent but cannot pinpoint it. I received this product complimentary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't use masks often but this one was so much fun! I loved the awesome blue color which made for great Instagram photos!! It felt great going on and was easy to apply. After washing off, my skin felt super soft and smooth!! It did feel a little dryer than I would have liked but that may just be my skin. Overall, I loved it'!"

I got this mask in my Influenster's Vox box and it is AMAZING! It's so creamy and nice to put on and when you take it off your skin feels like butter. So far I haven't gained anotherbpimple or black head since I've been using it. Buy it and thank me later.
"Received this product for testing, and I love it! The lemon scent makes it feel so pampering and fresh. Love that it's a mud mask and exfoliant in one. Just wish it came with a spatula to scoop out the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loved this mask for many reasons but the best part was how even and smooth my skin looked after continued use! The scent wasn't over powering and the exfoliation was just right without being too abrasive.
I received this product for free to review with my honest opinion and I will be buying again and trying the rest of the collection! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask is really great! It has a creamy, consistency and doesn't settle in my skin. It dries not too fast and not too slow. Feels good on the face and doesn't make it extra dry after it comes off. Makes my skin feel really clean and fresh. Just be sure to follow up with a moisturizer, as it does dry your face slightly. I did receive this complimentary for review purposes, but thoughts are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my mask almost a month ago for free to check it out...after just one use my skin was softer and smoother, more glow to my skin for sure.

I received this a few weeks back and have since used it once to twice a week. My face is ABUNDANTLY more clear and smooth! The smell alone is invigorating and relaxing! It was easy to wash off after and left my face IMMEDIATELY feeling better! I highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got to chance to try this mask through Influenster. It's an amazing mask. It dries down but doesn't make your face all stiff. I have very red skin and after using this mask the redness went down.

"I received the Clarify & Smooth Face Mask from Influenster in exchange for an honest review and I am thoroughly impressed. Besides being a mask, it exfoliates so well that it cleans, refines, and brightens your skin. I now use it twice a week and the change is not subtle at all. Whenever I go makeup-free, I receive loads of compliments. I will definitely be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am absolutely blown away by this mask! My skin can be sensitive so when I used it the first time I was elated when after only 10 mins on, my face felt fresh, baby soft, and it even helped clear up a few blemishes I had. I'm now obsessed.

All options are my own :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this complementary mask it left my face feeling soooo smooth after using! The color is so fun and it has little seeds to exfoliate with after letting it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. I love exfoliators and masks so this was a perfect 2 in 1! Can't wait to try the others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am absolutely shook with this product. I am blown away with the quality of the masque. The texture is really awesome and it's super easy to spread.

I received this pure clay mask complimentary from Influenster. I was so excited to try it since I absolutely love masks. It smells like lemon but not overpowering. It goes on like a paste and with in mins drys down. It has little beads of some in it so when you go to take it off they really do exfoliate the skin well.

"The clay mask felt great, smelled great and is definitely something I would use again. The scent was subtle and the mask had a smooth consistency with enough exfoliant to make my face feel fresh. The only downside was that it took a lot of product to my entire face."

I have never used a mask by L'Oréal & this one feels great.
"It goes on pretty smooth & after waiting 15 minutes for it to do its work, I was surprised by the grittiness it had dried to, in a good way!"
It worked off the flaky skin & left a smooth finish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was sent this mask for free to test and review. I'm really loving it so far! It goes on smooth and seems to calm my skin after I wash it off. It's gentle enough for sensitive skin and it seems to have improved my skins texture with only a few uses. The only downfall is the scent. It's a bit too perfumy for my liking but I really like the texture of the mask so I can get past that. I'd highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am IN LOVE with this mask!! It leaves my skin so clear an refreshed!! I have been using it twice a week and it has helped to reduce some piples i had.

"Good product for a good price! I used the mask once to twice weekly and love the way it exfoliates my skin and gives it a smooth and refreshed appearance. The color is fun and the smell is delightful and the mask itself is so gentle. I think this mask would be perfect for someone whose skin can't handle harsh products, but not so great for those with extreme problematic skin. I received this product for free for testing purposes.

Honestly I love this because it's gentle on my skin unlike other clay masks I have tried. It doesn't burn and washes off easily.

This face mask will leave your skin feeling extremely soft. After one use I noticed that my skin was more smoother and glowy. After 5 uses I noticed that I had less blackheads on my nose.

I will continue to use and see how it will benefit the rest of my skincare routine! Thanks Influenster & Voxbox for sending me this mask for free to test & review!

I got this product as a free sample for testing! I wasn't too excited that it was a metallic blue color.. seemed a little unnatural. Not dye free but I gave it a go. It left my skin feeling slightly tight but I moisturized and was fine. I did notice my skin seemed to look much brighter than before. And I had less blemishes the next day. All in all a good mask I would probably only use it once every other week because it's slightly drying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product about a week ago, complimentary from Influenster. I have moderately dry and fairly sensitive skin. That being said, this product worked great!

A little goes a long way with this product do you would definitely get your money's worth. Over all, LOVED it! Would purchase as soon as I was running low on this container.

"I relieved this product complimentary for testing from influenster. I loved the smell and texture of this clay mask. I do however find it to be a little harsh on my skin from other products I have. Although it is better than some I have as well. It's not top of the line but if you are looking for a good quality affordable drug store brand, I would definitely recommend this. If I hadn't had other stuff I appreciate more than this would have been a new gonto. For me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this mask from Influenster for free to review. I like this mask! It's so pretty, but more importantly it makes my face feel nice and cleaned out without that super-tight clay mask feeling. This isn't as drying or heavy than the other clay masks I've used. Definitely worth checking out! It's not going to revolutionize your life but if you want a clay mask that won't suck the life out of your face this is a good one!

"I travel A LOT and it usually takes my skin days to recover. I put this masque to the ultimate test by using it after my trip to Chicago this weekend.

My hate face has never looked so good! A+ L'Oreal! I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love using this facemask to detox my skin. It definitely makes my skin feel a lot better. It helps exfoliating the dead skin in the end when you take it off.

It's not something I ever would have purchased on my own, but it left my skin so soft. Can't wait to continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried the other amazing masks in this line and I have to say this one is my favorite! It smells great like the others, but it has a fun yellow color. My favorite part about this mask is the exfoliation you get, I really took my time to wash this off and my skin thanked me for it, it looked brighter and smoother, it felt soft and still hydrated. Super easy to use and take off, I love it and definitely recommend! So happy and greatful for getting to try it free, thanks L'Oréal and Influenster!

I want to start off by saying that this mask smells so good!! Application was smooth and easy. I really like the texture of the mask and that it feels like a clay mask but it isn't super thick. Washing it off was also very easy and painless. After I took off the mask my face was sp soft and smooth and looked brighter than it did before!
I received this product for free from Influenster for review!
I can't get enough of this mask. I'm a spa fan that hates driving to the SPA. This clay face mask with seaweed is everything! It's super luxurious and all you need is 10 minutes! It's a creamy formula and it gently cleanses the skin and leaves it super clean and clear. My skin was sooo soft afterward and it looked so much healthier. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask is awesome! I've used a lot of clay masks before and usually my main complaint is that they're too harsh and they leave my skin feeing like the desert. I was worried that this one would be overly drying too, but I was pleasantly surprised! It left my skin feeling super smooth and refreshed. The texture is much lighter than other clay masks I've used and glides on easily. 5/5!"

Received this mask for free in my Loreal Voxbox from Influenster. If you are a fan of Lush face masks you will live this one because that's exactly what it reminds me of. The smell is amazing and it exfoliates your skin as you wash it off leaving behind smooth polished skin. I have been using it 3x a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this mask complimentary from influenster and tried it and im hooked. It went on like butter, smelt almost like flowers and settled on my face nicely. By times end it was comfortably tight and with warm qater came off nicely. This left my face not only feeling clean but tight and bright i will be using this at least once a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Packaging is beautiful. Smell great. Color are very attractive. Texture of th product is creamy and apply very smooth in my skin. Don't feel heavy in the skin. Firm but not tight.

I received this as a part of an Influenster voxbox! I love skincare and am openin to trying many different products. This product was different because of the exfoliating aspect of the mask. I have tried other masks and they normally help the skin feel restored but this mask exfoliated. The recommended use of 3 times per week has me worried because over exfoliation can irritate the skin. But so far my skin likes it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

(clear & comfort) It makes you look like a beautiful smurf for ten to fifteen minutes while you feel a fresh tingling sensation on the face. It's so easyyy to get off, I didn't need a washcloth at all, it feels like a smooth ribbon. My skin felt so plum, clean, and moisturized! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First thing I loved about this mask was the smell! It was incredible. Secondly, the texture. When taking it off, the exfoliation felt so good. My results after the mask were immediately visible. My skin was smoother and even felt tighter. It had a matte finish but still looked fresh and not at all dull. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone! I suppose the only down side is the yellow color staining my towels, but that can be fixed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Even my husband commented that I was glowing! Yes, please! I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was sent to me from Influenster. I am so happy with how smooth the clay mask made my skin feel. Right when I applied it there was a cooling and soothing sensation. The smell is clean and just slightly lemony, so even if smells get to you I don't think this would bother you too much. My skin feels lifted and just so nice. I have to refrain from touching my skin, it feels so soft! I don't usually use masks and I am already excited to put this on my skin again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! My skin felt so fresh and reguvinated after I exfoliated with this mask. The texture was a little rough, but I could tell that it was digging deep into my pores. The Argile-Pure mask stripped my skin of all its oil, but it never dried it out. It's truly one of the best face masks I've come across! I received this product free for testing.

Smell is important because if I personally can't handle the smell I won't leave it on my face , also the clay gardens but not to where I can't make facial expressions. Overall I loved this product it left my skin glowing , and calmed my redness in my tzone area [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This deep cleansing mask leaves your skin hydrated and smooth! My skin is quite sensitive and I was apprehensive in the beginning. Once I applied - it did sting for about 5 seconds and then I was totally fine. It comes in a course texture but runs smooth on the skin. Easy to apply and wash. It left my skin glowing and even removed by black heads. Use 3 times a week for best results

Either way I was happy to try it, it's a little expensive for my liking though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received complementary of influenster for testing purposes. I used the same night I received and it smells amazing. The texture is what you'd expect. Felt a slight tingle at first but then it was fine. Left on for about 10 minutes and rinsed off my face was immediately smoother and very clear looking. Love it and I definitely recommendz [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just received this in the mail From Influenster and let me tell you I wasted no time to try it out. My skin felt so smooth and the smell was amazing.

"I used this mask last night, and I liked the texture and ingredients! I have several other clay masks but none with Yuzu Lemon. I left the mask on for almost 20 minutes but it never became uncomfortable or hurt. My skin did feel smoother after I washed it off, and it did clear some clogged pores on my chin. My only complaint is that there isn't very much product in the container. *I received this product for free to test from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just purchased this mask a couple days ago and am in love with it!!! I have tried the other masks as well and love them too. This one made my face feel soft, smooth and refreshed while adding a soothing feature. The smell is wonderful as well. Needless to say, I am hooked on these for life and I hope they are never discontinued. For an at home spa facial without the super expensive cost, I highly recommend the pure clay mask line."
I received a sample of lemon version of this mask and I was excited to try it. The mask is spa like and it left my skin looking clear and even in tone. My skin also looked brighter to me.The reason for 4 stars is I wish it was fragrance free but luckily it smells good and doesn't irritate the skin at all. Will be buying the full size. I love the glass jar it comes in too.
"I got this mask as a sample through the mail and I'm absolutely in love! It does exactly as described, draws out impurities and sheds dead cells leaving a soft and glowy texture & light on my skin!

This is my go to mask. When i have acne all over my lower lip this is where this bad boy helps alot! I would apply about three times a week and my acne would have tone down abit. The smell of lemons is what gets me to reapply this. I would say definitely worth it.
I got this for the sample package and then I was trying out:) and I was kinda of okay with it but after I was done wash my face and then there was no dryness of the feeling So I guess this is good app sign?! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the way it made my skin feel! L'Oreal has great products!
I bought this product a month back and this showed its effect within the first 2 uses. My skin was clearer and felt smooth. It feels refreshing whenever I use this mask. Love this product absolutely!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have pretty average skin for a 22 year old...a little acne here and there but nothing ever severe. I usually do have sensitive skin when it comes to any kinds of cremes or lotions, but this was amazing on my skin. After having it on for about 10 minutes I didn't want to take it off! There is a decent amount of product in the glass jar and it smells very refreshing."
"I bought this clay mask not knowing what it would be like and I'm disappointed with it. First, it's a very unnatural BRIGHT blue, which is off-putting in my opinion. But worse, it has a VERY strong fragrance. I couldn't even keep it on my face for 10 minutes because of the scent. I was hoping it would indeed be a calming experience for my face, but it's not. I would not recommend this product."
Love this mask! Great scent and exfoliation. My skin felt so soft and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Such an amazing product by L'Oreal never fails to impress me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my daily go-to moisturizer. That is, until the pump broke with over half the product still left in it. I would prefer a jar or perhaps a squeeze bottle so that this problem could be alleviated. It's pretty expensive after all."
I bought this couple weeks ago it work awesome I noticed my open pores is minimize and my skin look fresh and clean :)
"I just bought a full-size, after getting a sample from L'Oreal. It felt refreshing, and worked like a mask with a mini-scrub in one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I bought this because it was reasonably priced, it's easy to use and makes my skin feel soft afterwards. I didn't see any other significant changes in my skin which I was hoping to, but overall it's a nice basic face mask. Good for sensitive skin."
"I recently purchased this and it works pretty good and makes my skin feel fresh and clean!!! Although I don't know if it's just me, but I smell a strong, bad scent from it which gives me a bad headache making it hard to keep on!! Thankyou, though!"
I have all of the L'oreal mask and use each different one based on my skin's condition. Love this one on dry skin after acne breakout. Smells great and refreshing.
"I love the scent and the feeling of this mask. It is so hydrating, especially for a clay mask. Also so refreshing with the hint of lemon. It goes by fast though. 4/5 because there is not much product for the price."
"It's ok/good. It does what it says and doesn't leave my skin dry after. I have combination skin but more oily and visible blackheads that are really hard to get out. It doesn't do anything to my blackheads which i dont like, and for my pimples and rest of my face its ok. I think it cleans my skin but doesnt do anything very visible. Skin does feel good tho after this. Its a good mask but if u want more pore purifying mask dont buy this."
I loved this mask. I found it did a better job than ones I've purchased at certain make up chains. It's so much less and did a much better job. I loved how when the time came to remove mask it then becomes a scrub. My skin felt so great after. Definitely a fan [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought the clarify & smooth mask and it was easy to apply, didn't smell bad & came in a glass jar ( my preference so the kids don't try to use it) was worth the $ spent , I would like to sample the other 2 they offer before buying but I know this one is safe And effective."
Once I washed it off OMG ladies the results were very impressive. Thank you L'Oreal for providing us stressed out women with a REAL product that works.
"The first thing about the mask is that I love the clean refreshing smell. But for the results of the product it left my skin feeling refreshed, tightened, and more vibrant! I also have a couple of blemish spots on my cheek which seemed to appear less noticeable. I recommend this to anyone wanting to keep their skin refreshed and tightened. Thanks Loreal.

"I received a sample of this mask, and I have fallen in love with it! My skin is dry and often flaky, but after each time using the mask, my skin was smooth and dewy. This is a miracle for my mature skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used my sample and immediately felt results! I never indulge on top brand items but this was worth it. The cost was very reasonable. My face feels much softer after using the clay mask.

Like this stuff a lot! I love the texture because it's so smooth and easy to apply. The mask doesn't even feel like it's burning when I put it on. I even put it over a pimple and it helped shrink the size. It doesn't have any instant effects but you can see the results later on. Good for people new to masks.
"I requested & just shortly after received my sample of clarify & smooth face mask. I must say that I am totally in love with this mask. I was pleasantly surprised at how great this product is.

It did rinse fairly well, and my face felt smooth, but my skin was noticeably reddened due to the fragrance irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a free sample and I really enjoyed it! It's a little more liquidy than the other two L'Oreal clay masks I've tried, so I had to apply a bit more than I would with my charcoal mask. The sensation when I applied was refreshing and a little bit tingly, but not in a burning or bad way. I will definitely purchase this mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wish I had bought this before. I used it this morning and liked the smell and way it made my skin feel so I purchased a container of it.

"Like some other ladies, i too have gotten a sample in the mail, i requested it i HAD to try it. And i am not disappointed at all. It smells so pretty and it feels amazing. I dont really care for masks they dry your skin out after washed off and a few minutes pass, but not this one. I love how its a mask but an exfoliating cleanser too, once you start to wash it off. Who knew that could be a combo lol. I would definitely buy this product over and over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This clay mask not only left my face feeling hydrated and smooth. But, the clay itself dried up very quickly, which cause it to take less time. Also when I first applied the mask, the clay felt very cool on my face giving me a sense of refresh. Lastly, it was very easy to take off, I did not have to rub hard or anything like that.

I really liked this mask. I felt like it genuinely did what it said it was going to do! My face felt brighter.

I received this product free for testing.
"I received a coupon & a sample of this product & I absolutely loved it! It didn't irritate my skin nor was it too rough like some exfoliants can be, it was really great! It went on easily and felt great even when it came time to exfoliate. Such a great mask and I'll be buying it soon, not for daily use but a couple times a week. Love it! I truly cannot wait now to try all of the clay masks, especially the seaweed one I think for calm and comfort & red algae! Thank you so much for my sample!

This stuff smells like something pre-pubescent boys wore in middle school. Won't be repurchasing.
It's okay but left me with spots on my face. Fortunately they faded and I think it is doing its job.

"While I am prone to blackheads and acne, my skin still tends to get dried out in winter, so I hesitate to use masks. This mask, however, was different. Even though it is clay-based, my skin felt clean, but not taut or dry afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I left it on for 10 minutes & after I rinsed it off my skin felt & looked AMAZING!! My face was so soft & had a beautiful glow. The only thing I didn't like was the lemon smell. I will be making this part of my skin care routine!
I received this product compliments of Influenster to test and review. I have enjoyed the added brightness of my skin and the exfoliation is nice : not too rough but gets the job done! The scent is nice and it's not irritating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"full disclosure, i did multimask with a moisturizing mask around my eyes (i'm 49) but i used this mask on the rest of my face and it felt and looked very good afterwards. i would say this is a better deal than masks which cost a LOT more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample two days back and thought of giving it a try! in case you feel its just a mask (like me) the you need to know that it does both- exfoliate and cleanse. I thought of exfoliating my face before applying it so as to get the full benefit but to my surprise it already had that property.
It smells same like the garnier face cream and dries up quickly. make sure you wet your face a bit before rinsing it off so that you get to exfoliate as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this mask so much. I think my skin fell in love with it too. It was very soothing to my skin, no irritation whatsoever. I am a person with sensitive skin and I had no adverse reaction to it. It left my skin feeling so smooth, my forehead is my problem area of always feeling dry and rough but after using this mask, it was immediately smoother. I also think that my skin appears more even and bright as well. I will definitely be buying this mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a sample because I was so excited to try it! And omg I love it! It smells really good has a lemony scent! Also goes on easily and you feel a tingly sensation not too over the top but tolerable over all I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a sample for an honest review. So I lliked the smell it was lemon and kinda funny cause I looked like I had mustered with bacon bits on my face lol. When I washed it off as instructed my face felt slimy and my skin looked red. It did not feel clean at alll.
Tried the sample of the Lemon yuzu mask. Love the color - you can scare your kids and pets with this! I like to try new things but I will stick with the masks without the scrub material. I think the eucalyptus and seaweed masks are better for thin skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, I really enjoyed this mask. It was easy to apply and wash off. There was a slight tingling when I initially put the mask on, but that disappeared in less than a minutes. The mask exfoliated my skin, but did not leave it raw. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Received a free sample of this in the mail today from L'Oréal. I'm not normally a mask person but this stuff is great with the little beads.

"I received a free sample of this mask from L'Oreal Paris. It was the grape seed scrub that I was sent. As soon as I broke the top off the smell was incredible. I have very sensitive skin, having a lot of redheads in my family and this didn't irritate me at all. Left my skin feeling smooth and I could smell it in bathroom for a long time after! I love this and will definitely be buying some! I think you should give it a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It didn't blow me away as far as results, but as someone who enjoys the relaxation and pampering of masking often, I don't always want to break out my more expensive ones.

I started using the detox and brighten cleanser and fell in love! I contacted Loreal with questions about their clay masks.I purchased Clarify and Smooth and Detox and Brighten. I am so pleased. My skin is smoother and brighter. My skin can be sensitive but no problem at all. After about two months of use this is now my skin care line of choice. If you are thinking about trying don't hesitate. The sooner you start you will be THRILLED too. Your friends will notice how wonderful your skin looks.
"I got my clay mask today in the mail and I have to say it was very nice. I loved the exfoliant in the clay mask and the lemon scent was great. It gave me a tingling sensation which was nice as well. I let it sit for about 15 mins and gentaly washed it off in a circular motion to get that extra exfoliate. It left my face smooth, bright, and feeling extra clean. Thank You! I will definitely be buying more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I requested for a free sample of the Yuzu-Lemon mask and I must say, I was really impressed. It doesn't smell like a regular clay mask, it smells divine. I particularly like the dual effect of masking and exfoliation. My skin felt refreshed after I washed off the mask. Although I did not see the immediate effect as advertised, I am sure on consistent use, this mask would be phenomenal for the skin texture [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am allergic to so many things I hesitate to use anything. But who can say no to a free sample? Well its the best thing I've ever used, my skin is clear and bright after one use, and I even love the smell. I will definitely purchase this product."
I just love L'Oreal. So I jumped at the chance for the free sample. I just love the L'Oreal line. I use everything the foundation mascara and I wanted to try this new face mask as well.However they were out of samples by the time I was able to get online and order one. So what if I miss the free sample of the face mask.My five star rating is for all the other stuff that I do use.Thanks L'Oreal Sincerely Kathy Johnson
"I had the chance to get a free sample in the mail, the smell is amazing but when I used this mask I felt like my face was burning off because it felt very cold, I was expecting my skin to be all red after but when i took off the mask my skin looked noticeably brighter and felt smoother.

"Aside from the fact that this mask makes you look like a wannabe emoji, everything else is amazing. It smells super good, made my skin feel super smooth and clean, and just made me feel refreshed overall. Was also pretty easy to wash off which is a plus.

"I got a free sample of this and decided to give it a try. I was really pleased! Other clay masks I've tried have irritated my skin or caused me to break out. This one didn't give me a single problem. It felt nice to apply to my face and had a pleasant scent. My face felt soft and smooth after using the mask, and it made my face look clear and bright. I plan on buying this as soon as I can."
"I received a free sample of this mask, and both my boyfriend and I loved it. It smells fresh, with a light citrus scent that isn't overpowering. Unlike other clay masks, it left my skin feeling soft without drying it out. Will definitely buy a full-size version for the household. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so happy I got this. Haven't felt this clean and soft since my teenage years. I am very please with the way my face looks and feels. My face is pillow soft. The smell is a very nice smell. It leaves my face feeling and smelling amazing. It is not sticky or smelling of medicine. It is an absolute perfect delight to clean my face with. I will be buying this again in the near future.
Thank you for the free sample. I am impressed with your product. I have been trying out new/different products and brands looking for the one that fits my preference. This sample I recieved had enough grit in it to exfoliate efficiently. Once done my face felt comfortably tight. Im not talking about that minty feel some products have. This is a real feel. And it leaves a clean soft youthful feeling face when its all done. I will be exploring more of this brand.
"I love this clay mask, it worked wonders on my face. Typically, I have dry sensitive skin so I have to be concerned with the products that I use, but I didn't have any type of reaction towards this product. My face also felt smooth and soft when I washed off the mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I bought this at Ulta along with the kiwi scrub because I had the coupons with my samples...plus at Ulta it was buy one get one 40% off. I immediately started using it when I got home and I have to say that it is absolutely wonderful. Not only is it effective but it has a wonderful scent that immediately relaxes you and eases stress as well as a nice clean sensation during and after wards. I will definitely be buying more when I run out. Amazing, effective and inexpensive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this not expecting much, to be honest. First, the scent of lemons was so fresh and unexpected. I don't like using floral like scents on my face and this mask was perfect! It left my skin feeling smooth and clean with a even tone. I can't say enough about this wonderful mask. It's exfoliating property is gentle and effective. I can't wait to try the other masks in the line."
I tried a free sample that Loreal was offering. Wow is all I can say. I have never felt my face this smooth. It was so simple to put on and take off that it was easily worth the 10 minutes you're supposed to leave it on. I actually am writing this review only because I came to buy some for continued use.
"I received a sample in the mail and it smelled so so good! I let it sit for 10 or so min and then wash it away. My skill was bright and soft and smooth, which is important since I just turned 37. I will make sure I get more on my next visit to the store or order online ASAP! Loved it, and looking forward to trying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask left my skin feeling amazingly smooth and soft. And the feeling lasts, unlike a lot of masks that only leave you feeling soft for a few hours. Bonus points for my hands feeling soft, too, from massaging the mask off when I was done. The only thing I didn't love was the smell. It was a bit strong and gave me a bit of a headache. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this mask and I really love it. It dries out my pimples and exfoliates for smoother skin. I used it 3 times a week but since I have combination skin, it dries out the skin around my lips and nose so I have to use it less, wish I could use it everyday though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The sample I received did double duty as both a mask and a gentle exfoliating scrub when I washed it off. It did a good job of cleaning my acne-prone skin without making it feel super-tight like a lot of clay masks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first heard about this clay mask, I liked the concept. Everything it claimed made perfect sense to me. It did for my skin all that I wanted and more. My face felt smooth and clean, even soothed. I have sensitive skin by the way. By nightfall, I had my very own product for regular use. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm a mask junkie and ill be honest, I had little faith I would like a mask at this price point."

"I received this product for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love the way that this product smells! It would be perfect to start my day with if I got up early enough. Also, it feels great on my skin. The only cons are the glass packaging and the amount received for the price. I would prefer plastic packaging as I am very clumsy and I drop a lot of things in the bathroom. I would be willing to pay more for a larger amount to get more uses out of this product.

This mask didn't make my face feel too tight or uncomfortable while wearing. A little bit of product can go a long way. I did notice my skin was almost instantly smoother after washing off. I really enjoyed this face mask over other brands I've tried. My face is usually pretty sensitive but this mask didn't irritate it at all. Would definitely recommend to try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After a nice hot shower, i applied this mask to my skin and wow was i amazed at how clean my skin felt afterwards! i really feel like it deep cleaned and got rid of all the impurities that were clogging my skin. i definitey recommend this and i can't wait to use it again! I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love face masks and this one was no exception. The clay texture was great and felt very good going on. The granules did a nice job of exfoliating without being too harsh. This mask felt great and it left my skin feeling very refreshed.

"I've been been using this once a week for a couple weeks now. I have to see, it refreshes me so much and my face feels SO SOFT. I also really love the color of it. I would definitely recommend this to a friend as it's super affordable. I received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask, hands down, is just as good as any high end mask --- maybe even better! The scent is so clean and fresh, it applies and dries evenly without cracking too much or causing my (very DRY) skin to itch, and it's gentle enough for me to use whenever I like - sometimes even 2 times per week. This mask does an excellent job of cleansing and making my skin appear more refined and flawless! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am always hesitant to buy clay masks because they often leave my sensitive skin dry and too tight. This mask however, is very soothing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and tight, but not in an uncomfortable way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask complimentary for review. All comments are my own and not influenced by this.
"This mask is a great way to pamper yourself after a hard day. It's nothing magical, but it does smooth my face and calms any angry spots. It does feel a bit oily after rinsed, which was a turn off for me. I would prefer to use an oil for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this for free from influenster and it's a very nice face mask. It's a little annoying to wash it all off but other than that i love it. It doesn't make me break out and it leaves my skin feeling super soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im a skincare junkie, especialky when it comes to masks. This mask definitely rivals my previous favorite. I see a visible difference in my pores after I use it and I love the exfoliating factir too. I recevied this product for free from Influenster for reciew, but can absolutely see myself rebuying! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is really great for exfoliation purposes! I use it once a week after cleansing my face with the new L'Oréal clay cleanser. I apply it with a makeup brush - it goes on smoothly and it has a pleasant smell. It leaves my skin feeling so smoothly! The only critique I would have is that though the packaging is really nice, there isn't AS much product as it looks there would be. I got this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I waited to use this until I ran out to really review it and I really did enjoy it! The smell was amazing to me one of my favorite colors is yellow so I was super excited! Mainly because I got it free from Influenster!! I honestly do recommend it i love how much brighter my skin looks!
Purify-Mattify mask made Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday night my mini spa time. I have oily adult acne prone skin and this mask cleared up the acne while putting the oil in check.

I received this mask complimentary for test purposes from Influencer. My own personal opinion is this is amazing! My pores have shrunk and my acne have cleared! The mask leaves my skin radiant and glowing while feeling clean and refreshed. When used in conjunction with the clay facial cleanser it leaves your skin better than ever! I highly recommend the mask to everyone!
Freeman's makes better masks at lower prices. This is not PURE and has many additives. I have sensitive skin and this burned when I applied it. It also has a fragrance that is not too pleasant. I would not recommend this to anyone to use in their daily or weekly skin care routine. The packaging is nice albeit dated. I received this product free from Influenster for testing and review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tried so many mudmask, this mask is literally my favorite. It doesn't try out your skin out, like other mudmask do,I love how soft and smooth it made my skin. that glow you get after you wash out the mask, I'm so impressed with this product, I'm grateful for getting the opportunity to test this product out. this mask will be part of skincare routine for lifetime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love clay masks and this one is one of my favorite ones. My skin feels so clean and soft afterward and it helps to clear out blackheads too. I love the glass jar packaging which makes it easy to scoop up the product. The scent is somehow unisex which makes a great mask for my husband too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since this mask didn't promise to remove wrinkles or clear up my skin (which would be a miracle product!), but simply to comfort, I believe it did that. As I have gotten older, I have felt my skin gets dry, red, and irritated easier and this did feel great going on and washing off. I'll definitely be using the whole jar. It was also gentle enough that I even let my daughter try it out on her cheeks for fun with me!! (I received this free for review from Influenster) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing. I have been using it maybe two or three times a week. I love the scrub aspect of the mask.

"First off, the smell was extremely strong for me. Smells like a lot of chemicals are contained in this mask. Also, I did not see a difference in my skin after a few weeks of using it. I received this as a sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the way this mask felt on my face. I wasn't crazy about the smell while wearing it but thought, hey i can stand it for 15 min. After washing it off and for the rest of the day the mask was all I could smell. Even though I liked the results I will not use again based on how strong and overwhelming the smell was.

"I was surprised by how nice this mask was, especially coming from a drugstore brand! It made my skin so soft and clean feeling. My only problem was that I did feel that it left my skin feeling a bit dehydrated, but I think that's the norm with clay masks. Also, I wish the jars held more product (or maybe I just used too much at once) because I only got a few uses from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product free for testing purpose. All opinions are my own. I love this mask. It leaves my face looking brighter and feeling so clean. It goes on smoothly and only takes a little. I use this about once or twice a week and it works well. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try this clay mask, but was nervous knowing this type of product usually dries my skin out. Unfortunately, I was right and my skin was very dry after using. With that said, I have very sensitive skin and always have to be careful of the products I use. I think L'Oreal is typically very high quality and I would recommend friends to give this a try if they have more normal skin. I received this product free for testing from influenster, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture of this mask is so thick, and a little goes a long way. It has a nice gentle scent, and it dries down on the skin. When you wash it off, skin feels smooth and comfortable. Perfect for right before bed. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love a good mask but unfortunately they are hard to come by. This mask works great and it is easy on my pockets. The jar contains a ton of products so I definitely feel I am getting my money's worth. I've used the mask several times and I have noticed my skin is brighter and my breakouts have lessened. My skin is also less oily. I would definitely recommend! I received this product for free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After getting this Pure Clay Mask in my last Voxbox Im in love! I would compare this mask to the GlamGlow masks without all the over drying! I recommend everyone with sensitive skin who usually cant use masks like this to try it out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoyed how easy it was for me to apply this mask. I ran into issues with mask applicationso so I really appreciate how simple this product is. It also did a great job doing a deep cleaning. After one use it can see a cleaning for sure however I still had enlarged pores on my nose with some oilsort and imperfections. I look forward to continuedoing usemail to see if this works better with time. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This mask was sent to me for testing purposes Fromm influenster and I'm honestly so glad they sent it to me because it has made my skin super soft every time I use it and actually brightens up my skin. I don't really like the smell of it but overall it's an amazing mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried this once since getting it and it seemed to deep clean and renew my tired skin! Only downside is my skin was sort of red for a bit after rinsing off. I received this free for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The only words I have for this are amazing! Great price point, great product, just great. Only negative I've experienced is the blue coloring tends to remain after washing on the baby hairs around my forehead. Have to grab a makeup remover wipe to get rid of it. But otherwise well worth it."
I received this product complementary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the consistency of the mask, it's smooth and easy to apply. I used a flat foundation brush. I found the mask to be delightfully refreshing, and detoxifying. I felt like it truly cleaned out my pores but it wasn't harsh on my skin, and didn't have a harsh smell [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of my favorite drugstore brand masks! My skin was brighter and smooth after one use! Also, I how this clay looks on my face. Very fun and vibrant color!!"

My skin feels nice after using this but I️ don't think it did anything long term to help my breakout prone skin. Probably will continue to use just because it makes my skin soft. I️ received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free to review. I really loved how exfoliating it is, my skin feels super soft after I use it. After using it a few times, I think my skin looks a little brighter and some of my blemishes have gone away. My face is definitely softer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, I love the color of this mask! It is so bright blue I feel like a Na'vi when I wear it which is pretty epic. The mask glides on like skin on my skin and immediately cools my face. When it dries it feels a little tight but not too bad and I just get it a little wet then use a washcloth to remove easy peasy. Afterwards my skin feels super soft. Great mask! I received this product for free to test, all opinions are my own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask from Influenster and have been obsessed since I got it. I'm normally super picky with masks and drawn to high end because that must mean they work better!? Wrong.... this worked just as well or better and left my skin feeling silky smooth and less full of gunk. I will continue to use this in my mask options. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this mask from Influenster, for testing, a few weeks ago. I was hoping for the best when I received this mask and it did not let down. The color is gorgeous and it dries very quickly. But my favorite part about this mask was that I did not have to us a lot of product. I just needed a thin layer on my face to do the trick! I would recommend this to someone wanting to try out a new mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this face mask. The whole process is pleasant: from applying the mask, to it setting, to taking it off. There's no harsh smell, and I have a sensitive sense of smell, so that's a plus. It is a very thick consistency, and feels cooling during the drying process. After the face mask, I use the L'Oréal moisturizer for oily skin and I find it to be a wonderful combo. I received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review. I really love how this masl exfoliates the skin, but that is about it. I have been using it for about a month and have seen no long term effects. I think its good for getting that excess dry skin you have on your face, but none of the other claims it has. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask free for testing purposes from Influenster. It's amazing. No joke, my skin feels fresher, smoother, and cleaner than ever before.

I was sent this by influenster to try and I love the scent of it. While the mask was nice and seemed to do what it claimed after continued use I think I just have the wrong skin type for the one I received. I have dry skin and the more I used it the more flaky my skin seemed. Would recommend to someone with more oily to normal skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I received this for free from Influenster to try and review. My opinion is my own. I have been a Loreal customer for years and this was something I've wanted to try. It does feel weird on your face, but it's a normal feeling--as it is a clay mask."

Thanks to Influenster I received this product complimentary for testing purposes! I've never used a clay mask before so it's a super neat experience. I do feel like my face is refreshed and it helps with brightening. With it being so thick I have to use my Clarisonic to remove it in order to get all of the product off of my face. Otherwise there's still residue when I use my toner the next morning. All in all a very enjoyable product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

As of right now I own all four L'Oreal Mask. I'm just waiting for Walmart to start carrying the Yuzu lemon. The charcoal red algae eucalyptus and the seaweed masks are absolutely amazing I use them twice a day morning and night I haven't had a break out since I started!

"I received this product complimentary through Influenster, and it's now my favorite face mask. The container makes the mask easy to apply. The mask itself is smooth, which also makes it easy to apply. It isn't too thick or too thin either. The mask made my face tingle a little, but that shows me that the mask is working. My face felt so smooth afterwards. Overall, the mask has brightened my face and made me feel relaxed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Got this as a free sample from Influenster for testing and review. The one draw back is the container it's kind of difficult to get the mask out and no applicator provided. The actual product i love! It's so smooth yet has great exfoliation. Didn't overly dry out my skin and left it feeling super soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This mask is pretty great! It smells good. Goes on very smooth and feels amazing. It takes about 20 minutes or so to dry and washes off very easily. And afterwards your skin feels great and looks clean & fresh. If you're looking for a mask that is relaxing and refreshing this is it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love love love this mask! It goes on easy, and removal is easy, as well. I use it twice a week, and my skin feels so refreshed, and it leaves my skin feeling as soft as a piece of fine silk.

This clay mask works great! It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. It has helped to clear my skin. It doesn't have a strong smell or leave my skin feeling stripped. This is a great alternative to more expensive clay masks. And does just as good a job. Would definitely recommend and will purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product captures all of the qualities I love in a face mask product. It applies nicely, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and washes off easily. It even exfoliates as you wash it off!

"I received this from Influenster complementary for reviewing purposes. I have oily, acne-prone skin. First off, this is one of the most beautiful-looking masks. It's a brilliant blue shade. It truly does make my face more clean. It absorbs excess oil and cleans really well, but also doesn't make my skin feel tight and dehydrated. When I use this consistently, my acne is kept at bay and stays clear. It just has an overall brighter appearance. I love this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really like this mud mask. It smells great and does it's job. It did dry very quickly on my face, and that is my only criticism.

I received this as a free product via influenster for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The mask is okay it feels good on the skin but didn't see much of a difference.

I received this free to try and am very pleased with the product. The smell is great. The texture is that of what you want a mask to be. Easy to use. Skin feels great after. Won't irritate.

My skin looks great after using this, my pores are much smaller. My skin appears much smoother after use. The bright yellow color takes a little getting used to but it's definitely worth it. The price point is also amazing for the product you're receiving. I did receive this product for free in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love this mask. I love the blue color, it is super fun and different! I love the way it makes my skin feel after too. My skin feels very soft and clean afterwards. I think it's awesome that there is a mask like this at the drugstore and is easily accessible to everyone. I love that l'areal is doing this! I did receive this product for free but all opinions are honest. Keep it up L'oreal! Oh, you also get a big jar for your money!"
"I fell in love with this stuff! From the very first time I used it, I could tell a big difference in the texture and feel of my skin.

"I wanted to love this so much. The product smells AMAZING and it leaves my skin feeling really smooth afterwards. It has little bits in it for exfoliation, which I really liked. I noticed, though, that the next day my face felt a bit oily, especially if paired with it's face wash counter part. I would recommend this face mask though, it just didn't react well with my skin. I received this product free for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This mask made my face feel very soft after use but it has a fragrance smell and I prefer my face masks to smell more like soap or since this is a clay mask clay. It is very easy to wash off compared to other masks but other than making my face feel soft I didn't notice any difference. I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes to give my honest option. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First of all, this product smells amazing. Sometimes face masks are quite strong but this is so pleasant to have on the face for 10+ minutes. When applying/removing it has a gentle exfoliant that feels very nice. It also doesn't dry and suck my skin very tight as it dries. When I rinsed it off my skin looked brighter and felt so soft. I would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly did not notice any difference in my skin after using this mask. Only thing it did for me was make my face feel clean... Like any other mask I have used.

"This product is really bomb. I love the thickness, but it's really easy to distribute. It also gives a slight tingle and leaves your face feeling refreshed.

So I just received a sample from influenster and I absoubtly love the mask! The moment you put it on there is a tingling feeling. It's almost like you know the product is working. I did not need to put a lot on my face just used about a pea size and was able to cover my whole face. I love the smell and how well it works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Simply amazing L'Oréal!!! I never have my expectation being higher than a five whenever I receive an influencer Voxbox, but I was really impressed. Not only does it work well on it's on, I mean extremely well, but I notice you don't even have to use the corresponding face wash to get a great result from using it."

The color is unique and texture is very soothing especially when you wash it off, the beads feel like they're really working into your skin.

Be diligent to use two to three times a week!"
"When I first used this product, it felt very refreshing on my face. Just like any other mask, it dried within the 15 minute mark. Once I washed my face, my face felt like it was refreshed and clean.

"When the mask was impressed by the color, I dared to try it because it really made me very curious. I confess that I followed the steps on how to place it and the result was pure softness and less black points in my zone T, really it is fascinated. Something super important is that this peosuctos was a gift to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've made it a Sunday ritual to pamper my skin after a long week. & even though I may look like a new member of the blue man group, I am loving this mask!

"Being a college student, I'm ajwaya engulfed in stress.

This mask was very pleasing. Did not dry my skin out and I have dry skin. Only con would be it stings while I'm applying it to my face then stops as it sits. A good mask especially for the price my skin did look brighter after consistent use.

I almost always gravitate towards products for dry skin, and I've never sought out anything for my texture. This helped so much! I noticed a difference after the first couple times using it. It seems great as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask free from Influenster and it is amazing for smoothing out the skin! The mask really works like it says; clarifies while it sits and dries, smooths when you exfoliate as you take the mask off. I can tell the difference in my skin's texture after each use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this mask from the second I put it on the smell of lemons woke me up. I applied it in my trouble areas, in the sides of my nose, chin and forehead. I left it on for 20 minutes and actually felt the mask cleansing my pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for review and I'm in love with it will definitely purchase it when I run out. It goes on smooth and it feels great on my face while I'm wearing it for the 15 minutes. It also washes off very nicely unlike other masks that can leave residue behind. My skin feels amazing. I got this product for free to review but I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free from Influenster and I am so glad I did! I struggle with black heads and this masks really helped reduce them. I truly felt like my skin was cleaner when I washed my face! A great product that does what it claims! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am in love with this product. Firstly it has a great refreshing smell that adds to relaxation when using the product. Its leaves my skin with a sense of calm. My skin has a glow when I remove the mask and it feels moisturized. I feel with continued use it will give great results. I received this product free for testing.

"Loving this pure clay mask. Feels nice on the skin and smells good too, like floral. I used it with the cleanser and it made my skin feel so soft and look clearer. Received compliments from Influenster and L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask free in exchange for my honest review and I'm so glad I did! First off, I am a huge fan of using natural ingurients, like the Yuzu lemon in this mask, in my skincare routine. The exfoliating beads in the mask are also very nice to get rid of rough skin. All of the masks from this line are great and the packaging makes it feel high end! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this face mask! Sometimes after face masks, my face tends to feel dry and stripped of its natural oils, but not with this one. I felt clean and hydrated. One thing I will say though, is that there is a strong scent. It's a nice, fresh scent but could be overwhelming at first. Of course, after time the scent goes away, but for those more sensitive to scents, just beware. I received this item for testing purposes, but I'd definitely buy it on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this mask, leaves face feeling clean and smooth. I use atleast once a week and the smell is refreshing the textire is like a clay with little beads for exfoliate. Ive tried thier other clay mask so when I received this one for free i was excited because im a fan of thier clay mask collection."
"For a drugstore option, this mask is great. I felt like it worked because it leaves my skin a little tingly and it's cold, and my skin felt clean when I washed it off. I would not say it ""exfoliates"" when you rinse is off, but I did appreciate the light bit of grit as you massage the product on your skin. I will continue to use this product. I received this complimentary for review from Influenster but all my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not bing in skin care but thanks to Influenster I was able to try this product for free. Let me tell you I love how this mask smells. To me it smells like a high end perfume. After applying the mask n rinsing it my face feels super soft,tight n fresh. Would recommend this product to everyone."
"This mask goes on very cooling to my face, it goes on easily, and it's definitely comfortable to wear. I didnt notice a glow or anything after i washed it off but it t did leave it fresh. maybe after a few uses there is a difference shown? I received this product complimentary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love it! It goes on super easy and you don't have to absolutely scrub your face off to get it to come off like some clay masks. It even has a great scent to it, but it's not overpowering. It's like a natural scent. My face felt extremely smooth and refreshed afterwards. I received it for free in return for an honest review from Inflenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I started using it I felt and noticed a difference on my skin. Now I been using it every 3 days since I got my free sample from influenster. My skin looks smoother and brighter. The only thing I don't like about it is the scent. But I just had a baby on July so I might just be a little to sensitive to the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this mask! I have sensitive skin but it left my skin feeling SO soft and SO clean!! It was easy to apply, as well as fun too, and completely did it's job. Would recommend to anyone!

"I am writing this review based on a complimentary product that I received; however, all opinions are my own. I did not find this mask to be particularily beneficial for my skin or complexion. The texture was the strangest part to me because it had little beads in it that are supposed to ""exfoliate"" as you wash the mask off. I felt this left my skin greasy and not refreshed as I hope that masks would. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this face mask! It's so smooth feeling and makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards. This is one of the only products that I can see results immediately! Definitely recommend. I received this product free for testing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive been loving this mask this month. The lemon smell is refreshing with out being over powering. It has become a new staple in my weekely routine.

I received this mask from Influenster and I have to say I am impressed! This time of the year my skin starts to get dry and the mask was able to clean my skin without drying it up. I'll definitely keep using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this mask a month ago and have been using it about once a week. I love the way it makes my skin feel! It is so soft and bright after using it and makes my skin feel fresh and clean! I can't wait to try some of the other clay masks. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was lucky enough to receive this complimentary to try out and review from Influenster. I have tried the charcoal pure clay mask before and feel that both that and this mask have an intense scent that doesn't go away after removing the product from your face. I also find that the masks don't help much in terms of removing acne and diminishing scarring. I find that other masks work better for my needs, although this is a refreshing mask to use once in a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask complimentary for testing purposes. Before i tried it, I saw several reviews about the smell. I actually liked the earthy smell and didn't find it too overpowering. The mask is nice and thick and makes my skin feel so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product for free from influenster! My opinions are 100% my own and honest opinion. This clay helped tighten/closed up my pores after one use. I can see the change in my skin before and after makeup application. Less pores is a happy me. It made my skin feel fresh with unwanted oils. I love this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My favorite part of this face mask is how exfoliating it is and how it makes my face glow! It's not too harsh for the skin. It also smells wonderful right in the morning. I was so happy to receive this for free in my Vox box from Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this free product and let me just start by saying how refreshing it felt in my face. It smelled great and the texture was very creamy and felt refreshing when on. I really liked this it made my skin feel smooth and I feel for wearing it before I showered my skin was softer and it somewhat help with mundo black heads but not really. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this product to test and I loved it! Will definitely be buying in the future. I'm not a huge mask person, due to them feeling like they always leave my face feeling dry. But this one didn't give me that feeling! I felt revitalized when I used it in the morning and my pores felt so clean and my skin so soft for the next couple of days. I recieved this product for free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a conplimentary items in exchange for an accurate review from the company. I have to say the first thing that I loved about the mask was the bright color!

I would definitely recommend this product and wouldn't purchase more once this container ends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I had got this sent to me in an influencer voxbox, which I was very happy to receive!"
I applied this mask at night and left on for 15 minutes! I love that you are able to wet it and exfoliate before fully rinsing it off. I felt that it calmed down the redness in my cheeks and left my skin feeling very soft! I will continue to use this

"I am very pleased with this face mask, it has helped with my oily tzone area, i have only been using it for 3 weeks. But i look forward to seeing what difference it will continue to make. Thanks to influenster & loreal, i received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent a complementary sample of this mask from Influenster. I did not know what to expect since I do not really use clay products since I fear they will dry my skin. I did not feel that this product dried my skin out at all which was a huge plus. I love the smell and how my skin felt afterward. I don't know if it is a holy grail product, but as far as drug store options go this is a great deal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I fell in love with this! Once i put it on it did feel a little warm but when i took it off i immediately felt my skin was smoother.

I did receive this product free in an exchange for a review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product for a couple of weeks, I didn't really see a difference in my skin. This product is said to clean and clear skin while providing a luxurious experience. I did really like the smell and feel of the product. It felt very velvety on the skin and washed off rather easily compared to other products. Overall, it was an okay product but I wouldn't buy it again. I was sent this item for testing purposes through influenster and this is my honest opinion of the product."
"I tried this mask the past two weeks. I have done the mask 2 times a week. I have fallen in love! Not only does it smell great - but it feels great too! So smooth. It left me feeling cool, and fresh. It was never too tight or dry. It was easy to rinse and did not leave a residue."

I've been using this about 2 times a week for about a month & I really love it I apply it when a synthetic brush for even application & when I wash it off skin feels very smooth & clean. Btw I have sensitive skin. (Sent this from influenster to try for free.)
This mask is great! It's very effective and leaves your skin feeling super soft afterwards!

I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster.
This mask was easy to apply and made my skin feel clean and smooth. I also noticed a reduction in the blemishes on my face. The only downside is the vibrant blue color- it takes quite a bit of washing to get it all off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this mask the other day and fell in love! It smells amazing and goes on smoothly! It left my skin feeling cool, it never “stung” or felt tingly. It was easy to rinse off and left my skin feeling soft!"

This product feels so good going on and coming off. It has exfoliators in it so when you put it on and rinse it off you're thoroughly exfoliating your skin. My face felt so smooth and refreshed after using it; it even looked refreshed and smooth as well. I highly recommend this product.
I received this product free from Influenster for testing.
I received this product free for testing. I have been wanting to try the loreal clay masks for awhile. I received the clarify and smooth mask to test. I don't have a lot of acne so I can't really testify to how well it clarified my skin. It definitely smoothed it after use. My skin looked mat and felt soft and clean. I like the smell and the texture of the mask. You get a nice exfoliation when you wash the mask off. I would recommend this mask to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was not a fan of the smell of this but, it made my skin super soft. I use it all the time and honestly it is amazing. I feel like it pulls the dirt right out from under your skins and gives you a glowing shine. It did kind of burn at first but my face was fine. It did not dry it out or anything!!!! Amazing mask especially for the price! I received this for free product testing but will continue to buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I receive this product for free from Influenster for review purposes. I have always wanted to try L'Oreal's clay mark range but I wasn't sure it would be effective. Now that I've tried it, I'm confident I will buy it in the future too. The mask smells amazing and the texture is really like clay. After application, my face felt clear and smooth - a lot less dull than before. The mask has beads in it for exfoliation while you wash it off. I like that it's multipurpose! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this from Influenster and I love it! I'm so glad I got this sample it's perfect for my skin. I use it 3 times and week and really feel the difference afterwards.

"I love this mask because of how it performs on my skin, especially after I've used it. The smell is great and gentle and really clears my skin from the nasty stuff that has been in it during the day. I'd definitely recommend! I also received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this product! Honestly one of my favorite parts is that it is yellow and exfoliating. The yellow mask makes it fun and you can really feel the mask working while it is on your face. As soon as I wash it off I can feel the difference. My face is nice and smooth with no oil residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free for testing and love it! It provides great exfoliation as you apply it and when you take it off, leaving your skin feeling refreshed. Other masks I've used tend to dry and form a hard crust, but this mask does not do that so it is more comfortable to leave on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this mask for free by influenster. The mask has the perfect late and not overpowering smell, and the exfoliation while washing it off is just right for sensitive dry skin. It was not drying, or too harsh which I always appreciate! This mask would definitely make a nice addition to the new trend of customizing the mask to different needs/sections on the face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This mask is the most beautiful blue color and I love the color blue! This mask glides on smooth like a dream. It's the perfect way to experience a little luxury and pamper time after a long day. My skin is left bright feels smooth. Does not dry out skin!

It was so soft, my redness went away and it just looked so much more radiant! My skin felt so much healthier. I will definitely continue to use this product and recommend it to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found that this mask did a decent job of helping clear out some pores. It wasn't drying and my skin felt smooth and refreshed after use. I find that it can be difficult to remove completely without a good rub with a washcloth and a lot of rinsing. My biggest gripe is the scent- it is extremely strong. Scents normally don't bother me but this scent really made it difficult to wear the mask for the recommended time. I received this product for free from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this for free to review from Influenster. I am so glad I did! This smells amazing, pulls all the junk out of my pores, then exfoliates on top of it! It's super easy to use and I love that it's a drugstore brand so it's easy to find and affordable. The packaging also makes it feel so luxe (even that has nothing to do with the product itself). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This mask is absolutely amazing. With my first use I immediately saw difference in my skin. When I was taking the mask off I was wiping black heads off my face as well. I couldn't believe that it worked that well after one use! I received this product free for testing but I will definitely be purchasing it as soon as I run out of this jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product for free from influenster to try it and please dont take that as I'll say its great no matter what. This product shocked me. I put it on and left it for 15 minutes. When I take it off my skin feels so much more smooth and brighter. When I run out of this I will definitely be buying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received in my #influenster box. I'm IN LOVE! I have sensitive skin and this does not irate! I do have to say it's an exfoliating mask so I have to wash it off softly but it's worth it! I am totally buying once mine is empty! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face mask was sent to me through Influenster and I was pleasantly surprised with how it worked on my face. I typically don't buy skin care products from L'Oréal but I may just have to start investing with more of their products! It left my skin feeling so fresh, and it wasn't a hassle to get off. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask smells amazing and was easy to apply and had a fun texture but I didn't notice much of a difference. It acted more like a resurfacing scrub more than a mask but I still really enjoy using it, I am still testing it over time so I am hoping to see more results the longer I use the product. When used several times a week I'm sure you will see more results but it can also be harsh on sensitive skin to use several times a week. Love the scent, the color and the texture. Also works well with clay cleanser."
"This mask is perfection, it goes on easy and starts to harden, just a little, as it sits. Once you rinse it takes a little time to get it all off but my skin felt so smooth after using it. I haven't noticed any major changes to my complexion, but I still like how my skin feels after use. I did receive this product free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.

"I received this in my Influenster voxbox, and I am amazed at how great it works. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes and then scrub it away and it really gets rid of the dead skin! It also smells great which is a plus. I let my mom try it out and she keeps coming back for more. I recommend this to anyone looking for a refreshing face mask to get rid of dirt and oils!

I would recommend this mask if you are looking for a refreshed feel. It did not leave any residue on my face or gave me a burning sensation. It did tingle a little though. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is probably one of the best face masks that I have ever tried. The Lemon smell alone is fantastic! I love the texture of the mask because I feel like when I rinse it off, I am actually rinsing off the dirt, oil and bacteria off of my face leaving my skin super smooth and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this clay mask so so much! but the smell of the product is way to strong for me, it smells like a mens cologne and left me with a huge migraine. I loved how soft it made my skin feel after using it but I can no longer use this mask due to the smell and the fact my skin is super sensitive and caused me to break out afterwards. ): [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am totally in love with this Yuzu Lemon Pure Clay Mask and will definitely keep on using it in the future!!!

"I love this little mask. Has it dramatically changed my skin? No. But does it feel great and force me to slow down for a few minutes before bed and relax? Yes. This was a great addition my nightly self-care routine. The amount of product in jar lasts a super long time, even with daily use. Highly recommended!"

"I got this product for free to review. I thought the color was cool and the metallic finish was a nice touch. However, I did not feel like the mask actually pulled anything from my pores. My biggest problem area is ny nose, lots of black heads, I usually rely on a mask to help me out. The mask made my face feel so smooth, texture wise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love face masks and I have tried many types, brands, consistencies and this one is a great one! Personally, I have one as a favorite and it's a prestige.

"Love the salon-like quality of this pure-clay cleanser! My face feels so soft and refreshed after using this product. I love the fact this face wash feels and goes on like a mask but it's not as heavy as a regular mask. The scent is a little strong, it smells a little spicy/minty but clean at the same time. I recieved this complimentary product through Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I enjoyed using this mask. It left my skin feeling very soft. The fragrance is quite large by lasting. I like that the mask incorporates natural ingredients, however I wish that were more evident in the fragrance. I received this product for free and exchange for a review.

"This was a different color and texture than any mask I've ever used. I'm all for anything that's exfoliating so I was intrigued. I saw immediate change to the tone and brightness of my skin, I was impressed! Will definitely be using again and might try another one of the ""flavors"" at the price point. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try this face mask that I received from Influenster for testing purposes! It feels great going on, is not cakey, stays comfortable while it sits, and easily comes off. The results are a soft, clear face! I can't rave enough about this sweet smelling mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this amazing face mask complimentary of Influenster and Loreal. Using this mask one time not only calmed my acne but helped calm the redness in my skin. I've already recommended it to several friends. It smells great and isn't harshlike a lot of face clay masks are. The formula is gentle and great for all skin types that are acne prone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. I went in without any expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. I tried out the mask after a very long trip, and I really felt and noticed a difference in my skin texture when I finished. Completely refreshed after a full day of travel! I always have liked clay masks, and really liked that the texture of this one was creamy and easy to smooth evenly onto my skin. Definitely enjoying this one!"
"I received this for free from Influenster, but that does not sway my opinion one way or the other. I've tried all of the masks in this line, and this one is my favorite. It's detoxifying, while not drying out my already very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this mask for over a month now and although i dont use it all over it has been heaven sent for the sides of my face/ jawline area.. The exfoliant is harsh so I have to remind myself not to rub too hard after it sets but this mask leaves my skin so incredibly soft afterwards and has really help with my breakouts! The bright yellow color is just the icing on the cake . I received this product complementary for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from Influnester to review for free and I absolutely love the results I got. Before using the mask, my skin was dull and the discoloration was more prominent. After using the mask for the first time, my skin had a glow and was soft to the touch. My skin started clearing up and evening out. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love using this mask. First, it's fun to use because it's so pretty! I love the shimmery blue color. So that makes it's fun to use and easy to see what spots need more goop. My skin first refreshed after use! I will definitely continue to use this in the future."

"I loved this mask! It has a gritty feeling to it, so if u don't like that feeling I wouldn't suggest it. It applies evenly on the face which I enjoyed very much! The drying process was a little uncomfortable as the mask started to burn and tighten. It came off very easily with a little bit of water and rubbing it in a circular motion. I received this product for free thanks to Influensters VoxBox, which is a great thing. Overall I enjoyed this product and will be buying more in the near future!"
I received this free for my honest review. The mask is easy to apply and has a refreshing smell which is important to me. I often have dry patches on my face and this smoothed it right out. I will definitely purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the softness of my skin after using this mask! I found it to be extremely relaxing and fun to use. It's great for all skin types.

"I've tried several different clay masks high end and drugstore and this Pure Clay mask by Loreal is literally my favorite. It has a light clean scent and the texture is perfect. I have very sensitive eyes but this Clay mask doesn't irritate them at all. Once I wash my face after using it, I can literally feel my face breath. And a healthy glow from within appearance. I would definitely recommend... I did receive this product for free for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I recently bought this product and I must say it is indeed one of the best, if not the best fave mask I've ever tried on my skin. I have sensitive skin so it's hard finding products to use on my skin that won't irritate it. I have had no problems with this product and I am extremely satisfied with the results. It left my face feeling hydrated and clean. I love this products."
"This product works really great. It makes my skin feel so soft after. The only downside is that it can be a little messy getting off so I started putting it on, waiting the allotted time and then getting in the shower to take it off. It smells great too! Note: I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this mask because the second I put it on, I could feel it cleaning my pores & drying unwanted pimples. Then, when you wash it off, it immediately feels smooth and moisturized. This is a clay mask worth trying & one that doesn't leave you with dried out skin like some other masks I've tried. I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster. Will definitely purchase when mine runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have oily skin and have had some bad acne flare ups lately. I've been using this all over and as a spot treatment to soothe and calm the irritated areas. It smells nice and stays on well and isn't hard to wash off.

"I was lucky to receive this complimentary from the brand Influenster. I have been using the facial mask for 4 weeks, twice a week. I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My skin appears to be brighter and cleaner. I have also noticed that my skin is much smoother then it once was. I paired this product with the Purify Cleanser and found that when using these two products together, my skin felt much better. I would recommend this item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried several clay and mud mask and this clay mask definitely measures up. A little goes a long way and it applies so smoothly on the skin. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all. The only downfall is the smell, it's very perfume like and I'm not a huge fan. Aside from that its a great product!!! I received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this item for free from Influenster for my honest review. This stuff smells great. The jar is heavy and feels very luxurious. Easy to put on. Love the blue color. Immediately after my face felt very soft and smooth. I've used about three times so far and every time my skin looks better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Got this complimentary in an Influenster box. But I love face masks, so i was definitely excited to give it a try. I love the smell of it right off the bat. My only complaint was that I have long nails, so without any kind of tool to dig the clay out of the pot, some of the mask ended up under my nails, which I did not like. Otherwise it was awesome, easy to remove, and my face felt SO soft afterwards. I definitely want to try out some of the other masks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product for free for trsting purposes, and it did wonders for my face. I have a combination skin and it didn't dry out and it didn't make my face oily after one use. It cleared up my most stubborn blemishes and some of my redness on my skin. I wasn't a fan of the smell, frankly I think the smell was too overpowering. But it did its job of soothing redness or stressed skin. I recommend this product for anyone who has redness, stubborn blemishes, and combination skin."
This mask is great! Its an awesome alternative for the super expensive stuff. Works just as great at a better price point. I received this product free for testing but I liked it so much I bought it for my sister. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is such a good product! It's great feeling on my skin. It helps with my weird sometimes normal, sometimes oily skin. I love the scent and it's essy to put in. It did dye my sink blue and looked like i drowned a Smurf, but it was easy to clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes and I am so happy I did. My mom and I both tried it and loved how it smelled and made our skin feel.

"Thanks to @influenster and LOREAL I got a chance to try a full size of this amazing product for free! After several uses this product, my face was left soft and clear, but even more amazingly brighter. By far one of my favorite face masks that aren't super expensive!"
"I received this product for free from Influenster. I'm a huge fan of face masks and this has to be one of my favorites right now. It smells awesome, is so smooth, and wipes off effortlessly. My face is left feeling so soft! My only pit is that I wish it had come with an applicator brush for easier application and less mess. Otherwise, awesome product with great eye catching packaging-looks like it would be spendy had I seen it on a department store shelf!"
"I did enjoy using this mask. It did not dry out my skin and left it feeling very smooth. I noticed that the dark marks on my face were a bit brighter the next day. The smell is pleasant and not too overwhelming. I received this from Influenster to try out and I'm glad I did. I enjoy my higher end masks more, but this is great for the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The new @Loreal Pure Clay Masks are one of my new drugstore favorites. I received the Pure Clay Cleanser, the Pure Clay Clarify & Smooth Mask complimentary to try & I purchased the Pure Clay Charcoal Mask. They make my skin feel so fresh & smooth, also less tired. These drugstore options are affordable at home spa treatments for getting The Glow when you don't have money to blow! I mean, you didn't want to leave the house anyway... Am I right? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks now and I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. My face is brighter and cleaner.

I received this product in a VoxBox through Influenster. Overall it is a very good product. I have sensitive skin so the only thing that I did not like was when I first put it in my face there was a stinging/burning sensation. But it wasn't too bad to the point that I couldn't keep the mask on my face and the sensation started to go away the longer I kept the mask on my face. I do love how the mask exfoliates my skin as I wash it off. I could tell the difference just after one use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask smells amazing for starters. It does sting a little when it's first applied and for the first couple minutes, I think because of the lemon in it. But otherwise, I liked this mask a lot."
*I received this product free for testing purposes* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask goes on smooth and doesn't feel cakey or gross. I like that it never full dries so your face doesn't crack and feel like it's drying you out. It does help with oil on your face though! I have seen an improvement in the overall look of my face. I'm 31 with good skin however I've got a few places that have sun spots that have been bothering me. I feel like this mask has made my skin look more even! I did receive this for free but my opinions are truthful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this mask for about 2 weeks now. I can say that this mask leaves your face feeling moisturized and looking flawless. for the most part i do have clear skin, but finding a product that leaves my face feeling moisturized and soft has always been a struggle. This mask really helps my combination skin!! I would recommend it to those with that type of skin. I received this mask in my influencer VoxBox for testing purposes."
I received this product for free from Influenster and I was so excited to try it. The mask smoothed out my imperfections and improved the texture of my skin.

"I received this product for testing from Influenster a few weeks ago. For someone who had oily skin I'm always trying to find something to tone down the oil and show nothing but beautiful skin. I'm so glad I was able to test out this product. It left my skin so smooth and not dull,shinny and not oily. I love the smell of the product and the fact that it wipes off easy. I would recommend."

"I received this full-sized product from Influenster and Loreal to try for FREE! My favorite part about this mask is; dries quickly and when you start to wash it off, you wet your face and the mask turns into a scrub! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from Influenster to review. I was pretty impressed the first time. It's not a super crazy mask, but it definitely works for me on the days I don't do my more intense mask (the instructions say to do it 3x a week). It smells fantastic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask was wonderful. It has little exfoliating beads in it that you massage into your face to get the full effect and they definitely work! I keep my mask on for 15 minutes, and after I take it off my skin feels extremely smooth and my complexion is looking better! The packaging does look very good, however, I found it a little awkward trying to get the product out of the jar. I received this product free to test from Influenster.

"I was sent a sample of this that I tried over two weeks combined with the pure clay cleanser and I could clearly feel a difference in the oiliness of my skin, not just immediately but also waking up the next morning. My makeup stayed more matte than usual throughout the next day. As a seriously oily girl, I was pleasantly surprised and would definitely recommend this to help control oil!

I wore it two to three times a week. The texture is so nice and the fragrance is good. I mix it with the gray one and they're like made to each other leaves my skin feeling so soft and fresh.

I was sent this mask to test for my honest review. So far it's a 5/5 for me because of how my skin feels after I wash it off...baby soft! The exfoliating beads remove my dull skill and after 10 min of having it on my face feels fresh. Also anything with lemon helps even the complexion which I need! Try it out!

"This is great for exfoliating the microbeads in it feel great! I massage it in as I apply it and massage it again as I'm washing it off! My skin definitely feels smoother after using it but I wouldn't say my complexion looks any different. Not my personal favorite smell in the world but not the worst either. Packaging is great and the product is easy to use. Received it complimentary from Influenster, probably not a product I would have picked up alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The color is definitely one of my favorite parts, but I do love how my skin feels after I use this mask. I had blemishes on my face that would irritate anyone and I used this mask, kept it on for 15 minutes, took it off and my skin looked so much better. I don't use it every day, but I use it 2-3 times a week. I did recieve this product for free testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start by saying it does wonders! It smells nice and the texture is soft. When you put it on it feels fresh. Oncr taken it off your skin feels smooth and moisturized amd its easy to apply on. By the way this product was free for testing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, I'd say this mask isn't bad for a drugstore product, but WOW, the smell is so cloying, it makes my nose hurt. There's no way there needs to be that much fragrance in a face mask. That's pretty much a deal breaker for me personally but the performance is pretty good - I have combination skin and this wasn't too oily nor drying. I don't think it made my pores smaller, though. I received this product compliments of Influenster for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free through Influenster for testing purposes. I really enjoyed a cool of things about this product. Firstly, the scent is very pleasing that smells mildly like citrus. Secondly, I liked the exfoliating texture of the mask. As someone with rather oily skin it's nice to feel like I am getting a deep cleanse. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face mask features yuzu lemon which is anti-bacterial, anti-aging, treats acne and boosts vitamin c. I received this 2 weeks ago from Influenster and was surprised as the results.

"I got this product FREE from Influenster, and I am in love with it! It is light and scrubby, and It doesn't feel weird once it dries. I actually forgot it was on! It's comfortable and smells amazing! After washing, my face is so smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was my first time using a mask in idk how many years. Overall I enjoyed it. The consistency was easy to work with and to apply. Honestly though.. I haven't noticed a huge difference after using it as instructed for a little over a week. My skin looks “awake” after I use it but doesn't last too long. It also sort of leaves my face dry afterwards. All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. But it was nice to receive for free in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many masks & I can't say that any of them really astounded me. This mask smells nice, goes on easily, it's definitely comfortable to wear while it sets in, and it comes off easily. There's no harsh scrubbing or red patchy skin afterward. I did not notice a glow, but I think this mask does what it says it will. I received this product complimentary from Influenster, and I'm very pleased after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask works as it is intended to work. I really love the smell of it, it's a relaxing smell. The mask itself doesn't dry down crunchy and removal is super easy, no hard scrubbing to get it all off.

I received this from Influenster for testing purposes but I would definitely also purchase this mask with my own money! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently received this product in the mail and couldn't wait to try it. First of all, it smells AMAZING!!! The formula leaves my skin soft and glowy afterwards.

I was sent this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster and I have to say I really love it. I have used it several times along with the Pure clay cleanser and I have noticed an improvement in the brightness and clarity of my skin. I do wish the mask and cleanser foamed up a little bit more but it went on nice and easy and it washed away just as simply. Great mask.
"The mask is worth it ladies, it leaves your skin clean and smooth, fresh every use, this is a great idea for sleepovers or favors in bridal showers! For the price it is really on the top of list of beat retail store mask!!! I recived this product to test by influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before this, I've been using the purify + mattify mask and is a huge fan of it! Despite the fact that it's inexpensive compared to others, it works wonders!

"I Recieved this mask free from Influenster for testing and I love it! It leaves my skin super soft. I would've like if it was able to peel off instead of wash off cause it's cause a hassle once it's dried but other than that I loved this product! I'm not much into masks, more into exfoliaters. So I'm not too sure I would purchase this item after I've run out but if you want a good mask, I recommend this one! IT SMELLS AWESOME TOO! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was never a huge fan of clay masks till I tried this one! My skins pretty normal with a little dryness. After using this mask my skin feels so smooth and plump!

I received this product complimentary of Influenster for reviewing purposes. This bright blue mask has a great scent and even better effects on my skin. I have used it twice now and have received several complements on how glowy my skin looks!

I received this product free through Influenster. I honestly did not think I was going to like it but I'm so glad I was wrong. I have been using this mask a couple of times a week along with the pure-clay cleanser and my skin has become so clear I honestly cannot believe it.

I have used this mask twice already and I absolutely love it. It feels sooo good when you apply to the skin and even better after. If you have any rough skin this is a great mask to focus on that area. I did receive this product for free to test out but it did not effect my opinion at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so very impressed by this clay face mask. After washing the mask off, my skin instantly felt refreshed. My skin tone looked bright and even toned. I really enjoyed the scent and I found it to be long lasting which I loved. I'm on week two of using it twice a week and I'm very happy with my skin. I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this in a VoxBox, and I was surprised to see how well it worked with my skin! I have a combo of oily and dry skin, and have a hard time finding a product that works for me. This is it! On the first try my face felt rejuvenated. It left it so smooth, and clean! 100% Recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review. I really loved this mask. The scent is amazing, and after I washed it off my skin felt incredibly smooth. I loved the feeling as it started to harden on my skin because I felt like I could feel it working into my pores. Will continue to use and probably purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product left my skin feeling so smooth and clean. I used the L'Oréal Pute Clay Cleanser before this and together the combo made my skin feel so great! It also smells wonderful. I received this product for free via Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"(I got this product for free to review, however all my opinions are honest and my own!) After the first use I noticed my skin felt soft and hydrated. After the first week and a half with application being every three days, I was in love. My combination skin loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask complimentary from Influenster and did not have very high hopes. However, when I opened the jar, the smell instantly made me excited to try it. It smells slightly of men's cologne but super fresh and clean! I love it, the mask seemed to work pretty well. My skin felt really soft and clean after using it. It did kinda make a mess in my sink though. But overall, great product and I want to try others in the line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved using this mask! After letting it sit on my skin then exfoliating while washing it off, it left my skin feeling bright and rejuvenated. I would highly recommend to anyone with an uneven texture or dull skin, it makes skin feel so fresh and clean. I also loved trying out this product in my VoxBox free from Influenster!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from Influenster and after a few uses this has really haloed my skin become smoother, and clearer! After use number one, I did notice a few more breakouts than normal on my skin but the mask is so good it takes away all the gunk! The texture of this mask is different but the way your skin feels is so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this for free through Influenster to try and review. It feels good once it's on the skin, but it does burn a bit while going on. It smells good and leaves my skin feeling soft! I haven't noticed a difference overall in my skin, but I've only used it twice. I would say there is enough for about 4 applications, unless you have a tiny face. It's a decent product, not my favorite, but not bad either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how easy it was to come off and it really made my face feel great afterwards. Felt extremely clean and the smell is incredible in my opinion. Smells a lot like a cologne. I would definitely recommend this product. *i received this product free for reviewing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask was just okay I thought. I wasn't highly impressed with results after 2 weeks. I used twice a week and after second week I haven't noticed major results. I will say it was comfortable when applied and came off easily. Has a very nice scent. But I didn't see it doing anything major. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. However, opinions are 100% my own!"
I was so excited when I received this mask in the mail and it did not disappoint! The only down fall is it did cause a couple blemishes the first time that I used it but I kept with it and my skin has never looked better! I would recommend this product to any one looking for a good clay mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that this masks exfoliates too! I hate having twenty different products to take care of my skin. My already-dry skin dries out when I use lots of different products. Now I can have a mask and an exfoliant, cutting out an extra step. This stuff left my skin feeling smooth and soft."
I received this product as part of an Influenster box. I used the product 3 times and I am very happy with the product and results. After using the product one time my face felt very smooth and soft. I used the product 2 additional times and had consistent results. My face seems brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is amazing. I was skeptical before actually trying it because of the color and consistency. It felt very nice on and the day after I used it my skin had dramatically improved! I have somewhat sensitives skin and this did not irritate it at all! I did receive this product free for testing but I will continue to buy it when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved using this mask! It's different than other masks I've used before. It's exfoliating and leaves my skin feeling super soft. The color is super fun too. I received this product for free to review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this mask from Influenster and was a bit disappointed, particuarly because the scent is so overpowering. It smells strongly of chemicals meant to be floral, but in a clay mask that seems strange. My face also didn't feel as clean as when I've used other clay masks. This mask doesn't dry quite as well as others, although some people might prefer a more moist product. All in all, it wasn't terrible but I would not purchase this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask is perfect for a spa day at home. The pure clay and seaweed formula is non-drying and left my skin feeling refreshed, clean and comforted. If you are looking for a good mask I would recommend this one."

Clarify & Smooth Pure Clays + Yuzu Lemon Mask Was so refreshing to my face. Right after made my face so soft! I also loved the smell! I'm surprised hat it did not irritate my skin. Totally recommend it to friends and family. I received this item free for testing. Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this from influenster, and I'm always super wary when it comes to skincare. I have very sensitive/acne prone skin, but I thought I'd give it a go. I didnt have any break out issues, and it did help brighten my acne scars! The body wash was great too, in that it helped to purify my skin. These both have nice, refreshing scents, too! Nothing irritating at all. Pleasantly surprised!"
This product left my face feeling refreshed. I have a lot of texture on my skin and I tried this for 3 times a week for 3 weeks and wow has it made a difference. The texture of the mask is different than most clay masks. It's is a lot thinner but it does the job. I received this in my free voxbox and I can't wait to test out more L'Oréal products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I truly ended up loving this mask! My skin feels amazing right after and the next morning. I've used this twice a week and have a seen a difference in my skin staying clear. Love everything about and the price is very reasonable. I was given this to try for free and plan to buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this mask a couple of times and I'm loving it! The first time I used it was after a 9hr flight, so naturally my skin was a mess - crazy break out. The mask helped calm my skin just after one use! I definitely do recommend this product. I got my mask complimentary from Influenster."
"I used this mask initially for the exfoliating benefits, but found while it was on my skin, it had a very fresh and clean feeling on the skin. After cleansing off and massaging into circles on my skin, my face felt smooth and was brighter. I loved this product and actually did a double take when I saw the brand. I received this item as a free sample from Influenster, and it will become a regular purchase of mine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I quite like the color and texture of the mask! I applied it with a flat brush to get an even application. It works well on my dry sensitive skin. It's for exfoliation and I think it does it's job well. I would say it's more of a gentle exfoliate. Pretty good for the price. Influenster sent this to me to try for free to review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Every time I use this mask I am pleasantly surprised by how gentle yet effective it is. It makes my skin feel extremely healthy. With the weather getting colder I have to be careful not to dry our my skin and this mask is a lifesaver. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't typically use masks so I can't compare it to others but I was really impressed with how much product you can get out of the small jar. Just a small amount spreads really smoothly, covering a large area without going too thin. The mask smells great and is soothing. After removing, my face feels softer and smoother. Sometimes I have a problem with a little bit getting stuck in my pores though. I received this item complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i was given this for free to try by influenster for an honest review. i have tried the detox mask and absolutely fell in love with it so i was excited to see how the comforting one would help my skin. using this twice a week for a month i haven't noticed a difference in my skin. while the smell and color are nice, that's the only good thing about this mask [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is awesome. Ive been wanting to try a clat mask but was worried about it drying out my skin. It was perfect! Didn't dry out my face, and was cooling and comfortable while on. When I washed it off my face felt clean and smooth! I received it free to try from influenster but plan to buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this mask! The texture is somewhat gritty so not only does it allow you to clarify your face you get to exfoliate some as well. After using the mask my skin was noticeably softer and smoother. I received this product for free for testing but I would love to repurchase it in the future!
So I received this product complimentary from my influenster box & I tried my face mask for the first time last night & I must say I saw a difference right away. My skin was smooth and soft. Overall it felt clean & rejuvenated! I also like how the scent is not too intense like some other face masks that I have.
Great product! Leaves my skins so soft and feeling refreshed. I love the smell of it too. I noticed its helping tone my face amd its getting rid of the redness i have around my nose. I received this product for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free to try and was so glad I did. After even one use of the mask my skin felt softer and didn't leave my skin feeling tight or irritated as other masks have done in the past. I would 100% recommend this mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this mask complimentary from Influenster! I've tried a few of the L'Oréal Pure Clay Masks before, so I was super excited to give this one a try! I love how soft and smooth it leaves the face feeling! You can definitely tell that your skin has been deep cleaned after using this product! The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the smell— and that's something that I can look past! I really like how this made my skin look and feel—just after one use!

This product worked wonders for my skin. It left my skin smooth and silky. I was surprised because i didnt think that l'oreals mask would do the job. But it did. I recently got married and i felt my skin super clean. I would definitely buy this product and use again. I actually rated this for my bridesmaids (11 ladies in my party) and some bought the product because of the glowing recommendation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is one of my new favorite masks. It's so light and refreshing. It truly leaves you feeling rejuvenated! I love the smell and the fact that it was not flaky like many others masks I've used from other brands. It was so light and comfortable that I almost forgot I had it on. I could definitely notice a difference in my skin- it was much softer and brighter. I received this product for free for testing purposes but I would definitely recommend this mask to others.

I received this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I really like this mask! It's a reasonable price and it keeps your face feeling fresh. It smells very nice as well!!

I received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster. I absolutely love it. The smell is what stood out to me the most. Normally I don't notice a smell to face masks but this one smells sooooooooo good. Also I felt like my skin had improved since using it. The product I used is designed for clear and comfort. I also really like the texture of the product it is very light on the skin and works great for my sensitive skin
I absolutely love this mask! I love that it has mostly safe and natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. I love the thick consistency and how it exfoliates my skin at the same time! I feel like this mask helps with breakouts and keeps my skin soft and glowing. I got this for free from Influenster :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this from influenster for free to give it a try but I really enjoyed this product. I felt it smoothed out some rougher spots on my face. I did however find it difficult to remove easily. My face felt a little gritty from the exfoliator for a few hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent this mask for free from Influenster, but I'm still obsessed with it! The texture is so smooth, and you only need a little bit to cover your whole face. I let it dry for about 15 minutes, then rinsed it off and followed up with the cleanser. My skin felt SO incredibly soft & smooth. definitely recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask for free by influenster in my Pure Clay VoxBox. I used this mask after visiting the sauna on a well-steamy face. First impressions were not very good. Because I felt a burning sensation on the skin, but gradually it passed. After washing off the skin was very soft and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this pure-clay mask! Using it has made my skin so so soft. Its has like a ""scrubby"" texture and I feel like it really pulls the impurities out from my skin. Ive been using it for a bout 2 weeks now, and got it for free in by Influenster Vox Box (received it free for testing). I love it and am so happy I received this- will re buy :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product in a campaign and was so exciting to try a new face mask as I have been trying to take care of my skin better. I loved the color and texture of this product, it is very smooth! But I don't feel like it takes out any impurities in my skin. My pores didn't seem to subside after use. My skin was noticeable softer though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complementary for reviewing purposes. Love this mask. It smells great, goes on smooth, plus it has a great blue color which makes it fun. It rinsed away easily and left my skin with noticeably tighter pores and feeling soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this free in my influenster voxbox. After one use my face felt amazing! The texture is a little odd at first, (I'm used to smooth) it was a little bumpy. After letting it dry 15 minutes on my face I started to rinse it off and even that felt good. It wasn't goopy, but it made soapy bubbles on my face. I will continue to use this, but I'm going to try the other products too. Very pleased with this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ohhhh let me tell you I love this mask! I think it smells great, and it has a bit of texture to it which makes me feel like it's really scrubbing down the pores when I'm putting it on and washing off. It leaves my face feeling so fresh and tingly after rinsing it off. Definitely DON'T leave on too long if you have sensitive or dry skin. I have neither so I leave on for about 20 minutes. Soooo happy to get the duo mask and cleanser FREE from influenster to try out to give feedback. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask free for review from Influenster. Was it my favorite mask ever! No! But it was
A great mask for its price point. This mask has a great smell and left my Facebook feeling clean a refreshed after use. I also noticed the days after I used this mask my face felt smoother. Definitely worth a purchase [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The yellow makes this mask so unique! It smells great and I love how it exfoliates as you wash it off! Great value and quality!

This does a great job of smoothing out skin and gently exfoliating as you wash it off. I've been using it for a few weeks and it seems to remove excess dirt even after washing my face. I received this complimentary through the Influenster program. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I usually don't like exfoliating masks but this one is amazing! I love that I only have to leave it on for 10 minutes so it's not that long of a wait time. It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. If I have any dry areas on my skin this takes it right away. This is one of my new favorite masks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask left my skin visibly smoother after just the first use! The only downside is that the perfume scent of this mask is overpowering. I received this mask as part of a Voxbox from Influenster to try for free and review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't rave enough about this mask. Upon opening the container you see it's just a normal container and some grounds used to exfoliate. I like to see the texture, not too large but not tiny either. The smell alone is worth a repurchase but I was so surprised to see my skin smooth and glowing after the first treatment! This in conjunction with the cleanser is amazing for my oily skin and now I won't have to buy my expensive Kiehl's skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell of this is amazing. It's not over powering and makes me feel like I'm in a spa. I'm skeptical of exfoliators in washes or masks because they tend to not agree with my skin unfortunately this mask didn't agree with it either :( however, my face felt very clean and smooth after each use!! I received this complimentary of influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask for reviewing purposes. I really like the smell of the mAsk and the way that it seems to smoothen and refine my complexion after I use it. I don't really see any huge benefits so far. I'm more of a fan of more “natural” clay masks with clay or natural minerals as the main ingredients, that being said, I like this mask now that I have it, but without being a standout and without those heavily pure componentes, it's not a “must have” for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this mask. It's easy to apply and to rinse off. It leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. It has a great texture and goes on evenly. You only have to apply it up to twice a week and you can feel it working from the very first time you use it. I recommend everyone try it because I am sure you'll be very satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product via influenster, and it is not something I would have normally purchased myself... in fact it took me a couple weeks to get around to using it... and I am completely blown away! I absolutely love it! It made my skin feels so clean and rejuvenated! I am also very surprised at how smooth my skin is :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free from Influenster to test and I am in love with it. It feels so light on my face unlike some other masks I've used in the past.

"This product took me by surprise, it felt so nice on my skin, no weight, just apply and dry basically. I didn't feel any discomfort which was really nice!! I honestly love this product. I also received this product for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pleasantly surprised with this facemask! I have pretty dry skin and products that clarify usually just dry out my skin but this mask didn't do that. It made my skin feel really cleansed and smooth. There are little exfoliating beads in the mask so it also gently exfoliates too. I'm worried that it might be drying during the winter months so I'm definitely going to pick up the clear and comfort version! I recieved this product free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I loved the smell of this product..made me think I was in hollister for some reason. The texture was nice and it was very cooling when applied. Taking it off though was s such a disaster. It took me like twenty minutes to scrub this stuff off my face. The next day thought I woke up and my skin felt super smooth.. less red than normal as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this mask complementary from Influenster to try and absolutely loved it. The smell was wonderful, and it made my skin feel so great after using it. My skin looked brighter after using it, and the cooling sensation the mask caused was so delightful. The small poppy seeds in the mask acted as a great, gentle exfoliant when I was rinsing the mask off, and I didn't feel any residual tightness afterwards either.

"I received this free for testing purposes. I'm hooked though! Masks often make my face breakout given my sensitive skin, but I've used this one several times and my face looks and feels incredible! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask is the best one I've tried in quite some time, it left my face feeling so smooth and clean, I could definitely tell a difference in my skin after the second use, oh and it also washes off so easily when your done! I would recommend trying it out if you have oily skin like me! I received this item complimentary for testing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for about two weeks now. It smells so good! I really love the simple packing. After using it my skin feels so smooth, plus while you have it on you get to look like a lemon. Usually masks make my skin feel overly dry or overly moisturized. This mask works for my normal to cry skin so far! I received this product to test for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this for free to test it and I LOVE this mask! I love using this after a long day, my face feels instantly refreshed! My skin feels instantly soft after I scrub it off. I've been using it a couple times a week, and have seen an improvement in the brightness of my skin. I also love the smell! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this sent to me for free for testing purposes. The first thing that I noticed was that the size was extremely generous and it was a heavy-duty jar, like an expensive luxury skin-care line. I love that it is packaged like this, rather than in a squeeze-tube. This mask smells fresh and lemony, but it's not in any way overpowering. It wakes you up in the morning, and makes your skin look bright and glowy! Definitely a good mask, and I would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask free of charge for testing purposes and I have to say- I like it a lot! It has a pleasant light smell and doesn't burn when it's drying! It has little exfoliators in it to delicately polish the skin which I appreciate for my dry skin type [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this from Influenster in my lovely voxbox and this mask is great. It's like 2 in 1. It's a mask and an exfoliater. It doesn't dry my face out and leaves my skin feeling super smooth and looking brighter [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as a gift from Influenster to review. I absolutely love everything this product does for my skin. It leaves my skin soft, bright and free of imperfections. It's magic in a jar. I will buy this product for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The blue metallic color is so fun and it smells amazing! It glides on very smoothly and it seriously left my skin feeling firm and smooth! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the feel of my face after this mask. It applied very well with a brush. The one thing I didn't like was the super perfume smell. It was a Bit overwhelming.. after I washed it off my face dead feel clean and soft and looked a little more even toned. Overall it's a good product. I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have combination skin and very little acne. I found this has helped even my skin and skintone. It also is a fun bright blue, even though that doesn't speak to the effectiveness. I found I did produce more oil initially but after a few uses that side effect calmed down. It also has a strong fragrance which might bother some people and their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for a free trial through Influenster. It smells great, but the yellow color is a bit off-putting when you apply it all over your face. It worked as a great exfoliator, but maybe not any better than my normal physical exfoliating scrub. Couldn't tell if the clay had any major impact on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The claim that this mask will visibly reduce blemishes after one use is 100% in my experience. I used it as a spot treatment the first time on a few pimples on my chin. I was completely blown away at the reduction in size, and irritation after washing it away. I will definitely buy again and would recommend to a friend. I also am excited to try the other masks in this line. I received this product for free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask for free from a VoxBox promotion. While I liked the exfoliant with the mask, I did not like the yellow color and how it dried on my face. I also would have appreciated a more soothingly lemon scent while wearing the mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was sent to me for free from Influenster, and my mother (age 50) and I (age 20)have been testing it for about 2 weeks now. She said her skin feels amazingly firm and her skin tone has evened out a ton as well. Of course my skin is more on the firm side to begin with, but I am very oily. This product has helped with that quite a bit I feel! Overall, love the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask free to test and I really enjoyed it! I have acne prone skin and this product did not break me out and it gently exfoliated my skin which I really liked! I will continue to use this mask and the yellow color is really fun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The mud mask was unlike any other. It was hydrating and calming, while also clearing. I suffer from dry patches on my cheeks and this didn't make them worse or dry my skin out! The scent is kind of strong though, so may irritate it if used too often. But overall a great mask. I received this for review purposes, but my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As someone with dry skin, I tend to stray away from clay masks, but this one completely changed my opinion! This mask is the perfect mixture of exfoliating and moisturizing! It didn't dry out or irritate my skin as it was drying and left me with a glow from within! I'm definitely adding this to my skin care routine!"
"I absolutely love this mask! It's so soothing and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and rejuvenated. The only thing I didn't like was the smell, It's pretty strong. Other than that i would have gave it 5 stars. I have very sensitive skin and it hasn't made me break out yet... I've used it about 3 times now. Not only has it not caused a break out, it's actually helping with my acne all together. Black heads and all! (I revived this product complementary of influenster for testing purposes)."
"This is such a great clay mask to use for day to day use. I use it mostly for spot treatment and it clears up my pimples by the next day! The feel of it is great and a refreshing smell. Overall, a great product. I recieved this product free for testing"
"I absolutely love this mask! It is so easy to apply and have a great texture. I could really feel how smooth my skin was afterwards, plus it has a great scent. I received this product free for this review but I would still buy it again. It is such a great price for such a high quality product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way this mask applied to my face as it wasn't too runny but also wasn't so thick that it was hard to spread evenly. I left it on for the recommended time and then washed off with a wet face cloth. It left my face feeling super clean and hydrated which I love, I can't wait to use it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this mask is everything it sets out to be and more! The smell isn't overwhelming but quite refreshing, and it does actually keep your skin smooth. It's Clay, so it's a bit heavier than normal but nothing too suffocating. I was pleased with the end result, and I would buy other products from this line! I received this product free for testing purposes on Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in a vox box through Influenster and I'm so happy I did. It smells like lemon poppyseed muffins and works like my Purlisse blue lotus seed mask. My skin had never felt softer after a mask. I see immediate results after using. #influenster #voxbox #pureclaymyway #courtesy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Was o excited to recieve this mask in the pure clay vox box form influenster. I have very oily acne prone skin with large pore , so I am a huge fan of clay masks. I loved how my skin felt after removing this mask, it completly cleared out my pores and improved some of my blemishes. It was very comfortable to wear and make me skin feel so soft and smooth. I will definitly be purchasing!"

"I got this for free from Influenster and I have loved using it! My only complaint is that just for my routine, it's hard to put it on after a shower and wash it off - it doesn't wash off very easily. However, my face has felt great and glowed afterwards so I'm happy with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for my honest feedback. Besides for a basic moisturizer and face wash, I don't usually do facials. I was pleasantly surprised to find this clay mask went on so smooth, washed off so easily and felt so soft. The smell wasn't too strong for me either. I look forward to using this once a week as the direction recommended to see if there is any noticeable difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never tried any face products from L'Oreal before this so I didn't know what to expect. From first impression, the packaging and everything was nice so I was diggin it. Opened it up, the smell was nice...smelled very refreshing. Put it on as instructed and left it on for 15 mins. When I washed it off, it left my skin very soft. I'm going to add this product in rotation to my face masks. Got this free for my review from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i received this mask by influenster for testing purposes and at first i was semi hesitant to use it because of the strong scent, but i'm glad i did! i instantly saw a difference in redness with my skin at that time. i use it about twice a week or whenever my face looks red and irritated and it smoothes it out so much. it's not a mess that cracks or makes your skin feel so tight you can't move, it's very flexible and feels nice on my skin. i'd recommend!"
I received this product in an Influenster Voxox and I love it!! I've never had a mask that feels they way this feels. My skin feels smooth and flawless after I use it. I highly recommend this product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm usually not into masks, but this one was amazing! Left my skin feeling super refreshed and vibrant! The clay in it really helps get into pours and leave you feeling smooth and deep-cleaned! I received this free for testing, but I'll definitely be buying my own when I run out, which will be soon since I want to use it 24/7! Totally worth a buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this stuff. I got it for free through influenster and it works so well! My skin looks so smooth and definitely is a lot less shiny than it normally is. The smell is also amazing. My face feels great and I would definitely recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin was so irritated and dry and I just didn't know what to do. This mask completely helped me! My skin felt less irritated and hydrated after my first use!! After using it a few times I really feel like my acne has been reduced immensely. This mask feels so high quality for an amazing price! I received this mask complimentary for my review, but my opinions are my own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask complimentary from Influenster for my consideration. Not that it matters, but the blue metallic color is very fun and makes me more likely to reach for it over other masks! The mask glided on and had a pleasant feagnace. Afterwards, my pores felt tighter and my skin felt cleared out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free to try from Influenster. I have to say I was impressed. Most drug store brands cause me breakouts. This one performed really well and the smell was not bad at all. All in all, good product at a good price [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this for free from influenster. And it couldn't have come to me at a better time! I broke out because I was on vacation for two weeks and didn't have my regular skin care routine with me. It's been three days of using this and I'm already clearing up! The only thing I don't like is the scent- it's too much like cheap men's cologne. Other than that- solid product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask is absolutely amazing. The first time that I used it my face looked clearer immediately. My nose is full of black heads and I was wiping blackheads off my nose as I was taking the mask off. I have never seen my nose without blackheads all over it before. I will definitely be buying more soon l! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a complimentary sample of this product for testing purposes. I love the scent and the exfoliation power of this mask. It makes my skin feel like it's getting a deep clean while the mask is on. However, that's where it ends. The clean feeling seems to go away quickly. I don't think there are many lasting effects from the use of the mask, but it smells good and gives a temporary clean feeling plus has good exfoliation. the color also looks a little bizarre on my skin once dried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask for free for testing purposes. I love that this mask had a fresh scent to it. Even better that it didn't upset my sensitive skin. I have used this mask 2x a week now and I feel like my skin is hitting a reset button after each treatment. I would purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this mask free from Influenster and have used it for a couple weeks now. I really enjoy the refreshing smell and feel of it! It's a gentle exfoliater that left my skin feeling very clean and brought out a lot of the dirt from my pores. I do wish the ingredient list was smaller and didn't include fragrance or alcohol, so this wouldn't be my top choice for a mask. However, I loved everything else about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This mask is it!! I'm so in love with it. It makes your skin softer and smoother than a baby's butt! I love the feel of it. I love that when it dries you can still move your face and talk normally. I also love the fact that it exfoliates when you're taking the mask off. I'm definitely making this my go to! Thank you L'Oreal and Influenster for my free sample!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been a skincare enthusiast for a while now. I love the mask I received, the sweet Yuzu smell was noticeable right away. I was surprised that the mask was actually pretty scrubby and provided a gentle exfoliation! I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like many masks I've tried, I don't notice immediate results after using this product besides the general skin softness that comes along with exfoliating but this was a really good experience. It was gentle enough on my skin while still brightening and exfoliating overall. It is definitely worth the price and I will probably purchase it on my own when I run out of my current jar. I received this product free from Influenster for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask left my face feeling very smooth. It was a little rough in texture but as long as your gentle it's fine. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all. Rinses off easily and left my skin feeling very smooth, clean and matte. I received this for free from influenster for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this item as a free sample through influenster. I've only used a few face masks in the past but this one has definitely got to be my favorite. It goes on smooth, smells wonderful, and makes my face feel so much better afterward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this mask! It has a cool, silky feel to it that makes it easy to apply evenly. The mask feels like it's cleaning but doesn't have any of the tingling/burning sensation that sometimes makes me worried about keeping it on for to long. I wanted to wear it all night and my friend actually did for about 4 hours when we were road tripping! She said her skin has never felt softer! A must have for any case mask lover. #Gotitfree #Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this item complimentary from Influenster. I have only worn this mask once so far, but I love it. It's a great concept, and I love the metallic blue color. It feels like butter when you put it on making it easy to spread. My only complaints are the over powering perfume smell, and that it gets all over your sink. Be prepared to wipe out your sink with a paper towel or something. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried this mask out for the first time tonight and I really enjoyed it. The smell was pleasant, it applied nicely and I loved the fact that it exfoliated my face as I was rinsing it off. My skin felt so clean and smooth. I have fairly sensitive skin and experienced no irritation which was a definite plus! I received this mask from Influenster free for my honest review."
"Wow! L'Oréal you really have stepped up your game with the beauty! I tried this mask not expecting much at all I have used twice my skin is glowing, black heads are removing, my skin is less dry, this mask really gives me a spa treatment at home, I received this complimentary for testing and I will definitely repurchase again!"
"I go to this mask through Influenster to try for free, but I'm so happy I got it! It's unlike any clay mask I've ever used. It really does feel less drying than the others! I've only used it a couple times, but it's left my skin soft each time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This clay mask is amazing for my combo/oily skin! Every time I use this mask my face feels so smooth and clean. My pores look decongested and appear smaller! Which is a huge plus in my book. The clays really seem to detox and balance my skin. I also really like that it's blue because that's my favorite color and it makes skincare a little more fun. I received this product complimentary through Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
ibstarted using this a couple weeks ago and I am OBSESSED. The clay mask leaves my skin feeling exfoliated and clean. The container is a little smaller than I thought it would be but a little bit goes a long way so it's not a big deal at all. It also smells great! Can't wait to keep using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried this mask three times now and so far I'm loving the results. I have sensitive skin and some texture. This mask doesn't irritate me at all and leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I naturally have oily skin and have the occasional acne. This mask is amazing!!! The exfoliating beads were gentle enough not to hurt my skin but strong enough to give it a deep clean. I can honestly say my face felt smoother after the first use and it didn't leave my face feeling dry like some other masks so that was a plus! So glad I received this complimentary mas from influenster to test out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved how it felt on my skin but after I used it I noticed I started breaking out more. I will continue to use it cause it will most likely be amazing just switching to a new product always does that. But I love the way my skin looked after it dried up my dry areas of my face more than they were tho. I still think the product is worth a try. *Got item complimentary from influenster to test [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product for some time, I liked it more and more each time. I think if you have REALLY sensitive skin you may not like this, as it is a really good scrub. But with oily and acne prone skin like me, you really need that good scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this mask a couple weeks ago and am continuing to use it... which I never do with masks. Usually they are drying but this one works really well for my skin! I have normal to dry skin. It smells good and your skin is so soft after using it! I would definitely recommend! plus you get to look like a cute lemon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask really works. I've been looking for products that really give radiance to my skin, and this one does it. It didn't break out my acne prone skin and the exfoliation really improved the overall texture and look of my skin after one use. I was sent this product free to review, but these are my honest opinions and I'll be buying another one when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent this for free by Influenster and holy cow! I love face masks I love trying new ones all the time and this one by far has been my favorite recently! I love the way my skin feels after !

"I got this product to test out from my influenster box and let me say it is amazing! The smell is lemony fresh. It is easy to work, smoothens easily on your skin and the exfoliating particles are not rough to the skin. As soon as you put it on you can feel your skin refreshen and when you take it it off, your skin feels even better. My skin just felt and looked amazing. I would defenitly reccomend it. Thanks influenster and loreal for sending me the product for free to try out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from Influenster to try this product out less than a full week ago. It states it will remove impurities, dirt and pollution and shed rough skin. So far the product has fufilled its promise but I've only used it twice since receiving it. It leaves my face smooth and is a great exfoliate combined with a spin brush. I will probably buy it but I would like to try the other masks out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for testing purposes complimentary of Influenster to test out. This was my second mask from the collection I do enjoy it. It doesn't calm and soothe the skin like it claims [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"First of all, the smell of this mask is amazing. It has a very fresh and clean smell. Exceeded my expectations. I've tried the dark gray clay mask before and I enjoyed the yellow one more. Very gentle. Definitely would purchase this product. This mask actually made my face feel clean and not as if I slapped something on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this mask for about a week now. It smells AMAZING and so fresh. It's exfoliating and feels really good while on my skin. After I rinse it off my skin feels very smooth and clean!

This product was sent to me complimentary in an Influnster box. Overall the mask is pretty good! The scent is fresh and florally and leaves my face feeling soft and has a slight glow. I have fairly sensitive skin and did break out a little the first time I used it but it cleared up quickly and haven't had any issues since [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the texture of this mask! It goes on super smooth, and doesn't take long to set. My skin was soft and I felt like this mask helped address some of the redness I have on my cheeks."

"I received this from Influenster in exchange for a review. I was very excited to try the mask, because I've been breaking out lately! The mask itself is nice and thick. The claims that it will draw out impurities and soothe stressed skin seem to be true. I applied it to my problem areas and have noticed them going down, with repeated use. It's a great, affordable mask. The only downside is the scent. While it's nice, it's super strong!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I love all things beauty related, I LOVE trying new masks and skin care products! So, I was excited to receive this from Influenster to try out. This mask is felt like a high end mask. I do love the way it looks, even though that really has nothing to do with anything :-)"
It was very smooth and my skin felt very clean and smooth afterwards. I will continue to use this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask has a very fresh scent to it which I love. I've been using this every other day in my skin care routine. It leaves you skin very soft, glowy, and refreshed. I asked my boyfriend if he has seen a difference in my skin and he said it looks brighter and clearer! This product has not caused any kind of breakouts in my skin. I would deff recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive mask. I was sent this product free for testing."
"I LOVE this mask. For starters, the color makes it easy to see where you're applying (plus it's fun to look at!). My skin feels very soft and renewed. I struggle with dry skin and this has definitely been helping keep my skin calm. I would definitely buy this again! You get so many uses out of the jar since you only need a little."

I have used this mask several times and I always love it! It has a great smell and applies easy. My face never feels tight or oily afterward. My only complaint is that the yellow color kind of makes a mess. I received this product for free for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this clay mask off and on for a little over a week. The color is a little weird but I like the texture and I use my spin brush to take it off. My skin does feel cleaner after using it but the clean feeling is similar to any other face wash/mask I've used. The smell is also a little odd.

"I got this free to try out from influenster and im so glad i did. Its a 2 in 1, you get a nice face mask and exfolient. My skin felt super fresh afte a week of use (3 x a week) i like glowy skin and this make my skin have a narutal glow. It dose crumble a bit when its drying but thats was not a big problem for me. Like most clay masks it dose feel a little tighting as it drys but not anything uncomfortable [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this mask free from the Influenster brand, and I was excited to see what this mask had to offer. I have never used a mask that was yellow, or used lemon as an ingredient, so I appreciate its individuality. I have used this mask three times and haven't seen any kind of immediate results. I do enjoy using it as a mid week pick me up knowing it's natural ingredients, but I'm waiting to see the change! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this mask it leave my skin super soft,I have noticed a great change in my skin ,I got mines from Influenster complementary and when I'm done with this one wil definitely get another one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free in my voxbox and it is fantastic! It made my skin really soft and I absolutely love that when you go to wash it off it has little beads to exfoliate. Plus it smells fantastic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask is exfoliating and claims to unclog pores. Immediately after using, my skin is definitely smoother and brighter. It smells like lemon and tingles a bit when it's first applied. The directions state to use 3x weekly, but I find that once a week is plenty for my skin, as I already use other exfoliating products. It's a nice treat. I may repurchase if I run out of my other clay masks and manual exfoliants."

"Courtesy of Influenster I was able to try this product out. I really like the texture and the way the mask dries. I like how it cleanses the skin but it doesn't fully get rid of black heads. However, I still really like this product. The only complaint is that it doesn't have a spatula aplicator so it can be a bit messy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the face mask, starting from it's fragrance to the texture and the smooth skin afterwards. I usually do not use too much product due to my acne and sensitive skin, but this product did not do any harm. One of the problem was that when I put it on my dry(as it's suggested) face, I would feel a little burning sensation but it disappears in like 5 secs. I received this product for free testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First time trying this and I absolutely love the way it made my skin feel. My skin felt smooth, clean and soft afterwords and it had a great smell to it; kind of like men cologne? I would recommend using a moisturize after as it left my skin a bit tight. In addition, I would recommend to take off the mask in the shower as it will leave a bit of a mess if done in the sink. Thanks to Influenster, I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I was having a difficult time trying to figure out how to perfectly turn the mask to mousse. The instructions claim to add water to the mask but not how much. However, I seemed to get it to work and put on the mask using my exfoliater and I turned out to love it! It left my skin feeling nice, smooth and refreshed! I received this product complimentary from influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a lot better than I expected, it's nice and thick so it's easy to apply and it smells so refreshing. The thing that I love most about it is that it is SO easy to wash off after it dries! Sometimes I find that gritty facemasks are hard to get off and your face still has some residue and grit on it after scrubbing it off, this one doesn't do that! It leaves my face bright and super smooth and clean. LOVE. I received this product for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this mask in my complimentary VoxBox. I have a sensitive skin and any mask would give me a little pinky tone. This mask brightened up my skin and opened my pores. I felt very refreshed! Also, I can't no trust mention the beautiful smell L'Oréal products have. Great relaxation on Saturday morning. Would definitely buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Smells old-ladyish, very strong and floral. However I love the feel of this mask - almost like a mousse ! Feels great on my skin. It stung just a little as I was putting it on but that feeling subsided and the mask is very moisturizing. I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really excited to try this mask when I received it free in my very first VoxBox & it did not disappoint! I loved the little exfoliation I got while using this mask & it gave me a great glow afterwards. Only downfall I can think of is that it did make my skin burn slightly, but I also have very sensitive skin so I wasn't too surprised. Overall, it is a great & affordable mask if you're looking for brightness!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask is so great! Not only is this blue mask very cool to look at and put on, but I am obsessed with the smell of it! I usually hate clay products and stay away from them but I really love this. My skin has been looking really nice ever since I starting using this. I received this product free for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face mask is honestly so good, I absolutely loved it! The texture and the fresh scent left my face feeling purified and so soft! I really enjoyed how light it felt on my skin, almost like it wasn't even there. It was really easy to wash off but also made you properly clean your face with the little pebbles in the mask itself. I am so glad to have tested this product from Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free via Influenster and so far I absolutely love it! It glides onto your face very smoothly and feels amazing while on. The next morning my skin already looked more even in tone and felt softer as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love this mask! Whenever my skin is feeling dull, I like to apply this mask and leave it on for about 10 minutes. It has little exfoliating beads in it so when you're removing it, just use circular motions and it leaves your skin feeling soo smooth! My skin does look brighter and more refreshed after using this 2-3 times in one week. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This mask smells great! I got this product for free from Influenster to review and first off the packaging on this product was great. When I opened it it smelled so good, I was also intrigued by the color. Once I placed this on my face I started to feel it and it started to tighten my face. The first night I applied all over my face, then I adjusted my routine and applied just in my t zone . I would definitely purchase this product again with my own money and recommend this to others.

i received this product complimentary from Influenster and im so happy i did. ive used it several times and it couldn't have come at a better time. my skin has really been in the dump lately and i feel that this mask is really helping it come back to life! it smells so fresh and it feels so lightweight and soothing on my face. when drying i can feel it warming a little but it doesn't bug me or irritate my skin. like i mentioned above ive only used it a couple of time but i do think its really helping in clearing up my skin!
"I have never owned a mask that felt this good on. It is so smooth and soft on the skin, it feels amazing. Very comfortable to have on and the results are great too. My skin felt a great deal softer and my pores were visibly smaller. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This mask felt amazing on my skin. I have combination skin and it left my skin feeling and looking like it glowed. I felt cleaned and refreshed after using it. Definitely recommend and would repurchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way this mask feels on my face! It is so rich and creamy and glides on effortlessly with a smoothness almost like gel but still thick and rich. Very interesting texture. It has a calming, cooling, soothing effect and feels wonderful on. I enjoy using this mask for the way it feels when I have it on."

"I love this mask! It has exfoliant particles in it that help remove dead skin. It had a pleasant smell, and it's not too harsh! A lot of exfoliating masks or cleansers make my skin feel dry, but this made my skin smooth and moisturized. I received this product for free for testing and if I had the choice, I'd totally buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought that the mask was relatively good. It had a good level of exfoliation and did not irritate my skin when I put it on. The only fault with this product was it was very time consuming to remove. I may have put on too much, but it was still hard to remove it all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product free for testing from influenster. I applied it with finger tips could not find my flat foundation brush smoothed on evenly the color was fun it does have a strong perfume scent which my mother loved, I was worried that it was going to break me out so far so good. I've put it on twice this week it is a bit drying so you need a good moisturizer. Overall it's a fun mask but didn't see any benefits yet."
"I have loved this face mask! It has a great texture and feel. It didn't make my skin tingle, feel tight, or dry it out! Seriously I think I am going to make this product part of my normal routine. Although the yellow is a weird kind of unappealing color once it's on it does not deter me from using it because the results are so great. I got this product free for testing from Influenster.

I am so impressed with this clay mask. It smooths on and rinses off easily. It does not dry out my skin but leaves a refreshing feeling once it has been rinsed off. I also love the smell of this mask!
"Disclaimer: I received this product for free for testing purposes, I will definitely invest in it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face mask is very interesting. For starters, it smells great. It's texture is a bit rough. So once you've had it on for the amount of time required, you wash your face and the mask turns into a scrub. My skin felt so soft for 2 days after that. For its price, this is a great face mask. I received this product for free in a voxbox from Influenster."
I received this mask as part of an Influenster VoxBox and I was pretty excited to give it a try. The smell is great and there's a good exfoliating texture to it. I've been using it in connection with the clay cleanser for about a week and so far I really enjoy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Tried this for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth my skin felt after. I feel like it helped with the texture of my skin and it helped minimize my pores as well. I will continue to use this once a week and hope to see more improvement! I received this for free for testing purposes and all opinion are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently received this product free for review and I really liked it! It made my skin feel very soft but i wish it made it feel a bit more hydrated. After using it i felt like i needed to apply face moisturizer because my skin felt a little dry. Overall i really liked it and it made my skin feel really soft! would definitely recommend this product to someone who loves having smooth skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this for free from Influenster to review, and I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I like this mask. I've used it twice now, over the course of a about a week and a half. It makes my skin feel clean, refreshed, and soft. The smell is a little more potent than I would have expected, but it doesn't bother me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I would recommend this to anyone experiencing dry, uneven skin on their face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this mask for several reasons. The color is so fun (not your typical green mask!), it smells fantastic bc of the lemon, and the texture is also really different from a traditional mask. It definitely exfoliates super well, and my skin felt so soft after. It also is very cleansing, though I found it a bit harsh on some of my more sensitive areas (I have combination skin). I received this product complementary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the Clarify & Smooth face mask for review by Influencer and I loved this! I felt instant satisfaction. Was very easy to get an even layer, was absolutely relaxing, & my favorite part was massaging the mask into my skin before washing it off. Gave it an extra exfoliating factor. My face feels amazing guys! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and I am in love! I used the mask for the first time last week and my skin instantly felt super clean and refreshed. The product smells amazing and natural, goes on easily and washes off without problems. The only thing I noticed that was compared to other masks I have tried, it didn't totally dry out as I had expected. Paired with the daily cleanser, this product is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is overall pretty good! The scent is fresh and florally and leaves you with a nice afterglow. I would say I was a little disappointed in how I started to brake out after using this product. Other than getting a couple blemishes here and there, my dry skin started to clear up and was smoother than it's ever been! I was sent this L'Oréal product in my VoxBox. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must say I'm very happy with this mask and will definitely be buying the other masks in this collection. It has a great smell, it doesn't feel uncomfortable on your skin and right after I take it off my skin feels so soft and after several uses your skin does clear up. This was a free product to test."
I received this product for free through Influenster for reviewing purposes but all of the following opinions are my own. I enjoy using this mask whenever I feel like my skin needs a detox. This mask smells a little like play-doh but in a soothing way. I like how it also doesn't dry my skin out like many other clay masks do.
"I got this clay mask, along with a clay cleanser, in my Influenster box, and I was so excited to try them out! Ive recently been super into facial care and face masks so my mom and I tried the mask on together. Shes been a longtime fan of loreal paris products and we both fell in love with this one! It smells so good and it didnt irritate my usually sensitive skin! My mom was so excited cause it left her face smooth and refreshed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product after a weekend camping... and I definitely enjoyed my smooth skin afterward! I would definitely use it again and I am excited to continue using it. I like how it's yellow... A different shade than the usual! *I did recieve this product for free as a tester, but with the face wash and this and how affordable it is I will definitely be buying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given this product as a gift to try. this product is nice and thick when you apply it. it goes on smooth and unlike other products it doesn't have that overwhelming burning or tingly feeling. when you wash it off it exfoliates the dead skin off your face. My face feels absolutely cleaned and refreshed! The cherry onto is that it had a delightful scent to it, not over powering at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best clay mask I have come across! The smell is wonderful, reminds me so much of a spa! And it feels wonderful too! I've noticed softer skin (using 3 times a week) and better texture. I would definitely recommend this mask! It is a great option for those of us who can't afford high end products, this is high end but with an affordable price! (Disclaimer: I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm very impressed with this mask!! I received it from Influenster and L'Oréal to review and i was not expecting to work this well. It did actually brighten and clarify my skin!! My skin was much less red, pores looked smaller, and had an overall radiance after the mask. DEFINITELY using again and recommending to friends!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Fresh clean scent. The texture is grainy but applies smoothly. After rinsing it off my skin felt clean and refreshed and the texture looked clearer due to the grainy exfoliate beads. Gentle enough to use daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I got this clay mask, along with a clay cleanser, in my Influenster box, and i'm SO glad they sent it to me! Firstly, it smells absolutely amazing and really reminds me of a salon. I was nervous to try this because my skin gets irritated by harsh exfoliators, but this was so so gentle and made my skin look so smooth, matte, and beautiful. I absolutely love this and you can't beat the price! Doesn't make your face feel super tight either, which I liked. I would purchase this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I got the mask a few weeks ago & tried it enough to say that is one of the best masks I ever used.The formula is in the right scale not too thick not too watery . It contains small exfoliating little things that feel like Little Rocks but they clean your skin so good and leaves it feeling soo smooth . I will repurchase this product and try the whole line !

"Normally, I stay away from clay masks. I feel like they always leave my skin feeling irritated, red, and overall just yucky- so when I received this from influenster to test out, I was nervous. I LOVE THIS MASK. It smells so good, for starters. Applying it is super easy and it goes on your skin smoothly. My skin felt softer after one use, and overall just feels fresher.

This mask is easy to apply and once you rinse it off your skin feels so smooth. The mask does have a strong scent that may bother some but to me it smells so good and I don't mind it. I usually apply it 3 times a week like I would usually use any other mask and if you want to see a big difference I would recommend using with after pure-clay cleanser !

"I absolutely love this face mask. After the first use, I already noticed a difference for my skin. I have pretty sensitive skin but this didn't break me out or irritate it at all. The mask made my skin feel very smooth and clean and also appear brighter. The only negative I have is that it is a bit messy and the skin feels a little dry after use. But that is expected and it is nothing horrible. I received this product free for testing from Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

After this was sent from influenster for me to try I was skeptical. It had a rough texture unlike any other mask. It said it exfoliates so I was hoping it would do the job. Boy was I happy. The smell of lemon is so unique that I've not used a mask much like it before. It left my skin so smooth and brightened after several uses! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been loving this mask so far! It's light enough to be gentle on your face but strong enough to power through dead skin and pores. It leaves me face SO smooth and clean feeling.

"I received this mask complentarty through Influenster. It was so pretty to look at!!! When I put it on my skin, it felt really nice and it dried well.

Ok I got this L'Oreal Mask as a complimentary from influenster and I have to say that I really liked it. I have fair skin so my skin is sometimes dry or oily.

"I found this product really cleansing and smoothing. I liked that it wasn't too cakey and heavy. It had little beads that really cleansed deep in my skin. After taking it off, my skin felt so much smoother. It did leave a slight burning sensation, but I have really sensitive skin. So for normal skin, it should be fine.

"I received this mask for review from Influenster. I was assuming it would be a bit more hydrating than it was, but I definitely can't complain. I have dry skin this didn't dry out my skin but definitely didn't hydrate like some sheet masks. This was definitely very cleansing, and felt super gentle on my skin. My skin showed no irritation after taking it off, and my skin is pretty sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I on the other hand thought it was not drying at all ! And he was right. My face did feel smoother after using this product as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask is so soothing and calming on my skin while still making it feel very clean. I think we tend to underestimate the power of soothing products on our skin but it really makes a difference. The packaging is also beautiful and you get quite a bit of product.

"ve this product! My skin felt so fresh and reguvinated after I exfoliated with this mask. The texture was a little rough, but I could tell that it was digging deep into my pores.

So opening this had me a little skeptical it looked like mustard lol. Dove right in and applied it to clean dry skin I wish the opening of the jar was a little wider but I made it work. The product smelled very slightly of lemon which I liked. Came off very easy unlike other clay masks I've tried. Left my skin feeling tight which I like and didn't dry out my skin. I received this product for free for testing purposes
"I received this mask in my Influenster Voxbox and am so far so pleased with how it works with my skin. I have acne prone skin and many masks burn or are uncomfortable.

The clarify and smooth skin mask was very easy to use and left my skin feeling extremely smooth after one use.

"I got this for free to test and review. First I washed my face, then applied to dry skin and waited about 10 min. The mask smells really nice and has an almost silky texture.

"So I am a really big fan of scrubs and this is what it reminded me of but a mask. When you apply it, it exfoliates your skin at the same time with the beads in it. The smell is so amazing. I'm so glad it did because you leave it in for 15 min but it was very hard to remove but I can over see that and continue to use and buy this product. I received this product free for testing purposes. And Im so happy they did! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm normally quite skeptical of masks because it's found it hard to see a difference but, let me tell you this mask has completely changed my mind. Since using this I have been able to truly see a difference. After the first use, the next morning my skin looked healthier and less noticeable blemishes. I really like everything about this product. It goes on smoothly and the texture is great. The scent is nice as well. I received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received this mask in my Influenster Vox Box for FREE, and I absolutely love this product so far! I have combo skin type (normal-oily) and I sometimes deal with texture on my nose so I was all for this exfoliating mask. It feels tingly when first applied which I like because that, to me, means it's working, I want to try the entire line, it's amazing how much they cater to all skin types! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was super excited to try this! As I applied it to my face it felt nice and cool. I followed the directions and left the mask on for 15 min!

"This product was send to free from influenster to test! I was surprise with this mask it did leave my skin smoother, but my skin is very sensitive and broke out in a red rash. And the beads were actually not harsh at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for testing from Loreal and was pleasantly surprised. Typically purifying masks have a bad smell and this mask smelled fresh and clean. I especially enjoy the exfoliating beads that are part of the mask, so when you wash it off you also exfoliate your skin, which feels great! My skin feels clean and soft after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this face mask. I was skeptical due to its color and claim of comfort. I expected it to be rough and harden making it difficult to move my face but I was wrong. It does have a strong smell--not bad, just strong. The face mask washes off easily and left my face feeling smooth."

"I received this product free for testing and immediately fell in love! After two uses, my complexion looks brighter and I have seen a decrease in the number of blemishes. My skin looks so much healthier. I tend to have extremely sensitive skin and so far have had no problems using this product! I highly recommend giving it a try! It's not very weird expensive and a little bit of product goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this mask! The the mask feels great and exfoliating on the skin and does not give off a strong smell like others do. I was a little worried about the lemon because my skin is so sensitive but there was no problem at all! After I washed the mask off my skin felt clean and soft. I will defiantly be buying more when I run out. Influencer sent me a full size jar for free testing. It is an awesome mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a little apprehensive to try this out because other clay masks have given me a slight burning feeling when applied or left me with red irritated skin......this product however is the best clay mask I've ever used, it had it a slight tingly sensation that felt refreshing instead of irritating, after exfoliating my skin has never felt so smooth and soft. Definitely a product i would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free for testing purposes. I like the packaging, it is very cute and looks ""natural"". I was expecting something more earthy but this had a strong scent. Too perfumed for me and it was all I could smell for awhile. The texture didn't seem to blend very well and seem to slip off my face. Even though the smell was a bit much for me it did not irritate my sensitive skin as many products do and left my skin bright afterward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this free product for a review. I really love this face mask. I have oily skin and wow my face feels fresh after rinsing it off. It comes off easy and is applied onto dry skin. I would but this product again and is worth the try. #PureClayMyWay #Complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask is a nice little spa in a bottle. It smells very nice and has a rough texture. Instructions say to massage your skin with the mask before rinsing for exfoliation. I loved that! I feel like this mask does double duty! My skin felt very smooth and clean afterwards.
I recieved the mask for free from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I absolutely love this mask! Makes my skin feel so fresh and clean!! Also it left my skin extremely glowing afterwards. Defiantly feels like a high end mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this mask. It dries down so nicely and has an exfoliater in it when you rinse it off. My skin was GLOWING afterwards. The only downfall to me is that their wasn't much product in the container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Compared to other masks this is priced perfectly and I feel below average! I have used other clay masks but my skin felt more refreshed after just the first use. I received this product free for testing purposes but I would definitely purchase in the future and recommend to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product was applied after using the clay cleanser. I was surprised when the mask didnt harden, but the results are good. It smells great and is surprisingly moisturizing to my skin. Also, I really like the exfolliating beads, its very gentle and I can tell a difference even after one use. I received this product complimentary of Influenster in return for my unbias honest opinion. If you like clay masks without the tough scrubbing then this mask is a good option.

"Great for reducing pores and texture on the skin, I suffer from very oily skin and this left my skin feeling fresh and clean without stripping my skin. This is a great mask and is gentle enough for even sensitive skin! Amazing mask definitely reccomend along with the cleanser. They are a dynamic duo for oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This clay had a great texture that rubbed into my skin nicely and dried nice and firm. The scent of the clay was also lovely. After washing the clay my skin was left feeling smooth and my pores felt tight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so skeptical because I feel like drugstore brand masks never do very much for my skin. I was pleasantly surprised and saw results with this in one use! Prior to using the mask, my pores were clogged and my skin felt very oily. After using it, my skin felt clean and my pores clear. I loved that while you rinse the mask off of your skin, the product exfoliates the dead skin away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit worried about the clay mask stripping moisture off of my dry skin, but it was so smoothing and clarifying, and left my face actually feeling very moisturized. Been using this 3 times a week so far, and so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this the other day and I love it! The lemon scent is super refreshing without being overbearing. It left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I got this product for free in my Influenster voxbox, but will definitely purchase when it runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a clay mask with small exfoliate particles in it. It's not over drying and it removes blackheads and whiteheads very effectively. The only little criticism from me is that the smell is a bit overpowering. The price is very reasonable and I get the same result from those of other high-end masks. Would recommend if you are not sensitive to fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This products was sent to me for review and testing purposes and it's been amazing the smell is just wonderful it smells like lemons I love the fact it is a clay mask but also an exfoliater . It doesn't leave your skin dry at all it's a must have skin care product !
"I am not new to the LOREAL clay mask line, i have tried every one but the Yellow & Green mask. I personally love this one is is so comfortable compared to the ones i have tried.After using this mask my skin looked very clear and so soft as well. the only down fall to these masks is I wish they had more product in them. i would recommend to anyone and would re-buy . I did get this product free thanks to influenster for testing purpose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed the product but I'm not a fan of the scent, not to the point where I won't use it, just enough to make me complain . My pores felt really clean though! The scent is not a bad chemical smell, I think it's just preferance . I used this mask as I took a bath and gave myself a little spa day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very pleased with this product! I was concerned that the product may be to harsh for my skin, but it wasn't! I followed the instructions and once I washed it off my skin felt so soft!

"Applied the Pure-Clay Mask on the outer section on my face. Applied with a brush. This helps especially if you wear makeup and sometimes are left with more of a rough surface after you have removed it. After, I proceeded to wash off with some fresh cold water and exfoliated while removing it. Would definitely recommend! I did receive it as a complimentary gift from Influenster's for testing purposes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the mask. I got it as a complimentary gift and definitely will go out to buy some more when I'm done using it. It did a great job of reviving my skin and resurfacing it. The smell is pleasant and the colors of the different clay masks are super fun. I would say the only thing that needs to be improved on is the box packaging. I had a hard time getting the jar out of the box initially. Other than that, great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just came back from the skincare mecca of South Korea and I've tried many masks. I wouldn't necessarily say this is a holy grail best product but I did enjoy using it. You should follow up with a moisturizer as always after a clay mask as it could be drying. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this clay mask through Influenster and was a little worried at first. My skin gets super dried out usually from similar masks, but this one rejuvenated it. It smells amazing, doesn't hurt or irritate my skin, and made my skin glow after the first time I used it. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the smell this face mask. It went on smooth and I was easy to wipe off. It took longer than expected to harden but that's okay. Maybe I put too much on but it was well worth it.

This products had a wonderful consistency. It was easy to put on and easy to take off. It felt cool and tingly but not so much so that it was uncomfortable. I would highly recommend this mask. I received this product free as a test. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this mask paired with the cleanser and I enjoyed it a lot. The color isn't the prettiest but it smells great. Not too scented but enough to know your face will smell good. I enjoyed how when it was time to take it off, I was able to exfoliate my face deeper. It's not too hard to get off which is great. My only complaint is that the directions aren't very specific about how much to use on your face. I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried out a few charcoal masks and some of them actually make my face feel worse instead of better, but this one doesn't. I like the way it feels on my skin. And I like that you only have to leave it on for ten minutes. That being said, I haven't noticed a huge difference in the look or feel of my skin after using this other than it helps get my skin cleaner. I did receive this complimentary for review from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This mask made my face look brighter and diminished redness after one use. I love the gentle exfoliation this mask provides, and it smells pretty good too. Overall, I would repurchase this mask. I did receive this product for free in order to test it."

I received this product complimentary free from influenster to test the product and review and honestly I love it!!!!

I will for sure be buying this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I treated this mask as any normal mask that I would use. So I was super surprised when I felt the grains that were in this mask that normally I would find in an exfoliating product. I went about using it like a normal face mask and afterwards I was pleasantly not surprised. My skin which would normally feel tight from being stripped of oils was really moisturized and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask is heaven on earth!!! I've been searching for the perfect mask and I think I've finally found it! I used the clay cleaner prior to applying the mask and the combination made my skin feel so clean and smooth.

I received this free from Influenster and I am so glad I received it. I love the exfoliating beads in the mask and I especially like the fresh sensation it leaves your skin. After only 3 uses I already see smoother skin and I have been skipping my normal pore filling primer under makeup. Great mask truly.

Mask is wonderful and feels my face feeling clean and refreshed. Love this and will buy again!
"I have a dry t zone and this mask helped immensly. I noticed a difference after just one use. It went on easily and did not dry stiff or uncomfortably. To remove the mask, you rub in a circular motion. The tiny particles helped exfoliate but it wasn't too harsh. Would definitely purchase."

I overall enjoyed my experience with this product. The only negative comment is it was tough to wipe away gently. I don't want to rub hard with a cloth every time I put this on my face. However it did leave my skin smooth . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I didn't know what to expect with this, mostly because I felt like I was putting spicy dijon mustard on my face, BUT, this stuff is awesome. I have oily skin, and this doesn't over-dry my skin. My skin was so incredibly soft after using this, and the pores around my nose actually looked smaller after washing this off. I'll definitely be repurchasing this after I empty the one I currently have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The lemon one smells so good and feels tingly and refreshing on the skin I think because of the citrus. After rinsing my face I felt super clean and not oily.

LOVE LOVE LOVE the L'Oreal Paris Pure Clay Mask Clarify & Smooth! I only just began using this product (1 week ago for 3x a week) but am already obsessed. The mask is gentle yet refreshing and when you wash it off 10 minutes later it really does make your skin feel clear and smooth. Highly recommended.

"I used this product for the first time yesterday and all I can say is I'm obsessed! It smells amazing, feels amazing, and really shows overall improvement on my skin. Just after using it ONE time I woke up this morning feeling refreshed and my skin was the softest it has felt in a long time. I can't wait to use it again. I did receive this products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes!"
"I received this mask free for testing and I'm so happy that I was able to try it out! It felt great on my face (I have very sensitive skin, so this is always a worry for me) and it gave me a nice summer time glow when I rinsed it off! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This mask left my face feeling clean and smooth. The clay was so smooth and felt so nice on my skin.
"Immediately I noticed my skin is much cleaner than my normal routine, and my skin wasnt super dried out."
I recieved this product compimentary of influenster for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First off it smells great. Great consistency. I put it on with a silicone brush and it applied so amazingly. It's slightly tingly but I like that. Leads me to think it's doing it job. It's now the day after I used it and my skin still looks a feels very nice. If you enjoy masks and affordable products this is a must have. Thank you to Influenster for sending me this for free to test out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had been wanting to try these masks for a very long time and I'm not sure why I wait so long having now tried it!! The smell and texture are wonderful. And my skin is so silky smooth after the exfoliating! I received this product free for testing and I can't wait to pick up the others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask was great! My favorite part was the scrub/exfoliation when you remove the mask. My skin felt so clean and fresh afterwards. I received this free product as part of a promotion to test it and cannot wait to re-purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this item for free through Influenster and am so glad I did! When I use face masks it's usually the kind that peel off (which is painful) so this was a welcome change. I was surprised at how smooth the consistency was and how much a small amount covered. It felt light on my face and smelled great. Taking it off was a breeze with a washcloth and water and I could genuinely see the reduced redness in my face and felt like my pores had been cleared out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this item for free for testing purposes and I am already in love. The mask has a wonderful smell and a nice texture that's perfect for exfoliating. One thing I notice with some masks is how drying they can be but not this one. After one use my skin is so soft and feels like it's going and healthy. As someone who struggles with dry skin this product was amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as part of a free VoxBox campaign with Influenster and have loved testing it out! It glides on smoothly and smells amazing! Though i look a little crazy while having it on, it really does my skin good! My skin feels clean, clarified, and smooth. Wonderful mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So i got this as a complimentary from influenster and tried it! When I put it on my face gots a little tingling sensation but it was tolerable and when i washed it off my skin looks and feels great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Truly love this mask! Received it for free for testing purposes through Influenster and i am definitely a fan. My skin doesn't feel dry and tight when it is rinsed off. My skin still feels hydrated. What I really love is the exfoliating beads in it! I don't mind the scent of it but it is a little tiny bit stronger than I would prefer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster complementary for testing purposes. I'm so impressed with how this made my skin feel! It left me GLOWING. So smooth and I can't keep my hands off of my face because I feel so refreshed. Just the consistency of the product I was amazed applying it. So creamy and thick very easy to apply and such a cool feeling on my skin. LOVE THIS [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this mask complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. I personally love their face masks!

"I am always eager to try new masks so when I received this one I couldn't be happier! I was drawn to it instantly by the color. It smells amazing and the texture is nice (grainy, but for exfoliation). It applied smoothly and didn't make my face feel tight at all! Once I washed it off my face instantly felt smoother. I received this complimentary for testing purposes. I would purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"received this product just a half hour ago and had to try it as soon as possible, i was so excited!! and for good reason too, unlike other masks, this one went on smoothly and left my face feeling refreshed and moisturized.the texture provided the perfect exfoliant. i was sent this to test for free and am so happy with it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received his item free for testing through vox box and I could not be happier. My skin suffers a lot of blemishes and clogged pores and this made my skin look so flawless. Cleared my pores (which is hard for a product to do), balanced my skin tone, and left my face feeling soft and moisturized! I'm so happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my first time trying out this mask so first off I love the smell of the product because it doesn't smell like harsh chemicals. I noticed when putting on the mask is that it takes more time to dry if you put to much on. After applying and then removing the mask my skin was a lot more brighter,smoother, and my pores looked smaller. I enjoyed this mask and the after smell of it."

"I received this for free from influenster this week and I'm in absolute heaven! My face is so soft, and I've dry skin my entire life! But also I have problems with redness- and this has helped evenly tone and calm my skin! This mask is a game changer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product for free in my voxbox in return for an honest review and so far I love it! It smells amazing and feels great on my skin. Haven't used it long enough to see a difference quite yet but my skin is always so soft when I rinse it off! The only thing is you need a lot of product to spread it on your face as it's pretty thin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This worked awesome, I love the smell and the tingling sensation. Also I love how it exfoliated at the end while rinsing it off. Two thumbs up. I received it free through influenster, thank you for introducing me to this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this mask was very cooling at first, i was very surprised. for a clay mask it was not very drying which i liked. my only problem with the mask was the fact that the exfoliation irritated my skin a bit, but it's manageable with my favorite moisturizer. my skin feels very smooth and it helped unclog my pores. i would recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a gift today and I used it immediately! It left my skin so soft and clean feeling. I have very sensitive skin and it made it so nice! The mask goes on really easily and washes off really easily as well! I will definitely be using this twice a week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this complimentary product from Influenster, and I must say I love this product. I love the results after the first use! My skin felt soft and rejuvenated. The texture feels nice on my skin and left my skin soft. I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a testing trial from influenster. I'm always skeptical about clay masks because I find they just leave my skin very dry. I left this mask on my face for about 20 minutes and it didn't make my skin feel stiff and hard! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I would have never thought to spend money on this, so I am SO SO SO happy I received it free with my Influenster VoxBox and had the chance to try it out. It is a weird color, yes, but it is AMAZING! I have combination skin and this not only exfoliates, but also doesn't get all tight and is easy to wash off. Really did make my face feel cleaner, softer, and better after just one use. Plus, you get a lot in a jar and a little goes a long way. 10/10 will continue to buy and use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how smooth and soft this mask is when you put it on. It glides on the skin and when it dries down it doesn't feel too tight on the skin. This is a thicker mask because of the clay but it comes off nicely after 15 minutes on the skin. I would recommend this highly! I did receive this product free to try from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask was fun to use and smelled great! After my first use my skin felt soft but not overly hydrated as I was expecting. It didn't give the immediate results that I wanted, but I still enjoyed it. Will continue to use in the future. This was sent to me from Influenster for free for reviewing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary from Influenster but had my eye on this and the cleanser for a while now. I am so happy I got to try this!

"I love using masks, this one was no exception. The application was smooth and creamy and the product was easy to remove from the container. The layer I put on took longer to dry than specified, but once dry, it did not feel too tight, as many clay masks do. It washed off nicely and left my face feeling brighter and smoother."

"I was very happy to receive this product because I love a good mask, especially ones that exfoliate my skin. I really liked this product, as it made my skin very smooth, but it did leave redness on my cheeks and nose. I will definitely use up the rest of the tub, but I am not sure that I would buy it again just because there are other masks that do the same for me, but don't give me redness.

I received this product for free to review by Influenster. I hoped it would work well but it was just average. I didn't notice any significant difference from any other drugstore product. The mask had a nice scent to it. I used this for several weeks and I have yet to see a huge difference. My face started breaking out slightly as well. It left my akin smooth but so does any other mask. If you're looking for something affordable this might be worth trying. Maybe you'll have more impressive results!
"Received a sample of this mask. I really liked that it contained lemon for brightening and was clay which is good for oily skin.

"This mask left my skin feeling great. I feel like it's a great mask. However... it has an incredibly strong fragrance. Like a men's cologne from the 80s/90s. If you get migraines or are sensitive to fragrance, don't use it. Otherwise, it's great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
