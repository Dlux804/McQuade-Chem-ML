Great product! I have been buying it for years!
"This product is not cheap, but it's worth it. This is a small size, so a person can use it for a trial or for travel."
"I've been using this product for about 10 years now. It is truly fragrance free, moisturizes well, is not oily, etc. I have no sun spots, discoloration, etc., so I believe the UV protectant works well as well."
I have been using this product for 8 years. The best moisturizer i have ever tried.
"this soaks into skin relatively quickly and I do see results in wrinkles diminishing gradually. It's my first time ever purchasing and using and I am impressed! Now I have a complete Olay skin care system, my eye gel and my skin cream and my toner"
"This is one skincare product that I must have in my medicine cabinet at all times. I have pale skin, so the SPF is a must. I even put a little dab on the tops of my hands in the morning. I use this as my ""day cream"" but have used it as a night cream in the past as well. You can smell the SPF in this product which doesn't bother me, but I know that might be an issue for some people. It has a thicker consistency than Olay's standard moisturizers and it is also thicker than ProX Anti-Aging Age Repair Lotion with Sunscreen."
"I purchased the Olay product because it was a rollback item and a reasonable price. I am not sure about an anti-aging description, however, liked that this moisturizer has a pump feature so I do not contaminate cream in a jar using my fingers. I will purchase again, as long as it is on sale."
Product did not not have any tamper proof around box nor item itself. For a product that is use on the face should have something in place so the customer know its safe to use.
Good but not enough. My skin still a bit dry afterward.
"I love the line... However, I tried this for the first time last night and this morning-- my cheeks did not react to this product. I am going back to exchange for another product , perhaps the one including the serum -- to see if it feels better on face. I am not allergic to many products, but perhaps it works on others. First time using Anti Aging products...."
"I have used this product everyday for 15 years. It has been a great product; moisturizing without oily, doesn't make me breakout and just overall effective. However the new formula is too thin and watery. And the price went up. Really bad move, now I have to find a new moisturizer that is more like the old formula. Why why do companies change great products??? If you have to raise the price we understand, inflation is inflation. But don't cheapen the product. So sad."
"If you are looking for a good cream that is fragrance-free, has an spf and keeps your skin soft, all at a great price, look no further. This is a great cream for everyday use. Thick and luxurious - the thick consistency makes it a little slow to absorb but that makes the skin softer and the added SPF is a bonus. Fragrance free on the face is a MUST, and you can't beat the value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is extremely well worth what it speaks it can achieve for someone. All of the Olay products are simply fabulous. I have been using them all for many years, and not one has disappointed! They just keep getting better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
An excellent product in terms of quality and value for money. Achieves what most branded products cant. Its part of my daily routine and is a two in one . A great moisturizer with SPF too. Goes on very smoothly . Moisturizes well in all seasons. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have severe allergies and have used this product for 2 years with great results. No allergic reaction or redness. My skin is supple and moist. I usually don't have to use any make-up when I go out. My skin looks dewy and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for years and I love it so much! It is the only thing I buy for my face that is on the expensive side but it is worth what I pay for it. It goes on smooth, is non-greasy but very moisturizing. I use it every morning after washing my face. It has plenty of moisture for my super dry skin on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am lucky to have good skin probably due to my Italian heritage. I do use a daily moisturizer and have for nearly half a century. Total Effects moisturizes without leaving my skin greasy feeling. It acts as a good base for my mineral powder. I love that it has sun screen in it since I live in Arizona and walk outside everyday. I am sensitive to fragrance and this has none. Best of all, if I choose to color my hair, I look 15 years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 60 years old. At least once a week, someone stops me and tells me what beautiful skin I have. I owe it all to Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF15. I have no wrinkles or blemishes. What more can I say? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have been using this product since it came out many years ago. Use it on my neck every day and alternate it with the new micro-sculpting cream with sunscreen 30 on my face occasionally. This is a winner. My neck is so smooth for my age. Another keeper. Nothing compares. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels wonderful and I could see the effects after using it for a few weeks. The skin around my jawline and neck felt and looked firmer. The sunscreen is a plus, so I feel confident my skin is protected throughout the day. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using Olay when I was 28 and I have continued until now. I'm 78 now. The Olay product line has served me very well through all these years. My skin thanks me every day when I put it on and I think it makes me look younger and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I most appreciate that it is fragrance free. With it being light weight it's a good base before applying other make up. Of course the anti-aging and SPF are also wonderful. This is a staple and I do not go on any trip without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"been using it every day for a few years now and it does make a big difference, people don't believe my age when i tell them.not only the look of the skin but the feel of it is amazing, please donot ever stop making this product, thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Over 30+ years of trying different lines of Olay products, I always come back to the Total Effects product. Having SPF in the product is a huge benefit. Too busy in the morning getting kids ready, so being able to put on moisturizer already with sunscreen is just great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually use all the Olay moisturizers (with SPF). I do not start my day without Olay especially since I walk my dogs in the am without makeup protection. I have my husband convinced to use it too and he is in his 70's. My skin doctor says I have great skin and is amazed since I live in Florida. When people ask me how I do it......I just say OLAY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Oil of Olay for more than 20 years, I loved how there products follow us with age.Im 44 and always get told I look a lot younger. Total effects is just right for me at this age in my life and I enjoy putting in on twice a day because I know and trust that it does what it says it does. How else can you explain being told you look so young when you are 44 with 3 children. I have already started my daughters on Olay, it's a must I tell them . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is an excellent moisturizer which includes SPF 15 for my fair and freckly typical redhead's skin. In addition, it has the anti-aging formula because I am not getting any younger! I need all 3 of those things for my skin now & will probably need more of the anti-aging products pronto! Thanks Olay for your care in producing good quality facial products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this as my daily moisturizer for years..since it's inception. It's light, but very hydrating. It absorbs into skin without leaving a residue. My makeup stys in place as there is no grease or film to interrupt the integrity of foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the Total Effects Moisturizer! It doesn't leave my face with an oily film or an overpowering fragrance like many others do. Just a soft dewy look. And the SPF 15 is just an added bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for many years for daytime. It must be working, because I have little or no sun damage and my skin is smooth. When I go to a dermatologist, she invariably comments ""your skin is amazing. You must never go out in the sun."" ""Not so at all,"" I reply...""it must be the olay moisturizer with SPF."" I also the product with SPF 50 on hand and use it when on vacation and /or expect to be in the sun more than normally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for more than 6 years and have noticed a significant difference in the integrity of my skin as well as diminished wrinkles. It is nonirritating and replenishes the vitality of your skin. AWESOME PRODUCT!! I would never use anything else as I have tried other products and non produced the same fantastic results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very sensitive skin and the fragrance free SPF 15 is great it absorbs right in and you can feel the smoothness all day.The SPF 15 works well because when you just go out for a drive you don't think about sunscreen and you always have it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I retired 6 years ago and can no longer afford to buy some of the higher-priced beauty products in department stores, I started using Olay and am thrilled with the results from using Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 15. I have many less wrinkles that friends who are my age, and I attribute it to Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Wouldn't be without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been an Olay user for more years than I can to count!! I've always had noticeably wonderful result and this moisturizer is a prime example. I use it daily - especially when going outdoors. I appreciate the SPF15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a great product. I know it works because i was just told by someone that they thought I was 27 years old and I am 35! (And I'll be 36 next month!) I know that's only 8 (well, almost 9) years but i was looking about 40 until shortly after i started using this product... Olay, you definitely got it right with this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a very long time, and i am always told that i don't look my age of 48. It is easy to apply, never leaves my skin feeling greasy or oily and i already have an oily complexion. And i am always looking for extra Skin protection so the 15SPF is a great protection against indoor lights as much as outdoor. I will continue to use until it is time to upgrade due to my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with 15 Fragrance Free. After using Total Effects Foaming Cleanser, I apply the Moisturizer while my skin is still damp. It makes my skin feel silky and supple. The bonus is the SPF 15 that is fragrance free and keeps my skin protected from the sun's rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product both in the morning and at night. It is not greasy to the touch or on my face. It keeps my face moisturized and helps with wrinkles now that I am over sixty-five. The SPF inclusion is definitely an added plus as I am an outdoors person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My favorite part is I don't have to put on sunscreen as it is already there & .it makes my face feel silky all day I cant wait to try the cc cream after watching dr oz show the beauty experts recommended a cc cream for my skin type cant wait to get it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for over a year now, and I always get compliments on how my skin looks great, even when I have no make-up on whatsoever. I turned 50 last year, and it is awesome to have such young looking skin. I had always struggled with finding the right balance with moisturizers that left my ""t-zone"" too oily, while my cheeks were too dry. This product does it all, and provides sun protection as well. I love it !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is a good basic one. I usually wear a tinted moisturizer, so this is a cream I prefer to wear under makeup (if I'm wearing that) or when I'm going to be getting dirty or just staying at home all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I saw the commercial and wondered, ""Will it really do what it says?"" I decided to give it a try. Total Effects really delivers on its promises. I've noticed no increase in wrinkling/signs of aging and it helps keep my skin clear. I have combination skin and this product helps keep it balanced. Of course, the SPF is essential for me. I will always use Total Effects moisturizer. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer for 5 years or more. I have a great granddaughter and everyone we see always says ""I can't believe your her great grandmother!"" ""You look too young!"" I LOVE IT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This priduct makes my skin feel so soft and look so healthy being a woman in my 60 's and using oil of lay for 40 some years people have always told me how young i look and dont look my age and i owe it all to oil of olay and i always recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After switching from the heavier cream I used during the winter, it's wonderful to have the lighter weight of the anti-aging moisturizer. The added benefit of the SPF and being fragrance free are essential to me. It still covers well and my skin feels nice and dewy when I put it on in the morning. I also like the pump feature very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer since it first came out. I use it every morning under my makeup. It protects my skin from the sun and I love the moisturizer. It makes my skin so soft. I have tried other under makeup moisturizers but they don't deliver the way Olay does. Since the products that I have tried have worked so well, I am going on to try more of your products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this moisturizer when this line first came out. This moisturizer is the best I have ever used by far. It beats out any high priced daytime moisturizer that I have tried. It is long lasting, I saw improvements in my skin withing the first 2 weeks of using it and you certainly get your money's worth. I would not use any thing else [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I needed a moisturizer that was not only helpful for dry skin but had a built in sunscreen. I did not want to have to use several products to obtain my skin care needs. I can use the Olay with SPF 15 and moisturizer to cover my needs. It is lightweight and non greasy, overall a great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that total effects anti aging moisturizer with SPF 15 fragrance free is non oily I my skin, absorbs well, feels lightweight, smooth end my skin and does not cause my sensitive skin to break out. It does make my skin fe soft and silly and hydrated while it protects against the suns rays and protects against aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product on a daily basis. I love it because it doesn't feel heavy. It helps my skin from drying out in the sun. I'm out side a lot because of my job. It has a clean feeling. That's refreshing to my face. Would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this everyday soon as I get out of the shower and it keeps my skin from feeling dry and it seems to keep it moisturized all day long and with the spf it also protects me from the sun. I also use the 30spf if I'm going to be out in the sun for a long period of time. I've tried other products but always switch back to Total Effects it is the best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizer. It is truly fragrance free which is important to me. The 'weight' is perfectly balanced: it's never too heavy or thick yet not so light that I feel I need to apply more. I do use it morning and night and it must work- I'm 56 and people are always shocked to hear my age! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love my total effects it not only moisturizes without being greasy but is also a great base for make up. And I've noticed that it really helps even skin tone and helps with fine lines. I use this everyday as part of my morning routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like total effects because it has a clean feeling. I don't have a lot of time in the morning so I like a moisturizer that protects me from aging but also a sun screen protection also. I think its great to protect both in the same product saving time and money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"THIS IS MY FAVORITE OLAY PRODUCT. IT IS LIGHT AND JUST PERFECT FOR THE SUMMER MONTHS. IT GIVES ME A FEELING OF CONFIDENCE THAT I AM DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR MY AGE(57) AND FOR SUN PROTECTION IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY, ABSORBS QUICKLY AND NO HEAVY FEEL ON MY FACE. I CAN'T IMAGINE MY DAY WITHOUT OLAY!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It makes my face look younger and refreshed. It has a great scent and applies nice and smooth. It has a nice glow to it without being greasy. Overall i love this product. I use this everyday and i see more results with every week i use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After 6 weeks of use I was already seeing a difference in my skin. This was perfect for my age as I am approaching 40 & my skin is starting to wrinkle & spot. I saw my skin glowing more lustrous & the spots were dimension [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using Total Effects products for years now, I love the way my face is smooth and the smell is very refreshing, everyone asks what do you use of moisturizer daily and I say Tota Effects by Olay it's the Best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product gives you the result that women want. When trying a new product you have to use it faithfully and when I use this product you really do get the Total Effects. Give it a chance it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Once Olay started providing fragrance free products I have been able to enjoy using the products more. I have been using this moisturizer for more years than I can remember and love everything about it. It is light on the skin and not greasy. The SPF protects my skin against those random unplanned outings in the sun. My skin has been good to me because Olay has been good to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I apply Olay anti aging moisturizer in the morning before riding my bike 12-15 miles in full sun and I have not gotten a sunburn. My facial skin looks pretty good for 60 years old and I thank Olay for 45 years of lotions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is lightweight and easily absorbed. I do not feel like I have a heavy glaze on my face when I use it. I do not have to wait an hour before it is completely absorbed so that I can put on my makeup unlike other products I have tried. It is not irritating when used near my eyes like many other products. I tried a different product recently and noticed immediately that it was not as effective even though it cost more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am on a fixed income and really can't afford this expencive product, so when my birthday, mothers day or Xmas comes along this is what I ask for.I am only sorry I discovered it so late in life.

I HAVE TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT ANTI AGING MOISTURIZER'S . I DECIDED TO GIVE OLAY A TRY. IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS AND ALREADY MY SKIN FEELS GREAT. SOFT BUT NOT GREASY AND THE LINES ARE ALOT LESS NOTICEABLE . I'M 55 AND I'M KIND OF EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A FEW MORE WEEKS. THUMBS UP- OLAY [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Total Effecs by Olayt! This moisturizer is perfect for year round use with it's light texture and non greasey feel. With the SPF rating, I don't need an additional product to complicate my mornng routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was definitely skeptical about the 7 in 1 promise. Although I use Olay products regularly I wasn't sure about this one. How can one cream do 7 things? I don't know if all 7 effects were reached but I liked the way it made my skin feel. Soft and smooth, not greasy. I trusty Olay because they have been around forever and their products usually work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 63 years old and have been using Olay since my 20s. The new total effects is not only light and blends in with no greasy residue but much younger teachers I work with have been shocked to find out my age. They all think I am in my early 50s. Olay.....you rock and I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was disappointed with this product for two reasons - I don't feel like it made any difference to the look of my face and the spf feature is more form over function, words over substance. An spf of 15 is pretty close to an spf of nothing - it's not enough to be particularly helpful as far as I'm concerned. Perhaps there is no magic product, but I think I'll keep looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many of these types of moisturizers, but this is the only product that clearly reduces my aging spots. Special bonus with the sunscreen so I don't get more of them. I also use it on the tops of my hands and guess what...no age spots there either and great sunscreen too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay products are the only ones that I will use on my face (and body)! This one is especially a stand-out because it does contain SPF15 and it is fragrance free, definitely a bonus! I know the best when I use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Many years of using this fabulous product and other Olay products have given me wonderful skin. I actually had someone tell me one time that they didn't recognize me, that I looked great, then ask me if I had had work done. I didn't care for that comment but I said ""No, it must be my Olay regiment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love all Olay products. This moisturizer with the SPF 15 is awesome and does a great job keeping my face and neck smooth as well as protecting my skin from the sun. The best part is that it's fragrance free. I'm allergic to a lot of scents so this is important to me. Thank you for having fragrance free products that work! I also use Olay body lotion with shea butter - excellent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product gives the feeling of silky skin and minimizes the appearance of fine lines that I want to avoid at 44. Highly recommend it and cannot live without it in my daily routine! I would rather have this than any foundation!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As an Olay user for over 40 years, I have found this to be the best overall moisterizer for both day and night use. It's non-greasy, leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and bright. When I first tried it, I only put it on half of my face. I was planning on waiting a week to see the difference, but after only three days, I had to use it all over. the difference was that noticable!! ( I even had family from out of twon ask if I used Botox!) It is that incredible! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Total Effects with SPF for over 8 years. I'm 38 and have 3 kids (14, 5 and 3) and am an attorney -- life is busy and stressful. But I still get mistaken as being 5-10 years younger. I tell anyone that asks that I've been using Oil of Olay products since I was 16 and they've kept my skin looking youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this moisturizer. It's imperative that I use an SPF as I have sun damage and want to prevent more from occurring. I also feel as though this product has helped with minimize some of the damage that has been caused with too much sun exposure. It is a great value for the money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have used this moisturizer for about two years. It is hard to find a good moisturizer with S P F built in and Olay has done a very good job .my skin is brighter and thin lines are less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used to use expensive Estee Lauder products, but when I retired, I could no longer afford to buy them. I started using this product a couple of years ago and love it. I especially like the fact that it has SPF15 in it as I'm fair skinned and need to use a sun block all year. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer for several years now and love the results. Earlier on, I tried a couple of other moisturizers to save money but came right back to Olay without finishing the other products because my skin got so dry and dull. Colorado weather is hard on the skin but Olay has really helped me minimize the dry skin and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this moisturizer for many years. Apply right after my morning shower. Non greasy and love that it is SPF and fragrance free. Absorbs nicely and can apply my foundation afterwards with no problems. I recommend this product to all who ask what I use. I love it so much I have never strayed from using it. It has been and I am sure will always be my daytime moisturizer. I truly love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is so smooth and creamy that I love the feel of my skin on my face. My face feels and looks so much young than I am and I have compliments all the time. I love this product and will use it forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product offers great sunscreen protection. I wish it didn't leave my skin looking so white after applying. It doesn't soak in very well. I like the way my skin feels better with the Regenerist regenerating serum, but it doesn't have sunscreen protection. So, I use the serum in the winter months and the Total Effects in the summer.

I have been using this moisturizer for about two years. I love using this and I have seen a major difference in my skin. It is a perfect moisturizer to use before applying make up and it gives you a very dewy look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have very sensitive skin and this product is awesome. It doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. In fact I can't even tell I have it on! I haven't had any blemish, rash problems, or new wrinkles, and I've been using it for almost a year. The sunscreen is an added plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Total effects is every bit as good as the department store moisturizer I had used for years and it is half the price. I use it twice a day and It absolutely exceeds all of my expectations. Thanks for such a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"One of the few products on the market who offer SPF in their moisturizer! This is so important living in Southern California.

"Love this product! We spend the winter in AZ. The weather there is sunny, hot and dry.Can really age and weather your skin.But I found this moisturizer works the best for me. Because it has SPS 15 I don't have to remember to put that on too.Double duty.My guy has even used it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product because it is light and non-greasy. it leaves my skin feeling very nice. Hopefully, it's doing what it's supposed to do as I was recently asked what I use on my face by a woman at least ten years younger than me as she was getting fine lines. I definitely complimented.

My skin bounces back and is so resilient. Why change to anything else? Never again! Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay 7 effects for years..under make-up it is light and non greasy. Night time it does not have to be globbed on. I just turned 60 this year and nobody thinks I am out of my 40's. I have tried other products but I always come back to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using only this moisturizer for the last 6 yrs and nothing else on my face.Helps me go make up free all the time without worrying how my skin looks.I tried other moisturizers to see if they live up to the hype and nothing comes even close.Planning to move to regenerist soon as i approach my 40th birthday although i do not want to give up my total effects!!!!!!

"This product gives you overall moisture it's a must for me every morning, I feel protected with the sunscreen it contains.

I will continue to use it because I trust it will continue to do the fabulous job it has done all these years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the light feel of this moisturizing protection for my skin. I want to protect my skin from damage but cannot stand heavy sunscreens. This dual purpose product is successful at both the UV protection and the moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works on my combination/sensitive skin. It doesn't leave an oily residue or a thick layer that feels like it coats your face. It blends well, looks natural, and does the trick. The SPF is light, so I will occasionally add sunscreen under it as needed. Olay is so healthy for the skin, and really works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I prefer this Okay product over others. I love that it is fragrance free. I have tried other products that smell like you dousing your face with a bottle of perfume. The anti-aging ingredients cover all the areas I want in a product to keep the wrinkles at bay. I'll be 55 in a couple of weeks. I still get compliments on how pretty my skin is! Thanks Olay, couldn't have done it without you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my absolutely favorite light-weight, sun blocking moisturizer. I have always protected my skin from the sun and I love the way this moisturizer works on my face. It protects it and it feels great. Goes well under makeup or just plain while I work in the garden. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am fifty-one years old and I look like I am in my thirties. Where ever I go people are amazed at how young I look. I do not have noticeable wrinkles, unles you have a microscope could you see minor fine lines. People's mouths drop to learn of my age and usually respond by saying I would never have guessed that! I have used your product since my twenties and would never switch to another product. Thank you for my beautiful complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the feel of this moisturizer once you applied it. it has no greasy feel.i use sensitive skin. its hard to find, but I will travel for it. it fits into my budget and lasts a long time. love it and it helps protects me from the sun. thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product every single day. I love how it makes my skin feel and knowing that I have a sunscreen of 15 on is very comforting. I think that all Oil of Olay products are reasonably priced and I will never use anything else. I also love the sunscreen face moisturizer with 30 spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using total effects for over ten years, and I must say this moisturizer is amazing. I could not use anything else on my skin; because you would see the difference. My skin glows, my face is smooth and soft and it reduces age marks. I just love this product and I would not use any other moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for the past 15 years. It has really helped keep my skin looking younger than my years. People are amazed when they learn my real age! I love the fragrance free moisturizer -- it doesn't interfere with my choice of parfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am addicted now to Total Effects After spending so much on high end products that promise lovely results, I found OLAY! The results are fabulous! Always being complimented on my smooth, beautiful skin! I am 75years young. Now my daughter loves this as well!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this during the day and also at night. The spf 15 helps keeps with prevention of dryness and sun damage while working out in the yard. It's not messy and penetrates evenly into your skin and retains the softness of the skin throughout the day and helps prevent dryness during the night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like to use this coz it doesn't clog my pores. Love the smell and it keeps my skin smooth all day. Plus the spf 15 helped, as I am in the valley in which temp reaches to triple digits during summer. Wish they have higher spf than 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for several years before I found the fragrance-free version. I have always looked for sun protection and the anti-aging works great! People always think I'm ten years younger than I actually am, which is a great compliment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using Olay for ~ 30 years now...their products never disappoint. They are always clean-feeling on my skin, and the results are comments you will like to hear. I had a young man tell me just yesterday that I couldn't be more than 50. HAHA - I am 67! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product faithfully every single day and my skin has never looked more radiant. Even though it's ""fragrance free"" it has a very light pleasant smell and make your skin blend and look so smooth and healthy. It also has the added SPF so when you aren't anticipating being outside and you step out for lunch you are still covered with protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am now more than 18 months user of Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 15 Fragrance Free. Using this everyday makes me feel younger and protected under the heat of the sun. Love love love this product much...Try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I put Total Effects on my face and neck at night and look so refreshed in the morning. I've been using Total Effects for at least 10 years and would probably look my age if I didn't. Total Effects is more like Special Effects. Totally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I spend a lot of time outdoors as we live in the country & it keeps me outdoors. Most products say they are ""natural"" but contain fragrance which irritates my skin. Olay is perfect for me as it does not irritate my skin. I wish there was a higher SPF, but am very happy otherwise. I would love to try the Regenerist line if it were more affordable for people on fixed incomes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Goes on very smoothly and is non greasy. I use it for the SPF as well as a moisturizer. I also like this product because it is fragrance free. It does not conflict with any other products I use on my face such as makeup. I would recommend this product to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very light on the skin and does not irritate my skin. I have very sensitive skin and find this feels good and doesn't bother my skin at all. I have difficulty finding products for sensitive skin and this is one of my staples [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using these products about a month ago. I use the cleanser as well as the moisturizer. I do see a difference in my skin since using them. I have less wrinkles, even though I am not young any more. There is a noticeable difference on my face and neck. I also like the idea of having sunscreen incorporated into the moisturizer. I live in a sunny climate and need sunscreen all the time. I also have fair skin so it is important. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love using Total Effects Anti Aging Moisturizer with SPF 15 Fragrance Free. It has some spf just wish it were a little better like spf 30.

"I have been using Oil of Oil products since I was 18 years old I am now 61. My skin has stayed young and wrinkle free I have progressed over the years as Olay has added and improved their products. Total Affects is the best. Continually moisturizes my skin, has a built in Spf and is fragrance free. Would not think of leaving my house without cleansing and then moisturizing with Total effects. Love how my sin and face look and feel. Sixty is the new Forty with Total Effects! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have use this moisturizer for many years and really like it that's the reason I haven't tried anything different. Have recommended it to serval individuals. As we get older I know we should use different moisturizer but I hate to change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At 60+ years old, I've used Olay in many formulas over decades. This Anti Aging is wonderful for my skin - smoothing out little wrinkles and sealing in moisture all day. Olay has worked so well for me that my 23 year old daughter has made it her go to product starting in her late teen years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product and am sure I see results by using it regularly. My Mom has used Olay products since I was a little girl and she looks so young for her age...I can tell this product is one reason why because it's helping me to stay young and healthy looking too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this product during the winter when I need more moisture and then use the regular moisturizer during the summer. Love the combination of them as I get great moisture for my skin and sun screen at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have dry skin, but wanted something thin enough to wear under makeup, this was it. It goes on beautifully, and didn't leave my face feeling tacky, i use it all year around.

I have sensitive skin but have a body that is aging far faster than my mind. I have used this product and seen great results without the breakouts I get with a lot of other moisturizers. I really like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for the last three years and not a day goes by that I do not receive compliments about how great my face looks, no one believes that I'm going to be 49 this year. I know I have inherited great genes but I also know that Olay is also the reason I'm happy with the way I look. Thanks Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer became a staple in my routine when I discovered it last year. I went from having dry skin all winter long to never having dry skin, and my laugh lines and forehead wrinkles became much less noticeable. I also like that is has spf 15, which is enough for me to wear by itself in the winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Keep your skin moisturized and youthful looking with Olay Regenerist. Not only does it protect your skin from sun rays, but it also moisturizes and makes skin look and feel more youthful. It firms your skin and makes lines virtually disappear. Look years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay moisturizer for over 40 years I started with Olay Complete and one use Olay total effects would never use a thing else. I also use the foam cleanser and tinted moisturizer and eye cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The SPF 15 is very light and effective. When available, I tend to purchase the SPF 30 version due to a family history of skin cancer. Unfortunately the SPF 30 version is not as readily available in store or online. The SPF 30 is a bit thicker and has more of a ""sunscreen"" feel to it. Both are great moisturizers.

"Love this product. I've tried many different moisturizers over the years, I have combination skin and sometime still break out even though I am 50. This gives me the moisturizer that I need without feeling greasy and helps both my dry patches and oily ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this product several years ago and was very satisfied. Through the years I sampled other moisturizers but always came back to Total Effects. It begins to produce positive changes in my skin almost immediately. I notice that I get many compliments on the appearance of my skin when I am using this product. I just purchased a few months supply because I really am convinced this is the product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my favorite daytime facial moisturizer. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth, the sunscreen is a bonus! My facialist asked what kind of sunscreen I used and when I told her Olay's Total Effects, she approved. I highly recommend it. It works great for my 50+ skin.

"I have been using this product for more than two years and I love the way it leaves my skin feeling fresh, moisturized and protected from sunburn and weather damage.

"After I started using this product, I noticed a major difference in my skin. At 92, you wouldn't think it was possible, but when I had my last facial, the clinician said that I had the skin of a 70 year old. Makes my skin feel softer, firmer and less wrinkled.

"I am a 45-year-old mom of 5 kids. I have sensitive, fair skin. I have used Total Effects fragrance-free SPF 15 for more than 8 years. This product is THE reason people mistake me for a 35-year-old woman! ! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pretty good moisturizer for the price and ingredients. I like the fact it has the SPF 15, no oil, and thank goodness no fragrance. Use this as my a.m. moisturizer .This moisturizer works great. Time will tell if it continues to perform as it has now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is amazing product. I live in Florida so the sun and heat can be murder on your skin. This product keeps my face, neck, shoulders and chest moist and soft. I use it after my morning shower before I start my day and if I had a sun field day, I use it after my evening shower. I'm 59 years but my face and skin looks 40ish (as I'm told often). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Within three days of using this fantastic product, my husband noticed my smoother, softer skin. The fine lines aroundmy eyes weren't noticable and, I could feel and see the lines on my forehead begin to soften. I'm hooked on this and have told all of my friends. Love. Love. Love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this product is fragrance free and has spf for the day. I use it along with the non spf version at night and the sensitive skin foaming cleanser, and have seen a great difference in my skin in a short amount of time. This product is great for sensitive skin. It has a faint smell of sunscreen when you first apply it, but it fades quickly. I like that it has no masking fragrance in it. I also love that it has no retinol or other chemicals in it but improves skin tone and clarity. Perfect for sensitive skin!"
"I am always looking for the best anti aging skin care regimen. Well, i went to the store looking for the regenerist system and came across this product. I recently turned 30 and have been worried about looking old too soon. Well, I started using this a week ago and I love it. I have noticed strangers have gone from calling me "" Mam"" to calling me ""Hun""! The only reason i diddnt give it 5 stars is because it is really thick. I am guessing that is because of the SPF in it. I will definately continue using this product!"
"I am 51 But if you look at the skin on my face I know it looks younger. I have been using Olay products since age 16, and when total effects was introduced my skin was at the right time to use. While I know that my genetics help you should see my 88 yo Mom who introduced me to Olay and that I avoid the sun helps your product is why I do not mind the mirror."
"I have used Oil of Olay facial moisturizer for years because it is a light product and really makes my skin feel great! However, since the beginning of summer, after using the product, a curious smell develops. I guess the best way to describe the smell would be to compare it to the smell of diesel exhaust. This could just be a chemical reaction unique to me but I've never had this happen before. I'll feel much better if you tell me the formula has changed. I DO love this Oil of Olay product!"
I receive Total Effects moisturizer for a challenge and I really love it. I ordered the face wash cream but wish I had ordered the foaming but other than that I really want to try to night cream and other items in this line. I would recommend it highly to all. Thank you Olay for letting me try this. I am certainly becoming a loyal Olay user!!!!!!
"I started this Olay Product around the beginning of August and I can tell it has done its job. My face feels very smooth and fresh. The only downfall would be that after applying, if I dont apply makeup over it, it looks like Im sweating or feels wet. Overall a good product, wish it had a higher SPF than 15 though."
"This lotion is exactly identical to the Fragrance Free lotion, but this contains effective UVA & UVB protection which is VITAL for daily living and wrinkle prevention. As with my previous review for the aforementioned product, this is wonderful on the skin - Light, fresh and effective. I prefer this over the Regenerist line of products. More affordable too!"
"I was using the Definity Color Recapture and felt like there was just a little too much color. I have been using the Total Effects Cleanser for a while and love it, so I thought I'd give the moisturizer a try. I just put it on this morning and I really can't believe how my skin looks! I look like I'm glowing and I keep checking myself out in the mirror! I am a stay-at-home mom of 3 boys and I am outside a lot, so I love the SPF! I can't wait to see how my face looks in a month or so!"
"I used the Total Effects plus SPF 15 for the first time today. I washed my face then applied it to my face and neck. I'm going to be 35 in a few months, I have a few wrinkles by my eyes and mouth, I'm hoping this will help with that. So far I like this product, it went one easily, does not feel greasy and my face feels very soft. The real test will be tonight when I go out with the girls and put on my makeup. I hope it doesn't make my face look greasy after I put my makeup on like other moisturizers have in the past."
"I am new to Olay, but have recently purchased this product in hopes of replacing a more expensive moisturizer. In the morning and at night, I apply this after washing my face and using a toner. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but my face feels sticky and looks greasy when I use this. No matter how much or how little I use...Not happy with the product and am going to try something from the Definity line before moving on to a different brand. It also smells heavily of sunscreen which is a little annoying."
"Prior in using total effects spf-15 on 2006, i'm using different brand which i've compared with a very big difference in using olay total effects. The product is extraordinary that makes me more confident, blemishes has been removed, my face is firmer, evenly toned and I look younger as what my family & friends observations, and I totally agree!"
"I recently ran out of me Total Effects, I wanted to see if it truly made a difference (I've been using since I was 23, I'm now 31). After just one month without it, I have noticed that my skin looks very patchy and that around my eyes is noticably darker and definetly has more fine lines that are apparant. Back to the store I go! I love this product!"
"I LOVE this product! i have very oily skin and is sensitive, i also live in a very hot climate. this feels so good on my skin, and is greasy, or oily at all. it also helps the appearence of my skin! my friends all like it too! I will keep using this product!"
"Total Effects is a great moisturizer, especially with SPF 15. You can be sure that you're protected while you're out in the yard or at an outside function. Swimming and boating require more protection of course, but the SPF 15 is great for every day use. The fragrance free products are a must with me because I breakout from anything that isn't. I wouldn't use anything else."
This is the best moisturizer. It is light weight and absorbs very quickly. I am 33 years old and people think I am 26. I have been using this product for about 5 years. I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all. Highly recommend this product.
I love this moisturizer. The texture is nice and makeup goes on well over it. Since I've been using it (over a year now) my skin looks great. It's one of the few moisturizers with sunscreen that doesn't make me break out. My only gripe is that it makes my already oily skin look extra shiny and I have to blot frequently throughout the day.
"I have used this product for as long as it has been out. I can't remember when Total Effects was introduced but I'm glad it stays on the market, it's my favorite. It's light, not too greasy for my oily skin and works great. I used the orginial 'complete' line with SPF 15 from the age of fifteen or sixteen."
Yes
Product doesn't absorb into the skin it leaves nasty white dust all over my face especially near the hairline. Maybe I bought the wrong product or I got an old one. I had high hopes I was doing better with a serum and plane old moisturizer.
Everyone thinks I wear makeup. They ask me what kind of makeup I use. I do not wear makeup. I just do my eyes and lips. I tell them I use Oil Of Olay 7 daily. They say my skin is beautiful. Thank you Oil of Olay for giving me such a great product.
"The product was trial sized, I will never buy it again due to the product being o small. overall all of olay products are wonderful. Didn't know Walmart could sell items that stated trial size, not for resale."
