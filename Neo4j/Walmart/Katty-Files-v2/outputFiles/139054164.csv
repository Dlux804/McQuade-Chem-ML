I have been looking for a mineral based SPF for a while and am so glad I found this one! It goes on smoothly and absorbs beautifully! As with any zinc sunscreen if you apply too much you get the white sheen but applied properly it blends and moisturizes well! I'm very satisfied!
"All sunscreens I have tried leave my face shiny. This one sinks right in, no fragrance, and is just perfect! I love it!! I am the type that researches everything, this product has everything good for your skin in it, no breakouts. Thank you install natural!"
"I been using this moisturizer a lot during summer. Mostly I wore it under makeup and it made my skin look beautiful! never greasy but glowing and healthy. It blends easy and it is a great primer for my every day makeup routine. I will be keep on using it during colder months, coz even in winter we need spf :) I have fair and sensitive skin. and this product didn't leave a white cast on."
