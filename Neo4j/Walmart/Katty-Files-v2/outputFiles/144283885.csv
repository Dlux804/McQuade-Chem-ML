"Loved it! Just as a caveat, it did pill under my cerave moisturizer. Other than that, it's slimy which i like and quite nice. Seemed to give me a glow and seems to heal acne faster and darker spots on face."
I love this moisturizer. I apply a thin layer in the morning and my skin stays moisturized all day. My face looks brighter and healthier as well. A little bit goes a long way.
Absolutely love this cream. I have oily - dry combo skin and I am also prone to having red cheeks. This is the first cream that calms and retains moisture in my skin throughout the entire day. Love the way it sets on my skin and it doesnât sting at all. It also gives a natural glow daily and so many people complimented me today on just day one of using it- 5 STARS!
I have crisco oily skin lol finding a moisturizer is so difficult until now... moisturizer is so dope love it
