"They stopped selling this moisturizer at target so I finally found them online at walmart from ""top rated seller"" for a much cheaper price than amazon! This is the best moisturizer bc it sits so well under makeup or sunblock and acts as a primer. This lotion is more on the moisturizing side so will give you a dewy look it you dont wear makeup over it"
"This moisturizer is perfect for putting on after you do your face cleansers and serums in the morning. It just takes a pea sized amount and after I spread it over my face it soaks up quickly without any left over residue. It doesn't make my face oily on in the day, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Seriously, I would implore you to try out this product. I know you will love it."
"Very thick and moisturizing, I use it both at night and in the morning. My skin type is oily combination."
"I am a product junkie and this cream is the best skincare product. It doubles as a primer too!! It makes my skin feel like butter. I have oily skin and this works well for me. I have noticed a huge improvement since i have used this cream, especially in my neck. This should be a part of every beauty arsenal."
"A wonderful all purpose moisturizer! I use it at night and wake up with a refreshed face. Not too thick or thin, no fragrance. Just right"
"Glides over the skin, and absorbs beautifully. Perfect under makeup."
Non greasy absorbs well into skin a tad overpriced but I like it
