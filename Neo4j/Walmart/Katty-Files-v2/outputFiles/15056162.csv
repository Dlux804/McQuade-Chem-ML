"I use Garnier products frequently. I have used their shampoo and styling products. This was new for me to try their facial mosturizer. I absolutely loved it!! It goes on nice and smooth on my skin, is not greasy or oily feeling and really works to help keep my skin youthful looking. I recommend it to my family and friends."
"I love all the garnier products, except the moisture rescue, its gel and has alcohol in it, so I did not like it. But, this one is great for the skin, good feel and smell under make-up. You just do not get much in the 1.6 like this and most are 1.7 jars. Honestly, I do not think anything is going to work miracles, they just make you feel better for awhile and feels good on the skin!"
I just happened to pick this up while looking for a serum. OMG! This cream-serum mix is beyond great. It's so hydrating and has helped the bags under my eyes and my lines. I have to relate it to this since this is the only new product I added to my skin care routine. I just found out they are discontinuing this. Why? There's so many great reviews on this. Why would they discontinue a phenomenol product like this? I'm so upset. I thought I finally found something that works!
"It's great for the dry Arizona air but you'll sweat to death with it on in humid climates like WI, NC or TX. I know. Tried it. I have to switch my face cream in humid climates to something lighter."
"the price is right ! this is a very good every day night moisturizer...smells good too. a little goes a long way and leaves your skin feeling fresh, uplifted,you will look good under your make up."
"Favorite and Best moisturizer I have ever used. I have extremely sensitive skin and can not use anything with retinol, so that basically rules out most all anti-aging/wrinkle products. This however has no retinol and leaves my skin feeling soft and my skin tone even. Since I began using it, people always compliment my complexion and ask what kind of moisturizer I use. Highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin."
"It took just two weeks for me to see how well this product works. Ultra-Lift Anti-wrinkle firming moisturizer works great. I can see the difference. It has firmed up my bagging under eyes, jawline and neck. All of my face has firmed up. Not a dry drawing firm, but a supple youthful looking firm. I am getting comments on how well I look. I tell everyone what helped me so much. Thanks to Garnier for making a product that works at a price even a person on fixed in come can afford. Thank You Garnier."
I USE THIS PRODUCT DAILY AND I DO FIND IT EFFECTIVE. IT IS NON GREASY AND GOES ON WELL. IT KEEPS MY SKIN LOOKING GOOD ALL DAY. MAKE-UP GOES ON SMOOTHLY WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS NOW AND UNTIL THERE IS A BETTER PRODUCT FOR LIFTING I WILL CONTINUE.
I bought this about a month ago - the Ultra Lift serum has been discontinued and this is taking it's place. I have been using it once a day - my skin is greasy and I am starting to break out. I do not like this new formula - bring the old one back please!!!
"I have used Garnier Ultra Lift for a week and so far I like the product very much! My face is firmer and age spots seem to be vanishing.There is no smell! Ultra Lift goes on smooth and a little covers my entire face.I will continue to use Garnier products. ,"
"I've tried other products from leading skin care lines and never had the results that this product gives. It goes on without being greasy; it feels wonderful on my face and neck; AND it continues to work all day, even in the dry air of my office. No other product has given me the results and the staying power that this has and I'm truly impressed."
"I have been using the moisturizer for years. It is absolutely amazing. When going out for the evening, I always reapply to get an instant firming under my eyes. I normally do not recommend products, but this is the most effective product I've ever used. I also use the under eye roll on before using the mosturizer in the mornings."
"I love this product. I've tried several anti-wrinking firming moisturizers, but Garnier Ultra-Lift is by far my favorite. It has been the best at truly firming my skin without leaving a residue. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth, looking great."
"This product deserves more than 5 stars I would give this product 10! I have continuously been purchasing this product for my mom as a gift every month and it is absolutely amazing! She loves the feel of the cream on her skin, and how it works for even sensitive skin types. Everyone always compliments her on how young she looks and how her skin is so clear! This product is definitely worth it!"
"I have problem skin that tends to break out with most moisturizers, but I've had no issues with this one. I love it! My skin is softer, no break-outs, and I've noticed the lines on my forehead are starting to become less noticeable after 1 month of use."
"Don't use this product unless you have enough money to keep buying new clothes. I have been using this product for 3 days and the shirts I have worn the last 3 days are now ruined. An orange color is all over the neckline of each shirt that will not come off with stain remover. If that orange color rubs off on clothes, what is it doing to my skin?"
"This product was purchased as part of a Garnier products solution to my skin. I have purchased a lot of products, through Walmart, and the line of Garnier seems to be the most effective and most natural way of treating my skin. I use this product sparingly, as much is not need to receive the protection and results of what are my needs. I recommend the full line of Garnier products."
"I have sensitive 55 year old, former sun worshipping skin. A friend recommended this product to me and it has made a wonderful difference in texture, lines, and tone. All with no breakouts! I may look like my 193 year old grandmother, but I no longer LOOK like her!"
"As a moisturizer with SPF, I am satisfied with this product. I generally use it in the mornings and have to wait a few min before applying makeup bc it leaves my skin a bit shiny & greasy. I have not noticed any improvement in the fine lines on my forehead, however."
"I use the Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer daily because I like the lightness of the product and the benefit of the SPF-15 sunscreen. At 51 years of age, the wrinkles are a challenge, especially around my eyes. I also like the control I have with the pump to get exactly the amount of cream I require."
I have been using this product for about a year now. The only thing I have not liked is the fact you don't have any way to tell when you have run out of cream. You use it and the one day the pump doesn't work and you are completely out of cream. If there was any way to fix this it would be great. If not I will probably have to switch to something else.
"It smells nice, but it's a sunscreen don't expect an ultra lift fining effect.... I've used it for over a month, 2 x a day and my skin looks the exact same. It's moisturizing to put on your makeup but if you are looking for REAL Ultra lift firming looks somewhere else. :/"
I used this product for two weeks straight and absolutely love it. I'm 34 and take pretty good care of my skin but I'd been noticing some fine lines appearing. I'm so happy to say that the ganier ultra lift anti wrinkle firming moisturizer took care if them and then some. I will never go without this priduct again. My skin feels and looks so much healthier (I thought it looked good before but I was wrong) This product is great. Definately give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried garnier skin active ultra lift sunscreen and I loved the way it made my skin look and feel. It gave me a young healthy glow. It also works very well as a sunscreen when your outdoors. It has a nice pleasant smell. It doesn't feel greasy on or leave a nasty after feeling on your face. I highly recommend garnier skin active ultra lift sunscreen for anyone wanting a good moisturizer or sunscreen. I will definitely be adding this to my daily beauty routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for three weeks now. I have not seen a change in my lines on forehead or a true difference. However, it is a great moisturizer. I usually put it on in the am and at night. I would recommend if you wanted some great face lotion and maybe fine lines, but not for a big difference with your face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer by Garnier. It goes on smooth, and has a fresh scent. It absorbs quickly into the skin. I feel like the smaller wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, and I've noticed my deeper wrinkles on my forehead are also less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have now used this daily for about two and a half weeks. I don't see a lot of 'lift' but I do like that it leaves my face feeling moisturized but not greasy at all. I also love that it has SPF 15 to protect my skin from further damage. I also liked that there was no scent. I think I will continue to use it and will likely but it again. The only reason I give it a 3 is that it is advertised to lift and tighten your skin but I didn't experience that. Otherwise it is a great moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this stuff, but it can be hard to find at my local store, which doesn't stock consistently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm 25 and I've been using this cream for about a year and a half. It is a good moisturizer and also makes your skin feel firmer!
"I have recently switched my facial skin products to Garnier and I really like this one. It feels good, smells good, and if I am not mistaken my wrinkles are not that deep anymore. Maybe just my imagination, maybe not."
"I've been so happy with this product line, I'm a Cosmetologist and can use any product that is available at a reduced price, however I 'm so pleased with the hair color line on to the skincare excellent results. I differently recommend it!"
"I just love this product, My skin is so soft and looks younger. What I really love is it has no smell like some lotions. It feels great on and I see a difference."
This product has a very strong odor of cheap men's cologne. It's quite obnoxious. I don't understand the earlier comment about it having no smell. Mine certainly was not unscented. It's awful.
"I have tried so many different products so I was expecting the same old same old. Wrong !! This left my skin soft and no greasy , heavy feel that leaves me running to wash my face again."
I have been using this product for 3 weeks with no visible results or change in skin. Very disappointed after reading all of the good reviews of this product.
this product works like a charm or magic But is works and the first time I used it I saw the difference in the skin and more so under the eyes I have a hard time with puffy eyes and they were gone the first use. THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL
"I love this product! My skin is smoother since I have started using it. I like the pump bottle a lot but it is hard to tell when you are running low. Otherwise, it is perfect!!"
"It stinks to still have acne when wrinkles start appearing. This product moisturized my skin, dealt with the fine smile lines, and did not cause any breakouts."
"Generally facial moisturizers that contain sunscreen make me break out, this one doesn't! I'm liking it so far. Haven""t really noticed any firming or lifting but overall a nice face lotion."
Great product with a great price
The price is very good it's much more everywhere else and shipped quick Y
I think this formula is great!! It's a little greasy but soaks in well and it's a great sunblock!! The formula has helped with long days in the sun this summer with the kids and my daughter loves it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to be honest and say it is a good moisturizer. My skin stays hydrated and feels great all day long. I love Garnier products and as always I am pretty pleased with this product. I would definitely recommend to family amd friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had never used a Garnier moisturizer before this, as I usually use a more high priced face lotion but I was pleasantly surprised. The texture is lightweight and not at all greasy. It sinks in quickly and is good for use under makeup. The scent is light and pleasing. I only wish it had more sunscreen- 15 is not nearly enough. All in all, 4 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love, love, love all of garbled products. My skin is brighter and my high school glow is back. This purchase was a gift to my mother and sister!"
"Great moisturizer that meets all my needs: doesn't make my skin feel greasy or irritated and it has a sunscreen (SPF 15). Overall, love the way my skin feels, soft and clean."
I love this moisturizer
waiting for results.
I really enjoyed trying this facial lotion. Its not super thick so it feels light on your face. It has a light scent that is almost like baby powder. I like that it has sunscreen in it. It claims to firm and tighten in 5 days. I didn't feel any difference after using it for 5 days. But I do like this lotion and would use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the consistency of this product, but I felt that each morning when I woke up my face was greasy. I have an oily face naturally so I typically don't use a ton of moisturizer. So I stopped using it at night and began using it as a primer in the morning under my makeup. I LOVED how it helped keep my makeup on, as well as provided sunscreen coverage. I did feel that it made my skin smoother. I did not see any immediate change in my skin other than that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So the product has great ingredients, it's easy to apply it's user friendly doesn't smell not greasy but to be honest have tried it for a while now almost a month but I haven't noticed any difference I haven't notices a improvement it's just there . So I will have to pass on this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like using Garnier SkinActive Daily moisturizer because it feels very light on my face while it's sunscreen at the same time. I have oily skin and adding sunscreen after a moisturizer normally clogs my pores, but this moisturizer is 2 in 1 and leaves my skill nice and plumped. I use it twice a day, in morning and evening since it's also anti wrinkle cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is an amazing addition to my skincare regime because it is lightweight and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I love that it has spf because with my roscea I need to make sure I protect my skin from the sun. The smell of the product is good, not strong, but pleasant to the nose. My skin is starting to look brighter and not dull. I expect my skin to only get better as I get closer to finishing the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a nice moisturizing spf. It's pretty thick but spreads evenly and absorbs well. I can't say I've seen a huge difference in my skin as far as wrinkles go, but overall my skin looks more hydrated. It does have a slightly odd smell, reminds me of bubble solution, but it's not offensive and dissipates quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Given the spf and consistency of the product I figured it would be greasy and horrible under makeup. I was wrong. The consistency makes it feel super moisturizing, but the skin absorbs it almost immediately. My makeup (foundation, concealer and powders) went over it flawlessly. It has replaced much more expensive moisturizers and I didn't notice much of a flashback or white cast despite the spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the moisturizer did it's job -- it moisturized by face -- but I was a bit confused by the package. It had a heavy emphasis on the sunscreen part of it, and I wasn't wild about the fact that it did feel like I was putting on sunscreen just before bed. It did have a bit of a sunscreen texture and smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always suffered from dry skin that requires me to use a daily moisturizer. Almost every product I try causes me to break out, feels to greasy or doesn't moisturize enough. The Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer is different! It is gentle enough to use everyday, is not greasy and provides hydration for my dry skin! I would recommend this to anyone who needs a daily moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I agree that it improves skin elasticity, but it smells too much like a typical sunblock that you wear to the beach (not the ones for your face). Every time I put it on my daughter asked me why I was putting it on. Typically, the moisturizer I use with spf do not have that strong of a smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Hi I have the try this moisturizer and is awesome because is like you dont need too many products because this one is all in one. I really like all the benefits and the most important is non greasy. I have sensitive skin and it really works for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried this for 7 days and while I did not really see any noticeable results, as far as my fine lines go, I have noticed great improvement of my skin texture. It has a nice scent but it does smell like sunscreen and I like the smell of sunscreen. It's non greasy and absorbs quickly. All in all this is a great daily moisturizer with the added protection of sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Garnier SkinActive Ultra-Lift is a great product because it leaves my skin moisturized & protected from the sun rays also it doesn't have a strong smell, I sweat a lot because I'm outside quite a bit and the product stays on without any white residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm still a bit confused about what this actually is. At first I thought it was an anti-wrinkle moisturizer but when I threw out the box and read the directions on the bottle the directions were all about using it as a sunscreen. I mean, my skin feels slightly more moisturizer but not much and there is no way I would use this as a sun screen. It just isn't practical considering the rest of me and my family needs sunscreen too. I'm scratching my head a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"To be honest I didn't love this as much as I wanted to. My face feels slightly more hydrated but other than that this is more of a sun screen for me, which isn't bad. It isn't too thick and it does not leave a film. It also did not make me break out or make my skin oily. So overall I will continue to use it as a sun screen, but will continue my search for a daily mousturizer. I would recomend it just because everyone's skin is different, so it could work for someone else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product. A little goes a long way. It's thick but not too thick so it doesn't feel like it's going to be runny. So far it has hydrated my face and the wrinkles around my eye seem to be disappearing. It's very affordable so I will most definitely be getting more! It's a very low smell which is great also. Can be used Morning and night! I highly recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! I love skincare products this is awesome pleasant smelling, non oily no heavy or film feeling on face. Works great under my makeup which is a must for me! Sensitive skin like me no worries, face feels hydrated and happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Garniers, Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer is more of a sunscreen than everyday moisturizer. It smells like sunscreen and seemed to smell that way for a while. It was thick, but not too thick. It was very gentle around the eye area. Unpleasant when sweating. Would definitely use it for being out in the sun, just not everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would have given 5 stars because it works really well but there was a major con for me. Having to reapply so often was a hassle for a busy mom. That being said I feel like I see results with the anti wrinkle formula and it definitely has protected my precious face from the sun ever day since I've started using it. I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have dry, sensitive skin. This keeps my face feeling hydrated for hours."
I did not like this product- I have fair skin and it turned my face orange-
Deep wrinkle was much better .. you discontinue good products
I thought the deep wrinkle worked much better . Wish they didn't discontinue it!
This product when applied leaves a greasy residue. Also it has a sunscreen smell that lingers.
This moisturizer is great for a smooth fresh look. I use it everyday.
"use this in conjunction with skin renew dark spot and eye firmer...great products and inexpensive compared to the ""big"" brands"
This product helps to prevent skin darkening because of the sun. It's a good sun screen under makeup and lasts all day.
I like the way it feels on your skin.I have tried others and they are too harsh on my skin. Also think my skin looks better since using it.
"This product is awsome i have used for One Week and is great my face is more is more moisture and shine i love ir, i all ready recommendent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love it because Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer also has 15 spf. Make my skin is softer, tightening, and lifting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Ultra Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer Spf 15, it leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft. I tried using the Ultra Lift Deep Wrinkle in the RED bottle, but it left my skin very oily. With the Ultra Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer Spf 15, my skin is perfect and my foundation goes on very smoothly, leaving me with an all over polished finish."
"This ultra lift lotion has a nice, light scent. The packaging makes getting just the right amount easy. I have combination skin, so in the more oily areas of my face I broke out the first night that I applied it. If you have dry skin, I think this is definitely for you. In my drier areas, I like it. I've heard that a woman's age first shows on her neck and chest, and I've been able to use the lotion in those areas. I do think I have seen an improvement in my skin there too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a combination skin oily and dry depends on the weather so for me its very hard to find a moisturizer that works for me and also i started to see some laughing lines ( ) and its just something that i know i have to deal with but, I have been trying the Garnier moisturizer for about 5 day and my face feels very soft and looks hydrated. I would definitely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Garnier SkinActive Ultra-Lift is amazing. It's think and creamy. It makes your skin smooth and silky. It really helps reduce your wrinkles and hydrated your skin. I love it!! It also smells very good. The only thing is that I wish this product was much bigger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Oh my gosh! I absolutely love my new Garnier Skin Active Anti-Wrinkle Firming Daily Moisturizer! I make sure to put it on every single day after exfoliating my skin in a nice warm shower. The results thus far are amazing! I'm noticing more healthier firmer looking skin. This product has definitely made me feel more confident and comfortable in my own skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried many different anti-wrinkle creams only to find I have to discontinue use because it burns the skin around my eyes. This product DOES NOT do that. It is is very moisturizing , however, that does not mean it is greasy. I can use it in the morning and before going to bed. A little goes a long way and the smell is great. A soft scent that is not over-powering. I would absolutely recommend this product to everyone I know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this a good product not greesy and oesn't leave a film. It is very moisterizing and has sunscreen which is a plus. It is affordable and I love how its packaged the only thing I didn't like about it was its strong scent but other than that I would recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer! It is light and non greasy and smells wonderful! It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and fresh! I've been using it for a week and already feel a difference in my face as well as my complexion! Love that it has sunscreen in it as well to protect my skin from the damage the sun can have on it! Highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I would like to see some results before buying this product. I like that it has a light scent and has SPF 15 right in the product. Does get a little greasy on some places on the face. Waiting to see the results as I've only used it 3 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! I am a true convert! I am always skeptical of trying new skin care products, but, this one changed my mind! I noticed a big difference in the first day of using it, and it just keeps amazing me more, as each day goes by! It is so light weight and creamy, with a very pleasant fragrance. Its not heavy on the skin, and makes my face feel soft and gives it a dewy appearance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with this product. Not only does it moisturize, it has SPF too which is so important for me. I also like that it is light weight and doesn't counteract my foundation like my previous moisturizer did. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product! It's amazing! It protects your delicate skin on your face from the sun. It doesnt leave you looking or feeling like a greasy mess. I will definitely be adding this to my daily skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Anti-wrinkle firming daily Moisturizer just made the cut for my skin care Staples. I'm in my 30's and I live in the desert. Garnier Skin Active Ultra- Lift is great. It's a light Moisturizer which is perfect it doesn't leave you a greasy mess. It protects your delicate face from the sun, and it leaves your face looking and feeling healthier. I use it during the day and at night as an eye cream... Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the anti-wrinkle firming daily moisturizer for five days immediately after my showers. I do think it helped minimize fine lines around my mouth and nose. I did not reapply every 2 hours for sunscreen. It did soak in quite quickly. I would not use it as a sunscreen only because I use a higher rated sunscreen if I am going to be outside for a prolonged period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this anti-wrinkle firming moisturizer! As a 30-something who grew up in Florida, I am now trying to undo the damage I did to my skin growing up. Garnier Skin Active Ultra Lift is non-greasy which is great for my sensitive and sometimes acne prone skin. I love the creamy texture and use it everyday! Two thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that it's a sunscreen and moistrizure in one. The smell is clean but it has that faint suncreen smell to it. It's lightweight on the skin and feels good. You only need one pump to cover your entire face. I recommend this. Great for summer time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a good product. It says on the packaging that you can also use as sunscreen. I do believe this product is better as a sunscreen for you face. It does have a little smell to it, but it is not as strong as most sun screens I have used. I plan on going to the state fair next month and i will definitely be taking this with me. It did soak into my skin for the most part. It's not slimy on my either which is great. I will be recommending this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow, Garnier Ultra Firm really does work. I've used it for 7 days and my man noticed the difference. Light and not greasy feeling, fresh scent, and SPF 15. I recommend this to all women. Firmer skin, less sightly wrinkles, give this a try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good product. I have only a few wrinkles that are near my eyes, and they have softened a bit with this product. It's a little too thick for my taste, but I just mix it with another moisturizer. The smell is my problem though. It smell way too much like sunscreen. I have plenty of stuff that has spf 10-20 in it, and contain no odor. All in all, not a bad bang for your buck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In all honesty I think it's a great product! It smells wonderful & it's non greasy! A little goes a long way too! If you're looking to ease the look of fine lines & wrinkles then this product is definitely the one for you! F [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Feels light and is not greasy on my face. Doesn't have much of a scent to it which is good as I can't handle heavy perfumes on my face. I will continue to use this product and purchase more when this bottle is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this moisturizer! It is super light feeling on your face and doesn't feel cakey. It is gentle and leaves a clean feeling. However, I haven't used it long enough to see its wrinkle reducing effects yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It goes on smooth and is lightweight doesn't leave my skin oily in fact it feels hydrated and the smell is amazing. A great product I always worry because my skin tends to feel oily when I use creams but it's so soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garnier SkinActive Ultra-Lift is a great product! Being 30 years old, I need to start thinking about anti-wrinkle and firming products, and this is a great one to start with. This cream is super light, and has an added bonus of 15 spf, which is super important. I really like how it doesn't feel heavy and greasy on my face. I will definitely continue to use this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product! I have considered buying it before, and was so excited when I found out I was chosen for this campaign. Super moisturizing, could tell its gonna work, just after the first use. Highly would recommend to a friend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the Garnier SkinActive Ultra Lift lotion and was pleasantly surprised by the way it felt and easy application. It has a silk like feel to your skin. My skin has some sensitive spots so this product was good and did not irritate my skin at all. The Ganier SkinActive Ultra Lift will now be a staple in my daily beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Nothing negative about this product. I only have 4 stars due to the packaging. You can't tell when it's almost empty so you go to use the pump and you're out with no warning. Need see thru pump bottle or some sort of indicator that it's almost gone.
This is the best lifting lotion and at the same time moisturizes.
"Blocks sun damage, smooths out wrinkles, not greasy, stays on all day without reapplying for softness, a little goes a long way, container colorful and decorative. Works great with makeup, too."

I think its ok. It seems to be a little thick for a everyday moisturizer. Since it is more like a sunscreen. I will use it when I am going to be outdoors or when we go camping. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I purchased what I believe to be an anti-inflammatory firming moisturizer. When reading closer I find it's actually sunscreen. It's called Ultra-Lift Anti Wrinkle Firming Moisturizer. In a green little pump. Now when I look at the website I see the same name in a red bottle. What am I using, a sunscreen or a firming cream?"
"i like it, it makes your skin soft. maybe helps get rid of some small wrinkles, i've went thru a whole bottle and i can't hardly see any difference."
NOT GREASY FEELS GREAT LEAVES MY FACE SO SMOOTH LOOK FORWARD TO SEE THE RESULTS AFTER A MONTH.
Did not do what was anticipated...very poor quality product
