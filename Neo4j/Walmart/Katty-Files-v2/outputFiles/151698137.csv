"I really like this eye cream! It has a medium to thick consistency, pleasant citrusy smell and is very moisturizing on my dry face. A little goes a long way with this product. Will definitely be purchasing again. This is a high quality moisturizer that I only see at spas or dermatologist offices. It's a steal at Walmart with it being less than half the price I see outside!"
"Been using this for years, it is an excellent product recommended by the person who does my facials, geat price."
"Great Hydrating Moisturizer I have always enjoyed the image skin care line. Its better to get all the items in a line and combine them to see max results, but alone this is still a remarkable product than will show favorable results if used daily."
"This moisturizer is smooth, light and smells great! Used it for years. Great price through Walmart Website"
"This cream has a nice sent, absorbs quickly, is not heavy, and leaves my skin texture smooth. This is the best price I have found for this product."
I love Image products. I teach at a college that offers a cosmetology program where the skin instructors use and highly recommend them.
This product is amazing and I saved ordering it through Walmart.com. Win win for me!
"I've been using this for years. Always look forward to putting it on in evening, has a nice scent and very creamy. Good brand."
Love all the products I ordered. I got the Repair cream and eye area moisturizer. My beautician told me I had very soft skin and I am 78 years old.
"I like this cream. Goes on nice and smooth. The only negative is it takes a long time to absorb, overnight plus. Maybe if I applied z little less, my face wouldn't feel a bit greasy on the morning."
Love how it feels on my face and my face fells much softer and smooth!
I have very sensitive skin and this is by far my favorite night cream.
The Image Vitamin C line is the best out there!!!!
I've used this face cream in the past and love the way it smells. It's a good cream.
Extremely hydrating! It smells literally like you are applying vitamins C on your face.
"I love this facial cream. Light yet Hydrating, my skin has never looked better."
I LOVE these products. It's nice to know that I can get them through Walmart at greater savings!
