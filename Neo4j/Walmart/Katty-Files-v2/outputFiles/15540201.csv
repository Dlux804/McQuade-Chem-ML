Softens my skin and never had been allergic from it. Have been an OLAY user for the longest time.
"I REALLY, REALLY LIKE THIS OLAY LOTION. THE FRANGRANCE LASTS, BUT NOT OVER POWERING. THE PRICE IS GREAT! MY SKIN ALREADY FEELS AND LOOKS BETTER SINCE I PURCHASED THIS ABOOUT 2 WKS AGO."
"This is my go to lotion all the time. It is effective and absorbs into the skin swiftly so you are not left with a greasy feeling for any time at all. This particular version, with anti aging benefits is getting harder and harder to find. Thank you Walmart for making this available easily with online ordering!"
Since the day I found this lotion it's the only lotion that I use for my body
I'm prone to dry skin and saw a difference within a week without being greasy
"Love this lotion....use it day and night on arms, elbows, feet, legs...big changes for the better in how my skin looks and feels."
"Smells great, keeps skin soft and glowing. My favorite lotion."
I have very sensitive skin. I'm allergic to everything from soap and detergents to lotion n perfume. I have dry skin and This lotion is awesome. I order it online when it's not in the store.
Love this cream! And good price. Been using this brand for a 5years!
I honestly think this is best body lotion ever. It is not greasy but it does provide moisture and the scent is lovely.
"Thick lotion for maximum moisturizing, and a light pleasant scent that everyone can agree on! My all-time favorite lotion."
"Love this lotion and its light, fresh, scent. When I could no longer find it in local stores I was thrilled to learn I could buy it & save with easy online shopping. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought the body Lotion and body cleanser in one package. I have noticed that my skin doesn't look as old. It looks smoother and makes my skin look firmer. It's the Total Effects product that I would recommend. I have tried other olay products, but I would recommend these because it isn't overwhelming. It leaves your skin soft."
"I was having issues with the skin on my legs looking and feeling cracked and very dry. I tried product after product and nothing worked, I ran across this project and thought...""why not""... I will NEVER use any other type of lotion on my body from this day forward, I saw visible signs of improvement instantly, my legs, arms and etc are smooth and soft, healthy looking and fabulous. Thanks Olay"
"The one thing I need now is a bigger bottle. I went throughout the large pump bottle in about two weeks, because I wanted to put more on my hands every time I passes. Even better when you use the body wash. I've honestly never had my skin feel so moisturized after a shower, even before applying the lotion. The only thing that would make this better is it included a SPF. LOVE IT!"
"I use this twice a day on my legs, feet, arms hands. It's amazing. It has gotten rid of my crepe skin and even keeps my feet soft. I would love to bathe in this scent. Ha, I actually even looked for a body spray. Olay hasn't created that yet, but there is a day face cream with spf and body wash. Okay has made a superior product line that is affordable."
"This lotion has such great weight, feel, smell, to say nothing of the moisturizing effect on skin. I know I am bit reluctant on some Olay wash and lotions for their strong scents, as I hv my own perfumes, but I bought 3 more bottles after using this, afraid I cud not get, its such good product."
"I'm a 61 year old woman, my skin was feeling extra dry after the long winter. I decided the body lotion I was using was no longer doing the job. I decided to try some different body lotions. I have to say my skin felt softer and smoother the next day, after one use of the Olay Total Effects Advanced Anti-Aging Body Lotion. It also has a pleasant smell."
"I like the lotion, the smell is strong but it tones down when it fully absorbs in your skin. I gave one star because a bought a 2 pk and one of the bottles was Busted lotion everywhere. The gas, the time and the inconvenience. That was the whole purpose of ordering on line. Now I have to either go to the store or the post office to get an exchange. Smh."
You can't go wrong with any olay product
"What can you say, it IS Oil of Olay. I love it, wouldn't be without it. The smell is delicious."
"great buy, leaves skin smooth n silky, had to renew my order before the old one was finish"
Love the prices and the fast shipping but MY INBOX WAS OVERLOADED WITH SPAM EMAILS IMMEDIATELY AFTER PLACING AN ORDER AND FOR WEEKS AFTER!!
I have been using this lotion for years. It feels great and smells great and my skin is very healthy.
"This is Great stuff. Absorbs quickly, smells and feels luxurious! Only wish the bottle was bigger. Will definatly buy again."
"THIS IS THE BEST LOTION IVE EVER USED! ITS TRUE TO WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR! WALMART DONE AN EXCEPTIONAL,"
My skin is so smooth and soft. I get compliments about the wonder smell. I see improvement on my entire aging body. I have been using this lotion for two weeks. No more dry legs. Wonderful! Shipment took 1 week. I am 59
Super soft skin and smells great.
Olay is the best. I would not buy anything else.
Very satisfied. Leaves skin mois and smoothe.
"Total Effects makes my skin feel great, I do love it on my neck and arms."
"I have been using Olay products daily for many, many years. I am 78 years old and everyone says I look like I am in my 50's. I give all the credit to God and OLAY PRODUCTS. Please don't ever discontinue your Regenerist line or your Total Effects 7 body lotion. Thanks for such quality products."
"I love the new body lotions that olay has come out with..They are my favorite lotions now.They are olay quench plus firming, total effects anti-aging body lotion..I just really love the fact that now i can fight the signs of aging all over my body,not just my face..Thank You,Olay"
"Good price for a 2 pack, $13.47. Smells good, works well. Quality brand. Lots of ingredients, however."
"Smells wonderful, a little goes a long way, and it makes your skin feel better, smoother immediately! Highly recommend."
Best body lotion ever! It gives skin 24 hour nourishment. It is not greasy or heavy like other lotions.
"It feels good rubbing in my skin, but it's too soon to comment on how effective it is as I haven't seen any changes as yet. So far I like the feel and scent"
This a light non greasy lotion that really helps with dryness when used daily. Smells wonderful. Just wish you could get in store and not have to order it.
I love the smell of this lotion and my skin is so soft.
The lotion and body wash has always been AWESOME for me.
great product just love it and the price is just great
This lotion is very moisturizing and has a nice light scent. Will buy again.
It was great
My favorite.
"I have used many different lotions over the years. I use to go to bath & body works, but skin would become very dry after applying the lotion. This product leaves my skin soft and well nourished. The lotion is not thick and does not just sit on top of the skin. I noticed with other lotions I have to continuously rub the lotion into my skin. This product sinks directly into the pores of your skin."
I love love love this lotion! I have never loved a lotion as much as I love this one. It makes my skin feel soft but not oily like most lotions and it is long lasting. Also I feel it gives my skin a slight glow. The scent is also nice. Its not too strong but it gives you a clean smell. It's really nice. I definitely recommend trying this lotion it isn't overly priced like most so you really don't have much to lose if you don't like it. :)
"I really love this product it makes my hands feel soft. It is not greasy and won't burn my hands. it smells great to. deffinately my new favorite Lotion. All it needs now is a SPF of 40 or higher added to it, because i have light fair skin. really great Product Olay!"
"This Total Effects Body Lotion is the best I have ever bought.It smells great and I love the way it makes my skin feel.I'm on my first bottle,and been using for 10 days so far.I can really tell a big difference in the way my skin feels.I already ordered 2 more bottles because I love it so much,I tried other Olay Quench Lotion and also loved it,but this is my favorite.I hope it never gets discontinued as I will be a loyal customer.Thanks Olay for making such wonderful products."
"I have always had super dry skin, I tried many lotions but after putting them on my skin was still dry. So I tried the body wash and I loved it, I didn't have dry skin after my shower, then I bought the lotion and face wash, and it is the best stuff I have ever used. I will never use another product again, I am 23 and am starting to get forehead creases so I think I will buy the face moisturizer next!!! GET THE TOTAL EFFECTS LINE!"
"Great Product! I purchased the body wash as well! After the first use my skin felt amazing! My Husband hugged me and he even noticed! He asked me ""how did your skin get so soft?"" Very pleased with both the lotion and body wash! I will be buying this every time I run out! Nothing has ever worked this well for me before! Thank you Olay :)"
Wish you carried the body wash to match!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Smells wonderful. Dont feel heavy on my skin and makes my skin smooth and soft.
"I LOVE this product ,It makes my face fell like silk."
This lotion makes your skin so soft and smooth. After the first use I could tell a difference!! Love this stuff!!!!
Been using Oil of Olay on my face since I was a young teenager. First time buying this formula and I'm not disappointed.
"Have used this product for years and am thrilled with the results. It has done wonders for my feet, elbows and neck."
"It makes your skin super soft, long lasting and smells amazing. Very difficult to find in stores though!"
"I thought all my life Olay was the best, but this particular body lotion is terrible!! First of all is feels sort of sticky -- nothing like their pink facial lotion. Plus, it has a weird smell that doesn't get better over time & I can't describe it except it smells ""old"". Maybe one of their other lotions is better, but I'm trying another brand."
"OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS ADVANCED ANTI-AGING BODY LOTION Goes on so smooth. Makes my skin feel so soft. I loved it as soon as I put it on. However, the smell is so strong and it is not a soft smell like the Olay Whips that I love. It is strong and does not go away. If you like strong woodsy smells you will love it. I am sad to say I will not use this lotion. Please make it unscented or maybe an Olay Whips scent. I love Olay products just my opinion on this one."
"I love this body lotion, but can't find it anywhere anymore. I even look for it as I travel across the United States with no luck. I am going to order online but it would be so helpful to be able to buy it locally again. I must have this type of container because the pump dispenser type spills out in my luggage. Help."
"I am a 44 year old female sun worshiper and I love this lotion. It got rid of most of my crepiness and I feel baby soft literally baby soft for like 24 hours. As for as looking younger, I think so because it takes care of the crepiness which does age us alot. It is truly amazing. Nothing I have ever used lasts as long as this does or makes me feel as soft. It is a little perfumey for my taste but it does dissipate. If they could make it smell like coconuts that would be ideal for me."
"I love this lotion so much. I just turned 40 this year and I have been using Olay Total Effects for a while now. I have noticed my skin glowing and it has a healthier appearance. I am also impressed with its ability to take away my fine "" laugh lines"" around my eyes. No lotion has ever done that before. Please do not discontinue this product Olay. I know once the stores run out of these lotions then they are not coming back. Just like the Olay Regenerist thermal mask. I miss it."
"I was more like a wanderer looking for the perfect solution for my skin. This is my one BIG stop. The fragrance is superb, i just love it. The feel of my skin changed from the very 1st use. Thank you OLAY. Never stop making Total Effect Body Lotion for my sake pleaseeee."
This is another excellent product I have been using oil of Olay products for years and always get great complament on how young I look. I am 78 years old no one believes me when I tell them how old I am they think I am in my late 50's or early 60's. Will keep on using this product forever.
"I use this lotion along with the body wash and I love it except for the smell. I have very dry skin and this makes it softer and my skin doesn't itch and burn as bad. I recommend this as a moisturizer. I can't say anything about younger looking skin or anything. I have only been using for a few days. However, the smell makes me sick. I can't leave it on my hands. Need to make a fragrance free!!!"
I no longer have dry spots any where on my body especially my legs and arms (from Florida sun) and my skin does look and feel smooth and no longer blotchy. I put this all over my feet and because it has emollients in it my pedicures last so much longer because the bottom part of my feet are never dry and calloused.
"it smells sooooo good! and it was delivered with a gripper and wrapped with a plastic so it doesn't leak out all over the place. This is off topic, but I remember buying oatmeal from Walmart and by the time it arrived, the cardboard box was crooked and the oatmeal was all over the place. So I was a little worried it would end up the same with this lotion. But now they wrapped it individually and more carefully. Great job, Walmart!"
"Love this lotion, never have I had a body lotion keep my skin soft all day.Usually I have to reapply several times a day. Even with oils i have to reapply. I love your Total Effects 7 all in one! Send me gallons I love it! If you ever need a spokes person I would be thrilled to speak for the amazing effects on my skin. Thank you! BB"
"After a few days of using it, I saw visible changes in the appearance of my skin. It gradually removed the uneven discoloration/texture. I also really LOVE the smell (which is one of the reasons why I bought it). Definitely something I will continue purchasing!!"
"I'm sure this product works really well, but honestly cannot comment on its effectiveness because I was only able to use it once. I am a HUGE fan of Olay products especially the total effects line (I religiously use the facial moisturizer), but the fragrance of this lotion is way too strong and smells AWFUL. Please, please, please make a fragrance free version, or one more similar to the facial moisturizer!"
"The Total Effects lotion works awesome, love the way it makes my skin look and feel smooth. My only issue is with the fragrance. Please oh please can you make the same thing without the heavy perfume....either fragrance free or something that smells as nice and light as your original face lotion would be wonderful :) Sorry have to give 3 stars for the fragrance since I can only use occasionally..."
I love the smell the most. And it feels good on my skin! Get it!
I have used this for years. It lightens dark spots if used often. Very good for problem skin.
"I love this lotion, but but local Walmart never has it in stock. Luckily, it is available online!"
I'm so allergic to this lotion!! Whatever ingredients are in it made my skin feel and look flushed. My chest had a rash on it hours later and I had to wash it off. NOT the lotion for me!
"Best body lotion I've ever used. Barely no scent at all, goes on with a light touch and leaves your skin looking wonderful. I've used this for years please don't ever stop selling it"
Just and Overly priced body cream with a Very Heavy Fragrance. I get better results from Suave Silkening Lotion for half the price. Returning for a Refund ASAP!
I don't know why it's not in stores or Sams club. I have been using for about a week and I love the light fragrance and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moist all day.
"My kids have severe excema, this lotion has done wonders for there skin. I can't stop them from using it. I love the scent and the smooth whipped feeling. Highly recommended this product. I Wish it was in stores."
I just love this product. It is so effective on my skin. I am 69 years young and am always being complimented on having nice skin. Thank you Olay Total Effects!!
I bought this product along with the body wash and both are fantastic. My skin is so soft and silky. Good to know that as I progress in life Olay will be there to assist.
"Good results, good ingredients and value. The one major negative thing about it is the fragrance. It smells very strong...no need for that. It'd be perfect if it was fragrance free."
I love the cream but it smells very very strong. I made the mistake of not ordering the fragrance free one. It gives me a headache. But I do like how it feels on my skin.
This lotion is amazing on aging skin. Literally makes my elbows and knees look years younger. Used it for several years and now I can't find it anywhere. Help Olay! Please don't tell me you have stopped making it!
I love this for my arms and throat especially. The places I used to buy it - in a different bottle - no longer carry it at all. Spent hours in many stores looking. Where is it. please?
"This is a great product, however, I wish it would be easier to use. I would love to have it in a ""In Shower"" lotion for a quicker application. My mornings are busy enough. Also, it would be great to add a sunblock to it for daily use."
I love the way my skin looks and feels with daily use of this lotion. I don't know what people don't like about the scent but I love it. My only issue is that it is impossible to find in stores. Is this product getting discontinued?
"I could not make it through the day with this lotion. Had to take a shower to wash it off due to the horrible smell. PLEASE change the scent, or just remove the scent..."
I'm 63 and been using this for a few years and also trying other stuff. None of them compare with this. It's not oily but still stays on to hydrate my skin without feeling mucky. The others let my legs dry out after a few hours but this one doesn't.
I actually picked this up by accident but tried it anyway it made my skin very soft but the smell is not so good it almost smells like a tanning lotion with some kind of flower fragrance but I don't mind because it works
This is the best lotion I have ever used. I have been using it about a week and can tell a huge difference in the fine lines on my hands and face. I love the smell of it also. I have already used about half the bottle!
Have used for about a month. My skin is so soft and my skin looks more even toned. Does it lightly tan your skin? I like the smell and feel. Absorbs quickly.
I love this product....just wish I could by it in our store. They quit carrying it:(.
I love the scent and the feel on my skin. Time will tell if the claims are true.
Love how my skin radiates!!!
"The only lotion I use ! Tones my skin great , I noticed a change in my legs, improved elasticity !"
Its too good.... i felt so good... it moisturized my skin for a good duration....
This lotion has a nice scent . Effectively moisturizes without being so heavy that it leaves your skin greasy.
"I do get a good moisturizer from it, my skin is nice and firm and smooth. I wish it left my skin feeling a bit softer though"
"This is an excellent moisturizer at a good price. I have sensitive and older fair skin, and I like it a lot."
I'm a guy and would love to use this lotion but it STINKS. Why so strong? Make a scentless and dye free version. Such a disappointment.
Love this lotion. It's a great moisturizer. My skin drinks it up without lots of rubbing in. It leaves my skin smooth and firm. Great value!
"I use this all the time. I have sensitive skin, but it never causes a reaction. It's smells great and absorbs easily. I recommend it!"
This is the only lotion I will use after my shower. Keeps my dry Las Vegas skin soft and moisturized better than any others I've tried!
It is the best. Love the scent!!! It goes on smooth and doesn't feel greasy at all. It is hard to find in stores though.
"I've been using this product for years. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it has a very nice fresh smell."
"I think this lotion would be good for my skin, but I can't get around the over powering smell. So the bottle sits on the counter unused.I use to use the regenerist body lotion and it did not bother my sinus like this one."
Great results.........use after showers and keeps skin smooth and silky....
I love all the Olay products. This lotion smells good and works great on my skin. No SPF though.
Very good product. Non-greasy and purchased at reasonable price from Walmart.
This lotion fill nice on your body smell nice as well.
"I did not like the fragrance; like perfume that I did not like, and it did not fade rapidly."
Good because soft good awsome to use i just love the product lotion
Works wonders it awesome and I would recommend everyone use this lotion.
It Seems Like It Help Because a lot of People buying it.
I have used this product before and I would recommend it to anyone.
Gives your body a silky feeling
My favorite lotion. Moisturizes very dry skin. Lasts all day and smells nice. Not too sweet.
really like how it works with the crepiness of arms and legs. but the frag. is too strong.
Works really great for my wife. Just after halfway through the bottle the improvement was very obvious on her skin with even tone and smoother skin.
I love this lotion
Excellent product
Excellent product.
This is the first time I buy this product but I trust that Olay will deliver.
What more can you ask for.
Did not moisturize my skin enough and this stuff stinks!
Best lotion. Great smell and not greasy
Wish I would have tried it sooner
