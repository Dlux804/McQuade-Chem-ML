I've been using this product for years now and I do think it helps to keep my skin firmer and more youthful! It is getting harder to find on the shelves so I'm glad I found the website!
"I have been using this product for less than a week and I am a bit amazed at how good it has already made my skin look. I know it's supposed to take approximately 4 weeks to work, but after only 4 days, the fine lines on my forehead are barely visible!!! I can also see a difference under my eyes! I was using the Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream with sunscreen SPF 15, which is also great. I had simply run out, saw this product on the shelf, and decided to try it. I am VERY happy with it!"
"I first found this product about 6 months ago in Lucky Magazine as a highly recommended product. Since I am always looking for good skin care at reasonable prices, I tried it. I am 57 years old and this has given my skin such clarity and radiance and FIRMNESS it is amazing. I will never use anything else as a daily moisturizer."
I have used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Firming Cream for a year. I absolutely love it. The fine lines and small wrinkles are gone. The skin around my eyes is much more firm. I have received many compliments about how young my skin looks. I was so disappointed when I couldn't find it in the stores around me anyone. So glad that I can order it online.
This product has done a great job of firming my skin. I am always trying to get a jump on my wrinkles before they decided to get me. I have used this product for about 6 months and was really happy with it. It also did a great job moisturizing. This is probably the best facial cream I have used.
Neutrogena is a firming skin cream and a very good one at that. I think it works as well as higher price skin cream if not better. I don't believe in paying a lot for skin products so this does the trick. It is healthy and I'm all for what it does do. I notice right after I apply to my face. You can't go wrong. It makes your skin feel good too.
"This is the first time I have ever written a review, but this product is so wonderful I had to share. My boyfriend is always commenting on how good it smells, it actually makes my skin feel firmer, and it does not over moisturize. I highly reccomend this product."
I have been using Healthy Skin Firming cream for over 6 months. I see a difference in the texture of my skin. It is more supple and has worked well on
my neck area which was my biggest concern.
"The word FIRMING is deceiving, the ingredients tells it all. RETINOL is the main ingredient for firming, it should be at least the second one on the list. It is a good product for the young who want to start the process of taking care of their face along with sunscreen added."
I was looking for a change from pricey department store cosmetics to a more reasonably priced line of moisturizers/skin care products.. Sadly disappointed; very heavy and would not absorb into my skin. Has a plastic smell to it.Felt heavy and greasy. Needless to say I will not be using this product; waste of money.
I am sensitive to 99% of the products ot there! Keep in mind I have Oily skin! After I tried this out I realized that I didnt get the itchy little bumps and red marks all over my face (allergic reaction) ! This producat does the JOB! Keeps my face hydrated throughout the day and makes my face feel super smooth!!
TIP: when I wear makeup I let the lotion sink into my skin for about 5-10 before applying anything on top of it for better results!
"I like this product a lot. It has sunblock and moisture so it takes care of several problems. It can be a little heavy so best not to use too much. I recommend this product since it's affordable, is great with firming skin and moisture and should last a long time. I am fairskinned and must have sunblock."
For the first week I thought this cream was great...my skin looked younger and felt softer than ever...but then it began to dry my skin...to the point that I have to stop using it...too bad...i really loved it...
"My skin is in good condition, this is not greasy, and it works. I get a lot of compliments on my skin. The price is awesome. I love this product. Neutrogena beats the so called ""best of them"" because it is the best."
This moisurizer is like nothing I have come across before. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. My skin looks and feels firmer. I love that it has SPF 15. Younger looking skin is what I have.
"This product is by far Neutrogena's best! It is well formulated, light weight, and effective. My skin feels fresh and vibrant with 2 weeks of use. Give it a try!"
I was concerned at first because of the shine it left on my face when I first used it but the moisturizer in the product absorbed quickly and my complexion felt so good it also worked great under my primer & make-up.
I have used this cream for many years. My go to product and moisturizer.. used under my make up . Its a win! I can't be without it . Walmart used to make a version of this so much cheaper but they discontinued it so I have to go for the brand name version. be sure to place on your decollete and top of hands too.
It's a staple item Gotta have it
"I use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair night cream and like it. I bought the Firming Cream and unfortunately found that caused acne. As another reviewer mentioned, it seems to accentuate pores. I have oily skin and perhaps this product is not intended for oily skin?"
I am surprised that a reasonably priced product actually works the way the description says it will.
I have sensitive skin and this really dryed my skin out . I was so excited to try it but was really let down ..
Makes skin very soft. All my dry skin bumps disappeared. Skin feels a little firmer which in turn lessens the lines a little.
I have used this for many years. It works real well on my skin.
"Bought it, tried it once and returned it. I can't get pass the smell. Went back to the Healthy Skin Anti Wrinkle cream which is odorless. I do not understand why they don't make these face creams odorless."
"I can't recall exactly when I began using this product-perhaps 5 years ago? I absolutely love it. I'm 56 years old, but people always guess I'm in my early 40's! I have dry skin, and this moisturizer is perfect for everyday wear under my foundation. And having an SPF 15 is always helpful for sun protection."
Thankful to the Neutrogena Corporation for creating such a wonderful product!!
I am 67 yrs. old. People say I do not look it. It is really a great product.
doing great to my face it's really different just after a week
This is he first time I have ever tried it and I really do Love it!
I noticed the ingredients were stronger in this product than in the Rapid Wrinkle Cream.
Very good product! It makes my skin soft and firm.
"Love the brand. Smells great, goes on without a greasy after look!"
"The absolute best product Neutrogena had, was, the Intensified Day Cream!! Keep hoping they bring it back"
"This product is moisturizing, but the firming qualities are lacking. If you are looking for firmed skin, choose another product; It will likely cost much more though."
I have used Neutrogena products for 30+ years. I would say I am very happy with it. The price is much easier on the budget than the drug stores and other retailers.
"A few minutes after smoothing on the cream, my eyes started to water and still were after an hour later. Used the cream to help dry eye lids and didn't get into my eyes, but it must have traveled into my eyes or the perfume got into my eyes. Very irritating. Need a fragrance free formula for sensitive eyes."
"I love this product. It's silky smooth, has good sunblock, but shortly after I purchased it, it began to clog the pump. It's too thick to be in a pump and needs to be in a jar. I won't be buying it anymore simply because I have to us a Q tip to pull out the cream. Too bad. It's a wonderful product."
"Hello, Neutrogena,"
I love your product but also use Lancome for my skin care. I would like to know how to use your product and benefit from my own Lancome. Do I apply your product first or mine? Or can I mix them together? Please advise and thank you. Please respond to my questions at my email address. Thanks !
"I found the product to be very drying to my skin. Did not smooth over my skin very well. Stopped using it and went back to my Neutrogena sensitive skin moisturizer. Was hoping this ""firming cream"" would work :/"
"I've been using this cream for at least the last 5 years and I have a good experience, if it had a SPF higher than 15 it would have been better for the summer season"
"Skin feels great, but, product is so heavily perfumed I can't stand it - will not buy this again unless they make it unscented."
It may tighten and feel good at first but sometimes I feel that it may feel dry. Im gonna finish it and try another neutrogena product
"I like the way this lotion feels on my skin, but it is so heavily perfumed I would not buy again."
