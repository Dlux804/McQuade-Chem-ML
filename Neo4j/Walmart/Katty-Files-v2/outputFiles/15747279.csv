This is the best night moisturizer I've ever used! (I'm in my late 50's and have tried a LOT.) I live in a very dry climate and need a moisturizer that's rich - not greasy. This is it! My skin if softer and smoother since I've begun using this moisturizer.
"I have been using this for a few months now, but noticed a noticeable difference after using it only for a few nights! My complexion looks so much smoother and healthier, showing less wrinkles. I apply it every night after I wash my face. It has definately made an improvement in my complexion"
I first purchased the hydro boost products and started using them while taking an antibiotic for a sinus infection. My skin was so smooth that I thought it must be from the antibiotics....until months later and my skin is still so soft and smooth. I've only used this product for about a week but I can already tell the difference. Whenever people compliment my skin I rave about these products. I've probably got at least 10 people hooked!
"Have been using for a little over a week. My skin is looking smoother and some small acne scars are starting to fade. Haven't noticed a huge difference in fine lines yet but, they are a little bit smoother. Is nice and moisturizing but, I may need a slightly heavier moisturizer being that it's winter and the heater makes me skin so dry. Have been using every night with no irritation. I am use to skincare with other anti aging and active ingredients though."
"After more products than I can mention I decided to try Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer, I am 81 and even my husband said after two days ""what are You doing,your skin looks great!"" that was enough for Me, I use it every night and look super, as my Grand-daughter says. Thank you so much. Marilyn"
I'm 44 years old and I've tried a lot of moisturizers. Including high end products. I dont waste time with worthless products. Im big into products thats perform but don't cost a fortune and this is one of those special finds. Gives noticeable results without irritation and it's affordable.
"After several days I was amazed at what I was seeing, great product."
"I'm proud to say, that even though I'm aging, you wouldn't guess my age..this product is truly brightening my countenance, fading dark spots and the wrinkles are taken care of. This product has absolutely no false advertising.."
This is a very good high retinol lotion that goes on easily and absorbs without looking greasy. I have been using it for a week and my face already feels tighter and looks smoother.
"I purchased the Rapid Wrinkle Repair approximately three weeks ago. In the evening I remove my makeup and apply the Night Moisturizer. I am extremely satisfied with this product, the small line are disappearing and my face feels soft and smooth."
I've only been using about a week but I notice a big hydration increase. Dont think I've been using long enough to notice wrinkle improvement but so far and overall I am pleased and will continue using.
"I purchased the rapid wrinkle night moisturizer a week ago tomorrow, and the results are incredible! My smile/frown lines are almost completely gone when I'm not smilng.... The deep creases between by eyebrows arebarely visable! Seriously worth the cost and a try!"
I have been a satisfied user of this night moisturizer for over 12 months and for me it works.
This is my third bottle NWR - has reduced wrinkle lines 50%. Facial skin is
Silky to touch and well hydrated.
"Not only has this product kept my wrinkles from getting worse, it has actually made them less noticeable -- it really works!"
"This product is good for my skin, and it helps my skin be smooth ever. Moreover, it also make my skin not be allergic at all."
"Ive been using this product for years. Everyone says I look 10 years younger. Feels great and smells good too, Im very picky about all that."
I have used Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer for several years. I love the way my face looks and feels.
"Didn't notice anything except it dried my skin out and I was using it every other day, after a week I quit using it."
"Smooth, non irritatin upon application. Absorbs quickly but in the morning the skin across my cheeks is dry, tight and has fine wrinkles that were not there the night before."
"Don't use many makeup or skin products, but have been using Neutrogena's Healthly Skin and Rapid Wrinkle Repair for years. Believe both products help to hydrate and"
smooth my skin.
I have used Neutrogena products a long time and find them very good.
Only been using for a couple weeks. Love the way it feels. Not dry and tight at all.
"Goes on smoothly, dries quickly, feels light on the skin, no smell. Love this moisturizer!"
So I had been a loyal user for years and for some stupid reason I decided to try another night cream. I broke out like crazy - switched back and in two days my skin is completely clear! My pores are much smaller too! I will never stray again!!
I am very happy with rapid wrinkle repair night moisturizer. It really makes a BIG
"difference. My skin feel soft and looks fresh not dull. I won't be without it,"
"I have been using this product for over a year and fine it to be the best face cream for night time repair of aging skin, moisturizes and softens also keeps lines and wrinkles at bay!"
"Have only been using this about a week, so haven't seen any change, but I like that it so light and refreshing on my skin. Use it every night after I wash with Neutrogena Hydro Burst exfoliating cleanser. Like them both so far."
I ordered the Night Repair and received the Rapid Wrinkle Repair moisturizer with sunscreen. I will use this since I have it and summer is right around the corner. I love Neutrogena products and have for years. Just disappointed that my order got messed up.
I was not happy with this producted.. .iratated my eyes....i had to quit using it
"I recommend, because is good price and is really good works to me 2 weeks ago!"
My skin is so much softer and firmer. I would recommend this to everyone woman
"Soaks into my skin quickly, no greasy residue, and my face is smooth and healthy looking again."
I'm 50 and have been using this for at least ten years... most people guess my age at about 32-35
I love this in 2 weeks you notice your wrinkles are gone
"Love the way it feels on my skin. Isn't greasy feeling at all. I only gave 4 stars because I have only used it for 2'weeks. Can't tell if it works yet , so far I like it. Makes my skin feel tighter"
"Love this product. Can dry out your skin if you use daily, so I use every other day. Noticeable difference in tone, texture and less wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't comment on how effective this product is because I ended up washing it off every time I tried to use it due its overpowering scent. While the scent is pleasant, it's just too strong. I was having trouble falling asleep because of it. I've since switched to the fragrance-free product and love it. If perfumes or other strong scents bother you, go with the fragrance-free one instead."
The active ingredient in this is retinol. And retinol is proven to help with texture and wrinkles. This did give me irritation and dried my skin out terribly. I had flakes and dry patches but I was expecting that. So if you're looking for an actual heavy duty moisturizer this isn't it. I used it for about 3 and a half weeks but I had to stop because my skin was just to inflamed. If you can get over the hurdle of your skin getting worse before it gets better then you may want to try this
"For anyone with the slightest fragrance allergy, this product is so perfumed that it is impossible to use. The perfume in it is so strong that your eyes water and your nose runs and you have to wash it off immediately. So who knows whether it works or not? Please produce a fragrance-free version for the 25% of women who are allergic to fragranced products!"
"My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena products to me. I had some deep lines...crevasses more like...around my mouth resulting from electrolysis treatments. These were very noticeable on my otherwise average-appearing face for a 62-year old. I saw a visible difference in about a week. There is still a crease from smiling, but NOTHING like it was before. Thank you for this great product."
Honestly I can't believe this product is actually working. I've been using this product for 2 weeks along with the Rapid Tone Repair during the day. I have seen a SIGNIFICANT change to the dark circles under my eyes and an overall brightening and smoothness to my skin. I asked my husband to look at my dark circles and he asked me if I had on makeup! I'm sold!
"I was originally very excited about this product because it did seem to help my wrinkles and increase elasticity; however, it ended up making me break out with melia bumps â€“ which are tiny little bumps caused by clogged pores that NEVER go away. :-(( It's not non-comedogenic, meaning this product clogs your pores :-("
"I had high hopes for this product due to my blotchy skin & Neutrogena's reputation. I started using the Rapid Tone Repair day moisturizer and Rapid Wrinkle Repair night moisturizer a week ago. I'm not sure which is causing it, but I woke up with large red circles around my eyes yesterday including my eyelids where I don't use product. My skin is dry and scaly and my eyes are puffy. I have stopped using both products in hopes my skin will clear up."
"This is a nice, lightweight feeling moisturizer but it'll be gone before you think. Although the bottle looks to be a reasonable size, there is only 1 oz. of liquid in there. The heavy bottle and carton are a waste of packaging material. Hey, Neutrogena, your products are great, but let's not produce so much packaging waste that's going to end up in the trash."
At first I wasn't sure about this product because it caused some redness but just like promise my skin got use to it and the results have been great. I now use just these three products and I'm 62 years old. I hate when you go to a department store and there's 20 different products they want you to purchase. I've used expensive high end creams and this by far is now my favorite cream. I'm very pleased with the results and I've received lots of compliments that I wasn't expecting. 10 stars
"I have been experimenting with skin care products for years ranging from the only thing that I could afford in college to very high end products since being in the work force. I have never used a product that has delivered results so quickly and noticeably!!!!! I woke up about 5 days after the start of using this product and said ""WOW""! It was like I had a whole new face; bright, clear, and lines were quickly fading. If I saw results in 5 days I can't wait to see what happens in 5 weeks!!!!!"
"I am amazed at the results after only 15 days.....It has made a visible difference in my frown lines, and lines running down along my mouth, from my nose to chin.....I have been telling everyone to try it, as I am shocked by the results, and want to see if anyone else has the same experience with the product. It has also firmed my skin.....I TOTALLY recommend this, and can't wait to see further results."
"Pores GONE! Blackheads GONE! Whiteheads GONE! Agespot VANISHING! Wrinkles SMOOTHING! All of this and I'm ONLY on my 4th night using this product?! I cant imagine it getting better :) You guys better keep this stuff stocked because when word gets out its going to fly off the shelves! Oh,and did I mention the UNBELIEVABLE price?? THANK YOU!!! 42 lookin' 35..."
"I don't usually have sensitive skin but as my first anti-wrinkle product experience I am completely disappointed and discouraged! I bought 2 different Neutrogena products to try (this one and the healthy skin anti-wrinkle cream) and now I am afraid to use them after the irritation, dryness and flakiness it has caused after just 4 days of use. Total waste of money I had low expectations but I was hoping this product would at LEAST be moisterizing but it did the exact opposite"
"Use it faithfully at night and wake up without my face feeling drawn and dry. Will keep using it. Am so pleased with the Neutrogena skin care products I have used to this date, I plan to order other items, especially the Hydro-Gel as soon as my budget allows."
I am on my 4th bottle of this product and love it. It has minimized my fine lines around my eyes and lips. My skin tone is more even and more polished. I am 41 and everyone thinks I'm 30 so something is working! I like the smell and I have allergies and can't stand strong smells. It has never been a problem for me.
"So, I'm not exactly sure what some of these other reviewers are talking about when they say the smell is overbearing. It smells great, and clean. Who cares how it smells anyway, when it works as well as it does? My forehead creases (frown lines) are barely perceptible after 3 weeks of use. My skin is highly acne prone, but I had no problems with breakouts with this product. I love it and will continue to use it! Seriously, it works."
LOVE THIS NEUTROGENA RAPID REPAIR.BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR. IM 70 YRS OLD AND I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS ON MY SKIN. I HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF MY SKIN SINCE I WAS YOUNG.A MUST TRY. I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS. I USE THE DAY LOTION AND THE NIGHT ONE.THE EYE CREME IS GOOD ALSO.
I have been using this product for 4 weeks and have noticed a difference in the fine wrinkles on my forehead and my skin seems less dull and much more youthful. The scent is not even noticeable to me. I will definitely be using this product for a long while and recommend it all of my friends.
"I have oily skin and just got done with my first bottle of this product and I am going to buy it again , my skin has shown visible improvment which I had not noticed with other creams and I have used many during the years , I highly recommend this product . thank you neutrogena"
"I've been using this for about three weeks and it is just incredible! I see and feel the difference in my crows feet and forehead lines. The clock has been dialed back at least 10 years so far. I feel NO burning, tingling, redness or flaking. Unfortunately, at 40, I am still plagued with acne and everything makes my face break out, even products which claim not to. This product has dramatically improved my acne as well. I could not be happier."
I just hope the damage this product did to my skin....especially to my eye area heals. Don't chance damaging your face. I am retired from the beauty industry and I bet this product will be pulled off the market. I'm not young but now I look worse. After 3 days my skin looked dried out and more wrinkled. I should have read some reviews before throwing away my money. I want to cry. I'm waiting a few days and if it doesn't heal off to the dermatologist
"Neutrogena is the best--it is a brand I trust. I had used the Ageless IntensivesÂ® Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Night Moisturizer for years and wanted to try this. The new product has a strong fragrance if you're used to fragrance free and I did get clogged pores from it. It is unclear why it is an improved formula--the company doesn't divulge % retinol, etc. Disappointing."
"I recommend this for someone who doesn't have deep wrinkles. Have used it faithfully for over a month, have not seen a big difference, but do like how it goes on and the smell of it. So in the long run for fine wrinkles I do recommend but not for medium to deep wrinkles. Maybe you will develop something for us that are prone to deep laugh lines and some times frown lines."
"I've been using this product for six weeks now. My skin looks so much better. I use it twice a day and can really tell the difference in my lines and wrinkles. In fact, the other day I was looking in the mirror to check my hair on the way out to work and noticed that I have absolutely no wrinkles (just small lines hardly noticable) by my eye area and this was in bright sunlight. WOW! And, I'm 53 going on 54 next month. Pretty amazing stuff. Definitely a keeper!!"
"I think I purchased this about a month ago, for help with some wrinkles I've been seeing lately. I have not seen an improvement in my wrinkles but my acne scars have almost totally vanished. It has also helped to bring back the texture to my skin. This is the first time since having acne and developing scarring that I touch my face and not feel utterly disgusted by it. I have not had any irritation or stinging either. This is a new staple in my nightly routine."
"I love Neutrogena products and have for years. I decided to try the Rapid Wrinkle Repair as I have alot of wrinkles, especially deep on my forehead. It works great and seems to be visually reducing the deep lines there. I will continue its use and hope"
they disappear even more. Thank You
"I tried this hoping to get rid of crows feet and reduce undereye wrinkles, and it has done just that. So much so that it has taken off 10+ years off my face! Whereas before people would say I look my age, now people think I'm 33 or younger (do the math, lol). I'm impressed!"
I love this stuff....I have mostly fine lines and within a week it was so much better. For my deeper wrinkles it's made a difference but I see signs of improvements. I have only used it for 2 weeks but I can really tell a difference. The bags under my eyes are so much better. I have tried many anti wrinkle creams even the high dollar stuff and not seen the results i have with this cream.
"I am 74 and have dry skin. I have been uising this product for 8 or 9 months and I love it. It has helped my wrinkles and overall look of my skin. My dermatologist even commented on how good my skin looks. I told her what I used and she said ""they do a good job with there products"". I agree. No one ever guesses that I am 74 and loving it."
"If you are prone or have sensitive skin, be mindful, as this product has accelerated retinal. I am sensitive under my eyes, so I avoid this area; however, apply in the crinkly areas of my forehead and neck and upper chest. This product is a night coverage"
"product, and for me, does what it claims in aiding in minimizing wrinkles."
I have used this as my night moisturizer for 3 yrs (42 yrs old). I love love love it. Anybody who complains about wrinkles I tell them to get this product. I read some other reviews that complained of skin issues with use. I have normal/dry skin and have never had any issues after years of use. I highly recommend the rapid repair eye cream too. Worked miracles on my crows feet!
"Over the last two weeks, I've absolutely noticed a softening of lines around my mouth and on my forehead. I used this product in tandem with my usual moisturizer and noticed a difference, even in the murky depths of January when it's difficult for skin to ever look good. Recommended. I should add that I have very sensitive skin with a tendency to blotch and Rapid Wrinkle Repair didn't bother my skin at all."
Really like the non-greasy feel and great moisturization BUT the scent is way too strong. I look to Neutrogena for products that leave out unnecessary ingredients like fragrance and was disappointed that it was added to this face lotion. Good product otherwise but I will not be purchasing it again unless it comes in unscented.
"Not sure if I will know if this product works, the fragrance is horrible and overpowering a real turn off. I have used neutrogenia products for years without fragrance so hoping that they are reading the reviews and understand that women don't want fragrance in a wrinkle cream UGH!"
"Really works! I could see difference after about 2 weeks. It spreads on lightly, not oily, and my fine wrinkles around eyes have been greatly reduced. Agree with packaging comments: this should be put in a tube (like the serum) so that every last drop can be used. Disagree with comments about strong fragrance: I don't find that it is. Only drawback: I live in Europe, but cannot buy it here. I have to always wait for my vacation to the States to load up on new Neutrogena products."
"I was very impressed with the results of the Rapid Repair Night Moisturizer and, so, had planned on trying a number of the other products in the Rapid Repair line. However, I am finding it impossible to ignore the intense fragrance and will, unfortunately, have to discontinue use. Having read similar reviews by other consumers expressing this same concern, I would hope that Neutrogena might consider a fragrance-free alternative."
"I will use this forever. This lotion is amazing. It smells clean and fresh, its light and absorbs quick. And my skin has never looked better. I have not tried many other night creams but this stuff works so well, I will be a customer forever. If you are in the market for a nightly cream with retinal.... THIS is it!!"
"I am 54 yrs old with deep forehead wrinkles and fine laugh lines . I have used this product for more than a month now. I have seen no results on the fine wrinkles let alone the deep ones. The fragrance is too strong and the moisturizing effect does not last through the night. Basically, I paid too much for a simple moisturizer that has too much fragrance and doesn't last."
"This product was advertised as ""100% of women see results in one week"". Well my face is smoother/softer since I have been using this product but I have seen no change in the newly formed wrinkles on my forehead. I will continue to use and a possible update later."
"am over 60 now, lines coming thick and fast, this night cream is definitely making a big difference to fine lines, some difference to skin texture, and a particularly noticable red mark in the middle of my forehead has gone. I look a better colour too."
"I am so disappointed in this product, I've used it for over a month and see no change/improvement in the lines on my face. I thought Neutrogena is a good Co., and I could trust what they were saying on TV & in magazines about this product. I really believed finally I would have a cream that works. . .but it didn't do anything more then other products I've tried."
I have been using this product for several years and my skin is gorgeous. I will be 70 in July of this year and no one would ever guess. I look at least 15 years younger. I have always been very careful about sun exposure. I love the beach and often spend all day at the beach or pool in the summer but I am very careful about applying and reapplying sunscreen. This moisturizer is light and does not clog pores. I use it every night.
"This product is the real deal when it comes to minimizing fine lines! But wow it dried out my oily skin. I've tried it all, everything from Dr.Perricone to Olay and nothing ever dried out my skin! I was actually shocked to see my face so dry. But I still kept using cause within a week my furrow lines were gone! I still use it, but I definitely have to put a thicker cream over it, sometimes Vaseline. Works excellent for fine lines , but if you already have dry skin would, I would steer clear from this product."
I noticed results after only using this a few nights my skin is noticeably smoother and less ruddy and dull. My makeup seems to glide on easier & I don't need as much. The more I continue to use this the better my complexion looks. I really think this helps my skin look much younger and supple.
"I used this product for approximately 6 days and on the 7th I started to see red areas, dry patches, and burning sensation. I changed by cleanser and returned to a tried and true night cream. For several days the burning continued. After 5 days I am seeing improvement in the burning but a LOT of dry patches. I would not recommend anyone using it. Today I am returning it to the store where purchased for a guaranteed money refund. Very disappointing."
"I am a red head, have sensitive skin, and have tried every face cream out there. I LOVE this product. My skin tone is now even, and my skin just glows. It leaves my skin so soft without being greasy and it doesn't smell like perfume, like all the others out there. It's light, simple, and my face feels younger. I can't say enough good things about rapid wrinkle repair. I hope they never stop making it, I won't buy anything else."
"I am 27 years old and am just starting to see minor fine wrinkles in my forehead. This moisturizer yielded results within days. My skin was soft, wrinkles almost gone and pores were much less noticable. This is a great product at a great price. Will definitely buy again."
"I am extrememly pleased that Neutrogena's claim is actually true. At 58, I have tried many well-known products, both department store-expensive and drugstore-reasonable. I use the day, the night and the eye creams and they all work. I see a very noticeable difference and people can't believe my age. My own personal downfall is some slight jowl sagging, but this product is not meant for that. More extreme measures are but with the results of these creams, I don't need to think about that just yet."
This product is outstanding. The exfoliating properties of this product are awesome. In one week I noticed a huge difference. My makeup goes on flawlessly. I have gotten so many compliments. Some people actually asked me if I had some kind of cosmetic procedure.
"Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer is great! Go to sleep w/ it on and wake up w/ much more moisturized skin. I like all Neutrogena products. They are easy to find, they are lower priced than the higher priced competition products.....and"
they work just as well.
"I'm 63 years young and have tried all the creams and serums promising younger looking skin. I can see the difference in my skin after just one application. Totally amazing results. I have always trusted in Neutrogena products and will continue to use them faithfully. Excellent job, Neutrogena, as usual!!"
#RapidResults This is just as good as the day version. Helps keep wrinkles at bay and is a great retinol product for fine lines and wrinkles. Use every day to see best results in as little as one week. I had one fine line near my bottom lip that was gone after using this for a month.
"I have been using Neutrogena's Rapid Wrinkle Repair for over three weeks now and have noticed a significant difference in my skin! It feels so soft and smooth and worry lines on my forehead are quickly a thing of the past. I have combination skin and therefore hesitant on what I put on my face. The serum is lightweight and has a nice clean scent. My skin is glowing and so much clearer. Your skin will have the ""I woke up like this"" look for sure."
"I started using this product a couple of months ago. I have some wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyebrows, also some fine lines under eyes. At first I wasn't sure about this product. Didn't see much change. But after a couple of months, I began to see the wrinkles were much softer and not as pronounced. Overall, I like the results of this product. My friends have started asking me why I am not aging as fast as they are. It must be working for them to notice."
I could not believe the difference in my skin. My face was glowing after two weeks! I can actually go without makeup. And Iam 55 yrs old. I have tried everything and this is the best. Do not waste time. You want results this product is it. Thank you Neutrogena. And I will add the makeup is wonderful too. My face looks and feels fresh all day !
"I've been using Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer at night and the Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30 during the day for about 3 months now. It works great!! At first, it did irritate my skin, for about a week or so. I figured this was proof it was working, because my skin was flakey and peeling. I had deep wrinkles on my forehead and now you can barely see them!!! Wonderful products, Neutrogena!! Thank you"
"My name is Linda and I am 51 years old. I have lines on my forehead, lips and deep laugh lines. Lets be real, we spend a lot of money on products that yield no results. I will be honest when I purchased this product, i expected more of the same. I bought the day and evening moisturizer along with the serum. Today is my 7th day and it is amazing. My deep wrinkles and lines have smoothed out so much and I look great. It is unbelieveable. I am so excited. I will always use this product and tell everyone about it."
"Was very cautious when I bought this product, because I am tired of throwing money away on things that I can only hope will work. After 2 1/2 wks. of use I have friends who have noticed a difference. The finer lines around my eyes have lessened. Also, just purchased the Anti-wrinkle deep filler for around my mouth. Got my fingers crossed that I will be just as satisfied...."
"I noticed a difference in my skin overnight, and it just keeps looking better each day. I haven't even used it a full week yet, so I am excited to see the results that I get as I continue use. I love the feel of it, the lack of fragrance, and the results! I wish the sizes of the product were larger for the same price."
"My week long trial is done & my skin looks better & younger so I'm going to keep using this line. I'm very surprised that my extremely sensitive, 42-year-old skin didn't have a bad reaction to this. After seven days my skin is more even-toned, moisturized, and the lines on my forehead & between my eyes are softer. It doesn't seem to clog my pores, either, which usually happens to me with ALL products. I think I'll try the Regenerating cream next b/c I just prefer no fragrance. Thanks, Neutrogena!"
I bought this product as recommended in Real Simple. I have been very pleased and have not experienced any of the issues of other reviewers. I love the scent which seems very light compared to some of the expensive French products I have used ( i live in France)
"I am 40 years old but I look under 30 years...Thanks to my good genes. However, I started using this product a few weeks ago as I have very fine lines under my eyes. I have noticed changes in my skin tone to the best and also I feel my skin very smooth."
"I have been using for just over a week now and noticed dry skin flakes when I apply makeup. I also stopped using it around my eyes because of the intense burning! When I applied concealer under my eyes my skin was peeling off. I may use this on my forehead, nose and cheeks but not on thin delicate skin around my eyes. I check everyday to see if the lines on my face are lighter but no luck so far."
My over priced creams/ serums started pooping out. Decided to try this on a whim and so far so good! Great for fine lines around the mouth and for early frown lines as well. Makes a great under make-up moisturizer for daytime. My whole complexion looks brighter after just 1 week. The only negative is the heavy fragrance. Hope they'll consider a fragrance free version.
I have been using Neutorgena's rapid wrinkle repair for 2 months and the difference is amazing. Co-workers have noticed the difference and asked what I have been doing. They are all sold on the product and going to invest in this magnificent product. So glad I gave it a try.
"I have tried many, many different products and this is one that I can say truly works. I am 57 and this product has made me like my skin again. A good friend recently told me that my skin looked really good. She was very impressed and wanted to get the product for herself. Thanks Neutrogena for actually delivering on your promise!"
"I'm a long time user of Neutrogena products and have never had any problems until now. I don't normally had sensitive skin, but after using this product and the daytime moisturizer for about 4 days, I've experience redness, flakiness, irritation,"
"and stinging. I'm afraid to continue using these products, did I get a bad batch?"
"I was invited to try this product and am glad I accepted. While the main benefit is marketed as an anti-wrinkle cream, I also experienced other benefits as well. While I didn't see much change in my dark spots over the past two weeks, I did experience a noticeable difference in my skin's texture and overall appearance. It's much smoother and less oily."
I have been using it for two weeks and I am amazed at the results. I had been using a very very expensive product line and gave up after a year with no results.After just two weeks I can't believe the difference. I can honestly say it worked miracles for me.
"I have used this night time moisturizer for years. I am impressed that it contains Hyaluronic Acid, a substance naturally produced by your body, especially in skin and connective tissue. I recently learned it is used as an injection to reduce joint pain, but dermatologists are using it to improve skin texture."
"Starting to notice Subtle differences after two applications and so far very pleased with the results, IÃ¢Â€Â™m almost 35 and the very fine line is already seem to be fading after two treatments subtle differences after two applications and so far very pleased with the results, IÃ¢Â€Â™m almost 35 and the very fine lines already seem to be fading after two uses. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s never too early to start a good skin care routine"
"Love this product. It's light and not greasy. I have been using this for years and I always get people not believing how old I actually am. I have tried similar products, but nothing compares to the quality or price of this product. Nice that the quality hasn't changed either."
"So far so good. It has dried my face out a good bit, but I have really oily skin so with a dab of moisturizer I'm fine. I only have a few wrinkles on my forehead I was trying to get rid of. I've been using this about 12 days and I've seen a difference."
The product worked very well.
"I love it, my skin looks so good, I can see the results in one week"
Thought I would try did nothing for me wil not purchase again
This is a great product. I use it every night and the skin around my eyes looks much better than last year.
I noticed a difference in my face very quickly. I can tell if I don't use it. My face is so soft and smooth.
I was skeptical but hopeful when I purchased this product. I am extremely pleased with the fast noticeable results! My skin looks more plump and wrinkles seem to be less noticeable and it's barely been one week. I recommend it to try today!
"Neutrogena facial products do exactly what they say they will do. I have been using them, along with the microdermabrasion tool, for decades."
"I have been using this for 4 nights and my skin has bunched up, gotten really dry and flakey and my wrinkle across my nose got DEEPER!!!!! My wrinkles are now MORE accentuated...HELP!!"
"I was really impressed with how quickly my skin started to show less wrinkles and more smoothness. It's not heavy, it's light but effective. I will definitely be purchasing this again."
"This is a treatment for your skin which helps refresh and soften lines and wrinkles. I am 65 years old and have used this for about 8 months every night. I would not change to anything else, and believe me I have tried many!"
"for any product to make them look better. I used the product faithfully but my deep wrinkles did not look any better. Normally, I like Neutrogena products but I think your claims do not fit everyone."
"This product delivers! After 2 days, my skin was visibly smoother. After 4 days, my dry patches were gone. After a week, my brown spots were noticeably fading. Even my husband complimented me on my glowing skin!"
"I loved the old tube of the night wrinkle cream that I bought in 2016. I bought it consistently, however, this new pump bottle is cool, however, the scent sucks. It is just too strong. Love the cream but hate the scent."
"Just started using this and have dry and sensitive skin, so I am following the advice about skipping a day. I'm wondering if I should use an additional moisturizer or toner with this product to minimize dryness."
"I have used Neutrogena products for decades (I'm 55) but you have topped everything you have ever done. AFFORDABLE and IT WORKS! In one week, my skin looks at least 10 years younger. I can't praise it enough, other than to say THANK YOU!"
awful. after a week of applying around the eyes and on the neck of irritation in the form of redness and sensation of burning skin. cash in the trash.
"Most people with sensitive skin are allergic to fragrance. I am surprised that a company like Neutrogena would put such in their products. Because of adding fragrance, I would never buy this product."
"I was skeptical at first, but this did in fact help my wrinkles. I wasn't able to use it every night at first due to sensitivity but I was able to see some improvement. Color me impressed!"
"I usually use more expensive brands, but the combination of retinol and hyaluronic acid do a great job. Smoother skin and more even skin tone. Very pleased!"
I had high hopes for this because I've trusted Neutrogena. I tried it one night and returned it to the store the next day. The fragrance was overpowering and made my eyes water. Why would a facial product have such a heavy scent?
"I cannot use this producet. After a few days my skin is red, blotchy, and very irritated. I left it for a few days and went back to it and it just got worse. Now no matter what i put on my face it burns."
I have been using this product for approximately 6 months. I will continue to use it as I feel it does so much for my skin. I am in my seventies and I often get remarks from others on how beautiful my skin is.
I have been using the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Cream for 3 weeks and my skin is now firmer and smoother. Plus my husband told me I look amazing! A 5 star product to be sure!!
"Friend recommended this. Been using it for a month now and my skin feels so soft when I wake up. One pump is enough for my face, neck and chest. And the fragrance is beautiful!"
"I absolutely love this night cream, It actually works and the smell is to die for. I can't wait to put it on my face at night. This is the best ant-aging product I have come across in a long time..."
"Directions say to use a pearl-sized amount? Is that for entire face and neck? I used pearl-sized on each cheek, forehead, and neck and experienced mild burning and redness. Did I use too much?"
"I've completely used two bottles of this product. My skin feels smooth and soft and looks clear and bright. I don't have many wrinkles to begin with, but haven't noticed any new ones since using this."
"This Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Night moisturizer is terrific! While nothing is magic and erases all wrinkles, this is a great moisturizer. It minimizes the lines and makes everything much smoother and softer. The feel isnt greasy."
Neutrogena has done it again. With regular use there's definitely results! Id suggest using the other products in the line so you get all the benefits! This leaves your skin soft &amp; supple.
"My skin has been terribly dry this winter season, so I love this! I put it on at night and my skin is so refreshed in the morning. I have also noticed less small wrinkles!"
"You can't go wrong with Neutrogena! This night cream delivers and in the morning I use the Very Gentle Cleanser, have not used soap on my face since I was 21 and then I follow it with Healthy Skin Radiance. This really works and I'm soon 64!"
I've used Healthy skin products for years and more recently Ageless Intensive Night Cream. I've notice NO additional benefits from uning the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night and Eye Cream. Extremely disappointed. Not worth the extra money.
"I bought two bottles and used them faithfully each night. Nothing happened, no wrinkles lessened or disappeared as stated. I look the same as I always did."
"Ive been using this moisturizer for about 6 months or more. The deep-set wrinkles on my forehead and crow's feet have diminished, the overall appearance of my skin is great I absolutely love it. This has done wonders for me."
"For the most concentrated formula, Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night is a strong moisturizer, working overtime while we sleep! Great for fine line, even deep wrinkles."
"I am very happy with this product!! I am 62. I have a deep line between my eye brows, this product has made it much less visible! It has helped with the laugh lines near my mouth. It works!!!"
I have been using this product now for about a week.and really notice the difference in the lines. They are finer and not as noticeable. I only wished this product was un scented.
I used this for the first time last night and the fragrance is so strong it gave me a headache. I don't understand why such a strong fragrance is used in a facial product. I will be returning it.
"THE FINE LINES AROUND MY EYES ARE FADING, I HAVE BEEN USING THIS AND THE BRAZILLIAN PEEL. I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS PRODUCT IS THE ONE MAKING THE DIFFERENCE. WILL BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY."
This product is worth every cent and more. I really do look better in the morning. It's amazing and feels great on my skin. How nice to have a wonderful product that works well and is priced well too.
I have been using this product for a week. I have sensitive skin but have had no redness or irritation. I haven't seen too much differance in my skin yet but I am not expecting results for 6-12 weeks.
"I've been loving this product for a few weeks now. My forehead wrinkles are diminishing, it's amazing!!! One question.... I want to add a little more moisture to my nightly routine, winter is coming....Does anyone have any ideas of what I can add with my Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum and Night Moisturizer?"
"I was excited to try this product - bought it for the new year - new me - new beauty regimen. The 1st application burned a bit- thought maybe, it's just working deep to rid wrinkles and smooth skin, but now day nine in - my under eyes are puffy and red. Going to take a break for a couple days and see what happens."
"I bought this product about a month ago. With 3 week use I started to discover dark burnt lines above and under my eyes. Reaction caused itchiness and pain. I do not recommend buying this moisturizer. This has damaged my skin, how do I recover from this ?"
"I bought the Neutragena Rapid Wrinkle Repair. I used it for few times. After that, my face become resdish. I feel burning sensation and itchiness on my face. Now my face is swelling, and its really bad in my eye area. Its all swelling. I do not recommend this!"
I have used this diligently at night for well over a week and I don't see any real change
This product is excellent. I would recommend it.
"I will have to try this, it does feel good on my skin :)"
"This feels very nice, but is not a cure for wrinkles."
"I did read the instruction on bottle, that skin might get red and flaky after using it, it's a sign of cream working. But it seems to deepen the lines, instead of the other way around. after just 3 days of using it, my skin gets very red and felt light burning sensation, and extremely dry, I had to apply Vaseline to it at night. I am very disappointed."
"I have sensitive and reactive skin, and it seems to make me break out if i apply it anywhere except my eyes. Not good for me because i wanted to apply to my forehead lines. Also if i apply every night, it irritates under my eyes. I haven't noticed an improvement in lines either."
"I have used it about 5 days now. The last two nights my eyes were so dry and sore when I awoke and burned when I first put it on. The smell is so strong that it causes me to have a headache. The smell isn't even good. Also, last night was the first night that I noticed it was starting to burn when I put it on and my skin feels dry when I awake. So, I will not buy another. Some may love it, but I don't."
"Thank you,Thank you, Thank you for making such a great feeling, awsome Resuts, afortable Produkt for your costumers!I worked in the Beauty-Market, for 25 Years now and know,what wonderful Results are possible with Retinol. This Product got it all right-it is simply awsome!!! thank you D.J.-Savannah!"
"I started using this product about 3 weeks ago . I don't have any wrinkles but Im inmy 40.s and wanted to try some products with the Retin A ingredients. My mother started complementing me on my skin and asked me what I was using. I told her the Wrinkle repair cream from this company. She said my skin looked very smooth. I suggest anyone to use it nightly , then maybe every other night . But I'm happy with this product."
"Well I keep learning a lesson everyday about this cream, do not exfoliate before using this cream. When you put it on your face it will burn like the fire of 1000 suns. Also dont use it everyday. I have chemical burns in the places i put it on. I only use it on the areas that actually have fine lines. Aside from the chemical burns, I have noticed a difference in my lines."
"Love this product! I'm over 50 and I was getting dryness in my usual combination skin. I wanted something to brighten and exfoliate w/out causing dryness and flakiness. A cleanser of another brand was giving me dryness. It's less than a week and my skin is smoother and brighter and doesn't feel sticky. The odor is nice, too! I want to try the Neutrogena daytime moisturizer too!"
I bought this 2 days ago and already see a noticeable difference around my eye area. I am amazed. Especially since it cost me $65 less than my last creme and so far with better results. I saw this in magazine articles the past few months and had been eagerly waiting for the [...] stores in my area to start carrying it.Thanks for making something so awesome that is affordable!!!!!!!!
"Im turning 40 this weekend and thought now would be a great time to start an anti-wrinkle cream. I bought this and after using it for 3 days my face is red, blotchy, swollen to almost my eyes are swollen shut! My skin where i put it feel like sandpaper too :( I have never had an allergic reaction to anything"
"I have been using the day spf product, the serum at night and I have the night cream and eye stuff. All rapic wrinkle replair. I love all of them but, I am still confused when I should use which ones, how frequently, and and in what ""order"" over or under each other? Help please."
"I tried this product for over a week. My skin started to flake, and the area under my eyes became supersensitive and stung when it was damp. I felt that I had to stop using the product, with that reaction in such a short time. I'm 76, and most people think I'm in my mid-to-upper 50s - flaking and red, sensitive skin do not do much for that! I'm sorry to have to say that I would NOT recommend this product."
"I don't have deep wrinkles, but this did smooth things out for me and improve the texture and clarity of my skin. I also tend to be sensitive, and have a weird combo of dry and oily skin, and this did not cause a reaction or breakouts. My skin felt lightly moisturized."
"Love , love this moisturizer , it is not to heavy but I can feel it working . My only complaint is that there is no way to tell when you are running out . The bottle has some weight to it so that does not help indicate you are low. Would love an indicator strip on side that is clear, just big enough to keep up with how much product is left. I really do not want to be without it, both the day and night version. Is there anything you can do to help this dilemma? Thank you"
I am the most skeptical person out there and I am having great results. I have tried the most expensive and not gotten the results I am seeing with these rapid products. I highly recommend using them and stick with them and you won't be disappointed!
"I have used many, many other anti aging products that cost two or three times as much as Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer. None of them are better than this. Why spend more ? Don't get sucked in by the ""coffeeberry, or the reservatrol, etc."" This product is great and its definitely more cost effective ! Love it."
"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS PLUS THE DAILY MOISTURE AND I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NO , REPEAT NO WRINKLES."
Some co-workers and I tried it for a few months on only one side of our face. It did absolutely nothing.
I been using the product for last 5 years. And I love it.. It helps me keep my face smooth and wrinkles under control.
"I've bought this a few times before, but my latest bottle has a different consistency from the last ones. Just wondering if I got a manky one?"
"If I wanted fragrance, I would buy perfume. My skin is sensative and I broke out after the sencond day."
I've had better results with &quot;Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair&quot; then with costly department store brands.
"My skin in a few days seems clearer and smoother. However, my question is should I put moisturizer over it at night?"
I have to say after a week of using this product I noticed a huge difference on my face. Totally happy with the product:)
I'm 76 years old so I don't expect miracles but my skin has gotten so soft and maybe some wrinkles are lessened.
Applied nightly and immediately enjoyed the hydration. I'm late 40's and appreciate hope at fighting wrinkles.
"I have used this as my daily moisturizer for years...and Love it. No breakouts, no greasiness, just feels great."
This product is amazing! In the morning after use my skin is soft and smooth. This one is a must have!
I use it every night religiously and it has made my skin look smooth and wrinkles are less visible. Great results. I also use the day creme.
"My skin is looking so good. With me being 75 year's of age, it just couldn't look any better. I am so happy with Neutrogena for Day and Night."
I bought the cream after all the oopla about it but the fragrance is too much for me. It gave me headaches at night.
"I bought this last week and I have used it at night like it said, now I have redness and its dry and itchy is 2 spots on my face...I think Im going to go a few days to see if it goes away..."
I am a woman over 50 years old. I have found that all the face moisturizers geared towards women my age can be overtly greasy. This moisturizer goes on smoothly and it soaks in to my skin immediately. I will purchase again in the future.
"This product truly does what it says it will. In one week, I definately saw a difference in the appearance of my skil. I don't hesitate to recommend it."
i have used this product for 3 weeks and i still have the wrinkles. i thought by now i would see some kind of improvement. i am not pleased with this product and will not buy it again.
I bought this last Friday and it is now Monday. My skin is drier than it was before and I seem to have double the wrinkles I had before starting. I'm really concerned about this!!!
"I bought this for my mom. At first I only thought that it's used for underneath eyes areas only but you can use it for the entire face and especially focus on wrinkles on your forehead, around your lips or chin."
It works
Really like this product
"I have loving my life eye wrinkles (lots of outdoor time, laugh lines, getting older lines...). After 2 weeks of using Rapid Wrinkle Repair before bedtime, I have seen a definite improvement. The lines are a bit less noticeable and the area around my eyes"
seem softer.
I haven't used a moisturizer in many years because I felt like nothing made any difference. This product made my skin much softer. Fine lines seem smoother. Not much difference in wrinkles. I do see a lot less blotchiness. This has made me start a nite time routine again and I will be purchasing the product to see if I have further results.

"I Love the way it makes my skin feel. I was worry about oil build up over night but that was no problem. My skin was less oily and that is plus. With humidity high at night ,skin was silky and not oily like other moisturizer. This product I will continue to use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always used Neutrogena products for their quality and value and have been wanting to try this product. I have found that this product provides moisture to my skin without making it too oily for my combination skin and my skin does seem smoother with use of this product. I have had no adverse side effects from using this product either. I will definitely purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
LOVE LOVE LOVE this cream after 1 weeks use I could see a huge difference in laugh lines around my eyes....after 2 weeks I was SOLD brilliant cream not only does it help with wrinkles but softens and moisturizes skin well too. I use both creams daily and wouldn't use anything else!
"I bought the Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair and started applying it. On the 1st day,I experienced a tingling sensation.I comforted myself thinking the product is working.But on the 2nd day of applying, the skin under my eyes burnt giving a reddish look with a additional line under my eye. I am very disappointed.Please recommend on how to treat the affected area"
I am using this cream long time and I am very happy because is the best cream for wrinkles.
I'm 75 years old and even at my age it did a wonderful job on my wrinkles. Very highly recommended.
Noticed a difference within a week! Very fast results.
I am sensitive to perfume and it did not mentioned it was in the product
"I love Neutrogena products, better than more expensive products"
"My face feels moisturized, plus my fine lines and wrinkles are noticeably minimized."
My face is burned after two applications over three days. It is like a chemical burn.
.. in my skin. Lines seem to be fading. Will continue to see what happens.
"i;m 60 (male). the stuff works well, lessening a lot of damage."
Like the smooth softness of my skin when using Rapid Wrinkle Night Moisturizer.
"Absorbed quickly, felt smooth and silky going on. No irritation so far"
Really works well. Silky smooth and pleasant scent.
"I just started using this product and don't see much difference yet, but I will review again in a month."
I had to return the item and didn't even bother trying the eye cream because I was afraid it would smell as bad. Made me nauseous.
I've only used this product for a couple days and it says it can cause peeling and irritation. But this is ridiculous! My face hurts so bad! I stopped using it and even after a day it still burns. I don't normally have sensitive skin either.
I am in my 70s and recently lost 30 pounds..but with the loss of weight I gained wrinkles...I started using Rapid Wrinkle Repair about 3 weeks ago and no more wrinkles...my skin was restored to it's former glow...Thanks so much...
I really like his product . I used it before bed every night for about a month and I believe the fine lines around my eyes were less visible. I would buy it again
I was very impressed with this product. I saw results withing two weeks. My skin and smoothed out and was firmer. It didn't make me break out like most products do. Definitely worth trying out.
"Been using this product for nearly 2 weeks now and my skin is in such bad shape. Severely dry and itchy with red flaky patches all over my face. This is my first time using Retinol, is this normal?"
"After 5 days of use, I awoke this am to a face that looks like I stayed in sunbed wayyyyyyyyy too long-face is red, puffy, dry and burning. I applied my normal day moisturizer ( different brand) this am and my face had a 3 alarm burning sensation for 5 minutes. I need to know the antidote for this condition! I can't leave the house looking like this. By, the way I have NEVER experienced anything like this. What can I put on my face to relieve this severe irritation?????"
"Great packaging and truly a quality product. With a bit of patience, i saw my skin texture improving noticably and my forehead lines have almost faded. I use 2 pumps for the entire face and it makes skis feel and look at it's best. Shame it;s not for sale in Europe, but I get it imported from the US. This is the most effective and most pleasant retinol product i have ever used and i will continue buying this product."
"I was invited to sample Neutrogena's Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer from Allure. The first time I used it, my face turned red in spots. I was almost afraid that I wouldn't be able to use it. Then after a while, my skin cooled down and it later proved to work nicely in the upcoming days that I used to it help refine my pores and overall texture."
"Don't waste your money on the expensive stuff! This isn't my all time favorite moisturizer. I have been using the day and night cram for years, and there truly isn't anything better under $100. You can actually feel this stuff working on your skin. It really is noticeable within a week."
"I started using this product over a month ago. I was very excited to change and try some thing new. But I have to say, this product after over a month, did NOTHING FOR MY SKIN! My wrinkles are still there, nothing changed!! So I'm going back to Olay Regenterest!! That product is amazing! Thank you for letting me try your product."
"I received this product free to try from Home Tester Club. I think that overall this product works well and does help to repair skin, maybe not as well as I would like but I think given my skin's condition it did a nice job and overall I was satisfied and would recommend this product to family and friends and would use again myself in the future.

"I was pleasantly surprised by Neutrogena's Rapid Wrinkle Repair moisturizer. It worked pretty well, had a good consistency, and blended into my skin quickly. It wasn't at all sticky, which I really appreciated. And oh, did I mention it has a wonderful, light, very fresh scent? (It fades quickly, for those of you who have scent phobias.) Really liked this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product..It delivers results.Many products out there claiming they work and they don`t This product does work.I have seen significant changes in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead,they have gotten finer and less noticeable.my skin feels softer and more moisturized than it has in years.A little of this product goes a long way,dries fast and leaves no sticky residue.Very impressed with this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy. However, it hydrates very well! In the short time that I've used it, it has smoothed and brightened my skin and fine lines look like they're disappearing! Despite the retinol, it hasn't caused my skin to get irritated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer for about two weeks. It goes on light, absorbing well into my skin. It doesn't leave me feeling greasy. I have noticed an improvement in my wrinkles and will continue using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer is very smooth when applying. It is very silky feeling and does not leave a residue or buildup. It soaks in nicely and leaves my skin feeling very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the fact that there was only a slight fragrance. It seemed to work especially well on my neck & upper dÃ©colletage area - I definitely noticed an improvement in that area. It was ok on my face, & my super-sensitive skin was not bothered. It had a pleasant, non-greasy feel. Also, a little bit goes a long way - super rich & absorbable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liike this product. It has an extremely mild scent and a lovely texture that feels nice going on and absorbs quickly. After just a few days' use, I can definitely see an improvment n the deep wrinkles between my eyes and in the creepy, creeping crepiness of my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"NeutrogenaÂ® Rapid Wrinkle RepairÂ® Night Moisturizer has been a great nighttime moisturizer for me. It goes on easily and smoothly and absorbs perfectly. It has made my skin softer, smoother and more hydrated. My skin looks brighter and much healthier now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, I love the fragrance. It is very light yet rich, pleasant and not overpowering or obnoxious. The consistency is the same, luxurious but not heavy. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. I was only able to use it for a week before I had to do this survey, so I feel I can't really give an opinion on how well it fixes wrinkles and fine lines, but the moisture lasted well into the next day and that in and of itself helped them be less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neutropenia Rapid Wrikle Repair Night Moisturizer is so easy to use, just rub a dot on in the evening on my clean face in an upward motion and I'm done. It's been a week and my lines are noticeably finer. Definitely a plus in my book. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like the applicator on this product. It disperses the perfect amount for application. The product itself is lightweight and applies smoothly. It has a pleasant scent and isnt sticky. I can definitely start to see a difference in my eye area. The crows feet looks less to me. The lines on my forehead also are looking better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I saw an immediate change in the softness and moisture of my face. The wrinkles around my eyes just disappeared. I will definitely be purchasing this product going forward. Finding something that shows results that quick is so rare. I just hope they don't change the formula any time soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this for a week and I could actually see results, my fine lines seemed to be less noticeable on my face and my neck seemed to be firmer and tighter."

"Quick results! Glad I had the chance to use this sample from Neutrogena & Home Tester Club. I am very pleased with the quick results. It goes on fast and easy, it isn't greasy and it has a very light but pleasant fragrance. I didn't notice any flaking or irritation. The best part is it really does make my skin look younger, fresher and with fewer of those fine line wrinkles around the eyes! Planning to make this a part of my regular nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Some of my less deep wrinkles since I am 61, seem to become less noticeable, but my rosacea seem to become more noticeable. That would be the only reason I will not be moving forward with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have been using the product now for almost a week. I love the way the product feels being applied to my skin. Nice and smooth . I have noticed after a couple of days my fine lines and creases are fading more each day. My skin feels soft and tighter also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I began using it a couple of weeks ago at night, and notice a change in my skin after one week. The tone has improved, my skin feels and looks plumper, pores are non-existent, my skin is super-soft and I am beginning to see small changes in the finer lines around my eyes. I'm very hopeful that there will be positive impact on some of the deeper ones at the corners of my mouth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I can't believe how fantastic Neutrogena's Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer makes my skin feel. My skin is so soft to the touch - even the next day! i have used it twice now: it goes on smoothly and easily. It is so creamy and absorbent. I really love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought that the product itself smelled GREAT! The lotion was a nice texture. But, the box does makes some outrageous claims. I have been using the product every night and I haven't seen any of my wrinkles go away. I know that it is nearly impossible to reduce wrinkles, but the claims are very believable. Will keep using and hope for changes in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can feel this working. I have used overnight repair creams before, but never felt they actually worked. This has a tingly feeling after putting it on and actually feel i the morning that it has sloughed off some skin. I will continue to use and definitely recommend to a friend or two. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"it goes on quickly and smoothly and does not leave residue on my hands. it is easy to apply at bedtime when I am tired. Thanks for the sample which arrived quickly at my front door. The container is easy to handle, store, and the product comes out nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a light weight moisturizer. It glides on the skin and absorbs quickly. There is little to no scent which is good. I am noticing an improvement in my skin tone and texture since I started using it. The Neutrogena brand is one that I have used in the past with good results. I would recommend this product to be included in with your skincare regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am surprised by the effectiveness of Neutogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Moisturizer. The product goes on easily with no stinging or burning sensations and only a small amount is needed to cover the entire face and neck. I noticed my entire face looked smoother and healthier the next day after only one application. In my opinion, my complexion glowed after using this product. I plan to make this part of my nightly routine from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this product three days ago and have yet to see any difference in my heavy wrinkles, or even the light ones around my eyes, for that matter. I tried using the product twice a day, but it left my skin feeling greasy and heavy. I do feel like my skin has gotten ""thicker"" and it's not nearly as dry as it previously had been, so texture has definitely improved. I'm going to continue using it just to see if it ever does anything for the wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I have reached the ripe old age of 50. I now worry more about wrinkles and saggy skin. Neutrogena shows up to my rescue. I love how it makes my skin feel and also that it works while I'm sleeping. Perfect for women of all ages! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very good product, my fine lines are apparently faded a lot, and my skin;s over all texture is smoother. I am definitely going to continue using this product. I can't wait to see what happens in the long term [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It doesn't moisturizes, but dries and exfoliates. It should be directly called skin exfoliating cream. The name ""Rapid wrinkle repair moisturizer"" is totally wrong and misleading. I've applied it few times in my mouth and side of my nose area. When i applied it my skin itched, burned and turned red. Every time i used it, in the next morning of appliance, my skin becomes unusually dry. I never experienced such a terrible dry, itching and rough skin on my face in my life. Also I've never had any kind of allergy before."
I bought the night moisturizer to pair with the serum and day moisturizer and absolutely love it. What I like the most is that your skin feels totally healthy as soon as you put it on. I've been only using this for a week so I can't say how much it is accelerating the fine line removal process as of date but so far so good. I'm already using the serum that works wonders so I'm sure this will only maximize reducing fine lines and wrinkles.
This is a great product for the price and the amount of product for the price is great too !
this product moisturizes and leaves skin visibly smoother and more youthful!
"I really loved the way the product felt on my skin, it also smells wonderful. I saw a difference in my skin's feel, it seems more elastic & brighter."
I am just surprise how did work on my skin so perfect! and not expensive price. I will recommend to for everyone mature skin who has rinkle.
"I am in love with this product already. I can't believe this is MY skin! Brighter, smoother, younger looking and its only day 3."
Hate the smell. It's overpowering and offensive for a company who prides themselves on natural skin care products. Make a fragrance free product for those who prefer to wear their own cologne or perfume.
Will not want to go without the Neutragena product(s) for anti-aging. Don't mind the tingling as that's how i know its working. Lines/wrinkles around my mouth & forehead are less noticeable.
"Very disappointed - have seen no change. I am older and have had a face lift in the past, but some wrinkling around the mouth and neck are a concern. Thought this would help."
"I couldn't believe the results in just one week! I was so impressed that I rushed out and purchased the day cream (SPF 30, no less) and the eye cream. I never imagined I could get results like this at such a reasonable price point. THANK YOU!!"
"I used this product for a few weeks and noted my skin was smoother. It took a few days to get used to the ""tingle"" and redness but it went away quickly."
Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle repair has help my skin tremendously. After one week of use I noticed a reduction in my wrinkles. This is a fantastic product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Hard to believe this worked so well and quickly. The lines between my brows and nose to mouth has softened and my skin is brighter. Gave me makeup optional skin. Definitely recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am quite impressed with this product. Night moisturizers that I have used in the past tend to leave a distinct greasy or oily feel no matter how little I use. This is definitely a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far it seems great. I like how it feels when I apply it to my face. I just received it though. The shipping was slow so I don't know yet what the results will be but so far so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin. It absorbs quickly into the skin and keeps me hydrated throughout the night. I haven't seen a change in my wrinkles yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how lightweight this moisturizer is and how well it absorbs into my skin. It doesn't clog my pores or make me breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

like results noticeable right away////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been really impressed by the effect this product has on the area below my eyes. It really works and begins working very quickly. I'm sure you can buy other great products, but this one costs a lot less."
I was surprised how well this worked. It worked so well my mother asked me if I had Botox! I really like how it improved the appearance of my forehead!
I didn't get a chane to see if it works. I used it one time and the fragrance was so strong it gave me a headach so I returned it. I'm suprised Neutrogena adds fragrance to this. I have used Neutrogena products for years because of their fragrance free products and have been very satisfied with them.
Just bought this today. Put on before bed and tried as hard as I could to get past the terrible perfume smell but only lasted 30 minutes. I could not wait to wash it off my face and that terrible smell is still stuck in my nose. Very disappointed in Neutragena. Never thought it would contain scent.
"I love Neutrogena products, maybe it's the retinol but this is a moisture cream, right? It unfortunately doesn't moisturize my face but caused it to become dry.. zany one else have this priblem? I've read similar online reviews elsewhere but didn't believe it so purchased it last week. I use tge daily oil free formula no problem. ."
"Like so many others, I had to give this a try due to the claims on the packaging. I tried the full product line for 2 months, absolutely NO results. Much like when a shoe breaks in, once those creases are in the material they're there for good. Same thing with your face. Don't bother with any of these products. Waste of money."
i have been using this for 5 weeks and ive had no change love to get my money back!!!
"A very nice cream, a little goes a long way. I really like the pump-top, fast and easy."
This product makes my skin very dry. Not worth the money.I bought this since it is from Neutrogena and expected it to be a good product
I have only been using the Rapid Repair Serium for one month ---- I see no results !!!!!!! Will try it on my feet as the other review suggested.
Applied nightly and immediately enjoyed the hydration. I'm late 40's and appreciate hope at fighting wrinkles.
"Tried it, used up the whole bottle, it's not as strong as my prescription retinol but feels pretty good on the skin and less irritation as well."
"The sample I got I used right away. Felt great and looked good on skin, do not have wrinkles but would still use this product."
I could tell a little bit of a difference but not an extreme amount. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"great product, reduces wrinkles and smoothes skin. I would definitely recommend this product, it's amazing!"
It was a great experience to also be able to get this companion product from the manufacturer at a reasonable cost. Brava!
I've been using this product nightly for about over a week now. It claimed to work in a week but I'm seeing results very slowly. I'm sure it'll work.
I wanted to try but what a mistake unless this is normal. I have pimples from use. - what gives? I have used for about 2 weeks and it is getting no better.
"My skin was smoother within one week. By the end of the 3rd week my forehead lines disappeared!!! I don't even have a trace,slight line left. I have always taken care of my skin but this product made a tremendous difference."
what a waste of my $$$$ this has not done one thing for me.
"I've been using this product for years, it's the only thing that actually works for me!"
"It goes on smooth and my skin soaks it up, not greasy. I see results in 5 days!"
I liked how it tightened the skin and closed the pores.
Makes my face soft and seems to be working on wrinkle repair
Cream really helps skin look and feel smoother.
"If you're sensitive to smells, this isn't for you. It's got a horribly strong scent."
price is right and product is good
I have sensitive skin. This cream smoothed fine wrinkles without causing redness or itchiness.
"Too greasy,my skin takes at least 15 minutes to absorved the product,and I have a dry skin,I dont like how it feels,I do like the container"
Easy to apply non greasy product helps my skin feel plumped underneath and supple reducing appearance of lines.
"not seeing much of a difference, but i like that it has retinol in it!"
I have been using neutrogena for several 3 yrs now.
