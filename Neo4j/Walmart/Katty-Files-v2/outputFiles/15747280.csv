"I've been using this since yesterday, July 11. I like it and nice Sun Protection. I will let you know about it in a week. It's Great for my skin. I've used it before and it really helped my lines on my face."
"I have been using the rapid winkle repair duo for many years. I have tried others, but I keep coming back to them...and the day one has SPF 30...one less thing not to worry about."
"I recently had a facial and the technician (who wanted to sell her own product) asked how old I was an what did I use). When I told her, she gave up her sales pitch since my skin is remarkable for a 71-year old. I like the daytime moisturizer because it has a 30 SPF and living in FL that's a necessity. The evening moisturizer provides the perfect amount of protection so I don't wake up feeling greasy."
"Rapid Wrinkle Repair and all of the Neutrogena products I have used do exactly what they say they will. I am so impressed with the results and the value. I would also like to add a review on the Neutrogena Color Stick for lips I purchased, As an older woman, lipstick tends to ""bleed"". The color stick does not. You really should mention that so women my age will see there is a solution to this problem."
"both night and day creams make my skin feel really soft, I love them! feels good in the humid air/conditioned air combo of Miami."
"When buying online, don't bother with the extra charge for quicker shipping, you products will only arrive in 4 days anyway."
"This is by far the best moisturizer I've used in years. I like that it has the SPF 30 protection and makes my skin feel soft and hydrated for the entire day. My fine wrinkles have diminished which makes me happy. I have purchased moisturizers in the past which cost 3 times as much as this product, but for me, they were no better than this moisturizer. I highly recommend it."
I have been using Rapid Wrinkle Repair as directed in the morning and evening. Haven't seen any changes in my skin yet. Might be too early to tell. Have been using for about 3 weeks. Scent is nice and feels good on my skin. Was just hoping for noticeable improvement quickly.
"I don't know from the other reviews I got the impression lines would be minimized and I don't see that at all. Don't see a change in the tone or texture of my skin, maybe its too soon? I have been using a week, will trying for another 2 weeks and make a decision if I will continue."
"I love it,i love it,i wear every day,and arrived very soon,"
I'm very happy with this product. It does what it says it will do for your skin..I will continue to buy this product. I t lasts about a month or a little longer. I recomend it to my friends.
This product is amazing; calms skin and moisturizes and goes on like silk. I ordered another bottle to carry in my purse for mid- day mosture. This product is exactly what I need !
One of the main reasons I bought this moisturizer is the SPF 30. I am 69
years old and don't have that many wrinkles yet but thought a moisturizer with that protection would be helpful.
"I've been using this daily for two weeks. I have dry skin which goes to very oily by end of day, so most moisturizers are too much, but this one is perfect. Still no change in wrinkles that I've noticed, but holding out hope."
Started using this for the first time about 2-3 weeks ago. Put it on after washing my face in the morning before going on my walk. Seems to moisturize we'll during my walk.
I have seen a real difference in my skin - that includes my skin tone (because of SPF 30). This stuff improves lines you currently have then helps to prevent new lines. Doesn't get better.
This is a great product for day time use has SPF Sunscreen 30 helps to moisturze drys dry skin an helping in skin wrinkle repair . Price is good for the product and I would recommend this item for daytime gentle use.
I've used this before and it is great. Makes my face and neck feel soft and is indeed lessening the appearance of wrinkles. Most excellent product.
This product really works to minimize wrinkles on face as advertised! I've used this brand for at least one year and see good results.
This is a great daytime moisturizer that lightweight and not greasy. The additional benefit of SPF30 only adds to the product's benefits.
I've used this cream for the past year and have noticed an improvement in my skin tone. My skin is also very soft.
I love this product.
I was spending twice as.much on department store products and it never gave me the results that this has.
"Have only been a user for three days, but my skin feels so much better...no more tight, pulling feeling."
"I did buy these products from Neutrogena for years, so I understand what my skin works. Thanks a lot"
I have used this about a month now and it has done wonders for my skin. It makes my skin look hydrated and fresh in the am. Its a great product!!
"The only down fall to this moisturizer would be that is has a strong scent. Not a bad scent, but for those of us who are sensitive to smells, I would prefer they make an unscented version as well."
I used this product a few years ago and decided to try something new. Wrong idea. Night creme is much better from Neutregena. Leave my skin soft. Absorbs quickly and in less than a week small wrinkles around my eyes are fading.
The best wrinkle repair on the market!
Very happy with the results and goes on easily smells good and is non greasy
All Neutrogena skin care is excellent! I see results the next morning in the texture of my skin.
Whoever thinks this can improve wrinkles in a week must have younger wrinkles than me.
no results wrinkles look the same! Too much for this!
Neutrogena products are clean and always leave my skin feeling smooth and nourished.
Nice product. easy to apply
I have recently started using this product and I have to say that my face feels smoother.
"Wonderful face cream, I love Neutrogena products !!"
My skin feels smoother and looks lighter since I use this
I love all of the Neutrogena face products. They work very well and aren't too heavy. I can really tell a difference in my fine lines and it has helped with some of my dark spots.
"On second bottle. Has made remarkable improvement in radiance, uneven complexion, and glow to skin. 46 year old African American with oily, acne prone skin. I won't be without this product and I've been so impressed that I'm taking a look at all neutrogena recommended products."
I don't know - I'm still waiting for my order that I placed online Nov 23.
Did not work for me smells good skin soft and wrinkle still on my face.
Working every night.
Great product for money; will buy again.
Great product and the SPF does not bother your eyes. Recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I purchased this item and it burned my skin and swelled up my face in a matter of minutes after applying, I ended up in the emergency room. Now I have huge medical expenses due to this so called Rapid wrinkle repair moisturizer."
I love this product - I have used it along withe the Night moisturizer for over a year; together they help with the fine lines I have. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Neutrogena for many years. It has kept my face very supple and I show few wrinkles. People are surprised when I tell them my age. I use it twice a day. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product would be great for those with dry skin, not for me. I used it under my makeup and 1 hour after my face looked oily and shinning. Do not recommend this product to people with combined skin."
I would not recommend this to anyone. Does nothing for lines and wrinkles as Promised in TV ads and other advertisements. Do not waste money on this product.
I bought this product as a Rapid Wrinkle Repair as stated on the product packing as well as on line. I followed directions as it stated but after the first bottle there was no improvement. I purchased my second bottle and proceeded as I did before with the first bottle. I wanted a before
I can tell a big difference in my skin since I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer. It helps with my laugh lines and gives my skin a soft glow.
"This stuff is awesome. I use it daily after cleansing with Rapid Wrinkle Repair Cleanser and OMG! My skin is absolutely radiant! I get so many compliments on my ""natural glow"". I love it. Thanks Neutrogena!"
Love this product
Excellent product
I love this product. I have been using it for a while and saw a difference within a week. It is the only product that does not make me break out. My friends compliment me on how good my skin looks and I tell them it is because of the Neutrogena. I live in South Florida so the SPF is a bonus. It works and I can't live without it.
I've been using Neutrogena's Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer for over a year and find that it moisturizes my oily skin without feeling greasy or heavy. I'm almost 70 and feel ithis product has definitely helped reduce my wrinkles and prevent new ones from developing. I also like that it's SPF 30 and that the pump makes it easy to apply. I've used creams in a jar which are messy and don't seem to stay as fresh as pump products. I would highly recommend this and other Neutrogena products.
I've been using this moisturizer for almost 3 yrs. I'm 59 and people think I'm in my 40's. I use this along with the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum and Eye Cream. I wouldn't switch at all. I occasionally use the Night Cream and Tone Repair.
Very pleased with this product. Hides fine lines and wrinkles. Smooths on the face easily.
"The first few uses it will make your skin feel hot and a little itchy, but for me that settled down after just a few days. It does seem to make my skin tone a bit more even, and the fine lines around my eyes seem a bit better. Mostly it's a way to use my vanity to get myself to wear sunscreen every day."
"I just bought the Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair and on the 3rd day of using it my skiing start burning especially under my eyes, I noticed my face was fleeky I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen or if it was and allergic reaccion I was very disappointed ☹️"
"I have used this and it works for fine wrinkles, especially around the eyes and lips. I used every night and I had no adverse reaction. It was safe to use and has a pleasant smell. The cost was easily affordable for any budget. The great thing is that"
you don't need to buy another Wrinkle Repair lotion. This is all you need.
"I am 42 years old, just started using this product in the last 6 months and saw results in the deep lines of my forehead. My skin tends to be on the oily side with an occasional breakout (one huge ugly zit), but since using this product my skin literally glows. When my co-workers started to notice the difference I knew I would never stop using this product. I only wish I could post my before/after pics as proof."
"Like so many others, I had to give this a try due to the claims on the packaging. I tried the full product line for 2 months, absolutely NO results. Much like when a shoe breaks in, once those creases are in the material they're there for good. Same thing with your face. Don't bother with any of these products. Waste of money."
"Why do you put fragrance in a product that I put on my face?! I love the way this product goes on, feels and works but I am considering not using it because of the smell. It's so strong that once I put it on I feel like I'm surrounded by a fog of perfume. My husband even asked me what I was using because the smell was overpowering. It's really a shame because I love Neutrogena products."
"Was using Rapid Wrinkle Repair, SPF 15, despite the strong odor. They no longer make it, so tried the new version, SPF 30. The pungent odor is even worse! I gave the product away. What a shame that a product with such good skin results is basically not usable (by me, anyway). Another reviewer said it's too""floral."" I don't find the smell at all floral; it's synthetic and pungent."
"Noticed softening of fine lines in two days. By the end of the week the deeper lines that went from corner of eyes to temples are completely gone. Lines around lips from years of smoking, gone in two weeks. On the third week and some one mistook me for 30, 20 years less then my age of 50. This product is great. The only way to make it better is to make it unscented. The smell is VERY floral and perfume like, very odd coming from Neutrogena."
"I've used this product as well as the night moisturizer for about a month. Yes, the wrinkles and fine lines seem less noticeable. But, the big difference is in the overall condition of my skin. The tone is much improved, pores are smaller, breakouts clear up quickly, and the surface is much smoother. Age spots are also fading. I'm 59 and my skin looks better than it has in years. It has SPF30, but still avoid the sun when using this product."
Deep Wrinkles appeared and bags under eyes in addition to redness and burning. Stop using the product after 2 days. I could not wear any eye make up for a week. Skin did seem to be somewhat improved after a week. I have used other Neutrogena products without any problems.
"I really wish I could use the bottle I purchase and see if it works but the scent is so heavy my allergies go crazy and get headaches from it. Neutrogena has great products but why add unnecessary scents to so many products? Make more of them UNSCENTED, please."
"Really like the product even cleared up some of the redness on my face and smooth skin for sure I'm 36 years old and my only complaint is there is not enough in the bottle,it is glass and it burns if you get in your eyes...but I really like what it does to my skin ."
"I've been using Neutrogena products for years and have been very satisfied with their moisturizers. When I decided to try this new product, I had little doubt that I would like this, also. I can't fairly review the effectiveness as I've only used it for about a week, but am very disappointed in the smell!.....way too floral....kind of like a cheap drugstore smell. Definitely not the typical fragrance-free Neutrogena products that I've used. My advice.......lose the perfume smell!"
I have used this product for about a month and have seen a noticable improvement in the lines around my mouth. I'm in my early 50's and have tried WAY more expensive products and not gotten the results that I have with this creme. I have a history of skin cancer and wanted to try a less expensive moisturizer with a high SPF for my face. This seals the deal for me! My face looks better -along with my neck- and the lines that were beginning to form are much less noticable. I will definitely repurchase!
"Used this product for a week and woke up to sensitive redness around my eyes, like a sunburn. My lips were also sore, again like a sunburn. Took days for it to go back to normal. It may work great for some people, but I'm sensitive to the retinol, I guess. BE CAREFUL! I'm not sure if Neutrogena recommends putting it on your EYELIDS, but being that's the most sensitive part of your face, you may want to avoid that area until you're sure you wont have a reaction."
"I love this because its nice to my face. Anti-aging products can be harsh to the skin sometimes, especially sensitive skin, which is what I have. But this product loves the skin, making it soft and smooth immediately. I have only used it for a short time and I am seeing and feeling a difference in my skin. Yay!!! Neutrogena has done it right!!!"
"I used this product first time and in just 10 days I noticed better skin tone, pores getting smaller , wrinkle reduction and the peeling ( mildly visible) did a good job. But I also noticed my skin a bit more sensitive than before (because of peeling) so started using it alternate days and felt better. I am not sure if I can continue to use it as long as I want or limit the use. Please let me know if you do."
"I have been using both the day and night Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizers and I'm totally impressed! Although I've only been using both products less than one week, the difference is amazing! I am thrilled and will be purchasing the eye product next. At my age, I have tried many OTC products and have been less than satisfied. This time, it is totally different. I'm a firm believer in this Neutrogena line! Thank you!!!"
I used it for only a few days at night. Woke up with the skin under my eyes very swollen and it hurt to touch it. My lids were swollen as if they had fluid in them. It's been 4 days since I used it and they're a little better but very dry. Now I have very wrinkled skin that wasn't wrinkled before. I normally love Neutrogena but there must be something in it that I'm allergic to.
"I'm 60 with plenty of past experiece trying ""eye creams"", so of course I had to try this one. I used it faithfully twice a day for one full week with remarkable improvement. Eye wrinkles are MUCH less noticeable, two small ""freckles"" are almost gone, and a 2-mo-old sub-skin irritation in the 'fat pad' under my right eye completely healed after only a week. I really do believe Neutrogena's claim that 100% of women saw improvement after using this product. I highly recommend it."
"I have been using this for about a week. I do not care for the smell, and I think I might have a sensitivity to it, as it makes my skin a little red at first and a little warm. I have developed 3 blemishes since using. It does seem to moisturize pretty well. My skin is normally sensitive, but other Neutrogena products have worked well for me."
"I bought this a few weeks ago and am very impressed. I never believe all the hype and advertising of this type of product, and I only had hoped for some moisturizing, but I noticed after only 1 week that there was a big change in my skin, both in the texture (felt so much smoother) and in most of the fine lines. On top of that, it's not greasy, and the SPF30 has been great protection for the very strong sun my face has been exposed to. Very happy I found this!"
"The Product is pricey for the small amount you get. When you put it on, it leaves a white residue on your face that makes it impossible to put make up on over it smoothly. The White residue peels off your face if you touch it and you can always see it in the mirror, looks like peeling skin or something."
"I'm looking for a product to keep me from getting more wrinkles (I'm in my 30's). I've tried a number of things, but find that this product seems to help reduce the obviousness of lines and especially I think it has helped my forehead wrinkles. Its a little expensive, but compared to the fancy department store products, I think this cream holds up really well, and I""ll continue to use it. When my first bottle ran out, and I used another product, I noticed the difference, so now I""m ordering it regularly."
"Not only does this product live up to its label, my skin has also never been this clear. My pores look smaller, my skin is smoother, and there's no greasy residue. I have had some minor redness and flaking, but no major irritation, and so far, 2 weeks in, I'm so glad I've made this purchase. Not only would I theoretically recommend this to a friend, but I already did--and it was recommended to me, so the word of mouth is getting around. And no, I didn't get anything in exchange for this review--it is simply that good."
"I just finished up my container of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair that I received to test and am definitely headed out to pick up more. I noticed an improvement in my overall skin tone, texture, and a slight reduction in fine lines with continued use."
"I also liked how soft and smooth my skin felt using this, and it seemed to literally melt into my skin with no greasy or heavy feeling. The SPF 30 was a definite plus as well. I would definitely recommend this product."
"Cons: This new packaging is heavy, as it's glass it's fragile if it falls- not difficult to happen- and leaves lots of the product inside that can't be used! The perfume is bad ( smells like my grandma did) and the taste ( around my mouth) is not good at all. Pros: The product absorbs fast."
"I love the way the moisturizer absorbs into my skin. It is light and refreshing. My skin no longer feels dry and is very smooth. Of course, it will take a little more time to tell if it reduces wrinkles; however, it is so much better than anything else I have ever tried that I want to keep on using it."
"I bought this to compliment the RWR night. I have used this for 3 days. I've seen a major reduction in fine lines around my neck, and my forehead lines are almost completely invisible. This is an incredible product. It beats high priced creams hands down. It took me a while to find it. I hope they aren't trying to discontinue it."
"I purchased the Rapid wrinkle repair with SPF 30, the night moisturizer and the eye cream. I had to stop after 3 days of non stop burning and redness around my eyes. Three days later the redness is starting to fade but it still burns some when I put on different moisturizer. My Skin Around my eyes looks worse then before I started using these products. I have never had senitive skin before. Very disappointed."
"I have always used the Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle (which is fragrance free) but wanted to try this one. I could not get past the fragrance, that is all I smelt all day long. I wish you would make all your facial products fragrance free. Back to the Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle for me."
"If you are prone or have sensitive skin, be mindful, as this product has accelerated retinal. I am sensitive under my eyes, so I avoid this area; however, apply in the crinkly areas of my forehead and neck and upper chest. I use this daily and have seen"
"the difference; however, it did take a little more than a week. Neutrogena is a favorite family brand."
"I have been using this product for two weeks now and it does exactly what it says it will do.I had deep lines between my eyebrows and they have improved about 80 percent in just two short weeks. .Did they go away completely? NO......., BUT they area lot less noticable."
I definitely would recommend this product. I just bought the rapid eye serum so I hope that I'm just as happy!
"When I started using Neutrogena Rapid Repair 4 weeks ago, my skin was so dry it was flaking, which also made my wrinkles more prominent. Today, although not totally wrinkle-free, my skin is softer to the touch...and no more flaking! I love these products!!!"
This is an awesome product with SPF that in other product lines had made my skin breakout. Not one breakout with this one! I am using the whole Rapid Wrinkle Repair line and my skin is so smooth and I don't have that greasy feeling either. Soft and supple.
"After using the product for about 5 days I noticed burning around the corner of my eyes by the end of the day I had a rash, it itched and burned badly. I hate that I cannot return this product I was so looking forward to seeing some results like other people had seen. :("
"I have used this product for over 2 weeks and have noticed any change at all. If you are going to make a product and guarantee it work in a week, then the product better work. I have tried other products and they don't work either. I am really disappointed in this product. I thought I found something that would work and that is affordable but I didn't. All products are just to get your money and no results."
"Neutrogena has been my go-to skincare line since I was a teenager. I'm now in my 50's, and it is still a reliable brand."
"I like the results I'm seeing with Rapid Wrinkle Repair SPF 30, but the fragrance added to this lotion is awful. It has a distinct “old lady smell”, instead of the fresh, clean scent your other products have (such as the Neutrogena Wrinkle Repair SPF 20 in the tube). Please, Neutrogena, change the fragrance. Thanks. —Lisa"
"I tried this a while ago &amp; thought it was alright. Although nothing is a miracle for decreasing wrinkles. This was moisturizing which I think helps to hide wrinkles some. My wrinkles are getting a little deeper now, so this might work better on someone"
"that only has fine lines. I didn't really notice my wrinkles going away any. But I do think it did help plump the skin a little &amp; moisturize well, which helped the wrinkles look a little less prominent for a little while."
"I have used this product for 3 weeks with no real change except my skin felt softer. Its also a bit to greasy for me. I only have a few wrinkles around my lips , they are still the same. Maybe I`ll try another neutrogena product , but right now I vote against it."
"I bought this product and really wanted to like it. However, after a couple of days I started to experience severe burning and sensivity. I thought perhaps I just needed to let my skin get used to it, but after about three weeks I just had to stop use as my skin was not adjusting and continued to burn."
"I tried Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisture and was pleasantly surprised at the light feel it had going on. It absorbed quickly. As for repair? Well, I have very deep wrinkles and doubt whether any product but botox makes a visble difference. Maybe"
this made a slight difference under foundation? But in my mind it made a tiny bit and I was protecting my skin with SPF 30 so worth it!
"I do not have sesitive skin at all or have any skin issues/problems, i have great skin,. althogh using this just one time/first time caused my face to immediately burn and was painful! i have never has any of sort experience as i did using this product. Would have been nice to be able to use :("
"I have only used this for one week, too soon to notice any wrinkle reduction. What I have noticed, however, is how soft my face has been and I haven't experienced any redness or irritation. I will definitely keep using it for fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My small eye wrinkles seem to have almost diminished as well as a large forehead wrinkle. In addition, the SPF 30 is an added bonus because I could use in the day and my skin will be protected from the sun. I think the smell is subtle and a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer was soothing and cooling, light and non-greasy. After one week of using the product my skin was noticeably brighter and smoother. I highly recommend this product as a daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just bought this to pair up with the wrinkle repair serum and I don't know how I was living without it. My face is brighter and feels supple to the touch. The SPF 30 is high enough for me to be comfortable about avoiding sun damaged skin which makes this a plus.
I think this is a fabulous product and I wear it almost every day and have for years. I really do not have those deep face wrinkles around my eyes and sides of face that most of my 70 year old friends have. It must work! I'm not going to stop using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Haven't recieved it yet!! Who should I contact?? Thanks.
"So far, I am happy with these products.You have to use a small amount. The products are strong."
By reading the reviews I thought it would work did nothing for me back to my go to creams
"noticed a difference on neck/face when used with facial lift cream, not alone"
"The product is good see results after the use of the first bottle, so I ordered more I like it for moisturizer."
I have been using this product for at least 5 years. I look for the best price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product and have seen remarkable difference. Seriously visible results in 1 week so I suggest you must must must try this product. I am not a big fan of the smell of this product.. something they should work on.
This product it works!!!! i used so many kind. paid so much money but none of them works!! i used this product almost 2 weeks now and wrinkle line is gone!!! I can't believe it!
I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and have great results. My skin has a much smoother appearance with fine lines gone. I've used several products and this is the best results so far.
I was pleasantly surprised at how fast this product worked I saw results in 24 hours. What I noticed the most was the reduction of sagging skin on the neck area.
I Was very surprised when a friend gave me this product to try. It reall did show great improvement the first week of use. Imagine my pleasant surprise after 4 weeks of use. You just cant go wrong with Rapid Wrinkle Repair.
I can't believe how quickly I am getting results. The wrinkles are just disappearing! I'm talking about the deep wrinkles in between my eyebrows and around my mouth! Amazing! I will be buying more of this stuff and recommending it to my friends.
"I have been using the daytime, nighttime, and eye cream in this line for a long time. I love it, but there is not enough in the bottle, and I would like to see how much is left in the bottle. I can never tell when I am about to run out."
I had wrinkles underneath my eyes and crows feet. Within a few weeks I saw visible results. Even my friends said I looked younger. So happy I didn't have to wait months to see results.
I have used this night lotion for over five years and can't stand to be without a new bottle waiting in my supply drawer. My face feels renewed in the morning.
Ideally this would be fragrance free. I have sensitive skin so I am taking a gamble with any product having active ingredients. Disappointed I didn't notice the fragrance factor. The smell is chemical.
"I used this the evening I recevied it, I was really pleased to see a noticeable difference the next morning. Still using daily and my skin tone and wrinkles are less noticeable. Plus my skin feels better overall. Love this product!"
"I like the clean scent, but other than that I have seen no benefit after two weeks. Neutrogena Clinical is a much better product for me and I will go back to it as soon as I can get back to the store. This was a disappointment."
"I've used this product for just over a week, as for the wrinkle repair I haven't noticed any results. However the moisturizer feels great and I love the SPF!"
I saw and felt a difference immediately! I also love the fact that it's not greasy and I don't feel like I have to wash my face in the middle of the day! Thank you neutrogena
"I am extremely impressed with this product. Have been using for a month, and the improvement is very noticeable. Also...appreciate the fact that I don't have to take out a second mortgage on the house to buy it! Thanks!"
"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and see no difference what so ever. I am 55, with wrinkles around the mouth and eyes. Another waste of money."
I am 17 and I recently stopped wearing make up on my skin so I was in search for a moisturizer/SPF/skin improver and this is just what I needed! No flakes and I have very sensitive skin! Love it
"This is by far the best product I have ever used on my skin. I've tried expensive creams, but this made my skin literally glow within a couple of weeks. Amazing!"
"I love the SPF 30 - this product goes on lighltly and leaves a nice matte finish. Best of all, I can use under my eyes and my mascara stays put. I have used this along with the night time formula for one week and I am definetely impressed !"
"after trying this lotion for the first time yesterday i felt the difference by the end of the day because my face was not oily, and it looked bright! even my sister complimented on my skin = )i will continue to use it and will update in a week."
I started using it a week or so ago and now I have a break out on my face! It did make my skin soft! What are the side effects of ingredients? Please respond!
"Finally a product that does what it says it will. I'm 71 years old and my skin looks so much better. With these results, I will continue to use this and other products."
Hi..bought this product two days ago and started use it yesterday. I think neutrogena products are GOOD and i trust this one but after two weeks i will come and tell you how my skin is doing...
Cannot Believe How fast this product works!
after just 1st use (a.m.) My skin was Transformed! Seriously.
I'm 4 days In And It's like A Reversal of Damage done.
"I absolutely LOVE Neutrogena R/W/R Moisturizer! I highly recommend it to everyone. It 's nice and light, non-oily, smells good, and smooths out the wrinkles. Please keep carrying it and I will continue to keep purchasing it."
I have been using this under my makeup for years and I love the way it doesn't feel heavy or clog my pores. It is one of very few lotions that does not break my face out drastically.
"I just started using this product and love the feel of my skin. It's been about two weeks and although I'd been using a different moister cream, I think I've finally found what I've been looking for......"
I was very excited to try this product. I've been using it about 3 weeks and have not noticed any difference whatsoever in my skin and I cannot stand the way it smells. Not a fan and won't buy it again.
"I have used this product for years and love it. I especially love that it includes SPF 30, which has not been included in many other, more expensive face lotions."
Exactly what I ordered [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great facial moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Nu Beauty anti aging serum is a better choice but it seems you can't buy it over the counter..
i love the product it really works but it's too expensive
"Hello,I'm thirt three year old and i have been searching and searching for this product since I saw the commercials just three days ago I finally found it! It was the last one and on sale I was so happy. I have some fine lines on my forhead and figured i'd give it a try. I have never used any other anti wrinkle products before.Its now day three and I love it so far.Makes me feel good and my skin is smooth. So i guess ill see what it looks like after a week."
"After 2 days of use skin started stinging, burning and flaking but after I discontinued and scrubbed peeled skin off, my skin was soooo smooth I couldn't believe it. Unfortunately burning sting persisted for 3-4 more days after discontinuing but if you don't have a reaction definitely the best product out there!"
"I bought this product wanting it to work. After reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try. So many other products I've tried didn't work. I have always had good results from Neutrogena. However, when I put this product on I experienced a burning sensation. My first thought was it must be working and I just have to get used to it for a few days. But after several days of using it my face was burning and was red and shiny like I had been sunburned. I had to discontinue using it."
I LOVE the light texture of this product. It is so light that I can wear it under my makeup and still feel like I am being protected. I feel like my skin looks smoother after using daily for a week. It smells really good as well which is a bonus. I would definitely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although it didn't prove to be a great ""wrinkle repair"" product, I definitely appreciate its capability as a sun screen and moisturizer. Having a school garden and being outside all day, it provided protection from the hot Texas sun much better than I anticipated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried this every morning since I got in for free from the Home Tester Club .I love the consistency and the smell. It is a thicker consistency but it goes on easy and absorbs quickly it doesn't leave a greasy film on your face It has a nice smell so I enjoy pitting it on every morning .it did not break out my skin as my skin is dry and sensitive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was lucky enough to be given Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to try in exchange for my honest review. Well, after using it consistently for 2 weeks I can definitely see an improvement in my skin. It's clear, glowing and my fine lines seem to have blurred. I'm excited to keep using it and see how much more my skin improves! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the consistency this Moisturizer gives. It leaves my skin soft and well Moisturizer without the heaviness of most anti aging Moisturizers. After using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle moisturizer w Broad Spectrum SPF 30 for only 2 weeks my fines have diminished and my skin looks great! I definitely recommend this Moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin. Most things I put on my face ends up dying it out even though they are supposed to moisturize it. I also have skin that breaks out easily. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this moisturizer was lite when applied with a fresh sent. Usually items are heavy and oily. This product is great. Lite, a fresh fragrance and there is no side effects for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really love the combination of wrinkle repair, sunscreen and moisturizer all in one product! I am out on a boat fishing and the sun exposure is very extreme. This cream protects me from the sun exposure while keeping my skin nice and moisturized. I reapply every two to three hours to protect my face from sun exposure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this moisturizer because it has many benefits. It goes on smooth and creamy. It makes my skin feel so soft, which allows my makeup to go on smoother. I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but I have noticed a change in my overall skin appearance. I will continue to use it as I feel it is a high quality product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Neurogena Rapid Wrinkle repair showed overall improvement with the fine lines on my forehead and lip area of my face. This product smells wonderful! I had some dry patches of skin around my nose and after a week it is very smooth.
Some area of my face have deep wrinkles and this moisturizer did improve the appearance of these deep wrinkles in just one week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was an amazing moisturizer, and my fine lines seemed to fade a little bit in just the small amount of time that I have been using this product(about2weeks). I also like the scent of this product and that it has 30spf. I would and will be purchasing this product after I finish using up the sample I received. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am turning 60 next year and have tried every moisturizer and wrinkle reducer on the market from inexpensive off brand to expensive name brands. I was very skeptical about this too....but....I must truly say that I see actual improvements to my face and wrinkles. I swear I look more youthful in just the several days I've used it. Thank you so very much Neutrogena. You won't regret trying it yourself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I purchased both the Rapid Wrinkle Repair night and day cream. I used only the night cream even under makeup at first until it was all gone. There was a big improvement in wrinkles. They had faded and were barely there. Then I ran out and used the day cream. Totally different! All the wrinkles came back. So I would recommend only using the night cream.
"I bought both day and night Rapid wrinkle repair and have been using religiously. I have been noticing my skin is peeling off at the nose, forehead, brow area and some around my chin. This has never happened before when I was using different product. I don't know what could be the problem."
My friends asked if I had a face-lift. This product is great and a lot less expensive than a face-lift and painless!
This product does exactly what it promises. My skin looks and feels great! I use the serum everyday and I am amazed at the result!
JUST STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO. CAN SEE AN IMPROVEMENT ALREADY. ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT !!
I love this product. It makes me skin so soft and is light. I have sensitive skin and this product did not bother it at all.
"Love this product! Seriously, I keep telling everyone it is amazing! Everyone should have this product! Thanks Neutrogena!!!"
I have used your product consistantly over the last few years. I am totaly satisfied with its results and its value.
I noticed when I used the product on wrinkles on my arms became faint pleasantly surprise when used the first time.
This is a great daily moisturer that does so much more. I have noticeable improvement in deep wrinkles and fine lines in just 2 weeks.
"I have used this product for years.It feels good on the skin,...nice and moist. I think it does help with the fine line problem."
I have used this product for weeks. It has not taken care of the fine lines and wrinkles. It made my skin oily. The n I started to breakout and itch.
"My fav cream for every day. I get tempted and lured away to another cream, and I always regret it and come back. There really is a difference."
The moisturizer is great . started using it a mouth a ago and i can feel the difference .wow Loving it !!!
It was a great experience to be able to get this product from the manufacturer at a reasonable cost. Brava!
"Shouldn't make it sound like it's an aging agent when it's more like a sunscreen, which it's nothing that I need."
Excellent product. Feels great on my skin. Helps smooth out my fine lines.
"Smooth even coverage , long lasting , I saw amazing results within 2 weeks. Definitely will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Went on smoothly, saw a difference in my wrinkles. It's lightweight and no offensive odor. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to lessen the appearance of wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Provides lightweight coverage with spf protection. Absorbs quickly and smell is pleasant. Definitely worth the cost and one product i would recommend and will buy again for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using this facial moisturizer with sunscreen for several years. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and I don't need to use 2 separate products. I was most pleased when my dermatologist said Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Lotion with SPF 30 was one of the best on the market.
"This goes on smoothly and has a nice texture. I didn't notice a difference with my fine lines and wrinkles, but I felt it gave me good sun proctection wheN I went outside in the intense florida sun. My face did feel firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While Neutrogena is a brand name that I've trusted in the past, I try to use products with more natural & organic ingredients. This provided moisturizing SPF coverage. The wrinkle repair wasn't observed during my use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair. The smell isn't too overpowering and it doesn't make my skin feel oily like other products do. I felt like my ""crow's feet"" were less visible and some of my fine lines weren't as apparent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer ! Within days there was a definite difference. It was easy to use and I will use this product now instead of my previous moisturizer. I was pleased with the fact that it provided sun protection while moisturizing. It has no smell that you would have to worry about competing with your perfume and mildly erased my fine lines in my eye area and smile areas. Definitely a good buy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing I noticed is that it has a very nice smell to it. It absorbs well on my face without leaving it feeling oily. I've used it for a week so far and have used just a bit extra around the eyes. I've only noticed a minor change there, but minor is better than none so with longer use, I expect the crows feet to diminish just a bit more. I haven't used any other sunscreen with it and have not had any problems in the sun. Overall, I like the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way it feels on the skin, it is not oily. The pump bottle is convienant and easy to use."
I also love that it is not smelly. I don't like too much fragrance in facial products. I have been using it twice a day for the past 8 days and I notice my face is softer and feels nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product absorbs nicely, so from a SPF aspect I find it to be a good choice especially under makeup. The product on my skin was not very moisturizing though. I also did not notice a difference in my wrinkles. I would use this product in combination with others. Perhaps, the wrinkle repair is more apparent over time. The product does smell somewhat like ""sunscreen"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As far as sunscreen coverage, this is a great product. I have spent plenty of time in the sun with this product and have had great protection. The down sides are that I saw no wrinkle improvement at all during my little over a week trial. This product also made me break out and I am a person that never has that problem with my skin. Overall, I don't think I would recommend this product unless you are looking for a decent sun Carr product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisturizer applies smoothly and evenly. There is no strong smell with this product, which makes it even easier to use. I have noticed a slight improvement in the texture of my facial skin since beginning using it and will continue to use it and watch for further improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a really nice product. I like the way that it smells. It makes my skin feel soft and fresh. I have noticed a difference in the fine lines on my skin. I have always like Neutrogena products. They are reasonably priced and a good quality. I am glad that I was able to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for over a week now. Although, I have not seen results yet I still like the product. The product absorbs quickly into my skin without making my face feel greasy. The product is light enough that it does not feel heavy once applied. The pump bottle allows me to get the amount of product I need without waste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 because it makes my skin feel so soft and supple. In just a few days of using it I felt that my skin is more supple and my fine lines have slowly disappeared. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The most surprising part of this moisturizer is the container - it's metal! What's inside is really what counts, though. I wore this Neutrogena moisturizer while on a tubing trip, and the SPF 30 worked great. The moisturizer isn't too thick, like others with SPF can be, and didn't leave my face feeling greasy. Will definitely wear this anytime I'm going to be in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The coverage feels great - it leaves a silky, smooth texture on the skin that is particularly rare with sunscreens. I don't have a ton of wrinkles but I feel like I can see a bit of a reduction in some fine lines. I would definitely recommend this product as an excellent choice for skin improvement and protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The lotion applies easily and a little goes a long way. It has a pleasant scent, not over powering. I've been using the Moisture Repair less than a week but I can already notice my skin seems more supple. I've been applying under my foundation and my skin just seems smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can see a change in the fine wrinkles in my face! I love the fact it has sunscreen in it and I can't wait to keep using it in the next weeks to see what the appearance of the deeper wrinkles on my face! I do recommend this product and will definitely buy this product. Its as good or better than the hundreds of dollars I spend on more expensive skin care products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love it ,it made my skin feel so smooth its better then i ever tried before . i tried many products before spending alot of money and still was disappointed now that i tried Neutrogena its know going back sticking to this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The creme is light weight with a very light fragrance. No pore clogging or irritation. Neutrogena is a brand I trust and though I have only been using my cream for a short period I am looking forward to continued us and seeing more amazing results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What I love about the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is how well it goes on my face, its lightweight and it absorbs nicely leaving my face feeling soft! It also has a clean fragrance."
I have only used for a couple days; so I'm anxious to see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this stuff! It goes on smooth, totally non greasy feel. My skin feels like it can still breath. It's not an overnight miracle, but after a week I did see tiny differences in my skins appearance. The SPF 30 is a major plus. I've spent most of my life in the sun, you have to have protection now more than ever. The fact that Neutrogena RWR 30 protects and helps skin repair and look better is reason enough to get it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer lives up to it's name. This moisturizer gave my face what it was missing..... Life. My face looks so youthful the dullness is gone, I feel like me again. This moisturizer is great if your looking for something lightweight that gets the job done [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the product pleasant to use. It is creamy and goes on smoothly. My skin feels very nice after putting it on. There is no offensive smell which makes it pleasant to use. As of now, after using the product for a week, I cannot honestly say that I see a reduction in wrinkles. I will continue using the product as my skin does feel smooth and hydrated and hope with continued use, I will see a lessening of wrinkles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using i did notice a slight change in my forehead lines. I also notice the texture of my skin felt smoother. Ive only been using a few days. So i feel certain results will get better and better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After more than a month of using this on my arms, I've developed the same contact dermatitis that I do from many chemical sunscreens. No, it's not the retinol, that's still working wonderfully. I'm just an unlucky one that reacts to sunscreen chemicals. Can't find the ingredient list for this one, but guessing it must be the same ingredient across brands that causes my reaction."
This Product has taken 10 years off of my face & Neck!!!!!!!!
Love Love this my skin feels so great thank you by the way I am 53 years old and look like 43
I've used this product for several years and love that it has sunscreen in it.
This is an excellent product i say it is number one the market
"Easy to use, However, there is no way to tell when the bottle ksempty"
Really like this product. Keeps my skin feeling soft all day. Best I have ever used.
"no greasy, no odor and keep your skin soft and smooth, love it"
I love this product! It works so wonderfully. I would recommend this to everyone.
"Really works!!!! my forehead wrinkle disappeared ,my skin is soft and clear."
"No scaly flakes on your face, perfect under foundation, an all around great product"
feels good on skin and keeps it soft and natural looking. i recommend to anyone.
This is not a bad product but it did dry my skin out very very much.
"Absorbs quickly, not greasy and immediately makes my skin feel and look softer"
I'm not sure about this product yet I only use it twice and had some irritation from it so I stop using it.
I like this stuff but boy my eyes are sensitive when it gets anywhere near them. Can not stop tearing up.
"I got this after tons of research on wrinkle creams. Unfortunately it burns my skin, especially around my eyes. The next day my skin peels. I've tried it a few different times, with the same results."
The day and night cream made my deep crease in between my eyebrows go away. Used this for a few days when I started to notice that my eyelids were swelling. An awful reaction that has taken almost a week to make go away.
Its very easy yo use and apply. Does not leave a greasy appearance on face. It moisturizes skin very well. Packaging is also simple yet attractive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is great. It smells fantastic. It is very smooth and light to the touch. Neutrogenas products have always been one of my favorites. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I loved how the moisturizer did not feel greasy! I have very dry skin and this lotion felt so smooth going on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is a great light moisturizer that absorbs quickly and helps fade wrinkles with regular use. I love that it has SPF 30 in it as I am out in the sun a lot. LIght scent and again is not heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Moisturizer works much better than my existing one, it made my skin very smooth and definitely helped in the disappearance of fine lines from my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the smell of it and it glides on nicely. I like the SPF that it has and it seems to work on the small fine wrinkles around the eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was disappointed. I have used daily for a month now, morning & night & I've seen no results of any kind. I'm 43 with minor wrinkles, mainly fine lines & laugh lines & with use of this repair cream I've seen not even small results. I did have some minor peeling after a mild burn after application. But, I love most Neutrogena products & would still give another product a try if recommended."
I purchased this along with the hydro and the rapid wrinkle serum. I bought this because I did some research and misread the reviews. Since I never used antiaging products before I had no idea What I was doing. I burn very very easy in the sun and I use this in the morning after my serum and hydro. It is great
"I only just started using this cream, so I'm not sure whether it is helping in the fine line and wrinkle department. It does make my skin feel very soft and moisturized without giving me a greasy look and feel. It also has not caused me to break out, which is something I always have to be concerned with. It's pricey for such a small bottle, so I hope it will help with wrinkles."
This stuff really works. It absorbs quickly and doesn't smell. I use this with the nighttime product and you really can see a difference within a week of using it. I've stopped a couple of times just to try other products and quickly jump back to Neutrogena. There is nothing out there I've found that compares to it. I'm 61 years old and everyone thinks I'm around 50.
"I have always used a moisturizer...even in my 20s. Not that I am in my 40s, I find that I look for moisturizers that offer more benefits and protection for my skin. Neutrogena provides a great product that goes on nicely and does not feel heavy. Skin feels great and moisturized. My wrinkles are really fine lines. Protecting my skin from additional skin damage is most important to me. So the real bonus of this product is the Broad Spectrum SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried Neutrogena® Rapid Wrinkle Repair Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 and I am very impressed with the results in my skin.it reduces my fine lines and wrinkles. It is very effective. I like it very much. I recommend this product to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 58 and have used Neutrogena products with confidence for many years. Last week I purchased Rapid Wrinkle Repair, used it for three days and now I wish I had checked the reviews beforehand. I have always had lovely skin and now because of the Rapid Wrinkle Repair I have red, itchy and inflamed patches on my face and neck. It's quite bad. I stopped using this awful product three days ago and I'm still feeling the effects. I am staying inside and using Aquaphor to try and calm my skin. Do not use this product!!"
I love it. After trying it for about 3 days my face felt softer. So far I love it
"only used it for 1 week, waiting for wrinkles to soften but skin is soft so half way there."
I use this in the morning on a clensed face before applying make up.
I've been using it for a week and I see the difference in my skin.
"Ditto with the title, but sunscreen seems to work."
I'm just starting to get wrinkles... and im glad i found this product because I have finally learned how important sunscreen is.
I did not see any results after one week maybe it's just me but it doesn't work as advertised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love having a good sunscreen in my moisturizer. Its perfect for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product once and my skin had a terrible reaction. Felt like I was burned. My skin dried up severely. Tried to sooth with coconut oil but was still dry and in pain!
"I am 65, have seen TV add so I purchased Rapid Wrinkle Repair for day and night use. Have used for 10 days, face all peeling and now have stopped using daily. Will this stop? Or have I wasted money?"
I love this stuff. Have been using it for probably 8 years. My skin looks pretty much the same as when I was in high school and I'm 32. I pair this with the matching eye cream and wear both every day. I like that it has SPF.
Disappointed with results. No change to eye or forehead area. Product did not do what it advertises. As matter of fact actually caused additional drooping under eyes
Great product! Within a few days I noticed a fading of fine lines and and fading of my hyper pigmentation. I will definitely continue to use this product. I am so pleased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product as I heard Retinol-A was the best way to reduce wrinkles. I love the price point. For anti-wrinkle cream it is affordable. A tube goes a long way, as you don't have to use much. My skin looks and feels fresh."
I have been using this product for about 6 months now and have definitely seen a difference in my wrinkles. My skin is much softer since using the moisturizer. I highly recommend it. WalMart has the lowest price on this product.
"I love this moisturizer. It is amazing. It's a great product and does work to smooth your skin, plus it has 30 spf sun protection. The moisturizer lasts a long time too. A small amount goes a long way."
Great product !
"I was hoping for a cream that would replace others that don't work (like commercial). Used only 3 days and small whiteheads appeared and two black spots not present before (guess that's why they recommend black spot remover in same Ad). I don't have blocked pore issues with other facial products I use, so was disappointed by this. Now I'll need to pay for an expensive facial just to try and get rid of them...Will Neutrogena pay for one? That would be a nice fix!"
"You have to get through approx. 1 1/2 weeks. It might dry out your skin at first in that time frame, but after that if you stick with it you will see a difference in your skin. I have been using this product for over a year and I really like it. I get compliments on my skin."
"I bought this product three days ago. The first two nights it seemed to be o.k. first morning I even shared with my friends how happy I was with it. After using it for the forth time, I woke up with severe skin irritation or even damage. constant burning and dry and damage skin sensation will not go away. I am even worried about my skin. I really wanted to love this product. I am very concerend and hopefully these symptons go away. I re"
I believe it aggravates my millia problem. Does this product contain oils?
"I've been using rapid wrinkle repair since it came out. I get compliments on how youthful I look. Try it, you mighy like it. Smells nice, too."
This product smells good and makes my skin feel soft and not greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It worked ok but gives you very little product for its huge price. Gone way to fast not happy with that.
"I just purchase this product and I usually like neutrogena. However, I cannot say anything about the product yet because I just started, unfortunately the pump literaly does not work. I am very disappointed!"
I really like Neutrogena product and would like to try the sample first before I buy. My skin is acne prone and I want to make sure it won't break out.
Its so easy to use. Goes in my skin so fast. Non greasy. Love it.
Works as a sunscreen but haven't noticed any change in wrinkles-maybe over time....
It does work over a period of months and I only use it once a day.
"Great product, it REALLY works !"
It does exactly as advertised.
One of the best I have ever used. Cost is great.
"Saw results in 3-4 weeks, Im on my 2nd bottle!"
Good stuff as a lot of my wrinkles are subsiding!
I like the fact it contains Retinol
"It seems to help, but too early to tell how much"
Arrived quickly and works well.
Been using this as my sunscreen for several years. It has a great feel and I feel confident in its UVA/UVB protection.
"It's just a creme. Don't expect too much. Softens skin like any other creme. Wrinkles? No, it stays. And, probably, would continue to stay."
Used it once a day for three days and ended up with dry skin that was flaking off. Discontinued use and used lots of aloe to soothe my skin for days.
EFFECTIVE
Would highly recommend
Fantastic
"Might be too soon to tell.... So far, no difference. Let you know in a week...thx"
"I used it twice and still cannot stand with the smell. Smells like herb, very strong."
It say 7 day to see any but i been on it for 4 or 5 days and its nothing much happening so far.
this product is awesome
