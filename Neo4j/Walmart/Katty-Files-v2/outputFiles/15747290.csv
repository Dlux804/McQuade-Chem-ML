"I have used the Roc Day Cream formulas in the past and was pleased with the results, so this Night Cream did not disappoint. It is easy to apply and produces a slight tingling that quickly disappears as it absorbs into the skin. It has a nice scent and leaves the skin feeling moisturized without a heavy, greasy feel. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an effective anti-aging night cream at a more affordable price."
Finally I found a retinol anti aging night cream that didn't hurt my sensitive skin! I have very sensitive skin and the couple of retinol creams I've tried either turn my face beet red or they cause a stinging sensation. The smell is very light too.ROC product's are great!
I recieved the Roc Retinol Correxion Anti Aging Skin Night Cream to review.I liked it because it balanced out my skin tone and it went on silky smooth.You apply the skin cream to a clean face at night and you will notice a difference in the morning.You skin will feel smoother and tighter.I liked the no drip tube and the light fragrance.You will have softer younger looking skin. I recommend it highly. I think it is a good quality sensitive skin cream that really works. It is a good value for the price.
"I have tried this cream 1-2 times per day for the last 3 plus weeks. I've been applying it in the morning and at night, most nights. I love the scent, not too strong but very nice. I love the feel of the cream, how it goes on so smoothly, the feel, etc. I unfortunately have not seen any change in my skin. I do enjoy wearing it, but again, have not seen any change in my fine lines, wrinkles, etc. Perhaps my skin cannot be helped at the age of 54."
"Retinol products are usually very good. Have not had sufficient time in using this cream to notice any visible change in reducing the appearance of lines or wrinkles. Like the smooth, silky feel when applied. No skin irritation. Mild fragrance. Non-greasy."
"I like the ease of application, I also like how it feels on my skin. I haven't seen any changes in my skin, but I only have been using it less than two weeks. But I have recommended to a friend of mine. I'll keep using it though and see if I seen any less aging in my face."
"Love this night time face cream! Feels smooth and silky going on. My skin feels moisturized right away, and I do feel there has been a small improvement in my fine lines since I started using this. Look forward to seeing what happens with longer use. Love Roc!"
"Ladies and gents, if you have sensitive skin, do not use this product. I am not sure what it is in this product that set my skin off, but I woke up red-faced and swollen, so apparently there is something in this skin cream that my skin did not like. While I was hesitant to retry the product, so I tried it on the skin under my chin where a reaction wouldn't be so obvious, and I had the same problem. The product was easy to apply and the directions were simple, but for someone with very sensitive skin this is not the product for you."
I've been using this product for almost 2 weeks. The packaging is nice and simple. The product itself definitely works. I noticed a lot of the fine lines near my eye creases have filled in. My skin is soft and glowing. I received this for the purpose of reviewing the product through Walmart' s Spark reviewer program. Overall extremely happy with this product. I feel like it holds up to the claims and is worth the purchase to try.
This night cream is light on the skin and not greasy to the touch. The smell of it is quite nice .As you apply it to your underside of your eyes they fill instead relief and not dry .when you wake in the morning your eyes are refreshed .and a little goes a long way...good to help rid yourself of the fine lines due to ageing.
I use this along with the Roc Sensitive eye cream. I love this product. I feel such a smooth difference on my skin. Like silk. No redness or burning. Nice smell. Only a small amount is needed. Fine lines really do diminish after just a week. I've just started my second week and I love the way my skin feels and looks.
I am using this for over 50 skin that has usually reacted badly to any type of exfoliating agent. This is a very pleasant white cream that I apply nightly after cleansing my face. It does leave your skin very soft and hasn't caused my skin to redeem or chap. It is too soon to know if it causes my fine facial lines to dissipate but here's hoping.
"I have used Roc products for year so I trust this brand very much. I used this every night and I see the results. I like that this is for sensitive skin for more delicate area ,under my eyes. The Roc Retinol correxion anti aging skin night cream absorbed quickly with no sticky residue. No strong smell and felt great. The results are real with Roc."
"Since using Roc Retinol Correxion Anti-Aging Skin Night Cream, it appears that my wrinkles are not as deepas they were before using it. My face apears smoother and it so easy to use before bedtime so it can work overnight."
"This face cream goes on very light and covers well, very smooth, and soft feel it leaves on your skin, I feel I look more youthful already, and it's only been a couple weeks. Smells good!"
I've had sensitive skin so I hadn't been able to used the regular wrinkle creams. This is great. I was getting lines on my forehead and crows feet . The wrinkles are gone and it hurt my skin.
I've been using this moisturizer since it came out and I love how light but effective it is. Walmart's price is the least expensive I've seen out there. So glad I purchased this from Walmart!
"I've been using this for about a month now & I love it! My face in the morning has never looked better. I have roseacea and very sensitive skin. It seems everything clogs my pores, breaks me out, dries it, or always something but this does wonders for it. I just wish I could keep it looking that good all day. I am on a mission to find Roc day creams now. Way to go Roc! Works perfect on my sensitive red skin."
"I decided to try this for my hormonal acne. I'm 35 (female) and on HRT. The monthly progesterone causes lots of pimples and some deep, painful blemishes, too. I thought the retinol component in this product might help and liked that it was for sensitive skin. It works great! My skin is smooth, clear and even. I ran out recently and tried a less expensive retinol cream. Bad move. I'll be going back to Roc because I *know* it works. I definitely recommend giving it a try. It's my go-to acne/aging treatment now."
"I have been using the Retinol Sensitive Night Creme for several years now and it is my primary treatment product each night. I have tried more expensive treatment products but this one is more effective and at a much better price. My skin tends to get irritated with full strength retinol so I use those very sparingly. I never have problems with the Sensitive Night Creme. The fragrance is barely there and seems to disappear within a few minutes, but I actually love the scent! The tube is great--no having to dip my fingers in a jar."
I am 76 years old and have used Roc moisturizer and resurfacing pads and night cream for more than 5 years...I love it. I have extremely good skin before Roc .. however.I know without any doubt that the glow and no crows feet and no wrinkles has definitely been improved from the continued use of Roc.
"I have been using this cream for about 6 months and while I felt it was working with minimal side effects at first, I now realize that I have several brown spots that I did not have prior to using this product. I use spf 30 daily and minimize sun exposure, knowing that using retinol can increase sensitivity to sunlight, yet am now left with another skin condition to deal with, very upset and disappointed."
"I'm using this for the first time tonight. I have sensitive skin and did not have any burning or stinging upon application. It absorbed perfectly into my freshly washed and dried skin. There was a minimal odor that I found non-offensive. I'm hoping to eventually move up to the non-sensitive Roc night time retinol to help with acne, enlarged pores, and dull skin tone. Will try to update my review once I've used it longer."
I have been using this product for two weeks and already see a big difference in my skin. I wonder if you have a day cream that is also for retinol sensitive skin. I know you can have a reaction to retinol that does subside but this product has not given me any problems and I would like to have the same type of product available for day time use.
"I have 45 year old postmenopausal skin.Dry, fine lines with an easily clogged T-zone. I have been getting complimented by strangers two months after starting to use this with the 5-in-1 day cream. I've tried other retinol products that left my skin angry and red. This stuff is fab!"
"I've been struggling with dry skin and acne since graduating Uni., mostly on my cheeks and chin"
I started using this because it was on sale and I read retinol can help with certain kinds of acne
"My skin transformed overnight. I use it every other night right now, I am so happy. My skin looks clear and bouncy and healthy"
I am bi-racial with combination to dry skin (it is getting dry as I head into my 40s). Tried all the roc products as I am a big fan but this is so far my favourite night cream. It moisturizes and evens out my skin tone and everybody says my skin looks radiant whilst I am using it! It also feels luxarious compared to the other roc night creams. Love it!!
I can't RAVE enough about this product. Just one night use and my skin seen a dramatic difference. I have to use a very strong Acne regiment so I'm always leery about putting ANYTHING on my face...but also from all the acne product use it made my skin dull and no radiance to it. I tried this and have been using it for a week now and I'm hooked!!! My husband has even noticed a difference in my skin...(brownie points)!!! No acne break out either!! And it just feels so GOOD on the skin!!
I have been using Roc products for years and I love the results! They absolutely work for a fraction of the cost of other products. I recently developed sensitivity to retinol and was totally bummed that I might not be able to use it anymore but this cream works great for sensitive skin. LOVE IT!
"This is my first anti-wrinkle cream and I appreciate how it feels. My lines are appearing inbetween my eye brows, a frow in my brow, and I find this cream feels good and is relaxing as I'm applying it. There is noticeable reduction of lines after applying, though I'm unsure of lasting results. Overall, for the price, I'm happy with this product and will continue to buy it."
great product and its nourishes. great lotion and good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This new ROC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Serum is long lasting and definitely makes wrinkles disappear. I like the product is best high quality, very effective, and you will see noticeable anti-aging results. I recommend it!"
"I have very dry, sensitive skin, and need a product that doesn't cause any burning. This fits the bill, and it's great for reducing the size of wrinkles."
"I have really sensitive skin, and this doesn't make my skin all red or itch like when I've used retinol in the past. It's too soon to tell if there have been any results from using it."
Very smooth and easy. Thanks
"I wanted to try something new and different. I'm in my late 40s and have combination skin, oily in my T zone. Read the reviews for this product and figured I'd give it a try. I used it every other night for about 2 weeks. The last night I used it, when I woke up the next morning, my face was red and blotchy. I really wanted this to work. It made my pores look huge and left my face feeling oily. I will stick with my olay products."
"After reading the positive reviews, I decided to give this product a try. Following the every other day application directions, I noticed fine lines that were not there before on my cheeks."
Fine lines under my eyes appeared too. I'm 28 this year and wanted to use this to make my skin look better but it's giving me fine lines now. Please help!
Excellent
