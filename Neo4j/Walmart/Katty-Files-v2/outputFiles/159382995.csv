I like the smell of the moisturizer. so far It hasn't irritated my skin. In just a week my wrinkles in my neck isn't so noticeable. Looking forward to see the results in a months. I just started using this product a few weeks ago.
How smooth it makes my skin
"I bought this product in the clearance section, and was shipped to my local Walmart, the product it's great, but it comes with out a box, and the lid was broken!!!"
"did not see skin improvement, it is not worth the money spent"
I used this until it was gone it's a good moisturizer but I saw no difference in wrinkled
"Didn't work for me. I only have light wrinkles. Used it twice a day at crows feet. Absolutely no improvement after over a month. I would've been really disappointed had I paid more than the $5 bucks I paid online clearance. Had it worked, I would have tried other areas, but of course had I used it on more than crows feet, it would've been long gone."
"Just thrown in a plastic envelope, lid all cracked BUT still tried it and smells so perfumey that just threw away."
