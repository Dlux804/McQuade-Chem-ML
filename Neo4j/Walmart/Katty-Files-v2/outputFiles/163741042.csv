I have been using this product for many years. It was first sold to me by my esthetician. I get it here at half the price now. It works terrific on fine lines around the eyes and mouth. It is not a moisturizer. And it is not meant for deep wrinkles. I use this morning and night followed by my favorite night cream or daytime protectant with antioxidants. I am 61 years old.
I started using these products 3 months ago. Love them. When I bought them from a spa there were much more expensive so I started to look at other suppliers. These guys are great. Good prices and good delivery. Give this brand a try it is worth it!!
I really like this product. It doesn't irritate my skin and it definitely helps smooth expression lines. It does everything it claims and that's a always a plus. I'd re purchase this item.
