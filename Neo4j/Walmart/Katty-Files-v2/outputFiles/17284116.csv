This cream is soothing and non oily. It is also very economical choice for someone with rosacea as it does not make the redness worse.
"I have super sensitive, dry, irritated skin from using harsh face wash and a friend told me to check out this night cream and I ended up loving it! I switched my facial cleanser to Burtsbees as well and I am never going back! It has done wonders for my face in just a week. After using it the first night the results were immediate my face looked and felt more healthy and glowing. Love this product I would recommend it for everyone has has sensitive skin."
"This product is great. I have oily skin, and so many moisturizers make it much worse. This product soaks into my skin quickly; feels like I'm hardly wearing anything! And the smell reminds me of nature, which I LOVE. I will continue to use this wonderful product!"
"I have used this product for a few months now, and find it to be refreshing, not heavy, but keeps my face smooth and moisturized but not greasy. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've struggled with sensitive skin and pimples for a really long while. Breaking out on my nose and my skin peeling of because of the sensitivity, mostly around the cold climate. As the cold weather started rolling in I decided to try out this product. It was literally a miracle, the eczema was controlled, no skin peeling, and a surprising lack of pimples. Would recommend 100%"
"Bought this on a whim and ended up loving it. it gets rid of redness/ dryness over night. i have naturally oily skin which is a blessing and a curse, this lotion never breaks me out, or feels overly sticky/greasy. downfall is the price but i found a product that works with me and will continue to buy over and over."
I wouldn't have originally chosen this cream but I did the Burt's Bees regimen tool and it suggested it to me so I thought I would try it. I love it! After cleansing I put on this cream..it is so soothing and gentle. I wake up in the morning and my skin is hydrated and calm...no reddness or irritation. Fine lines are plumped out with hydration. It's like I did something really nice and healing for my skin after a day of being out in the environment and wearing makeup. Great product!
"Absolutely love this product! It's my first of Burts Bees skin care to try and I think it is great, lightweight yet hydrating!"
Love this product! Ive dealt with sensitive skin my whole life and every winter no matter what i get these dry patches allbover my face. I started using this cream i havnt seen them. My skin feels alot healthier and smoothier!
I have tried night creams from other brands before. They have left me waking up and looking like I had my head in a vat of oil all night long. This formula doesn't do that. I wake up with skin that looks hydrated but not drenched. The scent is mild and pleasant. I will never use another night cream!
I autoship this for my 16 yr old daughter who won't use any other night cream. She has sensitive skin and is very fair. She has gorgeous skin!
"I literally uses at night, under my make up and refresh. Addicted to the pleasant smell. I use nothing else on my face. And people think that I've had plastic surgery because of lack of wrinkles. No sensitivity which is rare anything I use"
My rosacea prone skin is in Heaven with this cream! It's not so thick that it feels uncomfortable and it instantly cools my typically-red skin. Although the red has greatly improved thanks to the Sensitive Face line.
I really like the day cream with the pump but the night cream which I purchased at a local store is not a cream at all. It is very liquidity. I have to pour it from the jar on to my finger to apply. Is this a flawed batch or is it always like this? If it is always like this then it needs to be in a bottle with a pump and not a jar.
"I tried using this product several times during the summer. Every time I used it I broke out with a type of hive or chemical burn. I have already thrown the box away, which I'm sure lists ingredients on it, so I can't tell what is in it that is causing such a bad reaction. I used to love Burt's bees products, but I feel like they have changed in the past couple years...or my skin has become super sensitive to their ingredients. Regardless I will remember this time not to try them again. These hives will take a week to heal!"
"I have fair, sensitive skin; also, I have dry cheeks but slightly oily forehead and chin. My skin has broken out to almost every moisturizer I have tried, but not with Burt's Bees. This night cream is seriously the best! My skin feels smooth and hydrated and it doesn't require a lot of product for each application. I apply it every night after washing my face and have been using it for about three or four months now."
"After years of trying various products for my sensitive skin and constantly breaking out from them, I finally found the one! This night cream is fantastic and leaves my face super soft! Also, I haven't had one break out since using this and the sensitive face cleanser!"
"It smells like cinnamon to me, but I got used to it by the time I purchased my second jar. I do have a hard time getting it to sink into my skin - almost as hard a time as the SPF products, but I just keep lightly rubbing until the white color goes away. I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn't seem to irritate it. The moisture has been sufficient for the summer, but I don't think it will be enough in winter in the desert.

"I don't know if I'd say I have sensitive skin.. but I do have oily skin. I decided to try the sensitive products though because I wanted something gentle for my skin. :) I have been using this for about a week and I am really impressed! This night cream leaves my skin *incredibly* soft for a whole 24 hours! It has also helped even out my complexion...my husband even noticed the difference! :) I am really glad I bought this. Oh and when applying this product, a little goes a long way. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to a friend!"
I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. I have used everything from really expensive retail store products to stream line grocery store buys. This is the first one i have ever used where I don't wake up in the morning with white heads all over my chin area. I think its so important to use a moisturizer especially at night so i couldn't be more thrilled that I found this stuff!
"This has great texture, light, yet very moisturizing, clean light scent. This is very soothing and does not cause me any irritation. Can use in daytime too under my sunscreen and mineral powder, not greasy at all. This is by far the best moisturizer by Burt""s."
This is the first time I bought a burt's bee product and was pleasantly surprised. I am very sensitive to fragrance and have tossed out purchases in the past because I did not like the smell or it made me dizzy. This face cream is exactly what I am looking for! It does a good job in moisturizing my face in the winter time and the fact that it doesn't have any fragrance is a big plus! I hope this product remains in the market because I will be buying this again and plan on getting it for my mom too.
"This product is everything it promises and more. I have a prescription acne cream that dries my face ridiculously, but this cream really moisturized, even making some bad dry spots disappear. My face looks so much less irritated, which means it looks way clearer! And you don't need to use much for it to work well!"
"I ended up purchasing this product after getting a free sample of their sensitive day face lotion and really liking it. I am allergic to a lot of products that are ""less natural"" and this one my face has never been smoother, healthier looking, and I haven't had a hive in a really long time."
"I don't have sensitive skin, but I went to the beach and got sunburned. I bought this cream and it was wonderful. It made my skin feel good and I was able to go on without any pain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have the pickiest skin ever. I've searched for years for a moisturizer that doesn't make my already oily skin -- oiler/break out. This one has done the trick! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that this is fragrance free and natural however it did not absorb into my skin at all. It felt like I was just smearing it around my face and it never went into my skin. I hope they work on the formula and then I would have a go at it again.
"I have been using this product for the past 2 months and it doesn't hydrate my skin, and i haven't seen any improvements. In fact, it has made it more dry. I'm going back to Olay"
"I was very disappointed with not the product but it's how the item arrived, the top of the box was ripped open and the night cream itself was not even sealed. They've always warn us users of not accepting anything when it's not sealed so I'm returning this product."
"I have skin that flushes and reddens very easily, and this line is amazing for it, the wash then the daytime moisturizer or the night cream have improved my skin immensely! The night cream especially has really softened and evened out my skin. I love the feel of it, after I apply it, and it has a nice clean scent. Highly Recommend.

"Perfect Night Cream! Natural, Mild perfume and you only need a bit of cream ! Love love Burt's Bees!"
Used it twice so far and love the way my skin feels. Cream is light but has staying power. So far after only 2 applications I am impressed.
"I have the world's most sensitive skin. This light, clean, and natural night cream is the savior for my picky skin. Thank you Burt's Bees!"
"I started using this at night and it made a world of difference. It is quite a bit thicker than the day cream, but because it washes off in the shower this doesn't bother me. LOVE it!"
A little bit goes a long way. Great for sensitive skin!
Moisturizing cream for sensitive skin - doesn't irritate my skin. :)
Offers clean; not sticky moisture. Will determine it's effectiveness over time.
Not greasy at all but it is thick enough to keep your skin moisturized all night!
