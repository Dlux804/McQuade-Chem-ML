Love this face wash because it removes daily grime but also removes makeup. It leaves face feeling smooth and soft and not dried out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
my faces feels clean but not over dried and has a nice scent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the way my face feels and looks after I use it. It doesn't dry my face out like some other cleansers.
really makes skin feel fresh and pores feel so freesh
Keeps my skin clear and soft plus the scent is very light.
I stopped using the cleanser for a few weeks and the results were astonishing! My skin improved almost immediately when I began using the cleanser again! I'll never stop using this awesome product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a real problem with the packaging for this product. It is very difficult to get it out of the tube. The tube is too stiff and I have to do a toothpaste tube maneuver every time I wash my face. It's quite annoying.
I purchased this because it claims to be foamy and it wasn't very foamy just a tiny bit. Anyways it does smell good to me but i will not be purchasing this again. I don't recommend it for anyone with oily skin as it feels more like a creamy cleanser. It surely doesn't feel like your face is getting very clean. So if you have oily skin you'll just be massaging the oil around on your face with this cleanser.
"I love this cleanser. Very refreshing, leave my face feeling very clean but not dried out. My skin feels very soft and supple. This product also is a great makeup remover, without leaving my face dried out or feeling tight. Using moisturizer after using this cleanser feels great.

I keep a tube of this cleanser in my shower for my morning face wash and love the fact that it lathers but does not dry out my skin. There isn't another product on the market that I think compares. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using Oil of Olay for over 25 years (I'm 47) and it was the best decision I ever made. This product is mild and keeps my face clean and looking bright!
