What a great product! The face wash left my skin feeling clean but not dry and the cream were super hydrating without clogging up my skin. Highly recommend for the ultimate face regimen
I use the Missha time revolution products normally and needed travel sizes - these are perfect! It has a cleanser and everything you need for your nighttime skincare routine. I'm thinking about getting them for my friends since this set is such a great way to introduce them to the Missha brand!
"This is such a great set! I love the way my skin feels after using these products. The moisturizer in particular leaves my skin feeling so soft. I haven't used the product long enough to see results, but I'm definitely going to continue using and exploring other products from this brand. I am a Walmart associate and bought this for myself, but it would would make a great gift as well for anyone who loves skincare."
A nice luxury skin care set. I just wish the bottles were a little larger. My face appears brighter and smoother.
