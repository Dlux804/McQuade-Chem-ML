"Light soothing moisturizer- I use this on humid days or when my skin is feeling sensitive. In colder weather, I follow up with something a little more substantial. Great price from Jet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have a very oily T-zone and in the winter my cheeks get dry and this is perfect. The consistency is so gel-like and it smells wonderful. I have rosacea and it has a cooling effect when applied that is very soothing. I NEVER want to be without this. THANK YOU PHILOSOPHY FOR MAKING SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT!!!
I was given a sample for this product that probably gave me 10 days of use. I use it just after I wash my face in the morning and then after I was my face before bed. I saw improvement quickly...probably after the 2nd day! I've noticed less redness and less darkness under my eyes. Even though I'm young I feel like I look younger! Haha. 100% recommend. It also feels so good after putting it on. It leaves a cool and fresh feeling.
"The Take A Deep Breath gel cream is light feeling on my skin, lightly scented and a deLightful product to use. No greasy or heavy feeling. No stickiness. And after using now for a little while I haven't had any breakouts. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I was given this product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."
I loved the old formula of Take a Deep Breath. It had next to no odor for a moisturizer without an added fragrance.
However I cannot same the same for the new formula. The new formula does not list any added fragrance but it has a very strong smell to it. Which has made it impossible for me to use without setting off my allergies.
