"My forehead had recently been so dry that it felt more like rough skin on someone's foot. I tried several things and nothing seemed to be working. Then I tried this serum + moisturizer. Over night, my skin was almost normal. It also did NOT break out my face. I don't know if it will do anything for wrinkles, but it sure did a lot to moisturize my rough dry skin. I have never seen anything that worked like this. If they made a body lotion for aging skin, I would buy it in a heartbeat!"
"I was sceptical about this product when I first purchased it, but after a month of use I can honestly say that I see the sagging skin on my neck is actually less saggy and I 've received compliments on the radiance of my skin. I'll be using this product for a long while."
"I have tried all sorts of facial products and cosmetics. I LOVE this item. What a DEAL for 14 bucks. I will definately buy it again and keep using it. It's non irritating (for me) and goes on smoothly, absorbs into the skin, good alone or under makeup. However, if you are going to use it under makeup, wait for it to dry completely and don't use alot. Use more at night, wake up looking fresh."
"I've used this since it came out. I'm 40 and I love the simplicity of a dual product that works. My kids call it the T-Virus face cream. Please don't do away with it. At this point, in buying it online as it is no longer in stores near me. Please keep selling it"
"I get so tired of having to search for new things. I have used this product for YEARS, and now I find out that I have to go on the hunt for something else for my sensitive skin. So disappointing!"
"The only product that doesn't clog my pores or cause major skin irritation. It is not greasy or overly moisturizing I have been using this product since I was 21, in 29 now. People think I am 19-22"
Bring this product back! Love this product and have used it ever all year.
Don't like jars you dip your fingers into that's why this product appealed with a pump style z.
"I have one full bottle of this left and with the new rebranding, I can see how it didn't fit. Who cares!!!! It is the best and most moisturizing anti aging cream I have ever used."
I have been using this product for many years and have loved it. Very sad to hear it's been discontinued. Please bring it back! Other products I have tried clog my pores and makes my face break out! I am 64 and people guess me for being in my late 40s!
Why can't I find this on the shelf anywhere. I hate that I can't find it. I will be 57 and people think I am 48-50 I have used this since it came out.
I love this product! It works so well especially around my eyes. Companies are always discontinuing products that have worked so well and have such good consumer feedback. Please don't be that company. If companies would only realize how many loyal customers they lose to this practice. Hopefully you will reinstate this product. This is the second product I have used from Garnier that really worked only to have it discontinued.
"I have been using the Ultra-Lift 2-in-1 Serum for about 4 or 5 years and it makes my skin feel so good without feeling oily or greasy. no I am unable to get it in my area so I tried a couple other products which either bothered my eyes or or broke my skin out ( even with a sensitive formula). I am wondering if you are phasing this prodoct out in the Delaware area? (Walmarts, RiteAids, & Walgreens in particular)"
Really? You discontinued an affordable product that actually works? Please bring it back or release something similar. I am 51 and still have oily skin so this was a great option for me. I dont wear a lot of makeup and this product actually reduced the lines on the bridge of my nose and around my lips and got rid of some creases on the sides of my nose!
PLEASE BRING THIS BACK!!!!!! It's the best!!! I've used this since it's introduction to the line and it's been the best product ever...I've went thru TONS of this stuff and I would buy tons more if you all would PLEASE BRING BACK! My skin is just not the same! It made my skin look awesome and didn't break me out. Please please please Garnier...we beg you... bring it back!!!!
"I have been shopping for the Ultra-Lift 2 in 1 Serum and Moisturizer for weeks and have not been able to find it. I have used this product for several years and it keeps my face well moisturized. I use it night and day along with the day cream and night cream. My skin is very dry and it's just not the same with out this extra boost. If you are discontinuing it, Please bring it back."
"This is by far the best moisturizing serum I have ever used. I have sensitive combination skin, and this provides the perfect level of moisturizing without being heavy or greasy. PLEASE BRING THIS BACK!!! I'm feeling quite lost without it, and my skin is not happy."
Have running into a regular shortage every time I go to buy it and now it is no where to be found. The product worked without being too heavy or oily like the moisturizer. Very sad who knows how many products I will have to try before I find a replacement product.
I have used this product for about 1 week I can see the difference
"I love this product, and like others have used it for years. I'm 51, and there is no other product like it."
"Why would you discontinue it? Others products clog my pores, and skin doesn't look or feel as good. I am so tired of marketing dictating the products that are available to us. THIS IS a FABULOUS product. Bring it back or no more Garnier products for me."
love this product and the scent is subtle. the consistency is like a lotion and wears well during day or night. i use during day with sunscreen.
Love this product and from reading the reviews it is no longer available. For the last several years by the end of the day I feel like most moisturizers are in my eyes. But not this one. Please make it available again!!!
"This is my favorite and only moisturizer I use for my sensitive skin! Why discontinue it? If it is a profitability issue, keep it and charge double for it. I think you have a cult following that will purchase it at a higher price point!"
Please bring this product back. I have used it for years and love how it works with my skin. Cannot find a replacement that doesn't feel heavy and oily on my skin.
I've been purchasing for a long time now. Its the only moisturizer that doesn't leave me feeling oily by the afternoon. SOOOO Sad its no longer. I've searched stores all over for this. BUMMED!
Why can I not find this anymore? I loved the moisture this product provided! It would moisturize my skin so well without being heavy or greasy! That is a hard thing for me to find.
"I LOVE this product. After trying multiple products for my dry skin, this one has been the best one I've tried in years. Just found out today that it's been discontinued. Please bring it back!"
Light texture and it really moisturizes well. Has kept my 70 year old skin looking like 50. Really! People are surprised when they ask how old I am. PLEASE bring back the ORIGINAL. The new one doesn't FEEL the same and has LESS product in the container. Why can't companies leave well enough alone. You just lost a customer.
I have been trying other moisturizers and have not found one I like as well as this one. What recommendation do you have to replace it?
Please bring this product back! I just recently used it and it is wonderful. Do you have this product now under a different label?
"I love this and it really works, tried the Ultra Lift in the red jar but don't like. I hate to start looking for something new again."
I have been searching everywhere for this! I loved this moisturizer and have used it for years. Please bring it back!
I am almost 70 years old and I love this cream. It helps your skin keep the lines on your face from being so bad.
I have used this product for years and absolutely love it. Please make it available again. I am 54 and no one has ever guessed that I'm in my 50's.
"I have been using it for a few years - now my daughter is using it - please, please - we have found nothing better!"
"I've been using the 2-in-1 and was very frustrated to find out it has been discontinued. Why does every company discontinue products??? I'm 44 and have combination skin, this is the only product that has helped. Please bring this back!!!!"
"Had no idea this awesome product had been discontinued!! Like others, I used it for years with great results and no breakouts. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!"
"I wrote a review giving this product one star but it never got posted. For me the product doesn't absorb, and makes little balls if you rub your face. And it does NOT mix with other garnier products like the BB cream or garnier moisturizer with SPF. As soon as you try to layer on another Garnier product it makes balls and flakes."
This product is the best. I never used Garnier before. This will make me a user of Garnier. The 2 in 1 wrinkle serum really does work. It moisturizes my face and helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Hope this product is never discontinued. I am also prone to break outs but this does not make me break out with pimples.
So disappointed that this product was discontinued. I purchased all the packages I could find just so that I could stock up. The moisturizer you suggest is not comparable. Please tell me your team is taking these consumer comments under consideration and working on a new product that is equal to 5 second blur. So far I've found nothing else comparable on the market in Canada or the US. Please email me when you bring the product back!
"I agree with everyone, I can't believe this is discontiued and the ""comparable"" product is not in the least bit ""comparable"". It's not even the same type of product. So disapointed. I'm afraid to use any of your other products as they may randomly be discontinued."
PLEASE bring back the 5 Sec Blur Smoothing cream! I have tried the ulternative Ultra-Lift 2 You suggested as a better option AND FOUND IT HORRIBLE! I loved how 5 SEC BLUR WORKED! Now I will have to look to other product manufactures for a replacement product. So disappointed!
I Completely agree with the previous reviewer about your bad choice to discontinue the 5 Second Blur. I have tried your other products and nothing does what it did. Neither this nor the BB Creams disguise wrinkles as well - and none of the BB creams match my skin tone. I loved that I could user the 5 Second Blur with or without other makeup.
"I'm trying to find a decent replacement for the 5 Sec blur. This moisturizer isn't it and it doesn't stand up to other moisturizers. It peels off your skin and does not improve appearance. Please bring 5 sec blur back,everyone I know loved it! Why is it gone?"
"this product was a GEM and especially at the price point.. heck, you could probably even bring it back at a higher price and people would still buy it. there is nothing that compares and it truly doesn't make sense why you would discontinue a product that is clearly a favorite."
"I am adding to the many others who have commented about their sadness to see 5 sec blur go. Why discontinue something that has made so many people happy for so long? I am not looking forward to having to look for an alternative; I am hearing the recommendation from Garnier is not good for oily skin, that leaves me out. So sad."
"I LOVED the 5 second blur product! It left my skin feeling smoothe, soft and firm; the fact that it was discontinued for the Ulta-lift is very disappointing. The new product does not leave my face feeling as firm nor as soft and there is a STRONG scent that lingers well into the day. GIVE ME BACK THE BLUR!!!"
"I just went online to repurchase (for the 5th or 6th time) my 5 second blur, and I find that Garnier has discontinued it! OMG!!! Why??? I have recommended it to many of my friends and we all LOVE it. SO sad that Garnier chose to stop making it, and there is no suitable replacement. I've used no other primer for years. Now what? UGH!!!!!"
I purchased this product for the second time. I love it. I love the way it makes my face feel soft and works great on fine lines and wrinkles. You can feel it working the minute you put it on. Great product and great price. When I start to run out I'm back at walmart to buy another one.
"Add me to the list of consumers upset that you have discontinued the Garnier 5-Second Blur. It did an amazing job! I purchased nothing else since I discovered it several years ago. I have tried the product you now recommend and it is nothing like the 5-Sec Blur. It is too heavy, too greasy and does not do well under foundation. I have never understood why companies discontinue products that have been so sought after by so many people. Please bring 5-Sec Blur back!!!!"
I do not like this product as a substitute for the 5 second blur. There is no comparison in how much better 5 second blur works. I have tried to find one of your products to take the place of 5 second blur and you have none that compare. I've wasted money on several of your products and I am going to look to other companies now. I'm very disappointed that you have discontinued 5 second blur.
I cannot recommend this Ultra Lift Skin Active product!! Both my sister and I were (not so) blessed with 'craters' for pores and we LOVED the instant results we got with your 5 Sec Blur!!!! Please bring back the 5 Sec Blur!! There was/is no other product out there like it! I've only known about 5 Sec Blur for a year or two. Now it's gone?!?! Please tell me it ain't so!
"I have been using the 5-sec blur & I just ran out of it & can't seem to find it anywhere!!!! Has it been discontinued?? If so, why??? That product is amazing & the only kind of primer I've ever used on my face that always does the job without causing me any skin issues or breakouts!!! Please bring it back!!!!"
"Garnier, I can't with you. The 5 Sec Blur was AMAZING and I can't believe it's gone. This product was your recommended replacement, but it doesn't even work the same way AT ALL. It doesn't blur - it's a moisturizer and serum! They aren't the same things! Whyyyyy did you do this??"
Very unhappy that Garnier Blur has been discontinued. Did anybody at Garnier bother to ask consumers what they wanted? The new serum+moisturiser is a totally different product. Really disappointed in your marketing dept. How about listening to the people who actually use your products?
"Love the 2-in-1 moisturizer/serum - I use twice daily. I've noticed a huge difference and I don't have any major issues - but skin is brighter, smooth, soft but not tight. I've used other very expensive products that made big claims and this blew all of them out of the water. I use the night eye gel as well and when I get out of the shower in the a.m. I look so refreshed !! Very pleased !!"
"I am unhappy with this product. I have used Garnier, elusively and faithfully. Please bring back sec BLUR! Made my skin feel marvelous,like silk,and my skin looked more youthful and radiated. I plan to search for a similar product,taking my sec BLUR tube with me to my nearest ULTA. Why did you discontinue this wonderful product? I'd have paid more for this if cost was the issue. I always would recommend Garnier,but I am rethinking this."
"They claim on the box that it is fragrance free, but it is not. It has a very strong perfume smell. I washed my face twice after putting it on. But, the faded smell was still there. Also, if you look in the ingredient list, the last item listed is fragrance/perfume."
"The only reason I give low stars is only because after two weeks my cheeks started burning and itching and became redder than normal with bumps. I wasn't sure what it could be but my bf told me to stop using it for the weekend. And sure enough the rash went away, I was really upset because I love Garnier!!! Not sure what is in there that effected my skin but be careful if you start itching your face more than normal stop! lol"
This was the recommendation as a replacement for 5 sec blur. Sorry to say it is not even comparable. I kept looking for months in every store for 5 sec blue until i checked your website. must say I am totally disappointed it is discontinued. This product does not leave your skin feeling anywhere near a silky smooth as the 5 sec blur...please consider bringing it back.
"I am 75 years old. This is the BEST product I have EVER used, even and especially on facial skin my age! I am constantly being taken for being in my late 50s, early 60s, and it is because of this product! WHY WOULD IT EVER BE DISCONTINUED?? To the company, please RETHINK this decision"
"Yes this product needs to come back, been using it for years and have been searching to find it."
This is such a great product. Why would you discontinue it?
Please bring it back.
I have been using this product for awhile now and it really seems to work
I have used this for years. I just found out today that it is discontinued. I have no idea what I am going to do now.
"Been using Garnier Ultra-Lift for several years. It is a great product , it lifts and diminishes fine lines, while moisturizing as well."
"I'm Brian From Albuquerque, I use all the line and this ultra lift 2 in 1 is again the Best it feels like your putting on pure moisture.. please dont stop making it!!!!"
This product does not compare to 5 second blur. I'm so disappointed 5 second blur was discontinued. There aren't any other products like it on the market. It did exactly what it said it would at a reasonable price. Please bring it back!
I bought this as a suggested replacement for 5 second blur. I don't like it at all & wish I hadn't wasted my money. I loved 5 second blur & really wish it were still available. I will not buy this product again.
"I cant believe Garnier has STOPPED making this product! Such a let down. I have spent so much money on other promising products, but NOTHING COMPARES! please bring it back OR AT LEAST GIVE AN ADDRESS WHERE IT CAN BE PURCHASED! So disappointing!!!"
"several sites including Garnier recommended this as a replacement for 5 sec blur, it was definitly not. Please do not waste your money and time. I am so bummed about them discontinuing 5 sec blur, best product that was on the market."
"Please, please, please bring back the 5 second blur! It was a true miracle product, and the best primer on the market. None of your other products can even come close to replacing it."
"Just ran out of my 5 sec blur, now I know why I couldn't find it in the sores. Why would you discontinue it ????? I loved it and used it every single day :("
"Every time I find a great product, it gets discontinued. Please bring it back. It made my skin so smooth and it was not greasy. The paraffin wax in it was awesome too."
This was such a great product! I was so disappointed to see it disappear from the stores. Really helps to hide fine lines and pores. PLEASE ring it back!!!
Love this!!I recently bought this and love it!!Ive never used garnier products before but will be trying more of them now. It works seriously well and it's a price I can afford. My skin feels and looks great after about 2 weeks of use 2x a day.
"This product is terrible and useless. It does nothing. I can no longer find my Ultra Lift in stores, so I was forced to buy this last minute. I have used it for months now and my fine lines have gotten worse. I am so upset."
Please bring back 5 second blur! I can not use products with fragrance or benzoyl alcohol. That was the only great mosturizer with silica to diminish my pores and free of ingredients I'm allergic to.
"I love this product, I just found out its been discontinued. This out of all your products worked the best to reduce my wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes. Is there anyway you can bring this product back please please bring it back."
Have been using the ultra lift eye for a long time and very pleased so decided to try the moisturizer. The smell is horrifically strong!! I had a very poor night's sleep due to the odor. I took it back and got a refund.
"This product helps keep my pores clear and my skin softer. I love it. A representative from Garnier had told me it had been discontinued, so I was very happy to learn I can order it from Walmart."
"I've used this moisturizer for a long time, and was so happy to find it on line since my WalMart store no longer carries it. This is a light moisturizer with some wrinkle-reducing qualities. It's easy to apply, and a little goes a long way."
This cream is non greasy & it only requires a small amount to be affective.
I like that it takes care of two things at once
"This is a great product because it works. I have been using Olay for years, but this is better."
"I bought this product after reading the reviews.Looking forward to seeing the kind of results mentioned. I have inherited a tendency towards a wrinkly neck from my father's side of the family and was hoping to stave off the inevitable. BUT, to my amazement I turned out like a turkey with a red neck and under chin area as a result of using this product. So glad I didn't put it on my face. If I could recall where I bought it I would take it back and ask for a refund. I am very disappointed."
I am getting better results than I did from more expensive brands. I see improved skin tone and smoothed-out fine lines.
i love the way it glides on and makes my skin feel silky. I'm on my fifth bottle and it is very gentle on my eyes.
Why in the world would you discontinue a very popular and highly rated product? Who is making these decisions?
I concur! My 5 second blur out did the L'Oréal and Smashbox that I used to use. This other offered product doesn't do it for me.
There is no comparison in these two products. The ultralift is in no way near as good as the 5 second blur. I sure wish you would bring it back
I have been using the 5 sec blur for quite awhile. I love the product. I was wondering why is was so hard to find. I hope you bring it back.
"Used the cream, which I loved for a week until the pump broke. No way to fix it or ""get to"" the product."
"Please bring back 5 second blur!!!!! Love the way it made my skin look and feel, and definitely lessens the look of fine lines."
"When I used 5 second blur my skin look very young, with out pores. Its the BEST CREAM . Please come back."
"Too smelly, flakes off, does nothing. Why did you discontinue 5 Sec Blur? That product worked. Old saying, ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke."""
Not sure why this is considered an improvement. Please bring back the 5second blur. Been looking for months and can't find anything close.
"Been using this for over 5 years, it makes my skin feel great and never oily. I hope they never stop making it!!!"
So nice to have the serum and moisturizer in one. It's not a heavy feeling at all. I love it. I use it twice a day.
"This is my favorite skin cream, I hope they continue making it because it will be available for a bit and then it disappears for awhile. I have sunblock allergies so there are very few I can use."
"I started using this two weeks ago, not sure yet if I should use this one or the daily moisturizer or both, for now I use them both. Feels good on my face, smells good and my face feels fresher."
This product is okay however it can not be compared or considered a replacement for 5 second blur. 5 second blur was the best product I found as a smoothing primer. Please bring it back!
I looked for 5 Sec Blur everywhere and finally checked your website and bought the Ultra-Lift 2-in 1 as a replacement. Not even!! Please consider bringing back the 5 Sec Blur!!
"I ran out and kept looking at several stores...sad to see its gone, why? I have been using that product since it came out. Its disappointing and I noticed other Bb products seem to b disappearing. Can't u bring it back?"
"Bought this thinking it would be good for my skin. However the smell is awful,"
very strong and cheap smelling. cannot use it as the smell just keeps coming after it is applied.
"I love this product! I was leery at first only because my skin is so sensitive and breaks out over anything. Well this time, it didn't. I love the multi tasking this moisturizer does, so instead of having to bring out my extra products, like vitamin E and my anti wrinkle cream, I could take care of it all in one easy step! It kept my face moisturized all day, no flakes half way through the day and no greasy build up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the packaging on this. You get a good amount of product and a little goes a long way. Felt very moisturizing on my face but a little to heavy. Good for mornings when you're feeling puffy. I didn't particularly love the smell but it doesn't linger. Left my face smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First as to the packaging, it's silly but I LOVE the way this product looks! I like the spiral design it gives it an elegant look. The product itself has a very nice, soft feel. A small goes a long way. It recommends a ""pea"" sized amount and that really does spread well (without being too liquid-y.) It still feels substantial without being oily. One of the other things I really like about the moisturizer is the scent. It's not too strong but it has a light sweet scent that I think is rather nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is good for someone with dry skin. I have very oily skin, and I could feel the oil left behind on my face from this moisturizer. The smell is not great either. As far as the anti-aging goes, it has vitamin E and retinol, so it should help, but after using it for several days, all I noticed was how oily my skin felt. Perhaps someone with dryer skin would benefit from it, but definitely stay away if you have extra oily skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I ordered online,but then found it was also in my local Wal-mart. This is a silky feel and a light fragrance. Anybody who says this smells bad has NOT actually tried it because it is a nice soft fragrance, NOT strong. I love the way in goes on and the way it makes my face feel. Wish they did not swirl it that way you would get more! I love Garnier!"
Love this product please please please bring it back
"Why would you discontinue a product ,that by reading the reviews, so many of us loved?"
PLEEEEEEEASE bring back 5 Second Blur. i LOVE that stuff.
5 second blur why don't you guys bring it back?!?!?
This stuff is NOT comparable to 5-Second Blur. Ultra-Lift didn't help my oily skin.
"Just, bought this, but the scent is terrible. Not sure what ingredient is causing this."
Can't even compare to garners 5 second blur. Very disappointed
"This moisturizer works really well. Don't understand why it isn't offered in Walmart stores,"
Best day cream ever!!! Keeps face hydrated all day...
Why discontinue 5 Sec Blur?
Best product ever! You did what Coke did back in the day! Replace a great product with garbage!
I've been using this for a whole year and still have the same wrinkles I will never yes your product again
"I agree with the one of the other reviews, this smells awful. It smells like it's out of date or something. I buy a lot Garnier products, never had a problem with the smell before."
I have used this product for years and it is a wonderful base for sunscreen and makeup and I have very smooth soft facial skin. I cannot put anything with sunscreen directly on my nose as it breaks out if I do so this is excellent because it's sunscreen free. I then use Neutragena Free & Clear baby sunscreen on top of it before applying any makeup. Prevents any allergic reactions.
"I think this product is fantastic! I have tried many, many different moisturizers. Comparing, this is the best I have tried. It makes my face smooth. It has reduced my redness and dryness on my face. It has also made me look younger, as well as, less tired. It doesn't clog my pores like other moisturizers do. I love this product and I love how my face feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy using this Garnier skin-active Ultra-Lift 2-in-1 Serum + Moisturizer. I prefer to use it at night before I go to bed and the smell is so soothing! Also, sometimes I use heavier, harsher cleansers to remove my makeup, so the moisturizing factor really makes me feel like I'm nourishing my skin overnight. I have noticed much smoother and brighter skin when I wake up in the morning, so I feel the product is working to improve my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am very happy with this product. I noticed an immediate change in my skin. It looked much clearer and brighter.. also notcied that i didnt need to use as much of my priner when i was using my mineral foundation. Its looked so good this week that i havent really used my pwder. I recommend it highly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Garnier skin active two in one serum and moisturizer is really good. I have been trying it for about 3 weeks now and I've loved it. It doesn't have a strong scent at all, it makes my skin feel really soft and a small amount goes a long way. It does a good job at making my skin feel nice and plump and hydrated and it doesn't feel greasy at all. I definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this to be a really lovely product. The design of the bottle is very cool and it is easy to see up how fast you are using the lotion. The product itself is lightweight with a pleasant fragrance. I have only been using it a week, so I cannot speak to longterm effects, but short term it makes my skin look great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used Garnier SkinActive Ultra Lift wrinkle reducer 2 in 1 serum + moisturizer for several weeks. Though I have not noticed a change in my skin since I don't have wrinkles to determine that change it does seem to feel like it's tightening the skin. It has a silky smooth finish, blends well with a very light smell but does not moisturize the way I need it to. It's more of a serum for the wrinkle reduction than a moisturizer for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product works great. I started using it a little over a week ago and my face feels softer and moisturized. In the summer I like to use a lighter moisturizer and I thought this product went on light but had full coverage. I will continue to use and see what a difference it makes for fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product works great as a moisturizer, but I don't know that I noticed any difference in wrinkles. Also, while the product did not have much of a scent, the smell of it was not really my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this as a moisturizer. I have really dry skin in my eyebrows and this really helps. I can't say as I have seen any improvement in the appearance of wrinkles, but my skin feels nice after I use it. It soaks in quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this product. It soaked into my skin very nicely. However, I do not feel it did much for my wrinkles in this short amount of time. I feel it could work very well! I also love the packaging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to love this serum. I'm always on the lookout for affordable skincare and in the past Garnier products have not disappointed. I used this serum everyday for about two weeks. It did hydrate my skin well, especially for living in a dry climate. But that is all it did. I didn't notice any improvement in my fine lines or wrinkles. It left my skin feeling soft and it has a pleasant smell. But it's only a moisturizer and not really a serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product daily for a couple weeks and am really impressed with it. It feels incredibly light on my skin and absorbs very quickly. A small amount goes a long way. I feel like my skin looks brighter after only a couple weeks. My only complaint is the scent when I first apply it. It's a bit stronger and florally than I typically like. Yet, after a few moments I don't smell it anymore. Overall, it's a great product that I would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the product for about a week. So far, I like the smell and the product goes on really smoothly. I'm using it twice a day. Hoping to report some results on how effective the product is at moisturizing and reducing wrinkles. By the way, the product looks super cool swirled inside the bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great moisturizer. The Pro's: Pleasant scent , goes on smooth as silk, quick absorption and lasts for many hours. I even felt a little brighter. Cons: there should be more in the bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was amazed at how well I liked this product! Most products that claim to be a moisturizer and wrinkle reducer do not work on my skin and cause me to break out or become oily. This product did neither of those things! In face, after just about two weeks of use my skin feels firmer and softer then it has since high school! Plus, it did not cause me to break out nor did I get oily skin. I would recommend this product to others and use daily in my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't expecting much from this product when I got it, but I was so wrong. This moisturizer has improved my skin's texture and improved the appearance of fine lines in 2 weeks. You only need to use a little of this product as it is goes a long way. I use it on my face, neck and decolletage areas and have noticed a reduction in lines and dry skin. I cant wait to see the improvements in my skin as I continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently tried GARNIER SkinActive Ultra-Lift Moisturizer and I'm obsessed! It really helps with my combination skin, it reduces oil but mosturizes at the same time. Amazing new product and something I'll be both using and recommending to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love Garnier Skin Active Ultra-lift 2 in 1 Serum + Moisturizer. I am 42 years old and starting to shows signs of aging. I have been using this product for a while now and notice the wrinkles in my forehead smoothing out. It's simply amazing. It goes on smooth and not greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recently tried this product for the first time. After a week of use I can honestly say I like this product. The appearance of the product itself is great. It smooths on so easy, and the smell is great! Its very light and does not leave me feeling greasy, which is usually a problem. I feel my complexion is looking better and look forward to continuing to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the look of the product. The pump dispenser gives me complete control of the amount I need to cover my face and neck. I really like the creamy feel of the moisturizer. My skin looks radiant and healthy. My only complaint is that there is sunscreen in the serum. My makeup doesn't have any either so I had to add an additional step to my regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product already! Been using it ever since I got it and the brand is great too!! I can tell a difference in my face by using this product. The smell is okay but I have dry skin so it has been making my face really soft so I'm happy about that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always love Garnier products and this one hasn't disappointed me! It works great. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or oily, and I don't feel like I even put anything on afterwards. It does a great job moisturizing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I know I got this product free to try out, but when I run out I will be repurchasing. My skin feels smooth and tighter. I use it in the morning and at night after I take off my makeup. Light scent, and just a note, I have sensitive skin and it did not break me out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have dry sensitive skin and this moisturizer didn't irritate my skin. Goes on smooth and keeps my skin hydrated. The smell is a little strong but that's the only negative thing I would say. I would recommend this product for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In my opinion it's an incredible moisturizer. I have been using it for about a week and love how my skin looks and feels, very soft and hydrated. This product does have moderate fragrance in case you are sensitive. I do notice improvement in skin tone, discoloration and dark spots. That is a plus when you hit 40, believe me. Overall I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great moisturizer. I saw a difference in my skin after one use. I would recommend this moisturizer to a friend. It made my skin feel soft and smooth. I have used it for one week and I see improvement in my skin. The only complaint is the scent is really strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I genuinely loved this product! My skin is not very dry, so i appreciated how it is a mixture of serum and moisturizer! Serum allows the ingredients to penetrate better while moisturizer hydrates my skin for the entire day without being very heavy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product for people with dry skin! You don't need much and it feels amazing when applying. I unfortunately have oily skin, due to humidity, so it compounds my issues. I will be keeping it to use when we move to a dryer climate and can get better usage out of the product! If your skin needs some help in the hydration department this would be my top recommendation!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think overall this product is a really good moisturizer, it does make your skin feel tighter which I enjoy. Over time I hope it does prevent wrinkles, that'd be pretty darn great! The only thing I wasn't too keen on was the smell, but I really don't notice it once it's applied to my face so I can't complain too much about that. I will probably be repurchasing when it comes time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with Garnier ultra-lift 2-in-1 serum and moisturizer. My skin is so soft and feels lifted. It is very hard for me to find face scream that won't make me break out. I haven't had one break out!!! Best facial scream ever!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Garnier Ultra-lift 1-in-2 serum+moisturiszer. It has everything I ever wanted to from a face cream. IIt absorbs the super fast and I can already see results,my skin feels so soft and smooth. The pro-retinol and the rice-peptides working together to fight those wrinkels i have. Thisi is truly a keeper for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works wonderfully as a moisturizer. I am a person who is always looking for a new moisturizer and this is something I would consider buying in the future. After 3 uses I can already tell a difference the smoothness of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this stuff!! Makes my face feel amazing and it smells fresh. I'd definitely recommend this to others. Wrinkle free is the way to be :) I'm so happy I was given a chance to try it. I'll definitely keep on using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I started using this product I can tell the difference in the smoothness of my skin, the smell is nice and it goes on so well. I can tell it has a firming effect as well, I am hoping as I continue to use this product, which I will, I will notice more and more positives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that it doesn't make your skin all oily. It also absorbs quickly. I use it twice a day. normally I don't put anything on my face before my make up, but I wanted to see about the oil factor. It works great. The smell is good also [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Garnier SkinActive Ultra-lift for about 4 days now and I have not noticed any difference to my skin. I did not like the smell of the product but I will say the fragrance is very light so it was not a huge problem. My main concern is the fact that I have to apply other moisturizers because this product is not moisturizing enough for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My whole life I have had oily skin. When I moved to the desert the oil deminished and I started to notice changes in my face. Wrinkles and spots. I was so excited to try the Ultra-Lift 2-in-1 Serum + Moisturizer. I just put it on before bed and I was right it smells and feels amazing. I plan on using it 2 times a day and treating my face for a change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this first before I went to bed and I wasn't crazy over it. My skin felt moisturized but I kind of left a sticky residue. But when I woke up the stickiness was gone and my skin looked and felt AMAZING. I don't think I'd use this twice a day like recommended just because of the sticky residue but it is now apart of my nightly skin routine and I will be repurchasing when I run out.

"This product is AMAZING.. My skin is very sensitive, and I didn't feel irritated, it is very light , not oily I LOVED THAT.. My face light up. I got a lot of compliments of how smooth my face looked. A+ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is really good. I currently do not have wrinkles but I definitely want to prevent them. This product only takes one pump, and dries very fast into the skin. The only drawback is the smell while applying, it's kind of a floral sink. But as soon as it dries, you can't even smell it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I already feel like my skin has been tightened after the first use! It's not super moisturizing but I have super dry skin, so maybe it's just not for me. I would recommend trying it thought. I absolutely love the packaging and the pump is the best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this because it is not heavy but still moisturizers. I use it at night
A little greasy. I was expecting a nice soft velvety serum feel. As far as wrinkles I only been using it a week so don't know. After this bottle I won't repurchase. Don't like the texture of it.
Moisturizes without being oily like others I've used. I've used for less than a week and can already tell the difference in how my skin looks and it feels great! Will definitely be my new go-to! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was surprised how much I liked this product. I normally use high end skin care and this product was comparable. It was moisturizing without feeling greasy and made my skin look hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Pleasant light smell. Great moisturizing cream. My face felt smooth without shine that most soft and hydrated. Have not used it long enought to notice any wrinkle reducing qualities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love it!! The viscosity of the product is perfect and I love the smell! I love the way it feels on my skin and how light weight it is. I would definitely purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So as my title states, I loved this as a moisturizer. It's light and airy and my skin loved it. However i didn't really see a difference with any wrinkles as the bottle stated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great moisturizer! I have combination skin & I really fell in love with how moisturized it left my skin. Smells pleasant. Easy to blend in and use. Lasts a good while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Its seems to kinda help I feel it tighten my skin when put on but no physical changes that I can notice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer has amazing qualities and my skin has not felt this smooth and clean. Highly recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for a few weeks and I can see a small different. Works well and smells nice. It's lightweight and helpful to tighten skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the Ultra Lift 2 in 1 serum moisturizer for a week or more and I don't see a big difference in my skin. And the smell is not very pleasing at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best I have tried doesn't dry out my face and leaves it feeling clean. I don't have very many wrinkles so I can't judge that but I will continue to buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Good and excellent product for the wrinkles, smell is good. I recommend a my friends, i use the product for 1 week or more i see the results, thanks . :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really like this product. It doesn't irritate my skin. It has a great smell. It's light weight. Doesn't feel greasy on my skin. My skin feels fresh and more firm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't get past the fragrance. I really wish this product came in an unscented or fragrance-free version. It works really well under my Lancome powder foundation or actually just about all my powder foundations.
i think this is a good product i like the consistency and the smell but i do not like that this is kind of sticky and leaves sticky feeling on the skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product really works. I started to feel my skin tighten. It smells good. It'll last a while and it has decent amount of product in the bottle. I love how the product is in a spiral, it's something that I never seen in a product. The spiral catches your attention. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product - the first thing that I noticed was that the packaging is very appealing. It has spirals in it so that you can see the cream and you will always know how much is left. It pumps out easily, has a mild scent and feels very thick. However, it spreads easily as you apply it and does not leave a stick residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"lightweight & effective, doesn't mess up makeup. Love it"
"Looks ok when applied, but 'peals' off while applying makeup. Waste of good money!"
Product Does Not Work!!!!!!!!!.used it for several months now and no results will not be buying anymore from you any longer...
"Have noticed a real improvement! I have seevteviees about the fragrance, but I find it pleasant, so I guess it's different for each person??? Also love Ultra Lift Daily Moisturizer!"
I like that its combination perfect for traveling. Feels good & little goes a long way
Smooth silky texture. Skin looks and feels younger in just about a week.
it works for me; been using it for a few yrs; we'll be using it forever
VERY disappointed you discontinued this product! I loved it and have been using it for years!!!
it's might work if you younger than 30 but i use 3 pack already nothing change
It goes on smooth and is refreshing..
I have been using this product for 6 months. It works great for my skin. Ordering another 4 bottles.

Have been using this product for years. I love it. Don't feel like I have had any new wrinkles.
