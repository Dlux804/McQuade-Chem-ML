"I've always had fairly dry skin and if I moisturized, my face would break out. The night cream makes my face feel so good and I love the smell! I don't have those dry flakes (or break out) anymore. Please don't ever quit making or ""improve"" - it's great just the way it is!"
"I love this moisturizer it feels great on the skin and smells so good, also leaves my face feeling hydrated. I was looking to get the day cream but then I noticed all the ingredients are the same so whats the difference between the night and the day cream? Why sell two versions of the same thing?"
I have used this product for quite a while now and have had great results.
"I like this product and have used it for awhile. It seems to help my rosacea from getting worse, but it does not cure it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"About 2 months ago, I posted a review after using this product for a week. I loved it then.... and love it even more now. Right away I noticed that my skin felt well balanced. Well, 2 months later my skin looks great! Typical moisturizers usually make me breakout, but that has not been the case with this product. My skin is smoother and clearer. I'm hooked!"
"Bought this a few weeks ago, doesn't seem to do much. My skin is dry and flaky when I wake up in the morning. It smells nice and it goes on smoothly, not greasy."
"As much as I love the texture of this cream, it is amazing, I just can't take the smell. I don't know how to describe it, but the smell makes me nauseous feeling and I can't wait for it to soak in my skin completely. Again, the texture is exactly what I'm looking for in a night cream, but it's had to move from countertop to under the sink. If it was fragrance free. I'd be a user for life."
As another reviewer said..... this stuff makes you BREAK OUT BAD!! Do not use if you are acne prone... i cant fathom what it is but something in this product gives me acne. I thought it the first few times i used it.. but thought it was coincidental. So i took a break and my acne healed. Tried it again..... and same thing... nasty break out. Went off it and the acne healed. Will not use again and dont recommend!!
"My dermatologist told me to switch to a lotion that is non-comedogenic. I chose to try this one (which was more expensive than many of the others at the store) and found that it burns my face soooo badly! As soon as I rub it into my skin it stings horribly and turns my face a bright, bright red! I am so disappointed and I wish I could get my money back. :("
"I've been using this product for a few months and I love it! I'm not so sure about the whole ""natural"" part of it. However, it feels so light on my skin. Its nice to use with acne because it moisturizes the dry parts of my skin without clogging my pores and causing more acne."
I am a 58 year old woman and I still have breakouts with a lot of moisturizers plus my skin is dry. I use this under my make up. It does not cause me to break out in acne and it isn't greasy that it makes my makeup dissolve on my face. I love the smell and my skin already looks better. I highly recommend this product.
"I wanted to like it. But it is, hands down, the WORST moisturizer I've ever used. There is a burning sensation when applied that lasts half an hour or so. And my skin feels drier after than if I had applied nothing at all. Looking at the list of ingredients, one also wonders whether it should be called ""natural"" at all!"
"I was looking for a natural product without all the ""addictives and cancer causing junk"" that most companies put in their moisturizers and charge an arm and a leg for!. I woke up this morning with smooth and amazing soft skin on face, hands and neck! I love that it is not greasy and a great creamy texture..just glides on my 62 y/o face! I love it!!!!!!"
I have been using Neutrogena Naturals for many years. I have found that this product stands up over the test of time. Regardless if it is summer or winter I always have the perfectly moisturized skin without feeling oily or too dry. I have sensitive skin and have tried many other products and non of them have given me the results that this product has.
"I don't know about this. I have sensitive skin and this product proved it. For some reason i thought that because it was a ""natural"" product I would like it. I was wrong. It actually made my face sweat. It's supposed to make my face feel nice, but this did not make my face feel nice. For the price I paid for it, i thought I was getting a better product. I also do not like the smell of it either. It has a weird smell."
I was nervous about buying the product after reading the poor reviews. However after 2 months of use I can say I am totally happy with it. It distrbutes easily and a little goes a long way. Both my boyfriend and I really like the scent. My skin is both softer and brighter.
"I just want to say bravo to Neutrogena for making a product that is dye and paraben free! However, any moisturizer that has active ingredients (anti-oxidant omega bio-nutrient) should NOT be stored in a glass jar because it starts to break down from the oxygen. I heard that long, long ago and recently heard it again on the Dr. Oz show. I know it looks beautiful but lets change to packaging to benefit your customers."
"I have oily skin, and I read the review that this was a great product, but... not for oily/acne prone/sensitive skin!!!! this BURNS in my face :( smells good, the packaging is amazing, but wow the formula is awful :( and it doesn't provide a good moisture :("
"I'm almost completely through my first jar of this night cream and I absolutely love it! This product provides intense hydration without the usual heavy or sticky feeling I've grown accustomed to with other creams. It is so gentle and leaves my skin, soft, supple, and less inflamed around my acne in the morning. I personally really enjoy the subtle sweet scent it gives off as it helps me relax at night. I highly recommend this product!"
"I've been using this for about a week and am now having a strong reaction to it. My face is read, bumpy and itchy. Especially around the eyes and on my jaw line. I don't have particularly sensitive skin so this is a really bad reaction for me. Never had a reaction like this to any other neutrogena products."
"I have the world's most sensitive skin. The nourishing night cream is the best. I have had no reactions, The fragrance is mellow and it moisturizers nicely. I have searched for a night cream that does not irritate my skin. Today there are so many creams that contain florals, citrus and chamomile all of which I have a sensitively to. I highly recommend this cream."
"This product is exactly what the title of this review says: without a doubt, the best moisturizer or cream of any kind I've ever used. Almost 24 hours after I used it, my skin is STILL softer than it was on its best day before using this! HIGHLY recommend! You won't regret buying this!"
"This is the only night cream that works year round for me. I absolutely adore this product. I love the way it smells, the way it absorbs, the way it makes my skin feel and look. I live in Chicago and the winters are tough on my sensitive skin. This is the only lotion I've found keeps my skin from flaking. If it were a man, I'd marry it. Seriously. It's THAT good."
"This product might be ""natural,"" but beware, it is NOT unscented. The scent is fruity and greasy smelling, and sticks around, does not disappear after a few minutes. This is not what I would have expected from a product pitched to the sensitive, and the package labeling is confusing. Some of us have sensitive noses, not just skin. For me, fragrances can trigger asthma attacks!"
"It makes my skin so soft and I love the smell. When I read that it had fragrance added into it, I was really ambivalent about deciding whether I should buy it or not. I'm glad I did because the fragrance is really light and not overwhelming at all. Although, I'd be fine if they let it go. I don't know if it really has moisturized my skin or not, because how can you really tell when your skin is hydrated?"
"Although I have been using this product for only 2 weeks, the first thing that I noticed soon after application was that there was dryness & tautness to the skin under my eyes & over my cheekbones. Then, after a few applications, I began to feel a little mild tingling/burning sensation - not constantly, only intermittently. The cream has a good texture, but does not seem to absorb completely."
i have been using neutrogena naturals night moisterizer for years i love it because its smooth and i can use without any breakouts or allergic reactions i mention this because im allergic to a lot of things and have sensitive skinthank you for making this product
I love this moisturizer. I can apply as much as I want without having to worry about harmful ingredients. Most importantly it hydrates my dry skin without causing breakouts. It's not heavy so it glides on my skin and smells wonderful. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a natural moisturizer.
"I am so pleased that Neutrogena has come out with this line of Naturals products. I love the night cream. When I apply it to my face and neck, it immediately makes my skin softer and smoother. There is no greasy feeling and it smells wonderful. When I wake in the morning, my skin looks and feels great. I love it!"
"It does have a scent but its a great smell. Works all night long and it does not feel too sticky on my face. My skin is very oily so I only put this on my face at night and by the morning, my face is very soft and moisturized. I will buy this over and over again!"
"I had high hopes for this product. As soon as I opened the jar I smelled the fragrance, which I find mildly nauseating. Why does a product that's advertised and promoted as natural need any fragrance in it whatsoever? I don't recall even the regular Neutrogena products having an odor. I haven't had any burning or breakouts in the first few days, but it doesn't quite feel natural, either. I won't buy this product again. Still trying out the other products in this line, but I'm not optimistic."
"I have been using this nightly for about a week and i notice the burning when I put it on, but it's not bad and does not last long. I was hoping that the warmth meant the cream was doing something...hopefully good! It's probably too late for me to look better, but maybe with Neutrogena's help I can keep from looking way worse : )"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this product. Luxurious and yet not greasy. I love the fragrance, it's not too strong but pleasing. I like when products have a soft scent that's refreshing. Sometimes when there is no fragrance you smell the base of the ingredients and that's not good either. One expensive product I used reminded me of an ashtray....not using that again. I will most likely try the other products in the line."
"In my climate, Pacific NW, the air in winter is on the dry side even though it rains quite frequently. The Naturals products have kept my facial skin soft and moist throughout the day when used before bed time. I highly recommend the Naturals products. They certainly do not have oder as some have mentioned."
"This product is great. It is light, nongreasy, and moisturizes as intended. Finding the right facial products is difficult. Some people may be allergic to certain ingredients and others may have congested pores which is causing the burning. I have sensitive, oily skin and this product didn't irritate my skin. I think it is best to use it along with exfoliating, a cleanser, and a toner for the best results. Thank you."
"I bought this product after reading the ingredients which looked safe. After using it one time I had itchy red areas on 3 places on my face. I have no history of allergies and was very surprised with this response. For a test, I applied it to my lower leg with the same response. I would like to know all of the ingredients to determine which is the allergen to avoid in the future."
I don't go to sleep without applying this moisturizer. My skin was incredibly dry after using a benzoyl peroxide acne treatment and this healed all of the rough spots left behind. It leaves your skin feeling smooth instantly. I also use it on my hands.
"I have extremely dry skin and struggle to keep it quenched. This stuff is amazing, the only lotion I have found that gets rid of the rough spots. My mom has similar skin and after i showed her this product she couldn't believe she'd been buying expensive creams and switched to this. It also smells wonderful, like I said, THE BEST!"
Nice and light. No grease on my face or pillow. No tingling. Noticed less dryness almost immediately.
Haven't used it long enough to see visible results but very refreshing. Currently use the face cleanser & love it.
"I've been using this product for a while and it is great in the winter. It's great in general because it doesn't have a strong scent, it's made without all those icky chemicals, and it makes my skin feel rejuvenated."
"I have used this product for 2 years. I have have dry sensitive skin, many things burn my skin. This is the BEST stuff and I'm not worried about what chemicals may be in it"
It's moisturizing but irritating... my skin is burning and red after each application. The scent is very unnatural. Tried it 3 days and now I'm having a break out with many red pimples and white heads all over my face...very disappointed :(
I only use Neutrogena products on my face and have for years. I was at my dermatologists office today and noticed that he had product advertisements for Neutrogena!!!!!! The products are the best I've ever used.
"Since I began using the cream over a year ago, I noticed a difference in my skin, it is softer, and smoother. I also noticed my skin has more of a glow since using this product."
I have a very dry skin and have been trying various night creams but this one suits me perfectly. It moisturizes just enough not to make it greasy. My face looks clearer and softer in the morning. I love it.
"I just got this product a few days ago, and it feels great on my skin. Moisturizes in the evenings nicely without being too greasy. My skin feels soft and even in the morning. And it doesn't smell like chemicals or overbearing with fragrance."
"I'm not big on beauty products and I hate perfume smells, but this night cream is awesome. Thick, but not heavy or greasy. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. And I love the soft scent. Please don't stop making this and don't change the formula!"
"I love this cream and the whole line. I wish the company would create Natural hair care and cosmestic products because I love the face line so much! Until they do, I will just have to buy my natural hair products and cosmestics else where. . ."
"I love this product soooooooo much! When the people say that it doesn't clog your pores, they are soooooooooooo right. My skin BREATHES!!!!!! It is amazing!"
"and I love this night cream! I use an acne treatment mask every night, and this cream moisturizes perfectly afterwards. I've never felt any burning at all, it's never caused any breakouts, and I wake up every morning with perfectly moisturized skin!"
I have been using this and other Naturals products for a year. I also tried more expensive organic products from other manufacturers. I like the Neutrogena Naturals the most. I am 58 years old and have aging skin.
I love this stuff... ive used it every night since i go it and it keeps my face nice and smooth and mosturized. i have a big problem with having dry skin. and now after i wash my face i no longer have that problem ! very grateful !
"I have to say I'm pretty impressed with this product. I was expecting little add it was very inexpensive, but it smells so good, and it hydrates really well."
"I am a faithfil Neutrogena customer and just love the Naturals line. I just bought this night cream to try and just love it. It is perfect for my combination skin and feels so smooth on my skin all night. I am glad to read the other reviews concerning the smell as I thought I bought a bad batch lol! So yes, this night cream does have a nasty smell but that doesn't affect the performance of the product. So get over the smell and be thankful for this product that works great!"
This is a nice light moisturizer that disappears into my skin very quickly.
"i'm pretty satisfied with this product, improve my skin."
"I only use natural products and have it seems tried everything out there and spent tons of money on products that just don't work. This night cream is totally different. It goes on so light but I see such a difference in the morning. It hasn't caused acne for my oily, acne prone, aging skin and I don't wake up greasy, but instead soft and smooth. And I have noticed a difference in the depth of my wrinkles. Love this night cream."
"I have been using the Naturals moisturizer and cleanser after being away from Neutrogena for several years and I couldn't be happier. My 43 year old usually dry skin is now soft, smooth and even dewey like it used to be. There is a scent but it is not nearly as offensive and artificial as another leading drugstore brand I tried. I like to use the night moisturizer in the morning too now that the weather is getting cold."
"I love this product and all the others in this line as well. I have oily, dry, acne prone skin and finally found a product that keeps my acne and dry skin away. Many products I have tried have been much more expensive and either treats my acne or dry skin but not both."
"I have had trouble with excess oil and breakouts for most of my life. Lately, I have had some dryness in places, as well. After using this product for about a week, my skin feels much healthier, and it seems to be smoother. I'm not breaking out and I wonder if I'll ever need to exfoliate again. I am very impressed with the quality."
I really love the feel of this cream and it gives me great results...I love that it doesn't have any harsh crazy chemicals.
"I use regular Neutrogena products, but ther seems to be something caustic in this one. Why hasn't the comapany writtebn a response or warning?"
"there is a reaction on my skin, kind of spicy and ichty, so right now, I am going to use it on my neck"
I love this night cream. Not too heavy & greasy. Yet leaves my skin very smooth. The fragrance is nice and fresh as well. love it.
"After using countless products to help with my dry, flakey and sensitive skin, I've finally found a miracle in this cream. Please Please Please don't discontinue this product!"
"Really like that Neutrogena has a Naturals line. I use night cream for daytime as my skin is quite dry, and this cream is great. The scent I find is quite light, unlike what some of the other reviews have said."
"Bought this product because I love Neutrogena products and was really attracted to the fact that it is natural. However, upon application my skin becomes red and itchy. I have oily skin which isn't generally sensitive. Other products I use are the On The Spot Treatment, Pore Refining Daily Cleanser, Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover and Stress Control Toner. This is the only one that gives me problems! Sad to say I will be returning."
"I thought this would be good for my skin since it says it is all natural. Turns out when I woke up, I had a huge itching rash on my face and I had movies with friends that day. I'm never using this product again, but I do recommend the oil free fresh moisture cream. That one worked out way better for me!"
"Bought this on a Monday. By Thursday, I noticed splotches around my mouth and nose (I never have issues with my skin). As the day progressed, the splotches got itchy, and, the itching made it hard for me to sleep. I will never buy this product again."
"This product is fantastic. The first thing I noticed when I started using it was the scent, which is AMAZING! It smells like candy, pure and simple. I could sit for hours and just smell the cream, so it is convenient that I can fall asleep to its scent! Other than the smell, which you can tell I am crazy about, the cream does work wonderfully. It goes on cleanly, and is not sticky or over-bearing. I know it seems strange with a ""natural"" product, but those with sensitive skin might want to be cautious with this one."
Bought this a week cream and the daytime cream and both burned my skin felt like it was on fire! Plus next day in the morning noticed my pores were huge and pores were clogged and little blackheads had popped up on the side of my face. This hasn't happened in years. Disappointed wish I would have stuck with the sensitive cream or gotten the water boost gel cream maybe would have had better luck.
"I love the way this cream absorbs, smells and how it makes my skin feel!"
So far my skin is loving it! My skin feels well balanced.
Works wonders at night! My skin is so soft and hydrated in the morning.
"Leaves skin smooth, and hydrated. Nice smell, and most important are it's natural ingredients."
I am so glad this is free of harsh chemicals. I would recommend it to my friends.
I have really dry skin and chose this product for being natural etc. After about 5 minutes of applying this to my face it started burning and itching ! I tried to wash it off but my face is still burning now! Really disappointed and concerned.
"I have sensitive skin, so cannot use the Retnol products in the Neutrogena line. This is the only thing I have found for night and it seem to do the trick. Wish they had an eye cream to go with it."
"I have used this for a year, my skin's soft ans as smooth as silk, I love that. But now I'm pregnant and want to know whether I can keep applying this or not. Which product is good for skin of preganncy?"
This product is very creamy and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. My skin feels smooth and fresh when I wake. However I don't like the overpowering scent...I assumed 'natural' meant fragrance free or at the very least a lighter scent.
"I love that this product comes in a jar and not plastic, the product is lightweight but moisturizing, doesn't clog your pores and leaves your skin looking great. I have acne and use a prescription retinoid and the days when I'm not using it, I use this and it doesn't irritate my skin and feels great. I wish they would come up with something in their naturals line in a jar that has an SPF, I really like the ingredients and how it makes your skin feel."
"I am in love with this night cream! It goes on very well, the scent is lovely, but not too over powering, and a little goes a long way which is nice. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated right away, and in the morning it feels even better! LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
"This is great for my dry sensitive skin. It replenishes the moisture well & smells good, with being overly scented. I tried this because my fav Neutrogena Light Night Cream disappeared. I suspect it was discontinued. & I was devastated. This is a worthy replacement and a lot cheaper. I use it day and/or night. It's my new go-to!"
"This feels and smells wonderful! Not greasy, lightweight. Will buy again!"
Love this product! Was upset when local grocery store stopped selling it. Have been searching for it elsewhere.
"I really really really wish the ""naturals"" product didn't have synthetic fragrance with unlisted ingredients. It stings my face when I put it on and even a bit after it dries. Seems to moisturize ok, but probably would not buy again."
"When used with other basic Naturals products this works. Especially in winter when it is dry, it helps keep your face moist over night. It does have a different smell, but to me it smells like an unknown fresh fruit"
"Excellent nourishing night time cream! It feels great on my skin! It is light weight, does not clog the pores, oil free, great moisturizer and it leaves my facial skin soft and bright. Love this night cream product!!!"
I have very sensitive skin and this has worked well for me. I have tried many so I was happy to find this. I have used it for over a year wih no issues.
"I have very dry, very sensitive, aging skin. After using it both morning and night for just one week, my skin is much less flaky and feels much softer. The fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering. I highly recommend this product."
Irritates and burns skin as soon as I put it on my face at night. I thought that I will get used to it but it gets worse and worse every time I use it. Finally yesterday night I had red bumps that looked like welts on my face. I had to wash that off and put cetafil...I was ok this morning but I am not using that night cream ever again...
"After using it for only a week, my face started to develop these red, itchy, dry spots. My face felt burned every time I used it and it became hard to put on makeup because of the dryness and itchiness. I continued using it hoping it'd get better after I used it for a longer period of time, but it didn't. My skin just got dryer and dryer. It started to break me out too! I did not have that many white heads before using the cream! Bottom line, I do not recommend this product."
Love this moisturizer. My skin looks much more even and healthier. It's not extremely moisturizing but works fine. Great product for the price!
"I would love to be able to use this line, but I really hate to walk around smelling my face all day, or go to bed smelling my face! Throw out the fragrance!!"
"While the product seems to help my skin, the fragrance is anything but natural. I'm trying to get used to it, but not sure about my staying power. Love your products and this is the first issue I've ever had. Fragrance is like juicy fruit gum..."
My wife really like it..... so buying it for the 2nd time :0
"I have never used such bad quality facial cream, and it's hard to make the cream evenly distributed. Also, the smell is strange"
"After two uses my skin broke out and the smell was bothersome, after the third use I washed it off and have not gone back."
"It was very creamy & goes on nice but when I woke up, my skin was super oily & greasy....I would not use this again...."
This product is not good .. This cream gave me break outs.. I thought it was supposed to be good but it's not ! Don't waste ur money!
I found it not moisturizing. Not the best to moisturizer skin at night. The smell is very strong for a facial night cream.
These natural product don't work for my skin. I am so disappointed with them.
"I have combination skin in the T area, what mositurizer would you reccommend for my skin type?"
The smell isn't that great and it gave me a breakout on my face. Very disappointed! :(
