"I bought this after I noticed some things I didn't like due to getting older, it does work! Don't expect surgery results, but I noticed results immediately after the 1st use. I noticed the smile lines around my eyes weren't so noticeable, the laugh lines were less defined. All in all I am very happy with this Olay product."
I have been on this for years and my skin looks much younger than I actually am. Great products
I love this product it made my face so smooth and had it feeling so soft. It also had a really nice smell to it. I would recommend this to anyone
This cream is the best I've ever found and I'm sticking with it. Luxurious feel for a quality performance at a price I can reasonably afford. It really helps my desert-dry skin.
FIRST TIME AROUND WITH THIS PRODUCT...I NOTICE SOME DIFFERENCE ..I FIND DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WORK ON EACH OF US DIFFERENT... I GIVE THIS OLAY A EXCELLENT REVIEW
"Of all the creams I have used in this price range, this Olay face cream seems to have the best effect on my skin. I like the Olay products very much and their prices are within reason."
I've used Olay Regenerist for years with excellent results. Jet offers this item at a good price and it beats traveling 30+ minutes to the nearest store - and then they may not have this item. Items ordered from Jet arrive quickly and within the promised time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
have used Olay products for years and continue with Regenerest - all my face products are this brand and keep my skin soft and plump - am 63 and people find it hard to believe - no crows feet yet and chin still pretty firm (treat neck same as face and no wrinkles at base of it either! Can't say enough about Regenerest
Best thing I've tried on my face.
"Immediate difference in skin tone, smoother, tighter skin after every use"
My mother used original since I can remember. At 86 she passed away and all people kept saying was she does not look 86 her skin is perfect hardly any wrinkles at all. I miss her terribly but every day I use my original Olay to keep her near. Thank you for still making it! I turn 50 this September and I got to say I don't look 50 :) I'm a true Olay girl just like my beautiful mãe was.
"This cream is like a miracle in a bottle, I will never use anything else, since I started using this product my skin seems to be more firmer and definitely just beautiful clear skin. I have sensitive skin and this works perfect for me, I will never trust anything else, this one is definitely a keeper. Thanks Walmart.Com and Pharmapacks for such a great product at a reasonable rate, also thanks for fast shipping. I will definitely recommend this product to a friend."
"I liked everything about the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, leaves no after greasy feeling and your face feels very smooth. I also think that after a little over a week the lines around my mouth and chin have diminished a little. I am looking forward to seeing how this will continue. I am a senior citizen in Florida and dry skin from the sun and lines is a hazard."
I have used this product for a long time now and I really appreciate the fact it is fragrancy free and it keeps my skin (at 88) soft. I with more of your products were fragrant free since my eyes are so easily affected by even the slightest fragrance.
Great price and free shipping. I'm 60 look 40. Is it the face cream? I think so.
"It really helps me look younger I tried another product priced the same. I went right back, after A month. I noticed my face didn't look as young. Never again will I switch."
Happy with product. Have used it before and my face feels smoother and softer. Don't discontinue this product ever. Happy customer :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin. I have been using this fragrance-free cream for years. I've tried some of the department stores more expensive ones, but I find this cream to be as good...and you can't beat the price. I use it every night."
"Silky smooth texture, has made a huge difference in my skin! I love how it soaks in and has a plump, not greasy effect. Best for night and mornings if not wearing makeup — not suitable for under makeup as it will pill up your product. It's PERFECT for “no makeup makeup” days, paired with a solid mascara and brow. It will smooth lines and fill in pores."
"I never write reviews; probably because I've never really been impressed with any product before that prompted me to write a review. Until now. I purchased the Olay Micro Sculpt Cream today and I already love it! Plumper skin, visually reduced wrinkles and a glow I haven't seen in years. And I'm 55. Highly recommend and can't wait to try more Olay products!. ❤️"
I live in a very dry climate and this is the best that I've found to moisturize skin. As a moisturizer this feels amazing when first applied and after using for a few days your skin feels soft and moist even when you skip a day.
"I love this product speaking for my self only I have a under active thyroid and have tried just about everything from doctors cream, to expensive over the counter creams. Nothing was working my skin was very dry, flaky, scaly texture my makeup would not even stay on after reading all the reviews on this product I decided to try it.... This product worked for me I'm so in love with my skin now it's soft, smooth,and hydrated my makeup go's on flawless now. TY OLAY!!!!"
I have been an Olay user for years. I was sure that the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream would live up to the standards of prior products. I have purchased a total of 12 jars(3 unused so far) and have seen NO improvment or change as promised. I do not expect miracles at my age (71) but do expect some small and positive changes. Not happening with this product.
"I have been using Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream for several months. When I meet someone who has not seen me in a few years, the comment is, ""Wow you look great, you haven't changed!"" I use is every day and I do see the changes in my skin. Thank you so much."
"I just tried this cream and loved the way it made my face feel and look. Unfortunately the perfumed fragrance is so strong it gave me a headache and I had to return the cream to the store. I would LOVE it if Olay would make this in a Fragrance Free option. Until then, I can't use it."
"I am at an age where the well set wrinkles are here to stay. But using the sculpting cream and night moisturizer plumps up those smaller lines and gives my aged skin more life than it's had in years. So although the wrinkles are beyond the point of no return, these products really improve my overall appearance. Should have tried it sooner!"
"I have used Olay for several years and have recently tried this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer. I love how hydrating it is and how it makes my skin feel supple after just a few days of use. I also especially love that it's fragrance-free as I tend to be allergic to harsh fragrances that many moisturizers come with. Although I am writing this review as part of Influenster #contest, I honestly like Olay as a product."
"I have used Olay Regenerist products for years and I love them. They work really well and have kept my skin in really good condition. I wish I had paid for attention to my skin when I was younger but now I am doing so with Olay. This Micro-Scuplting Cream really does make a difference too. I went without it for a month and my skin showed a big difference. I don't want to do that again. Love, love. love this stuff."
"I finally found a product that works and it didn't cost a small fortune! Regenerist Microsculpting Cream is the best product I ever tried. I'm 60 and I have those horrid marionette lines below my nose and around my mouth. After about one week I noticed that they were not as noticeable and now, one month later they're barely there. I don't know how OLAY did it, but this product is a miracle cream. I'm so happy and my self confidence has gone up several notches. Now I'm going to try the Overnight Wrinkle Cream!"
"What a great product... I have been using it for a few weeks and I am starting to see the difference.It is defiantly starting to firm up my face,and moisturizing deep into my skin.Being unscented makes it perfect for me because my eyes tend to be sensitive to fragrances. I can't wait to see what the future results will be."
I am 64 years old and live in the desert. My skin was dry and tired looking. At my daughters urging I tried this product and now two years later I feel my skin looks bright and healthy and I am told I look much younger than my age. I am very happy with the results and would recommend it to any woman.
A good friend gave me my first bottle of this cream. I am not into all the hype and so it sat on my counter until I had run out of my very expensive department store cream. I saw the difference for myself the next morning. By the time I had used it a week I had friends and coworkers asking me what I was up to as I was glowing! Many wanted to know what new make up I was using so they could go and buy it too! I had to tell them it was OLAY! Thanks for making such a wonderful product and making me feel like a GODESS!
This product is exactly as advertised. I could see a visisble difference in the texture of my skin and my sagging jawline actually appears to be lifted and smoother. I am the biggest skeptic EVER about most product advertising - I am amazed and grateful for the results I got from this cream. It smells wonderful and I won't be without this one!!!
"I really liked the regenerist product and felt like it really did a good job of moisturizing my skin. It didn't make me break out and really absorbed into my skin nicely. When I woke up the next morning my skin felt moisturized and bright. I'm not sure if it has all of the fancy ingredients like peptides, AHAs, etc. but for the price point it's a great product. #Contest"
"I was looking forward to using this after reading the reviews. This broke my skin out and the itching was bad. I'm sure it works well for some, but I was allergic to something in this cream. I have used other Olay products in the past and never had a problem. The regenerate line just doesn't work on my skin."
"I was looking through my magazine and came across a sample of this product. I tried it on and the texture of this product was nice and smooth. I love the scent of it and as I applied on the product, I noticed my skin looked so much awake and youthful! I say thus because usually I look tired and my skin looks oily. But this product made my skin looked smooth and soft. Loving it! Now I'm hooked and I plan to purchase this moisturizer tomorrow !!"
"I had to stop using the product becuase I found the fragrance overwhelming and the product increased the redness in my face. Perfumes are known to cause problems with sensitive skin types. So far, I've only been able to use the frangrance free Serum without the issue of redness and I LOVE IT! More fragrant free products would be greatly appreciated!"
"I would most likely continue to use this product if it wasn't for the perfume in it. I really hope they come out with a fragrance free version, this one really bothered me. Otherwise I thought it was great, not worth walking around with a headache though. :( Did give my skin a beautiful glow and stayed plump and moisturized all day."
I love this cream! I have tried every cream you can think of even creams over $100. But this one is amazing! The first time i started using it someone came up to me and said wow your skin looks really good. I ran out of this cream the other day and had to use something i just had as backup and i could tell the difference it was like my face was thirsty for it lol! anyways it's not about spending tons of money on high priced name brands but what works for you and this one definitely does!! Thanks Olay
I have used the Microsculpting cream now for three weeks. Ihave really tried to like it but I don't. It is very sticky on my skin and I have pimples that are forming under my skin and blackheads that I haven't had since my younger yrs. I am 57 yrs. old.
"I have been using regenerist and other Olay products since I was 14 years old. On the advice of my mom. (rest her soul) She always had the most beautiful flawlwss skin. Part genetics and definately all Olay products as a committed routine. Thank You, Este"
I used the Olay Regenerating Moisturizer and then saw this in an ad. Tried it and will use nothing else ever again. Its WONDERFUL. Does everything its advertised to do and then some. Everyone noticed a difference. Worth every penny. Can't wait to try the new eye roller stuff.
I learned a lot about skin care products a few years ago as I was selling them for a direct sales company and I know that hyaluronic acid and amino peptides are the best ingredients to plump skin and renew cells. I recently researched hyaluronic acid and am completely convinced it brings life back to cells. I love what this cream is doing to my face.
"I had really bad wrinkles under my eyes and forehead. Nothing I had tried worked including those very expensive professional products. I've been using this cream for a couple months now and what amazing results. Most of my wrinkles have visibly disappeared and I could not be happier. I'm 51 yrs old and am told I look 15 yrs younger all the time, thank you OLAY Regenerist!"
"I have a combination oily skin and needed to get started working on my anti-aging skin regime. I started really late, I'm now in my mid-40s. I find this product a little too thick and greasy. I have to switch to a lighter one. When I go get my facials, the therapist says that I have millia and need to change my moisturizer. I was using the regenerist :|"
Product met my expectations.
I have used this cream for awhile now. Like how it makes your face feel especially after a shower.
Liked the bonus pack of cleansing cloths so much we bought more. Olay Regenerist Moisturizer has been great!
Especially like that it is unscented. Scents are the prime reason I stayed away from Oil of Olay products. I also like the unscented serum.
I like this product. I only use it at night before sleep. I use a different moisturizer during the day. I noticed my face looked more refreshed within about a week. I 'm sold and will keep purchasing this.
"I have tried many wrinkle creams and this is the only one that hasnât broke me outâI have rosacea so I canât just put anything on my face! Thanks olay, Iâll continue using this product!"
"Started using this product a couple years ago. Love how it works, but the plastic under the top cover is way too hard to take off. There's got to be a better way."
Finally! I found something that cleared up my dry flaky forehead and chin area! This works great without leaving a gross residue. Will definitely buy again.
"Love this Olay product! It is better than my department store moisturizers! Smooth, creamy and hydrates your skin!!"
Hydrates your skin very well. I have lines on my forehead and between my brows and this cream softens the lines so they are not as noticeable.
"I purchased it to help my skin from aging and restore the moisture. It was winter time when I bought it, help immensely for restoring my skin and kept from drying out. I love how it makes my face feel!"
"Being using for a month. It's light weight and great under makeup. My result: no more breakout, even skin tone and younger looking skin. LADIES, ITS WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY"
This is my favortie product of the regenerist collection. I use it everyday and have noticed my skin is firmer and looks soft and clean. I use it day and night. Highly recommend.
This cream is fabulous though the fragrance is so overwhelming that I cannot use it. If Olay develops this exact formula but with SPF 15 and no Fragrance I will be a life-long user!
"If you are looking for a product that stands up to all it claims, this is the one. It really gives the face and neck a lift. I found it also moisturizes without feeling greasy and decreases redness on the cheeks."
I really enjoy this product! It has a really nice smoothing effect to it. It is one of the best moisturizers I've had! I recommend this for anyone with dry skin.
Since I can't afford a face lift. this has to be the next best thing! The Regenrist Micro-Sculpting Cream diminishes the appearance of my wrinkles and sagging jowls. I use it faithfully twice and day and don't ever want to be without it!
"I have used this product from it's entry into the market. I am 81 years old and always told I look younger. Maybe it's my ballroom dancing, but my secret is my OLAY! Dancer"
This product is not to use before your foundation in the morning. It will not supermoisturize. Your makeup will not glide over it. I love the night cream but this is disappointing to me.
I HAVE USED OLAY IN RED BOTTLE FOR OVER 6YEARS AND I SWEAR BY IT HITTING 70YRS.IDON'T HAVE WRINKLES UNDER EYE'S AROUND MY MOUTH THIS IS ALL I USE AT NITE .
I have yet to find out if this product works or not. It seems to go on evenly but it leaves a film on my face leaving my face feeling unclean it also clogs my pores somewhat.I will Overlook these things if the product works though but I will keep hope that these things will be fixed to better the product.
"This product has always been a go-to for me. It helps smooth my skill and hydrate, creating a less visible wrinkles. I have seen it in many magazines independent reviews for best anti-wrinkle creams (and it's always the only affordable one). I recommend that they put vitamin c, tea extracts, and grape seed extract in their formula to make it even better. If they did this, it would be as good as the very expensive products."
"I recently purchased Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer, the night recovery moisturizer, eye moisturizer and the cleanser. I have only used it four days. I have to say I love how my skin feels and looks. I was at a high end department store yesterday with my mother. We tried some makeup samples and the sales lady complimented my skin. I told her what I was using and she was amazed as I am. I will keep you updated as time goes on. Happy to see what a few weeks will look like."
"Easy to apply, skin looks much better, moisturizer is effective."
Great moisturizer and a great Jet price
Good ..not as good as Lancôme.
"I have used olay product since I was a teen. I am now 62. Love love love, Regenerist products!"
Good inexpensive moisturizer without scent!
It works Great. Just like it says.
Love this moisturizer been using it for year tried others but always return to olay
Love this moisturizer but do no understand why it costs so much. Very pricey!!
Excellent price. Prompt shipping
"This stuff is awesome! I have always used high end, brand name products, such as Peter Thomas Roth, and ReVive. Due to my husband losing his job I've been looking for something to compare to those products, and this delivers! The Regenerist products work just as good at a fraction of the price! As a matter of fact when the economy improves, I do not intend to go back to buying those over priced products, because these work just as well, if not better. A very, very pleased customer!"
Along with applying eye cream this facial micro sculpting cream is wonderful! Within minutes I felt a light tingling and tightening of the skin. I love the fragrance and the feel. It absorbs fast. You only need a little bit of this non-greasy wonder. The frangance is light and smells amazingly fresh. I will be using this for a long time.
My grandma has been using this product ever since I remember and she has perfect skin! So I've decided to follow in her footsteps and been using it for a few months now! I love the way my face feels after it. My face feels so much better and I younger! I love it! #Contest.
"I started using this product a couple of months ago when I was delighted to find that it was available ""fragrance free."" I have been using Clinique products to avoid fragrances and I am very happy to be returning to Oil of Olay. I am writing this review in the hopes that the company will continue to support customers who do not feel that added fragrances are advantageous in skin care. Product provides great moisture especially for mature skin. Purchased the fragrance free serum as well!"
This is the first face cream that truly delivers what it advertises. Priced much lower than department store brands and delivers all the benefits. There is a huge difference in my skin. Less sagging and more elasticity. I will be a forever customer:-)
So far I have enjoyed this product very much and have see a difference in the apprearance of my skin. I use both morning and evening. I would like to know if anyone thinks perhaps the regenerist night cream should be used at night and the micro-sculpting for during the day only. I would appreciate any suggestions you might have. I am 59 years young. Thank you!
"Y'all (I'm from the South, so I have to say that), this product really works. I've been using it for about three months, and I can tell a difference in my jaw line (which was really starting to droop). The finer lines around my mouth and eyes are really reduced. I am so impressed with this product. I'll never give it up!"
"I started using this cream about two weeks ago, and I really like how it moisturizes my skin without making it feel oily. I know a lot of people are complaining about the smell, but I like it, and the most important thing to me is how it moisturizes my skin, not how it smells."
I like this product with one exception....THE FRAGRANCE! It is so overbearing and I cannot tolerate the smell for long. I do have allergies and this particular product definitely irritates my nose. I feel congested after applying this product. Please try to formulate this product without a fragrance. Otherwise I believe it works well.
"I bought a jar this past spring, & noticed a difference after the first week. My skin is firmer, smoother, and the forehead wrinkles are less noticeable. I can even wear blush over it without foundation, and still look good. Even my family notices a difference! Thank you Olay for a great product. Diana"
I have used the Microsculpting cream for over a year now. I love it. It leaves my skin feeling silky and soft. It gives me resiliance and a good feeling. I use it morning and night under my mineral foundation. I do not use an additional moistureizer or it gets too heavy. My foundation has a natural sunscreen so I am not missing out on that. I sell cosmetics for a drug store chain and I get many complements on my skin! I tell all that I use regenerist products and why! I absolutely sell the line because I use it!
"I am 56 years old and have friends from my 8th grade class asking me if I get Botox; no kidding. They want to know why I have no wrinkles on my forehead or around my eyes. There is no question that Olay Regenerist MicroSculpting cream is the best product on the market at any price. I started to use Oil of Olay when I was 16, and 40 years later it's still the one brand I'm using."
"When I first bought this I was scared because I have acne, oily, dermatitis and sensitive skin. I have been using this for a few weeks already and my jar is almost gone. Lets just say that I really like how it makes my skin look when I wake up and it does not irritate my acne. I do use acne medication below too but this works nice. I am not sure if it will remove wrinkles since it is my first jar but I love the feeling I get and the glow I get when I wake up. I mean so far this is my best night cream."
"As a former model and account executive for some of the major fragrance and cosmetic companies in the world, I was accustomed to using high end products. Because of the recession, I needed to find an alternative for the interim. I have heard positive feedback on the Regenerist line and decided to try the Micro-sculpting cream. I was stunned! It is the most luxurious cream I have ever used and the results are impressive. Thank you Olay! You can now claim me as a loyal customer."
"I have used Creme De La Mere for years. My facial skin is so dry that nothing else helped. I love Olay products and use many others. Once this cream came out i was in 7th heaven! Finally a product that moisturized my face all day without oiliness and didnt allow any dryness in. It is the single most coveted product i own/use. I love this so much, i pray it never stops being produced."
"I hit the half century years old mark a couple of months ago, and after taking a close look in front of the mirror, i noticed a pronounced sagging under the chin into the neck area......thought i'd go ahead and try the new product. The hydra firming cream is already starting to show it really works. The sagginess is much less noticeable. Less expensive and safer than a face lift! Thank You Olay!"
You will understand why it is the number one selling skin product. I have had the highest end and nothing compares to this cream .
"I'm not sure it is any better than some cheaper creams, so far."
Easy to use...NO SMELL....Works well...Been using this for years... Love it..
Even strangers think I am 50 years old instead of 81.
"I just started using this product. In the first two weeks, I've received so many compliments on how great my skin looks. I am 48 by the way."
This is very thick and greasy I put it on my skin and it makes it break out in acne because it closes the pores.
My second jar. Love the creme on my face. I use morning and night. My skin feels really smooth. Recommend this to everyone .
I love the way this product made my face feel after I took a shower I would apply to my face and neck
"Just started using this about a week ago, but I can definitely see a difference! I couldn't be more pleased with this product!"
"the moisturizer left my skin feeling amazingly soft, it really unbelievable, i only used the sample but now i want to buy the it. ☺"
The price point is excellent for this product. Don't have to buy expensive creams to make a difference!
I have very dry sensitive skin. Other moisturizers leave me with breakouts. This product has saved my skin! All the moisture and none of the irritation. I love the fresh clean scent. This product is amazing!
I put this product on my face and went to bed. The next morning I could already see a difference. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with the results.
This is an extremely good moisturizer. I really need a top notch moisturizer and this product is it. I have used many moisturizers but none have been better than this
I love this cream. I am 62 and my skin looks great. Not like I am 40 but darn good for 62.
This was the day cream that I ordered and it is correct and works very well.
"Considering all of the hype, I wasn't as impressed with this as I had hoped to be."
I absolutely love this product. Been using it for years Thank you
Love it. Not greasy. I like the cleansing cloths which came with it too
"I love this product! It leaves my skin feeling amazing and so soft! I would definitely recommend this, especially for those who have very dry skin! It's helped mine so much! #contest"
I have a shallow spot just below my cheekbone and have been using this product for a couple weeks. The shallow spot is less noticeable . Seems to firm skin pretty good
This cream is one of the best products I have ever tried. I have used numerous products but within two weeks I was able to see a dramatic difference in the firmness and over all glow of my skin. It is the best product I've ever used!
This cream instantly tightens and brightens the skin. It energizes the complextion and you can feel your skin's texture get tighter right after you massage it in. I love this cream!
Excellent product.
Daily skincare
excellent product!
Skin types differs. People have different skin types especially on the face. The cream is nice and not grease but absorbs into the skin but the difference is that I'm having skin reactions ( pimples ). My face look clear and firm but the Olay causes breakouts( pimples). It might work perfectly for others.
I have very dry skin. I normally use a heavy moisturizer but I wanted to try a facial cream that also helped with anti-aging. I could tell immediately after applying that it was not going to be moisturizing enough for my skin. I tried it for two days both day and night. I went back to my standard Cerave moisturizing cream. For now I will just use the olay at night and apply my moisturizing cream ontop. I don't believe I will be repurchasing.
"I applied to my whole face, emphasizing my forehead. Everything was fine until the next afternoon. I applied makeup this morning and by 5 or 6 pm, I felt a BUNCH of tiny bumps and red blotches on my forehead. I am not sure if it was a fluke, I will definitely try again, but my skin Never breaks out. My skin has handled all different types of products and is normally very dry. I am kind of scared of what the other products might do ?! Help !"
"I have been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for about two weeks and my skin is starting to look and feel great. I was surprised at how fast I started seeing result, loving it My skin looks and feels much better. I received this product free as part of an Insiders Program"
I absolutely love how Olay Regenerist makes my skin feel. In just a few weeks away has made my skin feel smoother and look brighter and more even in tone. I've noticed that my wrinkles are much less noticeable and even my friends noticed a difference.
"I have been testing this product as a member of The Insiders Net for free in return for my honest opinion. After using this product for a week and a half, I am noticing some subtle differences in my facial skin. My faces feels firmer, looks brighter and more even toned. I am highly impressed with this product. Definitely recommend this to anyone."
"The finish on this is SO powdery. It made my skin feel dirty. I did not like that at all. I'm usually so pleased with Olay products, too, so this was a bit of a disappointment. This also did not moisturize at all. My skin was just as dry as before. I also don't get what this cream was supposed to ""sculpt."" It did not firm up, tone, or ""lift"" my face, neck, or hands at all. For something that's fragrance-free, there is a definite smell. I did like the smell, but I don't care to give my face, neck, or hands a dirty feel just to smell good."
"Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream gave amazing RESULTS! It's inexpensive, softly silky smooth, & absorbs so freshly! I've seen dramatic changes throughout my entire face! Much firmer filled in skin that looks replenished, lines on my forehead have disappeared, and this even works great as a primer! I never in my life got results from ANY products I have purchased in the past up until NOW! I carry this everywhere!"
"love using olay regenerist. My skin always gets dry, and with olay, not anymore. Ive really noticed a softer and smoother appearance on my skin after just a four weeks. I use this before going to bed and in the morning it's a brand new feeling to the skin, i use and love the fact that theres vitamin C in it. If you dont believe me, try it for yourself and you'll love your skin! ""I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"""
I have to say that I had to google how to open the Olay Regenerist jar! I read the review below and was happy to see that someone was just as frustrated as I was. Definitely need to go back to the drawing board and figure out different packaging for this product. I have used the Olay regenerist serum for years and decided to switch it up and try this. Excited about the product just wish it were easier to use!
"I used this product a few years ago and recently wanted to try it again after using more expensive brands, but I have bought two jars and haven't been able to get either one open after turning the plastic lid clockwise. I returned them because it was too frustrating to try and open the jars - I would recommend finding a different way of getting the lid off and until then I will not be purchasing it again."
"This is a lovely moisturizer. I use it at night after the Miracle Boost Concentrate, and my skin looks plump and hydrated in the morning. I love the Regenerist products, and use many of them. My only complaint is that they don't have as many anti-aging ingredients in them as they used to. However they still make my skin look younger, so I continue to use them. Would like an amino-pepetide complex i serum or toner type product to be available in this line, containing carnosine, green tea, etc."
"I have used Oil of Olay products for some time, starting out with the first pink lotion. I loved it then and still do today. I now use the Regenerist to help with sun damage and fine lines. It goes on smoothly, it's not greasy, and it dries fast! I use it everyday, and I definitely see a difference. I put my makeup on after it dries and my skin looks Youthful and refreshed. It smells nice and it works for me! #contest"
"I enjoy learning about skin care products, always looking for the magic fix to my encreasing face wrinkles. Since I am approaching 70, I think I have tried numerous options, but until you actually have wrinkles, you do not know how they will work. I have returned to only one product that makes any real visible difference to my skin: Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does what it says!!! It makes my face feel soft & I'm happy with it, especially since my skin is very sensitive!!! I've used Olay Products for over 30 yrs. I'm almost 65 yrs old & feel that my use of Olay Products has made all the difference in keeping my skin soft, clean & clear!!! As I'm getting older, I'm needing help with dark spots & wrinkles. They aren't bad & that's why I'm starting to use the Olay Regenerist Line!!!! Thank you so very much!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently purchased this product and I am 65+. I have sensitive skin and have tried many products that cause irritation and have to discontinue using them. This product is gentle on my skin and I can feel and see that it is doing its job. I use it in combination with the fragrance free microsculpting Serum and the two products work well together. My skin feels smooth and has more texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the Regenerist Fragrance Free Micro sculpting crème for at least 5 years. My skin is smooth and hydrated and the crème feels so good at night after washing with Olay's sensitive skin wash. I get tons of compliments on my skin and that is great during the menopausal phase where dry skin creeps in. I ditched the more expensive dept. store crèmes after using this one and getting great results. Can not do without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! It stays with me all day without ever being heavy. I can feel the moisture in my skin but not the cream on my face. As soon as I apply it, my skin instantly looks better. I have tried many other creams and I always come back to this one. And every time I did, I'd say to myself, ""WHY did you even try somethig else? You should know better by now!"" And I do - I love this Cream and I recommend it highly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay Regenerist procucts for about 10 yrs. now. I love all the products I use. People can't beleive I'm 59. I have people tell me my skin is beautiful and ask what products I use. I even had someone pinch my skin as she thought I was in my early fourties. She is now using Olay. I will never switch from Olay. Thank you for making such amazing products that are reasonably priced and you don't have to go to a department store to purchase.
It is a joy to moisturize my face each morning after cleansing it with Regenerist Micro Sculpting Face Cream. I am humbled by the frequent and generous compliments I receive on my facial skin appearance. I am glad that this product is part of my daily beauty repertoire .
"It is very creamy making it match in quality with some costlier brands. It is an excellent moisturizer. And the minute I applied I saw the lines around my eyes were less visible. It is not taking away the lines, but making it less visible. I am using it for the last two weeks. Hope it will help to reduce the lines as well :) just bought the regenerist night recovery cream. Hope both will work good together."
"I love everything about Regenerist Microsculpting cream, (except how expensive it is). It really makes my skin feel soft and supple and creamy. Putting it on under make up really enhances my look, it also seems to help keep my face clear and i love the scent. I just wish it would go on sale more often or be cheaper, and come in a larger container!!"
"I can't say enough good things about this product. Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream I love it. My face feels tighter, the lines around the mouth and eyes are less. I have been using it since it came out and I swear by it. Love all the Olay products. I have been an Olay person since I was in my 20s."
"For the first time in 20 years, I have found a moisturizer I can put on my face that doesn't cause breakouts. As a bonus, it doesn't make my skin look shiny or greasy like other things I have tried. Nothing short of a miracle. I look forward to my first winter without dry skin flakes sticking to my makeup!"
I have been using this moisturizer for a week. It is different. Makes skin feel very soft. It has a dry texture if that is the right way to describe it. As you apply it feels like velvet on your face. Not oily and tacky. Skin feels tight. It does have a glitter in it that makes skins luminous.
"I just got my first jar of the regenerist cream. I've been using the night cream for a while now. I tried some of this at my sister-in-laws. Well, not having much money to spend on just me, I've had to save a while for it. I'm so excited that I finally get to use this everyday. It just makes my skin feel so soft and it smells edible!! Thanks Olay!"
"I started using the ""old"" pink lotion Oil of Olay when I turned 27 . . . . wanted to get a jump on looking under 30 ! I have stayed with Oil of Olay all these years and love many of the new products and I have people shocked that I am 48 . . . most guess around 35. I only have Oil of Olay to thank. I used their SPF products when living in Arizona and Nevada and have used ProX and now onto Regenerist. I LOVE Oil of Olay and can only say thanks for all the good years behind. . . . and ahead !"
"I've rescently begun purchasing different products from the Regenerist line. I've been very impressed with the Serum, microderm/peel system, night recovery cream, and as of yesterday the eye serum. Due to all the rave reviews I decided to try the micro-sculpt cream...I returned it immediately for a full refund! Felt nice initially, but made my mineral make- up cake on. May just not be the right moisturizer with my type of make-up."
"After years of trying different products decided to come back to Olay. Boy am I glad I did. In conjunction with the daily regenerating serum I have seen dramatic results in only 3 days (AM/PM). Beginning to work on stubborn forehead lines, smoothing skin tone and texture. Thank you Olay,"
"This is a good lotion but too perfumed. When will Olay make it in Fragrance Free like they do the Regenerist Regenerating Serum? I won't buy anymore untill they do. Once I opened the jar I bought, I used it for hand cream, not on my face. It was just too much smell right under my nose!"
"I am 58 yrs and I compete within my job field with women who in age are younger. As everyone knows it is a tough world out there. With Olay's products, I am able to feel good about myself and be the best competitive in my career field. With the best of the best products my favorite is Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream. Thank you Olay Chris"
I have used Olay for years probably over 25 years and because it people are always amazed when i tell them my age is 49 and i hear time and time again that I don't look it .When people try to guess my age i have been told that I look as young as 35. I love your product and tell everyone my secret they say I have found the fountain of youth.
"I'm not a girl who is easily impressed but, WOW !!!!!!! I spent alot of money on creams that were over $300.00 and it has nothing on this particular product by Olay. This is not a brand I would ever consider buying untill I told my sister I would try for a week and needless to say, I now have more money to spend on other things. Thanks Sis and Olay for a great product!"
"I love this Micro-sculpting cream. I use it each night and have soft supple skin. I am 60 years old and am told in many settings that my face makes me look younger than my age. I also like the price, since it is much less expensive than the department store products and others."
"I am a 64 year old woman and have been using the micro sculpting cream for several months now along with the serum. I use several OLAY products, but this is my favorite. I feel my skin looks great - very soft and smooth and I receive comments often that I don't look my age! Thanks, Olay!"
I just love this cream! I have used high end department store creams and have paid up to $500.00 for a jar of night cream. I can't believe that Olay has come out with a line of creams that work just as well if not better without spending such huge amounts of money. I am on my third jar and I absolutely will never stop using the Olay Regenerist line. It is the best!
I have never used such product that gave me tremendous results. I have tried several brands out there in the market from the pricey ones to the less expensive but Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream is the one that geve me the results I am looking for. I will not hesitate to recommend this product to my friends since they can see the beautiful results in my face.
"I have tried many skin cremes over the years, from inexpensive to some of the very expensive. This Micro-sculpting cream lives up to the claims. Within 1 week my skin started looking smoother, plumper and healthier. I will keep using this from now on, and I will be adding more of the line to my regular skin regime. The price is great!"
"I found great success in this product. I sleep on my checks and wake with goofy lines all over my face. Using this product, I notice that my skin bounces back much faster and smoother. The only downfall is the package, I really waste a ton of cream because it gets trapped under my long finger nails."
"MY WIFE HAS USED THE MICRO CREME ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.. IT'S THE FIRST AND LAST THING SHE DOES EVERYDAY,,,AND YOU KNOW IT DOES WORK....IT MAKES HER LOOK YOUNGER AND MAKES HER FEEL YOUNGER...AND I ALWAYS FILL HER CHRISTMAS STOCKING EVERY YEAR WITH OLAY GOODIES...THANKS HUSBAND ...DELBERT"
"I have used Oil of Olay for many years. Since turning 50, I felt I needed to step up my Oil of Olay program. I decided to give the Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream a try. It is wonderful. My face feels hydrated all day long. And to my amazement my two co-workers (ages 43 and 48) also use this product. We all see a definite improvement to our face. The texture of our skin has improved and fine lines are barely noticeable. I can't wait to give the Pro X line a try!"
"I have used the Regenerist Sculpting Cream for just TWO Days and the I am SO happy with the results! People wanted to know if I got married, got a face lift or turned back the clock. I even got whistled at by a coworker. At 57, I'll take it! Thanks Olay."
"It works really well in terms of making wrinkles less visible. Not abrasive in terms of application either. I have sensitive skin but have no adverse reaction after applying. Highly effective in making the skin look youthful. Also, best product for the price hands down."
"I have been using REGENERIST, for two years and will continue using the product for many more. I not only look and feel great but my skin looks lovely and NO wrinkles. Every morning when I wake up and take a look at the mirror, not only do I look, young, beautiful, and heathier, I know that I will have a nice day! Did I mentiond that I don't look 52!"
"Last fall my mom and I had facials and the product recommended by the aestetician was the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. I bought it for all my sisters and sister in law, for Christmas. We continue purchasing it as skin feels soft all day, even thought I apply it at night after showering."
"I have been using the Pro X products with success since 1/03/09. Even though I am crazy about the results; I have continued to use the micro-sculpting cream and the Regenerist serum because I find I get boosted results when I do. My skin feels more hydrated and more lifted when using the micro-scuplting cream and now with Pro-X, my eyebrow lines extending from my nose to my mouth are almost gone. I continue to use the Regenerist serum because Pro-X has not introduced a serum into the line yet."
This is truly one of your best products. I receive compliments on my skin all the time. I was at my daughter's not long ago and I didn't have any make up on and her friends could not believe the texture of my skin. I recommend your products every chance I get.
"Two years ago, i had spent money buying my first jar of La Mer but i did not continue to buy a second jar. Right now I am at my second jar of Olay Micro sculpting cream. I am going to visit my mother in Hong Kong 2 weeks later. No doubt, i am going to buy the same cream that I use daily and give it to my mom as a gift. All the truth is here, nothing to describe but Amazing ! other than the value, the most important is the sculpting cream really hydrates my facial skin so well. Thank you Olay"
I have used so many different products. From really expensive to cheep. The regenerist line has given me the best results out of all of them. I love the way the micro-sculpting cream makes my skin feel. Very silky. The eye cream has improved my fine lines and even the deeper laugh lines dramaticly.
"I love Olay products; I use them all the time. Every one always tells me how young I look, but since I started using Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream, people are tell me now that I look like my daughter's sister(who is 30th). I am a 55 yr old grandmother of three so that makes me feel great. Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream is keeping me young looking."
"I am on the way to 80 yrs of age, and my skin looks fabulous. A result of Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. I would be remiss if I did not mention the regenerist eye cream with the gel on the side. I have tried many skin products in my time but none rate the 5 stars I gave Regenerist Micro=sculpting Cream."
"My daughter gave me a set for Xmas and at first I was a little hesitant, since I normally use another product. When I did finally start using it on a daily basis, I was absolutely amazed. It is one if not the best line of products that I have ever used. I am so thankful to her for introducing me to these products."
"SUPER MOISTURIZING, NO GREASY AND ABSORBS QUICKLY!"
Best products you can buy and they are a fraction of the cost of the so called miracle creams.
It really helps keep my face moisturized.
Love this cream so much. I love how it leave my skin so sloft
"Within 5 days felt and saw immediate results in skin tone, color and wrinkles."
I've use Olay for years. People can't believe I 80 years old. So I really like it
Absolutely love this product. Helped my severely dry skin.
Works great and the fragrance free is non irritating for sensitive skin.
"Light weight, goes on smooth. Helps even out my oily and dry places."
"Yes, you need to change THE LID, wayy to hard to get off, and, I'm not seeing all the ingredients in it, that you say is in it......"
This stuff is great. Iâm on my second jar now and can really see difference. I will definitely continue to buy this.
This product is wonderful and it's true that you'll see results in 4 days. It's priced right and the delivery was very prompt.
Made me breakout like a teenager! I'm 34 and my skin would not tolerate this. My dermatologist said it was due to the oil in it.
Has a wonderful feel on skin and doesn't break me out. I have combination skin. I feel like the product works as advertised.
I have been using this product for about a week now. I haven't seen any changes as of yet but I do like the way it makes my skin feel. Soft and silky instead of greasy or sticky. So far so good for me. :)
It was a first time of using Olay and this cream is amazing. My skin becomes more elastic and smooth. I use it for a few weeks and like it so much. Luminous and non-greasy look. I'd recommend this product to everyone.
"Yes yes yes! I have been on a life long search for the perfect moisturizer and I do believe this is it. My skin was so lifeless before I started using this, now it feels softer and smoother than it ever has."
This product is amazing! I loved the smell- even if it was frangance free- it has a light fresh smell to it! It felt light on my skin and would definitely recommend it!!!
"I bought this OLAY cream for a while. I am very happy about it. It kept my skin moisturized during the dry winter. And this company I ordered from ships items very fast, very good service and good price too."
I use Olay products because they make fragrance free which is perfect for me. I am highly sensitive to perfumes and chemicals in cosmetics. Also I think the price is reasonable and you can see results soon. And the delivery is quick. Emily-New York
I have been using Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream and other Olay products for years and am very impressed with the absoption and non greasy feeling when applied. The price is fair and the coupons are even better.
"I LOVE this moisturizer! Thank you so much for taking the fragrance out too - who needs fragrance (extra chemicals) on the face? If you add SPF 30, I won't need a different product for the morning and that would be the best!"
"I have VERY oily skin so I only use this cream at night and am seeing results. I do agree with the other reviewers about the fragrance though. You do not need to add fragrance to this face cream, please remove it!! THX!"
"Try this if you truly want smooth, softened & refined skin.....it has definitely firmed the jowl area and resculpted the jawline. It's even hard to ""pinch"" any area of my face due to the firming factor! You will NOT be disappointed ~~~~"
"Love this cream. Have been using it for several months now. It leaves my face soft, hydrated and glowing. It's as good or even better than some of the more expensive department store creams. It stays on my list"
"I have sensitive skin and have had trouble with irritation from many wrinkle creams before. Not with this one! And, I swear my skin looks better even after just a few applications. Not too heavy; not too light. Perfect!"
"I have been using this for a few weeks now and find that it's helping my skin look and feel smoother. Hard to know if it's doing much for the few lines I have, but I'l lkeep using it just to see."
I've spent hundreds of dollars looking for a firming cream that lives up to it's promises and I have found it! My jawline is firmer and my friends and co-workers have noticed. This is a must have in your beauty routine! Go Olay!
"I'm always evaluating new skin products and I've tried many but finally, I've found a product that works. Feels great on my face and those fine lines have disappeared. I love this product! And the bonus is, it's affordable!"
The regenerist Micro sculpting cream is the best that I have ever used and I have used many. It is a bit pricey but it works. the fine lines and the saggy lines have almost disappeared.
"Hi, before i didnt know about this but my sister in law bought this for her and she was using..she asked me to take that cream and asked to use it.i found a big change on my face wow it really works.where ever i go now i use that..."
I've tried many other products however none seemed to work as well as this- I was greatly surprised of the outcome and in such a short period of time-
I have been using Micro-sculpting cream for about 5 or 6 months now. I work in cosmetics and I am always telling my customers about it and that it is undoubtably the best I have ever used . Could not get any better!!!
I have only been using this lotion for a few weeks but already I have noticed a difference. My skin is brighter and has a lovely new glow. Even my colleagues at work have noticed!
This is the best cream ever! After one month I noticed the texture and overall look of my skin had improved drastically! Keeps my face moisturized all day!
I call this my Miracle cream because it is the best affordable treatment I have found...and it really works!! You see and feel the difference immediately. I just love my Olay Miracle!!!! Bring it on...I'm ready!!
"I had pretty high hopes for this product, but it's not as good as I was wanting it to be. I think it's too high priced for the drugstore, even though it's a skincare item, and I really just didn't see any difference after using it. Visit my blog at christinaschiccorner.com to see my more detailed review I posted about it."
"I have fine lines on my cheeks, around my eyes and eyebrows. I have been using this product for over three weeks and I have not seen any improvement. Also, after applying it to my face, it leaves a greasy and thick feeling. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine, although it was really pricey I took a chance, but I guess this is not for me. I wish I could take it back to the store and try different Olay products that might work for me."
"Finally!! I stopped using the original (heavily-fragranced) Micro-Sculpting Cream because of its scent - whose idea was it to scent it anyway? Now that there's a fragrance-free option, I'm in! I'm a flight attendant so hydration is always an issue. My skin is smooth & well-hydrated. I love the product & encourage others to try it, too. Thank you, Olay, for taking the scent out!"
"THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL. I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. TRY TO KEEP MY SKIN HEALTHY IT DOES THE JOB. IT IS GREAT PRICED FOR THE PRODUCT, AND DOES AN AWESOME JOB FOR HELPING MY SKIN LOOK SOFT AND HEALTHY FOR MY AGE. I BRAG ABOUT OLAY PRODUCTS ALL THE TIME AND THINK THEY ARE THE BEST. THANK YOU."
"Been using Olay products for years! Started with classic Olay and then I tried regenerist, fell in love immediately! Creamy, not oily and my skin appearance just improved more and more! I used to work at high end stores and I can tell you, this works way better and you can't beat the price!"
"I was trying another product for about 3 years and I must admit I didn't see any changes, especially under my eyes. Honestly it got worse. I saw that y'all had made some changes, so I purchased Olay Eyes Gel, gave it a try! Seven days later, I see smoother skin! Wow!"
"As a breast cancer survivor, the oncologist telling me she was going to ""age"" me about 20 years, wasn't kidding! I have tried MANY different drugstore, department store, and kinds you have to get through a representative. THIS WORKS! I am glad that for some people they came out with fragrance-free. I personally? Love the smell of clean it gives me. Don't take away our smells, PLEASE!?"
I have used both with fragrance and without and I love this product. I have been using this for a few months and so far no issue at all. I can definitely feel my skin is getting softer and younger. I am 47 years old and gets compliments from my family and friends for looking much younger than that. I will take that any day
"At 66, I am glad to say I do not look 66. Those fine lines and wrinkles are a lot less noticeable now, thanks to Olay Regenerist. I use it as a night cream and also under my foundation during the day. You can't stop the aging process but you can definitely slow it down with Olay products."
I received Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer complementary to test out for the Insiders sampler campaign. I am fair skinned and have combination/ dry skin. I tried Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Face Moisturizer Cream for a little over 3 weeks. It is a thick rich cream
"I really love this product, I was able to review this Olay products as a part of The Insiders program. It is very light weight and goes on smoothly. It absorbs fast and and leaves my skin feeling moisturized after use. My skin looks and feels healthier! I have seen improvement in my skins texture and overall look since starting to use it and I look forward to continued use and results."
I was able to try the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream as part of the Insiders Campaign and was very pleasantly surprised. After just one use my skin felt soft and hydrated. After a few weeks of continuous use I have noticed a marked improvement in the texture of my skin. This is a great fit for your everyday moisturizer and I highly recommend it!
"I really like the Regenerist Cream. It absorbs completely and leaves no sticky or greasy residue. There is a faint scent but nothing lingering. I use thus at night, before going to bed. After 3 weeks my deepish forehead wrinkles are less deep. I was actually surprised by that. My skin overall is feeling smoother. I was able to try Olay Regenerist as part of The Insiders program."
I tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream and I don't think my skin liked it. The cream has a scent that is pleasant. The cream is midweight I would say and I just didn't feel like it did anything to my face. I did break out on my face and I just figured my skin did not like it. I was able to try Olay Regenerist as part of The Insiders program.
I received free samples from the Insiders campaign to try out Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I found this cream to be way too heavy for my personal preference. Perhaps for more mature skin this is a great moisturizer. I did not notice any positive changes to my skin either. Because of the greasiness I ended up only using this moisturizer at night. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this moisturizer without sampling first.
"I have used this product many times. The past 3 times, jars, its not the same. I stopped using it for 2 months thinking my skin had gotten used to it, but it didn't give me the same results. I am not sure if something has changed, but I was so disappointed!"
"I've found that this Olay product highly rivals those with pricetags several times doubled. The consistency, absorption and smell are all very pleasant. You instantly feel a difference in your skin as its baby soft making makeup application flawless. Since using this product I've eliminated a primer because I don't want to lose the glow I seem to have. Great product! I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."
"I am very happy with the Olay Regeneris Micro Sculpting Cream! It is fragrance free and I love how well it works! It has made my skin feel so much better and look better too! I would highly recommend. I love how little you have to use, therefore the jar lasts quite awhile! #Insiders #OlayRegenerist #olay #gotitfree"
"I have been a longtime fan of Olay Regenerist because of all the face creams I've tried, it is the most effective at moisturizing my skin and fighting early signs of aging. Its a great value because a dab goes a long way, even with daily use. You start to see fine lines soften, and your face begin to look softer, brighter and more even just after a week or two of continued use. I love the effectiveness of this fantastic product."
"""I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"". I liked it so much! I really liked The Regenerist cream. It makes my skin more hydrated and it gave its luminosity back. It helps a lot with elasticity too so the my skin look firmer than before. Something very special about it is that it doesn't make my face greasy or sticky! It dries easily and gives my skin a nice touch. I am sure I will repurchase it!!!"
"I had the opportunity to try Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer as part of a campaign through theInsiders! This cream is lightweight, smells amazing and has worked wonders softening lines, moisturing my skin, and firming. Use it at night or morning. This will be a regular in my routine. Definitely recommend!"
I tried this product as part of The Insider Olay campaign and I am hooked. This is the best face cream I have ever tried. Not only does it moisturize but it rejuvenates. I no longer have fine lines and my face is so much softer and firmer. I can't recommend this product enough. Finally a product that lives up to its promises.
"I am completely in love with this cream...it does all it claims to do and more. It is quite lightweight and since I have combination skin it did not leave a greasy feeling on my skin. I noticed my skin became firm, hydrated and plump with just a few uses. It also made my skin smooth and clear with a radiant glow. Definitely will continue using it and purchase again. Thank you insiders for this opportunity to introduce me to an amazing amazing product."
"n just a short amount of days of using this. I have notice that it makes my skin very soft to the touch. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about using it. But, I didn't break out at all. I'm still using it to see the full results so I can't wait. I also loved that I was able to share with a lot of people. I had no idea it was going to be all of these little samples. My mom is also using it as well. I can't wait to see her results as well."
Well summer time is back again for me and i am always outdoors and the sun is wreaking havoc on my face once again. Well at least it was before i starting using the Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream. My face is soft and smooth the way it was when i was younger. It feels more plump to the touch and the wrinkles from my dried out sun baked skin are starting to fill in. I really do love this face cream. It works. Now if it can take all the freckles away from sun damage everything in my world would be right!
"I absolutely love the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream, I've been using it about a month now and it has helped with my fine lines around my eyes and smile and leaves my skin so soft and smooth and has a silk like feeling to it, it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy like a lot of other creams I've tried."
I got to try this moisturizer through the Insiders program and I have to say that it really works! It is so moisturizing without being oily and you can feel and see the change in firmness and elasticity of your skin. I've had friends compliment me on my skin and tell me they see a difference!
"After using this product for four weeks I can tell that it works great!! I absolutely love it. I've been using it twice a day and I can see a big difference already. My skin feels more firm, young and healthy. I had a very dry skin, especially around my mouth and the other products I used didn't work at all. It's an amazing moisturizer, with a nice light scent, that goes on smoothly. It absorbs quickly and it doesn't feel greasy at all. This product is definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it!!"
"I just turned 32, so i've been getting more into skincare. And, since I have dry skin, i've been looking for a moisturizer. I don't really have wrinkles, so I don't know how it works for that. It leaves my face hydrated and soft. It also helps keep my skin tone even."
"I really enjoy using the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Face Cream. I'm 29 and started noticing uneven slimline, fine lines, puffy eyes, large pores, etc. When I stumbled upon this cream, I fell in love. It makes my face so silky soft and hits my target areas with moisture that it definitely needs. It's not oily, which I love and soaks in well. Overall, I've noticed a good change in my skin since the beginning of use."
"I am always on the lookout for a great night moisturizer. At 32, my biggest concerns are fine lines and dull skin. In addition to a product that addresses these concerns, I like a product that is light enough for humid, summer nights but moisturizing enough for the dry, winter months. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream really foots the bill in all of these areas!"
I have tried so many moisturizers and with my skin being sensitive it doesn't seem lo agree with any. Olay seems to be the brand my skin likes the most and this particular one I have seen it smooth out my skin after just a few weeks. My skin looks really nice and I can wash my face put it on amd apply makeup a half hour later and not have my face feel itchy as other moisturizers have done. Love it!
"I used this product every night for one month and my skin is softer, my fine lines have faded and left an amazing glow to my face. When I wash my face in the morning, each day it becomes softer and brighter. I also use it when I will be outside because it does have an spf so it's safe for the sun. And I live in Florida, so it's always sunny. I absolutely will continue using this product."
I love the scent. It is non greasy and absorbs into my skin leaving it softer and smoother. I have used for 3 weeks and I can tell fine lines have diminished and the skin under my chin looks tighter. It does not get in my eyes when I work out like other moisturizers have.
"The samples are free the opinions are my own. I received a sample of Olay Regenerist Mico-Sculping cream and I really love how smooth and easy it is to put on. I also love the smell, really great product. Thanks the Insiders for choosing me to test a really great product. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."
"I really like this facial cream. I have sensitive skin so it's hard to find things I can use that don't make my skin breakout or flare up, but this cream did neither of those. It left my skin feeling smooth and not greasy at all. I'd recommend this cream to anyone."
"I love how did cream made my face look brighter I highly recommend it.My face seems smoother and it brightens it as well.I am still using and now this cream is part of my beauty regimen,I am very happy with this product and recommend it.I was able to review this Olay product as a part of The Insiders program."
"One of the best face creams I have ever tried, very high quality and it shows. I am pretty young so I never really pay attention to face creams but this really made my skin feel moisturized and soft to touch. As others have said, it is very thick so I might be a little hesitant to use as much in the summer weather as I am afraid it will clog my pores, but overall i love the quality in my skin in the weeks I have been using this. I received this product free in exchange for my testimonial, but all opinions are my own."
I really love this cream for my skin. My skin is dry and sometimes sensitive and I found this product to be very moisturizing and not irritating at all. It has made my skin look smoother and more even toned. It goes on smoothly and is a nice consistency. I think it has slightly diminished some of my fine lines too. I will continue using it to hopefully see more results. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program.
"Olay Regenerist is wonderful. At first was skeptical, but found it to make my skin feel super soft. I loved how light weight it felt. I didn't feel like I had a ton on but knew that I applied it. The biggest thing I noticed was how nice my face felt and looked. Love it"
Well I've got to say Olay Regenerist Cream is great. My skin is so soft does not feel sticky or greasy. And my oil is under control. “I had the pleasure of reviewing this product as part of the Insiders program”. Definitely my new face cream.
"This cream is perfect!! Afoordable, good quality and meet the expectations of all my friends and students!!! Leaves the skin very smooth and hydrated, perfect to use it before makeup and before sleep. When you combine this cream with the eye cream you will see the results early"
"This product is great! Smooths skin and eliminates fine lines. I use this in the morning and at night and it really softens my skin, looks fresher and younger. I like that it isn't heavy or greasy and has a light scent. I've used this for a few weeks and have really noticed that my wrinkles and lines are less noticeable and my skin is softer and smoother. I received a free sample to try from The Insiders but my opinions are all my own and I definitely recommend this for great looking skin!"
"I got to try this product as a part of a review for free from insiders. This cream is very effective. I use it at night after washing my face, and it's the only product I put on. It leaves my skin moisturized and smooth, with the moisture lasting all night. It also definitely improves the overall texture and tone of my skin. I have also noticed a difference of the fine lines and on my face and neck."
"This product makes my face soooooo smooth!!! and you can feel the difference instantly. I've been using 2 a day and oh boy I look better than never. Everybody says I look ""rested"" and I think it makes it easier to apply make up. I've been using even for the festivals. In Vegas it was hot but didn't melt my face. Yay."
This moisturizer is amazing! It is so light and creamy but does not feel heavy on the skin. My skin just drinks it up and immediately feels healthier and more hydrated. The few lines I have at the corner of my lips and a couple on the forehead are plumped up with moisture leaving my skin feeling and looking beautiful!
"I'M so happy I got to try this product as a part of a review for free from insider.this cream is very effective. I use it at night after washing my face, and it's the only product I put on. It leaves my skin moisturized and smooth, with the moisture lasting all night. It also definitely improves the overall texture and tone of my skin. Those benefits have the effect of reducing the effect of fine lines and wrinkles on my face."
"With so many products that are available on the market today, and each making claims, it's difficult to choose. Olay regenerist micro - sculpting cream really does work. It leaves your skin feeling soft, moisturized and supple. I love it! I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."
I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program and will definitely continue to use. I have already noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth and a huge difference in the sagginess around my eyes. Goes on smooth without a greasy feel and smells great!
I am usually very skeptical about stuff like this but I am pleasantly surprised at how well this worked. I love that it makes my skin feel soft and smooth and really moisturizes my skin. I have been using this for about a month now and I really enjoy it.
"I don't hate this moisturizer, but I don't love it. I can only use it at night because it makes my face quite oily. I would definitely use it more, but I just don't like the way it makes my skin feel. It's probably just my skin type and I'm sure it works great for many others!"
"I have been using this product for about 4 weeks after receiving a free sample from #TheInsiders. I love the feel of this cream, so luxurious!! I have started to notice a reduction in the fine lines around my mouth and love the way it feels on my face!"
"I am totally blown away. I have only been using this product about a week and a half and I can already tell a huge difference. My skin looks healthier, feels softer and fine lines are gone. This is wonderful product. I highly recommend it to anyone. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."
I have been using Regenerist by Olay for a little over a week and I am really liking the results I have seen so far.My skin is soft and looks healthy.It gives me a healthy glow and my skin seems more firm as well.I am noticing my fine lines are much less noticeable with each day I continue to use this product.This does have a fragrance but it is light and fresh it is really nice.I am really enjoying the benefits that this product gives. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program.
I immediately noticed the very nice smell. It was not to strong and overpowering but very fresh and inviting. The next wonderful thing I noticed about this product is that it is not a oily face cream. A little bit of product goes a little no way. It has brought my extremely dry and rough skin back to life! Now my skin is not dull and soft. It has become part of my daily regimen and will continue to be. Your skin will thank you. I was able to review Olay products as part of the Insiders program.
"I have been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream and I LOVE IT!!! I can definitely see the difference in my skin, no doubt about it! I was a bit worried about some wrinkles on my forehead so I really really hoped it worked and IT DOES WORK! I will continue to use this cream as part of my everyday regimen and invite everyone who cares about their beautiful appearance to do so too. Did I mention Ive only been using it for two weeks and this product has delivered result? ;) go ahead, thank me later."
"I have been using for about 3 weeks and love it. I use twice a day and my face feels great. I feel like I'm glowing. The cream goes on great and smells just as good. I do notice some minimizing on my fine lines so that's a plus. This ones a keeper!I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"""
Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream really exceeded my expectations. I have acne breakouts every now and then. So using a cream on my face usually aggravates the situation. Well not this time. I apply this product on my face at night after cleaning. It has a very light but pleasant scent. Quickly absorbs into the skin. And it doesn't break my skin out! My skin is more softer. No fine lines when I talk or smile. This product does what it says it will do! Highly recommend.
This made my skin look and feel so soft and smooth and feels like more titer not so elastic. I do feel like it looks and feels allot softer and healthier then before. I feel with continue's use it will keep my skin looking allot better. I recommend this to anyone that needs help with there skin to feel softer and younger looking i say gives this a try.
"I have been using this product once a day for more than 3 weeks and I can see visible change in my skin tone and texture. I had couple of breakouts once I started the application but things settled down in just couple of days and after just few applications, I could feel my rejuvented skin. My skin is more soft, smooth, hydrated and looks much younger. I am very happy with the results and continue to use it in my daily regime."
"Love this cream. It leaves your skin so soft a few hours after applying. It does leave a stickiness for the first hour or so, but it's worth it. I put mine on at night and let it work it's magic. There is not chemical smell, I barely notice anything."
"I didn't realize how thirsty my skin was until I started using this cream! Since I've started using it, I've noticed that I don't get those little dry spots around my mouth anymore. I didn't think that any moisturizer could address those as none had so far. My skin feels softer, and I notice that it really soaks up the cream very quickly, like it's thirsty! My skin never feels stretched or too tight anymore. It's evened out my complexion a bit by making my skin less irritated. I love it and I will continue to use it for sure!"
"I cannot say enough good things about tgis cream. The smell is awesome, and it feels smooth on your skin. Turning 40 this year i knew i had to start some sort of anti aging routine. I tried several brands, and nothing compares to this. After just 2 weeks, i swear i have my 26 year old skin back. So excited to see the difference at 4 weeks. I was able to try this completely free for a month through the insiders sample program."
I'm so pleased with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream! I could see results right after the first use. It's not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving my skin hydrated and firmer. The fragrance is nice and light. I love the way my skin feels and looks after I use it. I'm at the 4 week mark now and I'm seriously sold on this regimen. Olay is the best!!! I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program.
I was so excited to be picked from Insiders to try this product for free. I'm so happy that Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer is fragrance free. I love how fresh it makes my face feels. I've been using this product for 3 weeks now and love it more each time I use it.
"This cream goes on like silk. It has a very pleasant but subtle scent that I really like. It doesn't irritate my skin in any way. The skin on my neck and around my mouth is firmer and looks younger after just a week. I use it at night and when I wake up, my skin is soft, smooth and feels great. It doesn't leave a residue because it absorbs well. I love Regenerist and have found my new go-to product. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"
Helps with the elasticity of my skin and has helped my wrinkles get smaller. The only problem that I had was I started breaking out after about week one of using it. But my skin looks and feels better. I am 26 and trying to do preventative maintenance. I approve! I received this product free as part of an Insiders Promotion
"I really like this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream moisturizer! It has a great, mild scent that I love! It definitely works well at moisturizing my face! I've only been using this product for 2 weeks and I definitely already see a great improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles! My skin even looks tighter, brighter and clearer! I would recommend this product to anyone gladly! I received this product free as part of an Insiders Promotion!"
I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program. I really liked how smooth it was and felt on my skin. It also has a nice smell to it. I was unable to use it more then 2 days due to it making me break out. I have given my samples away in hopes it will work better for them.
"I had the pleasure of trying out the Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream thanks to Olay and the Insiders. I've been using this product for a month. I apply it every evening after washing the day away from my face. My skin looks bright and radiant. I have a little glow, just like when I got married. My skin is soft and hydrated. I can easily run errands and go about my day without any makeup on because my skin looks amazing! The best part is that this cream is affordable! I highly recommend this cream to any woman in her 30's and up!"
"I noticed a big difference in my skin with the first application! The texture of my skin is smoother and I am seeing an improvement in expressive lines on my forehead. It works great with my current regimine, even if I swap out a few items and the smell is terrific. I would (and have) recommend this product. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."
I was able to review Olay products as part of the Insiders program. I have been using Olay cream for 3 weeks. I apply it at bedtime. It is very easy to put on and has a smooth texture. I have already noticed a difference in my skin. the fine lines and wrinkles are starting to disappear. I would definitely recommend this product.
I love this face moisturizer cream. I have been using it five weeks and I notice a big difference. I have less wrinkles and the skin is firmer. I am really impressed with the results. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program
"I was able to review Olay products as part of the Insiders program. Officially in love with this product! The transformation of my face since using this is unbelievable. My skin is smoother, firmer and noticeably less fine lines or wrinkles. It's my secret weapon!"
I noticed that in the first couple days my skin felt SO soft. I use this morning and night and I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin. I was able to review the Olay regenerist micro sculpting cream through the insiders campaign. My makeup goes on smoother i would recommend this.
I'm on week 3 of using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream and I've been enjoying using it so far! I use it on my face and my neck but avoid the t-zone area since it makes my forehead shiny. The cream applies smoothly and gets absorbed fast. It can leave the skin a bit tacky (but not greasy) if you apply too thick of a layer. It also doesn't do much for those large pores on my nose. But my face has been looking very radiant and smooth! I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program.
"I've been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream since April 13, 2018 a week after I started to see positive results on my face that it felt smoother and my skin looked healthier and tighter than ever! I will defenatly recommend it to anyone who likes to look younger and I will continue to purchase it for my own use."
"Moving back to the desert and commuting on my bike everyday, I knew I needed something to treat my skin. I apply it before I go to bed, right after I wash my face. The cream is relatively light, but I wouldn't want to put this on in the morning. When I wake up, my face looks so refreshed and soft. It takes a few days to see results (at least for me), but the continued usage has finally paid off. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."
"I was able to test Olay product through the Insiders program. I was worried that this product would feel heavy and greasy,but in fact it goes on very smoothly with no heavy feeling.My skin feels a bit tighter and a bit smoother .I also love the nice scent of this product."
"I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program,and all opinions and results are my own. A bit over a month in to using the micro-sculpting cream,and my skin has never looked so good! It has more life and radiance,is much more firm,and amazingly my wrinkles and laugh lines are almost completely gone! My skin stays hydrated,without feeling oily or heavy,and there's been zero pilling."
"This is a very effective face cream. I use it at night after washing my face, and it's the only product I put on. It leaves my skin moisturized and smooth, with the moisture lasting all night. It also definitely improves the overall texture and tone of my skin. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"
"I have been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for at least a week and what I liked the most so far was the soft texture it leaves on the skin after application. We do not get the sticky or wet face feeling and the smell is very soft, not bringing problems to people who do not like products with strong perfume. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"
"After trying this product compliments of the Insiders program, I finally found my perfect moisturizer. Having combination skin, I've had problems in finding a cream that is lightweight, effective, and provides maximum results. Having used this cream for a week, I was already able to clearly distinguish a difference in my skin. It felt more nourished, less dullness, and more supple. This is a great year round cream and not containing any heavy fragrance is absolutely great."
"This product is moisturizing. However, it is heavily scented, and the fragrance is unpleasant. This product also rolls/pills with minimal rubbing. I would expect much more at this price point. Now that I've looked at the website, I see that there is a fragrance-free version. I guess my question is, why bother putting the fragrance in at all? Why not make everything fragrance-free by default? Some may appreciate this product, but I won't be buying again."
"I've been using Oil of Olay products since my early 20's, I will be 46 this year. I did however switch to the Loreal line but saw that it was breaking me out and results were just not there. I see change in my skin, a radiant look to my skin and also the price isn't bad compared to other lines. Would highly recommend this product."
"Olay Regenerists Micro-sculpting cream is a holy grail! The light soft feel of the cream is exactly what it leaves your face with!! It doesn't leave any oily or greasy feel or look! It absorbs quickly into the skin!! I love it and EVERYONE I know does as well! Your face is left with that ""silky smooth baby soft feel"" ! Really lives up to turning back the hands of time!  I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program"
I was lucky enough to receive free samples of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream via The Insiders to try out! I liked this moisturizer more than I even expected to! The consistency and smell are good. And I appreciate the way it absorbs into my skin.
"I have been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer, Fragrance-Free that The Insiders sent to me to sample and review and I have noticed a big difference in my skin. My face seems to be tighter and super soft. The only drawback is It seems to break me out where my glasses touch my face. This has never happened with any other skin care products that I have used. I love the Olay line and hope the breakout problems clear themselves up."
I think I have found my new favorite face product. I honestly love everything about it. It's a very light weight cream and it isn't greasy nor does it leave your face feeling oily or sticky. I'm still amazed at the results. I definitely notice more firmness to my skin n. I will most definitely recommend this product to everyone. Even the smell is great. It's not stinky but the fragrance isn't over bearing . I will be buying this in the near future.
This makes my face feel great and soft. I was having a bit of a dry patch and this made it a lot better. The first few times I used it I broke out but I was trying to find the right balance of how much to put on since every product is a bit different. I noticed some of the lines around my mouth were fading a bit too. I didn't notice any smells to it either. Overall I am really happy with it. Here is a before and after 2 weeks use.
Love this Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I was so excited to try this product because i just love Olay products.I got to try this as a part of an insiders campaign. I started noticing changes on my skin ever since i started applying this cream. It moisturizes my face so well and making my skin soft and smooth. I am really happy with the results .
Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream works great because I can feel my skin smoother and hydrated. I love also that it is not greasy since my skin is combination to oily so I tried not to get creams that leave me all greasy and then in the pictures does not look good at all.
I was very impressed with this micr-sculpting cream. I loved to use it morning and evening time and I have seen such an improvement with the texture of my skin. It's very hydrating and nourishing and with this you can instantly see improvements. It has a lightweight scent and it's not overly heavy or too oily.
It makes my skin smoother and more hydrated feeling. I am also noticing that the wrinkles between my eyes are starting to go away the longer I use this product. I received this product from The Insiders Campaign to test out. So far I love the product and will be purchasing more at Walmart.
"The scent reminds me of something I had used in the past and forgot about until now. It is nostalgia in a bottle, while also rewinding my face back to that time. It absorbs fast, is non-greasy, and moisturizes. I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review."
I received a samples of this through The Insiders to try for free. I really like this product. i already noticed a little difference around my eyes and my foreheads. The lines aren't noticeably less. I am going to continue to use and see where it takes me.
"I've had the pleasure of using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream over the past few weeks thanks to The Insiders! My skin was showing fine lines, unevenness, losing firmness and the list goes on with aging. I began using the cream and noticed a difference in the texture of my skin instantly. This cream reversed the signs of aging and now my skin look healthier, younger and firmer. This cream truly works as stated! I highly recommend using this cream to reverse the signs of aging!"
"I like Olay moisturizers, and I've been using them for a long time. That's why I was happy when I was offered Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream as a free sample to try and give an honest opinion about. I am in love with this moisturizer. It is very smooth and gentle. I always recommend Olay to my family and friends."
"I have struggled with skin problems due to working in a kitchen for a while now. I started using this product, and saw results in days. I am still currently using, and will never stop. This product is just amazing. It helps replenish my skin after dealing with grease, and fryer oils all day. It has transformed my skin back to its soft nature."
"I love this product! I am concerned about aging, but also have acne, so I am usually leery of moisturizers because they tend to make me break out. This is amazing because it absorbs easily and as of yet I have not noticed it causing me to break out. Also after two uses I feel that I look younger and my skin feels more refreshed. I received this product as a sample from Insiders and I love it!"
"The Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is just that, a wonderful smooth cream that is so light and fluffy. It absorbs quickly and is not tacky feeling, you can't even feel it was applied once it sinks into your skin... the only thing you can feel is smooth, soft skin that feels so moisturized and healthy. It also has a very pleasant scent to the cream."
"I have been an Olay fan for a long time and I love trying their products. They never let me down. First of all, I really love the clean scent of this moisturizer as well as the light texture. It is not greasy or thick feeling. I have noticed my skin has become much softer and youthful looking. I am so happy I tried this and will continue to purchase it."
"I'm always looking for a moisturizer that won't either dry out my skin or make ITV overly oily, so I received samples of this product from (theinsiders) and now I'm in love with how well this product transformed my skin from dull and dry to hydrated and quenched....I already purchased the full sizes and now this is my go too Moisturizer for all my skincare needs!!!!"
It is working great for me. The cream is easy to use with non greasy formula which i really like because i have oily skin. It has improved my skin texture and the signs of aging within 2-3 weeks of use. I am using it on my face and neck everyday hoping to see more results.
"I have combination skin, and its very hard to find a good face cream. This one fights the dryness of my cheeks, but my forehead gets a little greasy in the moment I use it. But its not a big problem, since it can be easily changed by using a primer (I use a Revlon primer over this cream on the forehead, and it's perfect). Another good thing is that it absorbs quickly and I don't feel sticky or tacky. My skin looks healthier and smoother."
"Hi, I'm 55yrs old. I first started using regenerist sculpting cream ( fragrance free) 7yrs ago. When I applied it to my face it was as if though my skin litterly drank it. It was awesome feeling with great results. But, 2 weeks ago I received my 2 new jars. Soon as I applied it, I could tell something was different? It didn't sink into my skin like usual? I could tell right away something had changed? If it's not broken, don't fix it! Still have faith in my regenerist sculpting cream!"
"The Olay Regenerist Mico-Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer isn't all it's cracked up to be. Feels smooth going on, but leaves a greasy film that caused acne even after using it directly after cleansing. It feels nice, but does have a light scent. I have sensitive skin and a few fine lines, of which none show any improvement with 2 weeks of morning and night use. My skin is still uneven, now acne prone and have enlarged pores. Not for me."
"I have been using Olay Regenerist Sculpting Cream for two weeks and I love it! It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue, and has a nice light scent. The thing I like most about it is it actually produces excellent results! I have noticed my fine lines around my mouth and forehead disappeared and my skin feels tighter and soft! I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to see real results at a great price!"
"Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, I am very happy and grateful. I'm 40 years old and I notice signs of lines of expressoes, fine wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes. My skin was lifeless, and with spots when passing Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for the first time I could already feel a difference. I will continue the treatment for 4 weeks and I believe that much transformation is about to happen. I got free samples The Insider. I really recommend to everyone."
"I love, love, love this product. It makes the skin on my face feel so soft, smooth and supple. It makes fine lines and wrinkles vanish. I love the smell of it and the ease of using it. I use it in the morning and at night, and the eye cream at night. It is definitely a must have for me, I won't be without it. It is, to me, better than a lot of those high priced, too of the line products being sold and has way better results, and I've tried several. I highly, highly recommend."
"I like how Olay regenerist microsculpting cream feels on my skin. My biggest complaint with moisturizers normally is they clog my pores, and smell bad but Olay regenerist is not like that at all! This cream doesn't clog my pores, my skin feels fresh and reguvinated and also it doesn't have a smell to it! I can notice a difference with my skin and it's only been about 2 weeks. Overall I would buy this product again and again."
"I love using olay regenerist. My skin always gets dry, and with olay, not anymore. Ive really noticed a softer and smoother appearance on my skin after applied! After 3 days of use I can already see a noticeable difference. I have an issue with lotions not absorbing into my skin, that is not an issue with this. It's light weight and absorbs without leaving a heavy or greasy feeling."
Hi. I'm 58 yrs old. My churchmate said that my face is glowing and ask what I am using. I said oil of Olay regenerist. Even my daughter said I don't look like my age. So i continue using it. By the way what is the difference bet the regenerist and the 7 in one.
I received a sample of Okay Regenerist in the mail. I just put it on today so I won't have a resolution on how it works until after I've used it a while. I'm not sure why it says fragrance free because it surely does have a smell. Its a nice subtle calming smell and doesn't make my face feel heavy.
What stands out about this cream is that it is lightweight and not heavy on the scents. It's perfect for my sensitive skin. I've been using it for a few days and have noticed some changes. I will continue to use this. I love how moist my skin feels. I also like how easy it is to apply. Definitely will continue to use this.
"I just received my Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream yesterday and I can already feel the difference in my skin. It was softer and smoother. This product was easy to use/apply. Smells great! Creamy, soft, texture. Non- greasy. Easily blends right into my skin. Could use it any time of the day which was great! I haven't used it long enough to see any other results but I will continue use.No breakouts, allergic reaction, or skin irritations. I would recommend to anyone."
"Im just now getting to try this moisturizer and 8 days in Im already seeing a difference in my skin. Truly amazing how this works in such little time. The smell is amazing too. It does not make your skin feel heavy or sticky, it absorbs nicely. I will keep this in my home always. I love it."
"I love using olay regenerist. My skin always gets dry, and with olay, not anymore. Ive really noticed a softer and smoother appearance on my skin after just a few weeks. I cant use this before going to bed though as for some reason i always wake up with a breakout. So for at night, i use Alice Nouveau - Super C Anti-Aging Cream - Brightens, firms, Regenerates and love the fact that theres vitamin C in it. If you dont believe me, try it for yourself and you'll love your skin!"
"The first time I tried it I saw such a dramatic change to my skin. First of all it smells great even though it's fragrance free and has a nice soft texture. Very easy to apply as well and you don't need to apply a lot, just a little and it spreads easily into your skin. It left my skin feeling smooth, soft, moisturized and hydrated. It didn't feel greasy or heavy at all. I love it and I recomend it."
"I have used this product for 2 months now and my wrinkles and fine lines appear less noticeable. My face is considerably softer and never feels dry since I began using this cream. I highly recommend this product, especially, for those of us who are not getting older, but, getting better!"
"I love everything about this moisturizer! I'm 29, and don't have a whole lot of wrinkles yet, but I had been struggling to find a good moisturizer that I liked. I tried this one and I loved it. The great scent is a huge plus. I felt a difference from day one, it left my face feeling so soft. I have combination skin and it worked great for me. The dry areas were well moisturized, but it didn't add to the oiliness of my face."
"I bought the Olay Regenerist Micro- Sculpting Creme in-store and I just have to say I absolutely love it. My skin in Just a few days was noticefully softer and after a few weeks I see a difference around my eyes and forehead. My favorite part is how it good it feels going on,better than cremes I have spent high dollars on. And the smell is heavenly. Huge fan."
"I was so excited to try out the product. I liked the smell and the texture of the cream. However, much to much dismay, (the first time I tried it) after I gently pat a reasonable amount on my face, I saw some of the cream just roll up into little white films. It happened multiple times! I couldn't even put a layer of sunscreen on top of the cream because it makes the condition where the white gritty film appear even more. Very disappointed!"
"I have been used this product for a long long time and I receive compliments from everybody about my skin. I studied Quemistry and I am always aware what I put on my skin. Olay products are the best, you can see the results and I have a sensitive skin and I'd never have an allergic reaction. I love this cream, has no fragrance and works really good. Thank you Olay"
"Works well to reduce fine lines, but cannot wear makeup (or anything else) on top bc it immediately thickens/hardens. I first tried applying a light foundation with SPF on top, and it immediately thickened/hardened to a point where it couldn't be smoothed out. I washed my face, reapplied the moisturizer, and applied coconut oil (instead of foundation) to give my skin a sheen, and the same reaction happened. I wear makeup almost everyday so will have to stop using as a daytime moisturizer."
"I'm a younger person that doesn't have many wrinkles at all, but I noticed a difference in one day. I have a combination of dry and oily skin. I have a hard time taking care of my skin due to a busy lifestyle. My skin gets patchy flaky dryness and it cleared it up in one day and night. Also, after a couple weeks my skin is glowy and smooth. It has improved the texture of my skin and it looks amazing!"
"I have very sensitive dry skin, so I purchased a microsculpting cream, serum and a few other products . The sculpting cream bottle was half empty and dried up , so I only got to try it for maybe 3wks no results ,got a bad product,,angry How my product was and the $$ spent,but I'm very skeptic to go get these products again I had to throw it away without even getting a chance to use them,very disappointed and I'm out a few hundred dollars"
"I am very pleased with this cream. I have hyper sensitive skin, and this product works well with my skin. There is no burning and redness! Love the feel of my skin after application. I have been using it about a week and I can notice a change in my skin. (I'm 37) It looks more even and smooth. I would buy again. PLUS it's fragrance free!"
"Have been using this formula for a few years..as have other family members..loved it. Bought multi-packs in November, immediately noticed colour and texture is different (lighter, texture not as thick/rich).Does not absorb well, not as moisturizing, leaves gritty film. When you rub your hand on your face (even well after application) you can see/feel the product drying up and rolling off onto your hand. Not just my experience. Packaging said '25% more' of the skin improving ingredients.??"
"my mom is 64 and she don't look a day over 50 she looks amazing. thanks to Olay.. this has been her skincare brand for many years.. I also use it daily.. makes my skin feel amazing.. with years of damage from sun, smoking and alcohol in my early years. my skin looks rough.. but the micro sculpting helps dramaticly.. I highly recommend the entire Olay regenerist line.."
Am just about finished with second jar and do not notice any improvement in wrinkles around mouth. This product was recommended to me by an Olay customer service person for that specific problem. Very disappointing. Has not worked any better than other products I have tried. Am considering requesting a refund.
"Love the latest formula of this cream. Could see results in one use without absolutely no irritation at all. Tried original formula and did not like so never purchased it again, but latest regenerist formulas are fabulous for brighter, younger looking skin."
"I took the 30-day challenge, and I don't feel that my face feels glowing and moisturized. I like to feel that my face looks a bit energized once I apply a moisturizer. I have used Clarins for years but it is very expensive so I thought I'd try Oil of Olay. I have always had two different moisturizers; one for day and one for evening, so I find it odd that I'd use the same product for both."
"Hey, I've never tried olay before and I'm 41. I look young for my age and I don't believe creams can get rid of wrinkles. I watched this on Dr Phil and thought why not I'll give it a try. It does work my lines are fainter, they haven't gone but they're not as deep. Don't waste your money on anything else try this you won't be disappointed. I use it twice a day and I've had it over a month and there's still loads left.... Go for it!"
"I love this stuff, has worked so good within the first day I have been using it for over a year now and people still think I'm in my early 30's. I'm almost 46. The only thing I don't like is the feel on my hands. For what ever reason it does not soak into my hands and leave a ""film"" on them. But I love the effects on my face!!"
"I've been using this product for a month and I love the way it feels on my face. I noticed that my face is brighter, more even and so far no breakouts. I'm 42 and don't have any wrinkles except for the smile lines around my mouth which has lessened after using the micro-sculpting cream. Its a great moisturizer that keeps my face hydrated."
"I've used this product for several years and I'm very disappointed with the new formula. It feels very greasy and not well absorbed into my skin. I've noticed when first used my skin became blotchy. Is there any place where I may purchase the older formula product? If not, I'll have to look around for a different brand that matches your older product."
"I am 48 y/o and of course my skin is not as youthful as it once was, however, after trying a sample of regenerist micro sculpting cream I noticed a remarkable difference within days!!! I now buy this product and use it every day and night! I get so many compliments on my skin now, I'M LOVING IT!!!!! Please try this!!!!"
I absolutely love Olay's Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. It smells great and works just as promised and costs much less then many other creams out there! I have been using it for years and I feel it has helped me remain youthful. I am writing this review to enter a contest but I am 100% honest. #contest #influesnster
I noticed a difference the very next morning after using this product once. It's not a heavy cream and it doesn't just sit on the skin surface. I have always used Olay products and they just keep getting better and better. I am 74 which means most creams do not make a difference at all. This one does.
"I absolutely adore this product! It has completely brought my problematic, dry, lack luster skin to life! I got very discouraged when I noticed my skin going down hill in my early 30's... I decided to try this cream and now at 35 I am so relieved to see life back in my skin!!! I will use this forever! THANK YOU!"
"At 50, I had noticeable forehead wrinkles & lines at the corners of my eyes. I tried a cheaper cream, but my skin became extremely dry. I went back to Olay & THEN I saw dramatic change! The reviews of it ""rolling"" on the face are from the user having used too much. Cost wise, I find it reasonable for the price & if I had to choose, I would give up other beauty regimens to afford it. Give it a try; I think you'll notice a visible improvement in your skin & the reduction of facial wrinkles."
"I have used this product for 4-5 years - as long as I've used an anti-aging moisturizer. Recently I bought another bottle which uses the new formula. Something about it feels different on my skin. It used to feel thick and luxurious - almost soothing. Now it feels thinner and more oily when I put it on and I don't feel that my skin is as well-moisturized as before. I also second the comments about it ""rolling off"" off sometimes. It's not that it's terrible now - but it leaves me wanting more."
my mom is 65 and No visible wrinkles I'm 40 and started noticing mine so I asked what s her secret she took me to her bathroom gave me a bottle of your amazing product and said use this.Needless to say I will never go back to Mary Kay product I thought was going to work!!
"Been using this product for only ""5 days"" and I started seeing results within minutes of the first application! I'm hooked! I'm 54 and people already think I'm in my late 30's or early 40's. What will they think now? LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! You should call me to do a commercial! Let real consumers promote your products!"
"2nd part of review due to length. Sticky once on-impossible for applying foundation. I tried putting it on hours before make up, tried using a moisturizer over it, make up application spray, primer, & different foundations–nothing helped. If you don't wear foundation it won't be a problem. Very disappointing product–especially for the price. Also, it's hard to get product out of the jar once you get past the top. It should come with a little plastic spoon or stick to scoop the product out."
"Have to put review in 2 comments due to length. I use many Olay products-Cleansing Lotion, Wipes, Serums, Moisturizers. I'm happy with all of them so decided to try this product to diminish wrinkles. It advertises that you see a difference in a day, so I thought I would see a difference right away. I took a before picture so I didn't have to rely on memory & to see detail to compare-3 months later & NO change. I know not all products work for all people but was hoping to see some improvement."
"I have been using your product for 20 plus years, this last jar of regenerist wrinkle reducing i bought is NOTHING like what i have bought for years. it is like whipped egg whites!!! it is not a cream. after applying it, if i wiped my face it would just roll up and look like rolled up skin but white. it has left my face greasy feeling even after washing. don't know what you changed, but please change back!!!!"
"I started using this when I turned 50, ten years ago. I will be turning 60 soon and I am still using it. My face looks so much better, softer, firmer since using this! I have friends that I went to school with who think that I have had a face lift, but I haven't and never will, its thanks to Regenerist!"
"I was using expensive products and then I met a girl that had the nicest skin so I asked her what she used. And she recommended this to me. I used it and was shocked at how much better I looked when I was using very expensive products that I thought were good. This is so much better for so much cheaper... My fine lines are gone, my complexion is so even, my skin is so smooth and hydrated!!! And this stuff doesn't make my skin oily like most. It's amazing"
"To 'new hampshire'...your glitter effect may b due to the Mica I found in the ingredient listing. My makeup smears & rolls no matter how long I've given Regenerist Sculpting Cream 2 soak n. Thank goodness u put a SPF n it now. Just wish new tall bottles showed amt prod remaining. I've noticed new Ultimate Eye Cream has same glitter effect, although it works much btr than twist pen eye prod! I've got dry & sensitive skin."

"Loved the original Regenerist..used it for years. The new formula is sooo disappointing. It does not work well under makeup. My foundation would not blend in smoothly, it was patchy in spots, seemed to ""roll"" and flake when I tried to smooth it out. I will finish the jar as a night cream, but will not be using it in the morning under foundation anymore. So disappointed."
I was very disappointed in my experience with this product. I had read rave reviews on the product & was excited to begin using it. Shortly after using it my skin felt really dry & really tight & flaky. I thought possibly this was a process & it would improve so I continued use however nothing changed except my skin becoming more dry. I want to find a product that works but now I am hesitant to use another from the line.
This product i swear by. I starting using it about 7 years ago. I am a mother of 6 and this product made me feel and look amazing. I have aged due to not always being able to purchase this product but it is by far the only cream im dedicated to. Ive tried other products. Nothing compares to this one. I tell others about this product. Im in love. Thank you
"I have been using olay products for many years. I have been satisfied with the products I had been using so I decided to try the regenerist micro-sculpting cream face moisturizer. I did not notice any difference what so ever in the appearance or feel of my skin. The cream did not feel like it was soaking into my skin, it felt more like a mask. During the day I could rub my face and a clay like substance would rub off."
"I wrote a negative review and I'm changing it to all positive.At first I didn't like the new formula and wanted the original classic formula back.However, after using the new formular for a week I'm in love with it and my mature face loves it!! I had to take the time to change my review because this new formular really is a miracle in a jar. My face just needed a little time to adjust to new formular and I'm happy I did and now I have to say it's better than the old formular."
You have so many wonderful moisturizers for younger skin and I should know since I've been using Olay for forty years. However for the mature user your old formula was perfection and there wasn't an ounce of it that needed to change.Please bring back your old formula. If some people like the new version offer both with the original named classic Olay regenerist.
"your new formula is terrible! Why did you change it? The previous formula was SO MUCH BETTER!!! I dont know why companies ruin a good thing by changing it. Now after years of using it I will have to look for another brand cause this new formula is just terrible. your previous formula was so much better. Please bring back the old formula! I had to give this one star cause of the system, but this new formula really deserves NO STARS!"
"I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was 12. I'm now 55 and was impressed with the Regenerist Micro-sculpting line which I have used for years. I was telling a friend, also an Oil of Olay fan, that I've been noticing Regenerist is just not as effective anymore. I didn't know PG had changed the formula. I've tried the serum & the moisturizer together thinking oh I'm just getting older. I still look amazing at 55 but the original formula was better."
"This new formula one just does NOT work. Texture and smell is different. I feel bad because I love Oil of Olay products. They had a winner with the original Oil of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpturing cream. Don't waste your money on this one unless you find the original one, which is worth every penny."
"At first I liked the texture and it went on smoothly. However, the more of it I apply, the more it feels like a sticky mess with thick white patches that do not blend in no matter how much I try to rub it in. My foundation does not blend in with the cream and appears flakey. I had to scrape off the foundation (probably most of the cream too) with tissue this morning as it looked bad. It feels like my attempts to achieve smooth application simply results in me stretching my skin. Any advice?"
"I bought the trial size because I'm looking for a new skin care regemin. Olay may be it, but before I put up with the gritty feeling, I fully intend to try other products. I don't always wee foundation, but the day I did apply it a coupla hours after applying this cream, my foundation visibly showed flakes of my skin in it. Not attractive at all...."
"I finally thought I found my holy grail of moisturizers . A moisturizer that did not break out my skin !! I couldn't have been more happy . I have been using the Micro sculpting cream for two years now . I used a new jar of this and noticed that the cap was a different color .. shiny silver !! I thought oh no !! I used this and within a week my skin broke out , terribly ! I am so disappointed in the new formula ! What to do !!!!"
"Your OLD formula, PRIOR to the change the start of 2017, was a miracle in a jar, and gave this 40 something the skin and confidence of a 20 year old. But your NEW formula feels terrible on my face, actually accentuates fine lines and wrinkles and circles under my eyes, with absolutely no plumping or smoothing. My skin looked awful after just a couple days. After trusting Olay for so many years I'm so disappointed that I now must find a new line of moisturizer. Please bring back the old formula!"
"The texture is very creamy and luxury as the advertisement mentioned. It can smooth your skin. However, the smell is not good and just like shampoos. Besides, if you don't pat the cream on your skin evenly, it will become white little grains which are really annoying when you touch your skin."
I love this face cream have been using it for 15 years. Never go to bed at night without using it. Definitely within budget. Buy it every month. Will not use anything else. I get complements on my skin all the time. My husband loves the way my skin feels. Much better then the expensive brands. Need to try more products.
"I like Regenerist as it feels good and does help the appearance of my skin. I have very sensitive skin and this is calming for it. However, the packaging disturbs me as you have put it in enough wrapping to almost cover two jars. Please be more environmentally conscious and use minimal packaging. The box size does not trick any of us into thinking it contains more and several women were commenting on the large box at the store. Please return to a small box."
Difference from other smells it attracted as one in particular for sure a homerun .olay is well known top of the line with out doubt well rounded that is my signature move not brag recommended to anybody I would say overall.I could not say nothing bad good job
The product smell very nice it rubs on my skin real smooth an creamy.i rate this product 5 stars.i had wanted to use this product a while before i finally bought some when I had enough money. But its worth it.i feel it and my family and friends see the effect of this product. I have recommended.this to friends and family
"In today's world you try almost everything to recapture that look of youth...no matter the cost. By some show of luck you fall on ""Reginerist"". You follow the instructions and it's working. A week later it's even better. You don't have to go to Hong Kong to get it, the price is great, and did I mention IT WORKS!"
"I'm 68 years old & have used Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream since it came on the market & am convinced that it is the best anti-aging cream out there. My skin feels soft, firm & very noticeably smoother! I've used numerous brands, in all price categories, that did give good results but have not found a cream that gives the results that Micro Sculpting cream does. Olay proves that you don't have to break your budget buying highly touted dr endorsed creams to get great results."
"Plumps up lines, firms my skin. It's super light, not irritating, and great to use under a moisturizer. I use on my face and neck area. Over the years I've used many expensive serums from department stores and from dermatologists also. This remains one of the absolute best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free has a smooth, skin comforting consistency without a detracting fragrance to interfere with my regularly worn fragrance. It makes my skin feel smoother and reduces the loss or gravity look that women in my age group (over 60) often project. It is non greasy and suitable for both day and night. It also works well under my foundation, not interfering with the foundation color or consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay products since I was young - and I am now 69 years old! I absolutely love all your products! My daughters friends have even commented to her that I must use Olay because my skin is so nice. What a compliment! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was in my 20's. I find that this product works wonders. I am now in my 60's and have been using this product for the last 10 years. I notice that I have a decrease in wrinkles around my eyes, lower cheek area as well as my neck. I would definitely recommend using this product to other women! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This o easy to apply, and blends very well. I love that it is fragrance free. Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free leaves my face feeling light, clean and moisturized without feeling heavy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like many other women, I have tried many age defying products once and moved on. However, the micro-sculpting cream made my skin feel hydrated, not oily. It left my skin feeling fresh, plumped and smooth. And the best testament to how it works, is that I did not have to think twice about purchasing again!

"I am a 69-yr old Irish G'ma and have used Olay products for 35 years. Olay has kept my fair skin soft and young-looking. I tried Neutrogena Toner, but it damaged my skin. I would never use anything else. My girls use Olay, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for over three years it is magnificent. It is the only thing I use on my face besides soap. I am over 66 yrs old and so many people say I do not look that old at all. Thanks Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this for several years along with other Regenerist products. People are surprised when I tell them my age. I will be 76 this year & think that Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream is one reason my skin still looks great. Thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tried nearly every Olay product at least once but my staple has always been that red jar. It goes on smoothly and absorbs completely. It makes my skin feel young and hydrated. Everyone says I have fantastic skin at 68 and look at least 10 years younger. , [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product every night. I love the feel on my skin. Not only do I use it on my face and neck but my hands as well. My skin feels firmer. My skin looks younger and is soft to the touch. This is by far my favorite Olay product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using Olay Regenerist for several years now. My grandmother used Olay all of her life and I started when I was 9 years old thanks to my grandmother. The lotion makes my skin smooth and young looking and it always hides my age which I love the most! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. IT DOES A GREAT JOB KEEPING YOUR SKIN MOIST AND YOUNGER LOOKING. I AM NOW 67 AND I MUST SAY THAT MY FACIAL SKIN IS STILL NOT WRINKLED. I SWEAR BY OLAY PRODUCTS. I ALSO USE OTHER OLAY PRODUCTS AS WELL SUCH AS THE SERUM, EYE CREAM, AND CLEANSER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin. I have been using this for years and don't want to be without it. It feels good and along with the micro-scupting serum provides an excellent base for my foundation, so I use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this for years. I tried another moisturizer and went right back to Oil of Olay. I use cleanser, serum and Microscupting Cream. I am 74 years old and am always being told that I don't look my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for years and am very pleased with it. It exfoliates my facial skin in a less harsh manner than some of the prescription meds that I've tried. Since I am getting older, 64, my skin is getting thinner. Harsh, drying chemicals only irritate it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Regenerist Fragrance-Free Micro-Sculpting Cream for several months and am extremely satisfied. It is easy to apply to my face and isn't greasy. My face feels smooth and my make-up goes on without any effort. I have also noticed that my complexion looks brighter and I do not appear to have as many wrinkles. I have bought several of the Regenerist products over the years and am very happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product for 6 months straight as directed and didn't see any recognizable difference in my skin. Only have fine to medium wrinkles and they did not seem to be any change. Have used Olay moisturizing products for years and still do, but won't spend the money to purchase high end creams with little to no benefit [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've always liked Olay products. I have several allergies and can only use certain products. I love that the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is fragrance free as I cannot use products with fragrance. It makes my skin feel very soft with no irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very comfortable to wear. Great moisturizer with silky feeling texture. Not too oily but moiturizes well. The fragrance free version fits my sensitive skin perfectly. Get the same feeling as those very expensive brand moisturizers but this one is so affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an amazing product, and I will never stray away from it again. I have tried many, many products over the years, and I ALWAYS come back to this product. I don't know why I keep trying anything else when I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer! Others make my skin feel dried out, but this makes my skin feel soft, smooth, and most of all, clean. Please don't ever stop making this product or I would be lost! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product since it's beginning and am pleased with the way my skin looks at my age of 77 yrs. I do have some discoloration but it is minimal and has not increased. I used to use Charles Of the Ritz until it was discontinued. I believe Olay is every bit as good, perhaps better. Thanks for your continued advancement in product effective. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that this cream is fragrance free for my sensitive skin! My skin has never looked better. it is soft and has a glow to it. The fine lines on my forehead have disappeared!!! I'm in love with this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best product I've ever found for firming up sagging skin. The results on my jaw line left me true believer in this product. My jaw line is now much firmer and has some definition to it. Great overall for the face and chest area and results are visible within a short time of use. Wouldn't be without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay products and I love Olay Regenerist micro sculpting lotion in a pump bottle. But, do not buy creams that are packed in jars that are opened to the air and you dip your fingers in the product. The effective ingredients in the product degrade when you open the jar and expose the product to the air. This product would be great if they would offer it in a squeeze tube with a rotating cap to keep out the air."
"Yes my skin for a 61 year old is in a bad shape, very senstive now I have brown patches on it HELP pls, I am very satisfied with the creams i hva eused from Olay, my late mother used Olay all her life. Yes we are an Olay family [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was the first product I used from the Regenerist line and I became a fan immediately. The silky texture and a very soft scent conquered me. The cream is very good, it moisturizes well and keeps on skin for a long time, leaving the face with the same silky texture. It isn't perfect because don't have sunblock [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 45 years old with very sensitive skin. I have tried many, many wrinkle creams over the years. If they have any fragrance at all my skin will get red and itchy. This cream is the best I've ever used. I love the texture and zero odor. It feels clean and pure on my skin and hydrates really well. I use it twice a day and am very pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love that there really is NO fragrance. My skin feels silky and soft after applying with none of the almost ""slimy"" feel I've gotten with other products. Crow's feet are my main concern, they are less noticeable after several weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After reading about this product (Regenist Micro-Sculpting cream )in numerous magazine articles, I tried it. It did soften my face. But I primarily bought this product to apply over Retin A to miminize its drying effects. Because my face is sensitive to fragrances , I bought the unscented version. Over all, I am satisfied with this product as I think it works well when used consistently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have been using this product for quite a few years now and love it. It makes my skin feel smooth and not greasy. I don't look my age and I think Rergenerist helps. I'm 72 years old and would recommend this product for everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My dermatologist recommended this to moisturize my skin. After a number of skin cancers removed it helps to have soft skin when they sew. I'm a 69 year old male and probably will have a few more removed so I'll keep the skin soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using Olay since I was 16. I started using Regeneris Micro-Sculpting Cream a few years ago and it' amazing. I didn't use the product for a week and my wrinkles started appearing again, so I quickly started using the Sculpting cream again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good serviceable product. not sticky and does hydrate skin, this is comparable to other higher end products, but is not overly emollient. If your skin is really dry, you may have to layer this with something else. No smell and doesn't make you break out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream leaves my skin feeling fresh, soft and subtle without being greasy. It absorbs instantly, and leaves a youthful glow, which at the age of 53 is pretty remarkable. I have been using tis product for over 5 years and love the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Oil of Olay for 39 years. However, I have bought other products during this time and nothing compares to Oil of Olay. Oil of Olay has the greatest products in my opinion, the best. When this product made its debut, I had to buy this moisturizer. I'm turning 57 at the end of this month and, women always ask me what's my secret. Well, its no secret, it's Oil of Olay and of course plenty of water. Thank you for your wonderful products :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using Olay products probably 15 years ago. I've always seemed to have a problem with dry, flakey skin and Olay moisturizers have made that problem go away! I also use the Cover Girl/Olay combination foundation and it looks so much more natural and smooth than any others I've tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At the age of 83, I have used a myriad of moisturizers but none as good as Regenerist micro-sculpting cream. I love the texture (not greasy) but my skin is soft. People think that I am in my 60's as it has made my skin so much younger looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an upscale product, with a lesser price tag. Works just as well as the pricey Department store products, and was voted #1 in Allure magazine many times. This cream blends in with any other skin care products and doesn't leave any residue or greasiness on the skin. Sometimes at your favorite drug store, you can get it, buy 1 get one half off. You can't go wrong with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream on my face morning and night. The light creaminess is just right to moisturize without feeling heavy or greasy. It also keeps my skin looking great... and also feeling great. I get lots of compliments on my skin, and since this is the product I use as a moisturizer, I'm clearly getting great results. I love Olay Regenerist products! They work and are a great value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream since it was introduced on the market. People are always commenting on my young-looking skin. I am always asked which ""department store"" product I use. I surprise people when I tell them that I use Regenerist products exclusively! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I have been using Olay for many years and as I age I must use the age appropriate items. I tried this product and am very happy with the results. My lines around my mouth have diminished greatly, also the lines around my eyes. I do feel better when I look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Regenerist micro sculpting cream since it came out. Prior to this, I used Total effects. I am 45 years old. People guess me to be 27-32. Once someone said 35 and I was offended! lol. LOVE this moistuizer. Hydrates without feeling greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this cream for a couple of years now and like it much better then anything I have used. I wash my face at night and apply the cream liberally and when I wake up and finish my shower apply again before I put on my makeup. It has softened my skin and made the little eye and lip creases much softer and less noticeable. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this product for years and I always get compliments on my skin. I'm 54 and have been told I look much younger, which I attribute to a product that actually does what it says it will do! The few times I've strayed and tried something else, I have regretted as my skin has either not responded or has had a reaction. I now simply buy it, picking it up whenever I see it on sale at my favorite store. This skin cream is all it says it is and more. Thank you, Regenerist!

I have been using regenerist micro-sculpting cream for over 10 years. I use it under my make up and it leaves my skin soft and smooth without a greasy feeling. It is excellent to prevent fine lines from forming and leaves skin looking younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I am not a ""spring chick"", the contour is very important to me and this product does improve it significantly. Honestly I think that Olay discovered a wonderful formula for our skin improvement. The alo have one more line ProX which is absolutely fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using OLAY as long as I can remember,have used your cosmectics untill discontinued by OLAY. When I am out with my 57 year old son,I am addressed as his wife and he is also young looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay is the only product that I can use on my skin. I seem to be allergic to all others except for an advertised truly non allergic product. Many years ago I tried going without your cream and I could see a big difference in my skin within 10 days (and not for the better). I would never be without it now. Please don't change the formula.

"I've used Olay moisturizing products for MANY years and continually receive compliments regarding my smooth, youthful skin tone. I have never been disappointed with the Olay products I've purchased. Olay moisturizers continue to improve.....with age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Regenerist Micro sculpting cream fragrance free for 8 years. I am 62 and have no wrinkles! I love this product! It absorbs quickly and doesn't feel greasy. My skin instantly feels refreshed and soft.The fragrance free is nice but even the fragranced one isn't that strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Micro-Sculpting Cream for a number of years now and am very happy with the results; my skin is very hydrated and I look much younger than my 74 years. I have even had dermatologists tell me my skin is in great condition!! How about that?!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Using this product was a pleasure. I used it at night time all over my face and under my jaw and throat area. I started noticing a lift in my chin/jaw area within a week. I am very pleased with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for about years and been using Olay about 25 years I absolutely Love it. I will never use anything else. I also use Olay body wash, I'm and Olay girl and always will be. It leaves my skin so sooth and brilliant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I went to the dermatologist and was prescribed all sorts of creams for my face, nothing worked. My wife then suggested In try her Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Dream and presto it was like magic my face cleared right up. I've been useing ever since with the same success.

"I love this moisturizer. Once I made the switch to the micro-sculpting cream I could tell a difference, even though I was skeptical to begin with. I think it truly has helped tighten up areas around my mouth and throat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product nightly and though I haven't seen my wrinkles disappear - I have not noticed any more wrinkles. The ones I have are the corner of the mouth down, however they have not got any deeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream feels very smooth and creamy and appears to add moisture to my skin. I frequently use it before applying makeup which allows the makeup to coat more evenly. I also love that it is fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a male who uses this product as my aftershave moisturizer and have been using the product since 2009. I even took several jars with me to Iraq because of the extreme weather conditions and I have used the product ever since. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Olay products for many year, since it was once called Oil Of Olay. My skin at 80 years old looks better than any friends or relatives that I know of. Even my doctors are amazed at the texture and color of my face, neck etc. Love all the Regenerist products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has really helped my dry skin and made wrinkles less noticeable.. I use it every morning, whether or not I use makeup..It has really made my skin look much better. When I tell people my age, (78) they tell me I look a LOT younger.... Who wouldn't like that compliment? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best moisturizer I've used. Cream immediately disappears into your skin and lasts all day without your skin feeling oily or greasy. Provides more moisture than a lotion and is strong enough to tackle winter dry skin. Daily must have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for 4 or 5 years. I am 76 years old and I have tried everything, expensive creams, I always go back to this and the Regenerist Cleanser. Why should I pay for expensive creams when this has always done the work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for as long as it has been in existence. I have sometimes switched to try other creams but always return to this one; I just do not get the results with others that I do with this one: no fragrance is such a big plus for me; tightens (noticeable sagging when I do not use it); helps to keep wrinkles at bay; moisturizes. Really what more can one ask for in a modestly priced cream! Oh and ... I have to show my ID for senior discounts! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"no matter what this is my ""ONE"" thing I must have daily!! I use several Olay products but if for any reason I dont have even makeup, I always use and must have my cream!! Love this product and line with Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been an ""Olay girl"" for over 2 decades, but this is by far the best stuff I've used. I can't handle any fragrances, so it's nice to be free. I wish there were a fragrance-free with sunblock, tho. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product since it came out. Every time I try something new it has not lived up to the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream. I use the product night and day...always makes my skin look fresh and line free. No One ever believes I am 64 years young. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In just one night of use, my face was visibly moisturized, plumped, radiant, softened to the touch, and lines around the eyes were less visible; friends commented on how rested and young my face looked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 51 years old and have used your products for the majority of my life, however over the last decade I have used the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream and I have been repeatedly asked if I have the correct birthday date down whenever I fill out forms and have even been carded three times this year. Makes a gal feel good when people think I'm 15 years or more younger. Thank you for making such a wonderful product that does what it says. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised to see the cream does tighten and tone my neck and cheek areas.The product does apply smoothly and is absorbed quickly. My wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin looks healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product and will continue to use it,for the simple fact it does exactly what it's advertised to do. It makes my skin feel amazing to the touch,and it clearly makes my skin brighter,and healthy looking..such a self esteem booster especially at my age."
"I hate to say it, but this product is absolutely worthless. I'm really frustrated at all of the money I've spent on this product only to see NO results! I've been using this for about 4 months now, and my forehead wrinkles are just as prevalent as ever; they actually look deeper than before! I will definitely be switching to a different product/brand."
I love this product.I'v been using this product for a while and recently i thought of trying something else on my skin.I tried the new product for almost 4 weeks and from day 1 i was like missing the OLAY Regenerist.I am back to using this Product now and this really leaves my skin smooth.I am 30 years old and i have fine wrinkles on my forehead and they are gone now.I definitely recommend it!
"I have been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream along with other Regenerist products for several years. I have been ""mistaken"" for a MUCH younger woman especially since I started using this product. In fact, I have been mistaken for my daughter's sister many times. When I receive a lovely compliment I always say the same thing, ""Thank you, it's Oil of Olay...the red jar!"""
"I just had to write to tell you how impressed I am with your lotion with SPF 15. I put some on my face, neck and hands early in the morning and after sitting at a trackmeet all afternoon, my legs and arms were very sunburned, but my face, neck and hands were protected by your product....Thank you so much. I have and will continue to promote Oil of Olay..."
It makes me look and feel very young. It's easy to use and feels good on my skin. I could see the difference on the first day that used it. The cost is minimal for the results that were achieved. I was surprised that it worked so quickly. I would recommend it to anyone who needs and wants to look younger.
Regenerist Night Recovery Cream & Regenerist Cream Cleanser worked great so I decided to try microsculpting cream & detoxifying scrub . Skin looked great 1st wk then I got breakouts on my forehead & cheeks. Skin also got oily after a few hours. I also needed to further cleanse about twice a week. I'm truly disappointed with this product because I don't think that it is right for my skin type.
"So I seen a ad in a magazine raving about this moisturiser. I bought it, and used it for 2 months faithfully. It makea your skin soft, but does nothing else. It would also be nice if this was not in a jar, but a pump style would do best. Really thought this would plump my face, and dimish some lines. But it did not. I will not purchase again."
"I have only been using this cream for 5 days, and already I love it!! Wasn't expecting to see a change so quickly. I noticed my skin is softer, looks brighter. I can't wait to see what my skin will look like after a month! The only thing I don't like is the smell! Olay puts entirely too much fragrance in their products!"
"I used Mary Kay for a long time, but switched to this because it's easier to get when I run out and I'm so glad I switched. I have always found it difficult to find moisturizer for my skin type which is both oily AND dry. It has helped with my dry skin so much and doesn't get greasy at all. I'm 33 and have very few lines and so I am using it more as a prevention cream so I can continue to ""pass"" for 7 or 8 years younger than I really am."
"Sadly, after faithfully using this product for 6 weeks - nothing. It worked ""okay"" as a moisturizer, but not as well as my normal Yves Rocher cream. I was hoping for at least a small visible change in the wrinkles and lines, but not a small amount happened. Additionally, my forehead was just as oily as ever and I experienced several breakouts along my hairline. I definitely wouldn't buy this product again."
"I'm a skeptic, especially about beauty and personal care products. But I have to say, Regenerist is awesome. Ive used several products in the Regenerist line and loved them all. I only notice how well it works when I stop using it for a week or so......then I wonder why my face looks so tired/wrinkly/dry/whatever. Note to self: buy more before it runs out! Lol"
"I constantly search for skin care with anti aging properties. Spent thousands on high end products and was never as pleased as I am with Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream. Seems to have all the right stuff, Hyaluraonic acid, peptides...whatever is in there it works! True confessions, I've only been using it for 3 days but I can definitely see the change in fine lines so the plumping promise must be legit. 10 years younger in 4 weeks? Hey.... Could happen!"
"I have been using the product for 3 months.I am 48 years old, and I have extremely oily skin, but in the winter, I now get some dry patches.. My skin has even felt more soft and smooth using this, and I have noticed that I have less breakouts now. And I have never had so many compliments about how good my skin looks. I like the fragrance free because sometimes I have a reaction, and I like how it is rich enough to moisturize my oily skin, but not too greasy for me."
"I purchased this product with great expectations, but found myself disappointed instead. The cream feels amazing, but the promise of visible wrinkle results is just not true! I'm 40 years old and don't have deep wrinkles, so I assumed this would do the trick. Unfortunately it hasn't. Not sure I would spend this much money on a product that doesn't work as it promises."
I just started using olay regenerist micro sculpting cream. It is amazing! I am 68 yrs old and had been noticing lip lines and wrinkles around my jaw line. After two days of using this cream they were almost gone. I will never use anything else. It is truly the fountain of youth!! Thank you Olay for such an amazing affordable product!!!
"I am 66, and a lot of people think I am at least 10 years younger, because of Olay Products. This regenerist is the BEST…. I have a habit of having my fingers tips a bit damp…then dip into the jar and it goes on great. Don't use so much that you feel it's just laying on your skin. This really absorbs using the right amount..not too much- not too little..."
"This product is okay for the price, but it does not do well under makeup. This product leaves a white cast on my face and when I put on foundation over it, the foundation collects on certain spots on my face. I had to buy another cream to use in the morning."
"People are always saying"" You look great"", to me at the stores, as we live in a small , popular ski town up in the Rockies. They guess my age at 45-55, but I fool them as I am almost 70!! I love this product, and all their products are great. You don't have to pay an"" Arm or a leg"" to look young, just be consistant with your usage each day!"
I really love this product I have used this product for 11years.. I really love how it feels nice and thick and creamy silky on your fingers just wait until you put it on your face in a upper motion. You are going to thank me later for this review and thank Olay for this reasonable price luxury produce:)
"I have been a loyal user of this product for many years, recommending it to friends. However, you have clearly changed the formula and NOT for the better. Undoubtably for the cheaper. It no longer lives up to your claim to feel as rich as more expensive creams. I will be looking for another skincare line."
I've been using this product for a year now. Picked it up based on a good review in a magazine. Love it. Does a good job of moisturizing the skin on my cheeks without being greasy. Also slather it on my neck and forehead. Stays moisturized all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used many Oil of Olay products over the years. I am now in my 60's and Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream provides a low cost combination of gentle and effective ingredients that keeps my skin healthy and looking its best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would have given this a higher review but it leaves a residue on my face. My face feels good after I use the product but to be honest I do not notice any change or difference. I follow the directions but I see no uplift. I do not think it was worth the money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product makes my skin feel soft but firmer at the same time. I am old enough I do not expect wrinkle-free but this product makes my skin feel very good. I use it every day and have been very pleased with its performance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for years on the advice of my dermatologist. My friends' reactions say it all, i.e., ""Her skin looks so great she must have had plastic surgery."" This product is rich and luxurious--far better than the high priced ""luxury"" items on the market today. I highly recommend it for any skin type. You will love the results in a very short time.

I have been using Regenerist Micro sculpting cream for s few years and it has really helped with the wrinkles. I use it every morning and every night. I am 61 years young but most people think I am 50. I really love this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this since shortly after it first hit the market. No breakouts or greasy film left on the skin, and it leaves a nice surface for applying foundation immediately. Skin feels soft and firm. Be sure to apply to your neck too. I have been losing weight, and my neck isn't wrinkly because I faithfully apply this to my throat area and neck. Strongly recommend as an economical product that does exactly what it says it does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I began faithfully using Olay products when I was just 16 years old, I am 52 today and still using Olay. Recently, I changed from Total Effects to Regenerist. It is a little thicker and seems to suit my aging skin. Also, I love that it is available in Fragrance Free since I don't like to smell fragrance on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this the micro-sculpting cream for over 6 months and can see the results of more brightness, vibrancy and added plumpness to my skin. My face feels more soft and my fine lines have decreased. Not only does the product work efficiently, the price is affordable as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Having now reached well past 'middle age', I have tried most types and brands of moisturizers and anti-aging products on the market, and the Olay Regenerist line is by far the very best I've used with the very best results...at an incredibly affordable price. I've been a customer for many years, with no plans of ever changing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in my fifties and still have occasional adult acne breakouts, usually due to trying a new skin product. I put off trying the Regenerist line because I was sure it would trigger a breakout. Recently I decided it was worth risking the $ to try it out and I'm so glad I did! No breakouts, just a rich fragrance-free moisturizer that doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes, either. My undereye area looks better already and it's only been a few weeks. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This micro sculpting cream got alot of good press, and I agree with it. It's light and feels great on the skin. Unfortunately I don't use it that often (because it's expensive) so I can't comment on whether it's made a huge difference for m. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is so sensitive that I have trouble finding products that do not cause itching and burning. I have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream daily with no problems. I am 62, and my skin is smoother, tighter, and brighter since starting the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a good example of your many products. I am a senior with flawless skin. People always ask me if I had cosmetic surgery. My answer is try Regenerist, and you will have the same results. I look 15 to 20 years younger than my actual age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay products since I was 28, today I am 64. The Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream I use on my upper eyes and at the bottom of my chin takes years off my face. I am told for my age I have hardly any wrinkles. Thanks Olay, I have loved you for 36 years now!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Best feature is it works at making skin more supple and less wrinkles. It is not greasy but feels like it penetrates my skin. I feel like I've given my skin a treat when I use this every evening. I hAve even started using it under my makeup. This works be tter than any product I have ever tried [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm almost 75 years old and have a lot of sun damage to my fair skin because of my youthful sunning days. I must have thought I was a French fry using baby oil to get ""the look"". Anyway, I am now paying the consequences with brown spots and wrinkles. I find thatRegenerist micro-sculpting cream while not doing away with all the damage I have inflicted on my face, it has helped amke the lines more smooth..

I originally received a sample of this in a beauty box but I really love it so I now purchase it and use it in my every day routine. It's very hydrating without being too greasy. It makes my skin feel smooth and firm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product. It makes my ""over 50"" skin feel so smooth and silky"". It never leaves any dry patches. It seems to just glide over your skin when you're putting it on.

I have been using the Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream for years! This cream holds the moisture in my skin making it look so soft and hopefully youthful! haha!

"From the very first time I used this product, I fell in love with it. It made my skin feel so soft and lifted. I immediately could feel the uplifting power of it. I couldn't stop feeling my face and neck area. I used it all the way down my chest area and wanted to continue to put it all over my body. I am on my second bottle and will continue to use it forever unless you come out with something better. Great job!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I love everything about it, the feel, the fragrance but most importantly I love the hydration. My skin never feels dry, which is not easy for me to find a moisturizer that accomplishes that. And it never feels oily either. It just feels perfectly hydrated. I love it. I also use it at night after I wash my face around my eyes and lips. Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

One day we look into the mirror and it scares us... I had my day a few years ago and now have a host of creams in the closet gravebasket.... I'm just finishing my first jar of this product and am so happy! Really the lines around my eyes are almost gone and I see a firmness that I thought age has taken from me.. Thank you so much Olay for this cream and for keeping the price within reach! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using product for a few years. I am 50 and people think I am in my 30's or 40's. My grandmother used Oil of Olay products and looked younger too. Thank you for keeping me looking younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product works great. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and it doesn't feel heavy at all. It makes my skin glow and appear more youthful looking. And I like the container it comes in. It's convenient for travel and makes application super easy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product from a sample I received and it's been like an eraser in a jar! People who know have commented how young I look and how awesome my skin looks. Many people think I'm 10 - 12 years younger than I actually am! Now THAT'S a great product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried many face (and neck) creams and loved this one from the first time I used it. Once in awhile, I will try another and it never compares to this cream. I use it on my face, neck and hands - I only wish it would come in a larger jar!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for the last 3 years and cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful it is! I fish a lot and am in the sun a lot. I try to protect my skin everyday from the sun but there are times when the sun is so powerful. At night when I apply this cream it is like my skin just drinks it up! My face feels so much better every morning and everyday because of this product. THank-you OLAY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have had several people tell me I have not aged for the last 10 years - this is just about how long I have been using the Regenerist micro-sculpting cream at night and during the day I use the olay moisturizer with sunscreen and I never paid any attention to it but after a few people told me my face was not as tanned as my chest/lower neck area I realized that the olay was doing a terrific job. I work outside most of the time so I get a lot of sun during the warmer months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It has a light not a heavy base to it. And blends in well with my skin texture. I like to use it as my night moisturizer. And it works beautifully under my makeup because it is so light. And that is why I Love this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I get alot of compliments on my skin . People always ask me what skin care products I use. I love products and I try alot but always go back to Regenerist sculpting cream . It feels good and my skin and stays moist. I like a cream instead of a lotion because it makes my skin feel good. I am 66 years old and I have been using regenerist for about 5 years. I got my mother in law on it and she loves it to. I would tell everyone that it is a wonderful product to try it for thereself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the fragrance free Regenerist Mirco-Sculpting Cream. I use it every day and sometimes even use the serum underneath. I have sensitive skin and this cream is perfect because it is fragrance free and fragrance sometimes irritates my skin. The moisture is good for my dry skin. I think my skin looks younger and fresher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"noticed forehead creases last year that I could feel were quite deep. started using this product and those creases are now gone. cannot feel or see them at all. I didn't honestly believe that this could possibly work to improve such deep wrinkles, but it did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many products and yet to find one that truly works. I was very pleased with this product seemed to help soften existing wrinkles along with warding off new. There is no magic in any bottle but this one has found a combination that works. My face feels so completely soft and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for the last year and I love it. It works as well if not better than the more expensive products I have tried and it actually feels like it is moisturizing after you put it on. It is a little thicker than some I have tried and I like that. You can feel it soaking into your skin and making it feel refreshed. I use it everyday even if I am using other products along with it.

"Regenerist Micro sculpting cream delivers sublte results. At an affordable price it is my go to night cream.

i have used this product for about 2 years now. it works. i am 65 and people tell me i look 50. i think that tells it all. what other people think. my skin is soft and i dont have many wrinkles or crows feet. i have used oil of olay products since they came out many years ago. i am an oil of olay gal!

"At age 61, my face is free of tiny wrinkles and I feel this is all due to my use of Olay products. I have used many Olay products over the years, but the Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream keeps my face wrinkle free and baby soft. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using microsculpt cream for almost three years now and I will never give it up. There is a noticeable difference in my skin when I skip a week, I look in the mirror and see the lines and looser skin especially under my chin and neck and after a week of continued use the lines soften and my skin becomes firmer all over.

I am 60 years old and I think this product does a great job for making your skin look and feel moisturized. It helps the lines and wrinkles look less noticable. Good skin care is so important for everyone at every age- but especially as you get older. It is even better if you start young. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the regenerist micro sculpting cream for years now and it really works!!! It provides moisture and firming all at the same time..A big bonus as I have very sensitive skin is no reactions at all!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product, a plus being it is fragrance free, I have noticed an increased suppleness to my skin. And being 60 years old, I was noticing an increased dryness to my skin. I apply every night to damp skin and in the morning it is still so soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product for about 3 yrs. and is better than a higher priced name brand from well-known dept. Stores. It moisturizes better and gives fast results resulting in younger looking skin. I wouldn't be without it. I won't return to my former moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am 73 years old and have dry blotchy skin. Since using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream my skin is much smoother and less blotchy. My foundation makeup goes over the sculpting cream easily without any flaking or streaking. At my age it is important to have a cream that deminishes wrinkles and not accentuate them. With Olay Regenerist I feel confident that I always look my best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Probably on my 10th jar with 2 in the cabinet ready for opening. It is nourishing, softening, and makes such a difference. I use the original scent as it is wonderful, no need to change to unscented. All over my face and neck before my makeup. Never oily. I sometimes cheat and use it nightly too. Must try the night formula. When they advertise minimizing wrinkles and making you feel like you have never felt before, it truly describes the product. My favorite friend.

"I have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for a couple years now. The first time I used it I noticed a plumping of the skin and softening of lines. I am 73 years old and have been using Olay products and skin care for literally decades. People are quite surprised to find out my age as Ican easily pass for being 10 years younger, at least. Is it because I have been using Olay face products for decades? I think it may be a big part of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to Oil of OLay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, this 59 year old has the face and décolletage of a 35 year old, as this product has restored firmness to my checks and jawline.

"Used No7, neutrogena, and nivea products, but this is by far the creamiest and smoothest facial cream I have ever used. I use it on my face and neck at bedtime and every morning under my make-up. It is the easiest and best absorbed cream. The scent is nice and clean smelling. I would suggest this for any age and face. Also even though this isn't in any of the categories listed the micro derm thermal scrub is great too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really was surprised at how well this moisturizer worked for me. I hadn't used Olay products until about a year ago and now I won't stop.

I have been using the olay regenerist micro sculpting cream for the last two years - tried a few times with other moisturizers but still came back to this afterwards.

I have been using olay for at least 7 years now and absolutely love this product!!!i have told all my friends and family to use it because it's better than any expensive cream out there right now. Works wonders for wrinkles and brightening the entire face and neck!!!! Love this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for years - and at almost 60 years old (yikes!) my skin looks great! Everyone always comments that I have very few wrinkles for my age and I give Olay Regenerist products all of the credit for that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 48 years old. I have tried just about every line of facial cleansers/lotions out there. By far this is the best moisturizer!! I have some breakouts and some crows feet. This minimizes them both. I won't ever change to another product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love both of these products. I use the lotion daily and truly love the fact that I am adding sunscreen along with my moisturizer.It is very light and I don't notice it at all after it has been applied. I use the cream nightly. I am a big fan of both products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love applying Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream to my face. It leaves my skin hydrated and with a silky smooth finish. I can tell my skin looks refreshed and smoother right after using it. This is great for any time of year. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is BETTER than many of the expensive department store brand. This cream feels and smells luxurious, not greasy. Your facial skin looks young, tender, and plump next morning. After long-term use, my face looks even better. This one is best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used many different cremes over the last ten years, and none of them have done so much for my skin that Regenerist has done. It has been the best wrinkle control creme that I have ever used, too. All in all, it is definitely the best creme ever. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product nightly and have noticed great improvement in my skin. Fine lines have faded, my skin is very moisturized, and has a slightly firmed up appearance. The product is not greasy, gets absorbed easily and you can use it with serums and such. An amazing product that really improves your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this cream for about 6 weeks and can honestly say that my wrinkles have diminished considerably. It has softened the lines in my cheeks and around my eyes. I also use it on my neck and it has lessened the lines there also. It is now my ""forever"" product. Thank you.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been used Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for two years now and I am totally satisfied with it. I have referred this product to my family and friends. They are also happy with it. The price is reasonable but the effect is superior. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product quite a long time ago and have really seen a difference and the way I knew it was when I ran out and did not run to buy it immediately. Within a week my skin looked terrible and I didn't realize at first what the problem was. When I did and ran to buy it, within a few days my face was back to looking great. I now use quite a few other products from this line and I am loving it. I just started using the scrub, love it. Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product daily and it goes on so smooth and makes my face feel soft. When applying my liquid foundation after using the sculpting cream, it blends so that it is hard to tell I am wearing any! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried switching to other products but I'm not happy at all... Thank You Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay products since I was about 20 years old & I'll be 60 in July. I use the micro sculpting serum along with the cream and the brightening face wash. I am frequently told that I look like I'm in my 40's - I'll take that! I love Olay products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

just as amazing as the one with the fragrance but I m a guy so i prefer this one over the other. Results are almost instant . I've been using this product for years and I'm sure will keep using it. THE BEST [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There was a dramatic improvement within a few weeks of using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I have extremely sensitive skin, so being fragrance free is greatly appreciated by me as it is very difficult to find products without fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I run out and have to substitute another product...it's just not the same great results. I need to make sure to always have a backup jar for between shopping trips. Regenerist has really helped my sun damaged hardworking hands. Thank You Olay!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used okay products for years. My grandmother always told me to take care of my skin so I did what she did. Her skin was always amazing. So now in my 50's I use the regenerist cream daily and love it. I have very dry skin and this cream works perfectly! Thank you for a wonderful product that leaves my skin smooth and not greasy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Before finding Micro Sculpting cream i spent a fortune at department stores & beauty supply stores and did not get the results i get from this fantastic product. When the jar gets a little low i'm out shopping for another so that I never run out. I will defy anyone to tell my age now that i have been a constant user of this cream since shortly after it was on the market. That you TV ads!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love this product. I have used Olay in the past, but had not tried the Olay Regenerist until a few weeks ago. I am pleasantly surprised at how moisturizing it feels on my face and neck. It also decreases the appearance of fine lines around my mouth and nose which is a big plus! I definitely will continue to use the Regenerist on a regular basis.

"I have been using OLAY Regenerist micro-sculpting cream Moisturizer for more than 30 years. Plus, Olay regenerating Serum during the day and Olay regenerating micro-sculpting Serum at night for as long. I like the way these products have kept my skin so smooth and with less wrinkles. Great products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried numerous moisturizers and always hated how heavy they felt and how strong they smelled. Purchased this after reading so many good reviews, and I love it. It's so light and soaks in almost immediately, there's NO scent, which I really appreciate, and my skin feels so soft in the morning. I'm an Olay diehard for life now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use regenerist serum which goes on under my moisturizer. My skin feels so smooth as soon as it touches my face. it is non greasy and yes I honestly can see results i smoother looking and feeling skin.

Soaks right in! I have always shied away from creams but this was light and airy not greasy at all! My skin tone improved within a week or so of use. Will use sparingly during the summer and a little more during the dry winter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product as a day to night time moisturizer . It is super hydrating and absorbs into th e skin quickly .

I bought this for myself (age 41) and found that within a few days I was getting compliments on how great my skin looked and I felt younger. I then bought it for my mother (age 64) who has never been able to afford nor use any great products and hence is very wrinkling. Within a week we all noticed a HUGE difference in her appearance and her self esteem seemed to higher as well. My sister then bought it and also feels the same as we do. Just AMAZING.

"I've been using this product for a little over a month now and I can see that my skin is looking much better. I was starting to see a little sagging on my checks but now I feel like it's back to normal. I would highly recommend this to others. I'm going to continue to use this. I also really love how it smells and goes on, not greasy at all. I use it day and night, and under my make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is an state of the art moisturizer, always rated among the best in the marke and at an affordable price. It works wonders for me and I've been using it for a long time.

"Works great to repair and moisturise. This product is in family of Olay have been using for last 2twenty five years Price is very much less than dermotogist recommended cosmetic creams for repair and moisturise aging skin.

I dislike cookie-cutter products so I was a little apprehensive about the kudos this product was getting so I tried it myself....and it works! I have combination skin and I am 77 years old with patches of dry skin. This product did was it said it would...deminished the look of wrinkles and fine lines....thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay's micro-sculpting cream is not oily. It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling soft. I was hoping it would smooth out some of the lines brought about by age and sun damage and firm up my skin. Perhaps Olay has another product that helps with these concerns. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have been using Olay products for 40 years!!.I will be 56 this month and this Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream keeps my skin so young looking! I have often been called my 28 year old daughters sister not her mom!! Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this cream! I like the consistency and it goes on smooth on my skin. The fragrance is very light. I especially like this product in the winter months because it gives you that extra layer of moisturization for your face. It has made a dramatic difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always skeptical about product stating it will help aging skin. Olay has some of the best products out there. This makes my face look younger, by that I don't have dry flaky looking skin. It feels soft and moisturized. I have tried many different products, I will be sticking with Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream for years and love it. It feel good to my skin and my skin has a soft and supple look to it.

"I had been using a more expensive, department store brand, and decided to switch to save money. A friend recommended Olay and decided to try it, and I am so glad I did! My skin looks great (and perhaps better) than it did with the prior brand. I had been concerned about breakouts and redness from changing, but didn't experience any of that! Thank you, Olay for a great product! I am about to purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is as amazing as the commercial claims, really even better. Made my skin soft and the appearance of the fine lines has truly decreased! The cost is great as well! I had been using products from two well know lady doctors and the Regenerist Micro Sculpting Creams has made more improvement than their high priced products did in four years!

"I have used this product for over a month and love it, love it, love it!! I went to a party and saw ladies I haven't seen in a few months. They said, something is different about you. You look 10 years younger. I am 65 and that was great to here. It has to be the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. This is the only thing I have changed since I saw these ladies. Great product, I will continue using this product forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Moisturizing Cream is a product that really keeps my skin smooth and greatly reduces the fine lines round my eyes and mouth which have over-taken my face. It really is a necessity, especially in the winter for my very dry aging skin. Use it with the moisturizing night cream to get the full effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Like most of us as we age, we lose elasticity in our skin and our face begins to look less defined. Once I started using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream I began to see a noticeable difference in the firmness of my skin, especially around my mouth and jaw line.

"Everyone tells me that I look 10-15 years younger than I am. I know I have good genes, but I also credit it to this product. I have used it for over ten years and I can't live without it. I won't even leave the house until I put it on in the morning. It smooths and tightens my skin and keeps it looking radiant. It also smooths out my fine lines and wrinkles so instantly my skin looks younger. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have noticed that my neck shows my age more than any other part of my face -- I started using the Oil of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream on my neck and have seen a marked improvement.

I can't tell you how many people each month ask me what I used on my face. They always tell me how pretty my complexion is and ask what I use. I always tell them Olay Regenerist. I have even had several men ask me this question. I am one of Olay's best spokes persons. I love your products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As a 70 yr. old working with 15 women from ages 25 to 60 I try to blend in with the group. I think using the regenerist cream daily helps me to avoid some of the looks of aging that I see on other friends. I apply every day before foundation and it blends in and is not greasy. My favorite product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this product for about 2 years. My skin is sensitive and is prone to breakouts. I use this product with the detoxifying pore scrub and I have clear and soft skin.

One for my travel bag and one for every day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I swear that my face looks more refreshed the next morning after applying this cream this cream before going to bed.

I have been using Regenerist for a couple of years and love the results! I will be 61 yrs old in a couple of months and have been told over and over again that I don't look any older than 50.

I stumbled upon this product via an ex-Proctor and Gamble employee who marketed the Olay product line. She raved about Olay in total but specifically recommended the Rengerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. Her raves were not unfounded. I've included this product in my daily skim regime. My facial skin is much more contoured and supple. My only question is....Can you use this product to do the same wonders for the body? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I use this product every night, using the moisturizer with spf (sun block) in the morning to get that extra protection during the day. My skin always feels so soft and smooth.

I have been using this product for a couple of years now and love the perfect amount of moisture and soft skin I get from this moisturizer.

"The texture and absorption qualities of this product are great. I am 75 years old, have used Olay for 40 years--deciding at 30 that it was time to get serious about my complexion. At that time I used the complete face cream with no sunscreen and as happy when they added it. I think the Regenerist micro-sculpting cream, used with the Olay advanced anti-aging cleanser, is great for young and older alike. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, this moisturizes like no other and has a lovely, light scent. The cream quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves my face and neck feeling soft and not at all greasy. My make-up applies nicely over this and keeps my skin hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE all of the Olay Regenerist line of products. They all work wonderfully. I love how they feel on my skin and how they make my skin feel. It makes my skin look smooth and dewy.

"I started using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream three years ago.My skin immediately started to be smoother. I noticed I didn't need to wear hardly any make-up, just lipstick and eye liner.

I've been using the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream ever since it was introduced in the market several years ago. I use this nightly in conjunction with the Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cream Cleanser and the Regenerist Serum. No one believes I am almost 62 years old!

"Although the micro sculpting cream is thick in appearance, it feels light when applied. The product should be used on the face and neck area on a daily basis to provide a hydrated, smooth texture to the skin. I have used the product for several years and would highly recommend it.

"I've been using olay for almost 10 years. I'm 38 and people always tell me how good I look, so I'm proud to say my age. I've tried other creams, but always go back to olay. I also use the body lotion.Love it!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In addition to being the absolute best moisturizing product EVER, the fragrance is wonderful. The cream's texture is silky, not greasy-feeling, quick-absorbing, and the scent is better than most perfumes.

"I use this product morning and night. I especially love it's contouring and lifting effect. I use it on my face, chin and neck and work it up for the lifting effect. Contouring happens naturally and gives me the look of having some facial muscles. This product also offers superior hydration! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used to use Lancome face creams. But the price was too high. Then I tried Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. Wow!!. I wanted to kick myself for not trying this earlier. Great Product! Great Price!

"The Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream has literally transformed my skin - luminous, smooth and has really diminished those annoying lines and wrinkles.

"I've tried the most expensive to the cheapest moistuizers, and Regenerist is the best I have found and it's a reasonable price. People are always telling me I look 10 years younger than my 80 years. I've spent my life in the sun and have sun damage, but Regenerist has smothed the wrinkles and evened the skin tone better than all the others I have tried. Most of my friends are using it now and I highly recommend it to all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream is the BEST under make-up moisturizer. Not only is it gentle on my sensitive skin, it glides easily and nourishes the dry areas to perfection. I have used this cream for a while now, but after the first few days I noticed a tightening to my jaw line and neck area. I am at the point now that I wouldn't start my day without it!

"All my friends ask me what I use on my skin and I tell them Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I use it every day after my shower. It has reduced my wrinkles considerably.

The Regenerist Micro-Scultping cream made my dry winter skin feel very moisturized; more so than many of the moisturizers I've tried over the years. I can't say that I noticed any other benefits; at least on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like Olay Regenerist products. One of my favorites is the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. It soaks right into my skin, it is light, yet has a rich feel to it. It is so luxurious, it really makes my skin feel wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product helps make me feel younger and more vitalized, making me look and feel healthy. It benefits in many ways,one such way is that it moisturizes and regenerates shape and volume across my skin. All thanks to you, thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is perfect for my sensitive skin! The selection of unscented products is usually very limited and many times the ""un"" scent is really awful. The Micro-Sculpting Cream is luxurious and a real powerhouse, offering the benefits of a prestige brand at an affordable price. Thanks for helping me look as young as I feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for over 2 months and am extremely pleased with it! Although it is a cream, it is not greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft. Also, the appearance of fine lines are gone and my skin feels firmer. I have tried other higher priced products that have not done even close to what this has done! I will be a repeat customer!!

I have been using this face cream for years and I find it to be one of the best out their. I sold Avon products for 7 years and find Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream to be one of the best out there. I have been using it for 5 years now and have had several comments about me looking younger than I am. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love all of my Olay products as I use several; however, at night, I truly enjoy my Regenerist Micro Sculpting Fragrance Free. I immediately feel relief from braving the elements throughout the day. I have noticed a drastic improvement as I have been using it for many years. I love that you have fragrance free as I have delicate and sensitive skin. Additionally, I love using the Regenerist Fragrance Free Serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have DRY skin, and find this helps keep it radiant during the winter months--I even use it during the day. The fragrance is a bit strong, but I haven't found anything else at this price point that does the job! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for several years now and I love how it goes on...not greasy or oily, makes my skin feel soft and moist. I have been using Oil of Olay products since I was in high school. Since I am celebrating my 50th class reunion this summer that is a long time to be committed to one brand! The quality just keeps getting better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the texture. Use it most nights and never feels greasy. This works well with any other evening moisturizer. Wait for a great sale and then buy several jars, though it lasts a long time. Recommend for more mature skin. I take a lot of medication and my skin tends to be dry. This helps greatly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for 3 years. I have tried other name brand creams (Clinique, Avon ,Mary Kay)but none compared to the way Regenerist makes my face feel silky and not greasy. I have just turned 60 and people always comment about how young I look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Noticed a difference in my face from the first day i used it. An overall improvement in my face after a week. I had smoother, more younger looking skin. I even got compliments, people asked me ""What have you done to your face"" :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product on one side of my face and a much more expensive product given to me by a friend. at the end of a month there was improvement on both sides of my face, but Olay was so much more affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream makes my skin glow! My brain insists that I am still 35 and using RM-SC makes my skin say yes to my brain! I can see my jawline taking shape and my neckline has never looked better. This is a rich, non- greasy cream that goes on smooth and immediately gives my face definition and suppleness! At 60, I finally know what I want and RM-SC is it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using various Olay products for years. Though many of the products seem to overlap, I always put Micro-Sculpting Cream on top of every other essence or treatment I use after an evening shower. It helps my skin feel soft without feeling ""tacky"" or sticky. I recently found a travel-size jar and am thrilled! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many other moisturizers and have found this product to be the best. It seems to help with lessening the looks of wrinkles as I have aged and has made the skin on my face feel and look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm a 56 year old nurse & I have patients & families who think I lie about my age & must be 35-40! Why would I lie older? LOL. I say it's because I use Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream. I can notice a difference if I run out for more than a few days. I love how my skin looks & feels! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love Regenerist and I've use many of Olay's pricey competitors - every time I come back to Regenerist. I love the way it absorbs cleanly into my skin making it feel smooth and soft. A great primer for a light foundation as well. So sign me up for life cause I'm a Regenerist woman! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used 4 jars of the micro-sculpting cream. It has helped my skin feel softer and firmer and If I skip a few days like I did on vacation because I took it out of my bag and forgot to put it back in, I definitely felt the difference. I went searching for a store and bought more on the spot. I have a friend who uses a very expensive product and even she finally admitted that this product is better than her expensive one.

"I have been using Olay Microsculptiing Cream for many years. I am in my 60's and people say my skin is great and that I don't look my age. Even if heredity plays any part in that, I wouldn't change my routine for anything. I like looking younger than my real age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i've been using this product mixed with the Regerenist Overnight Mask and the Regenerist Luminous Cream switching back and forth and these products are simply magical. I love it so much. Have been a big fan for over 3 or 4 years now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this for my night cream. I've used it for years and it really works well. On the rare occasion I'm not going out during the day (as in I need SPF) I put it on in the morning also. It is so hydrating and quickly absorbs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Had been using regenerist sculpting cream for years and my skin stayed tight and got asked frequently what face cream I use.I always hear comments about not showing my age .I'm Asian and I thought that it's my ethnic background that helps me stay younger until my family reunion that I realized that it is from religiously daily use of my Olay regenerist sculpting cream.

"My skin loves this moisturizer so much that if I use a different product my skin rebels and starts to break out. I thought it may have been too heavy of a cream for day time but when I stopped using in it the summer for my morning routine, my skin tried to over compensate for the lack of moisture, that it caused break outs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for years, I feel that it makes my skin smoother and clearer. Truthfully my deep wrinkles have not disappeared (I did not expect them to ) but it definitely softens smaller wrinkles. I use it at night, and under my make up during the day, which helps make my foundation look smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the micro sculpting cream starting with a sample, but I fell in love with it. In less than a week I could see a visible difference in my skin tone and look. And best of all it's affordable on a very tight budget! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I find something that works, I stick with it. This is my history with micro-sculpting cream which I discovered more than five years ago. Since then I have used first micro-sculpting serum then micro-sculpting cream every night to care for my skin.. I am now 77 and my complexion looks great. This is no question that I plan to continue with this regiment with the help of Olay. Thank you, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is the best I have ever tried in my 65 years. I have large pores and it doesn't clog them up. It also has no bad odor. On my neck it actually helped tighten up my sagging skin. I am thrilled to have found it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for about 2 years now along with the other regenerist products. The cream is lightweight and does not feel heavy under make up. It absorbs quickly and my wrinkles/ fine lines have diminished with constant use. It works great as a daily moisturizer and won't clog pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying multiple creams for my combination skin, this one is one that I have stuck with for years. I have seen a difference in my complexion as well as disappearance of wrinkles. It never leaves my skin greasy, and remains light after application. A must have for everyday wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would be lost without this skin cream. I have been using it for many years, and get many compliments about my wrinkle-free skin. I am in my 80's! I use it morning and night after washing my face. This is just as good as any of the high priced face creams. I will be using it as long as it is available....in the fragrance free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this cream for years now and just celebrated my 50th birthday with no wrinkles (a few fine lines, but not wrinkles!) I love this cream and would be lost without it, I've tired others only to realize they don't work like Regenrist Micro- Sculpting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the micro-sculpting cream for at least five years. I have had no reason to try another product or brand. It keeps my skin well-hydrated. It never feels dry or tight. I use it in conjunction with the micro-sculpting serum at night after cleansing. I also use the anti-aging eye roller. I started with the micro-sculpting cream and now use Olay skin care products exclusively. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm 72 year's of age. I've been using the Regenerist products for a very long time. I love the micro sculpting cream. I'm told I look like I'm 10-15 years younger. I've been a dedicated user of many of your products. I love the fact that I can afford the daily regimen. I use many of the regenerist products. I feel great and my makeup goes on so beautifully and smoothly. Thank you Olay for your wonderful products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay has for many years been a part of my facial skin care. Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream has gone a step further than the facial lotions and as I grow older has become very important to me. This cream softens my skin and wrinkles on my face. I am allergic to many face products and I have breakouts easily. Not with Regenerist products and I thank Olay for developing this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product many years and can definitely recognize when I have not! My sixty year old facial skin is renewed to less wrinkles and lines and a healthy glow returns when using daily. A simple dab worked in well with gentle fingertips does the trick. I definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Olay products for 30+ years and the results have been with complements on how I look younger that my years. I have used the facial cleanser, lotions and now the regenerist line.

"this cream is not only smooth, creamy and feels great on my skin, but it is also fragrance free. My skin is very sensitive and it makes it difficult to find products that don't cause break-outs or hives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Micro-Sculpting Cream is fabulous. It goes on light, and the smoothing effects are amazing. I have been using it for 6 years now, and it has kept my skin supple. It's helpful to open your pores with a warm washcloth first, and then apply it. What I really like about it is that it feels like I have nothing on. and I need no makeup over it. .

"Have used Regenerist for years and recently spent 6-8 months trying a different well known product which claimed better results. WRONG. So happy to be back to Regenerist, a product that immediately makes your face feel wonderfully nourished and that shows almost instant results. Never leaving it behind ever again.

"Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream has provided for me a product that I use with confidence. I have used this product since it first came on the market. I have tried other products but I always come back to Regenerist because no other product gives me the results I am looking for, smooth skin,appearance of diminishing lines and wrinkles. This is a product I do not want to be without. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these products! For the price point they actually work and I love the fact that I'm not paying three times the retail for other products that are ""top shelf department store"" types. I also love the fact some Olay products are available in unscented varieties. Bravo Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Love this cream and what it has done for my skin. It feels and looks 10 years younger than my actual age and I also love that it is fragrance free as I do not need fragrance in my facial products.

"Olay Regenerist, micro sculpting cream, both scented is my go-to moisturizer for 10 years.. I am 67 years old. Several people have complimented my skin texture for a woman my age. Not only does my face receive this cream, but also my neck. It is my belief that using this on the neck area has forstalled the ""creepiness"" in the neck area [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What a wonderful product; easy to apply because of silky consistency; non- irritating; wake up to a tighter, firmer, and smoother look.

"I can't say enough about this cream. My favorite feature is that it's light and non-greasy, yet provides all-day moisture to my combination skin. My liquid foundation applies perfectly on top of this product too. The best part is how affordable it is, compared to other moisturizers I've used over the years. And I love all the compliments I get on my skin and how young people say I look. I'm absolutely hooked on this product! Thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for several years. I am almost 66 years old, and this product has kept my skin smooth. It is a grate moisturizer. It keeps your skin soft. Many people think i am much younger than my age, and i believe this product and other Olay eye products and serums that I use are all responsible for keeping you looking than your actual years. I will always use these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Previously for quite some time, I've used Regenerist Regenerating Serum and haven't any regrets. But my last two bottles has been Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum.

"I have used this product several times and love it. However, I would love it if it came in a pump or some other system, so that I don't have to stick my fingers in it. I've used a plastic paddle but that pickup too much product. I'm looking forward to repurchase this product as well as some others in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay products for over 20 years. I like the way the products feel on my face as they work their magic. It has been very rewarding to watch as the lines on my forehead, around my eyes, and even around my lips began to decrease. I also use Olay complete SPF 15 as extra precaution. I like that better than regular sunscreen because it is non greasy and blends into my skin. I am 74 years old and people are very surprised when they learn my real age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have just finished my second jar of this product. I have always used a department store brand but decided to try out the Olay line. I guess the reason that I am addicted is because it works without feeling heavy on the face & neck. I can't stand heavy creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Amazing product. It really reduces fine lines and wrinkles . It leaves my face feeling and looking smooth. Great for all skin types too.very rich and creamy. Not to light but, not to heavy also. Also has a very pleasant fragrance. Not to over powering especially if you get migraines. I love this product and would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.

"I love that this product not only works, but is also affordable! I have spent so much money on creams that didn't do much more than feel better skin. With Regenerist, I can visibly see the difference in my skin. I am 61 years old, with very sun damaged skin. Regererist is making a difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Everyone is talking about Olay Regenerist micro sculpting crème! So I tried it as I knew my skin really needed the moisture. How easy to apply before bed and just sleep my way to getting younger.

"I have used Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for approximately ten years, and I am delighted with the results. My face feels soft, many of the (inevitable) lines are greatly reduced, and it gives my face a much younger appearance (others' comments, not self-praise). I am 72 years old, and when other people guess my age, they say no older than 50. Quite a spirit lifter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Used regularly this product works at keeping your face firm. Put on morning and evening before bed you wake up with a firmer looking face. Over time your skin tightens and aging disappears. You begin to look younger without much work. I have been told I look 10 years younger than my true age of 59... Oil of Olay is the only product that I use... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this cream alot. However, what would make it better would be for it to have an spf of at least 30. If I don't wear my tinted moisturizer which has an spf of 20 I need to use another moisturizer that does have sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using Olay products for 20+ years. Most people think I'm in my late 20's or early 30's. I'm actually 52 years young and attribute my youthful appearance to daily use of the Olay Regenerist line. The products have a rich texture, are extremely easy to use and make my skin feel incredible. I've tried more expensive products, but haven't found anything that is as good as Olay.

Within the first week of using this product I could see a reduction in my laugh lines. No other product has worked as well as this one.

I use this product nightly. I have never had anyone tell me I have nice skin but since using this product I have had multiple people pay me that very compliment. I can definitely see and feel a difference in my complexion. I do prefer the fragrance free as the other has MUCH too strong of a fragrance. Too much of a old strong perfume smell.

These products make my face as smooth and glowing as it did when I was young. It smooths my many wrinkles and gives me more confidence. I love to touch my face and feel the softness and can see the difference when I've not used it as often as I should. My friends notice my smooth skin too and asked me what I use.

Olay's Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is rich and creamy without being too heavy or greasy and is non-irritating to my skin. This product has a pleasant scent that, unlike some other brands, is not perfumey or overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The best ever! I am 55 and have used this for years. People are telling me my skin looks awesome. I switched to another brand and guess what? No more compliments!

I have used this cream for at least 5 years. I am 65 and people are always commenting on how great my skin looks. I have very few wrinkles and attribute it to this cream.

"I have been using this moisturizer for almost a year and although it feels really good on my dry skin and I feel my skin looks better since I started using it, the only negative feature I have noticed, is it does not work well with face Primers.

"All Olay products are superior in every way - i have been an Olay aficionado and consumer for 45 years, and no one believes I am 77. I owe this to my regular Olay use, initially, and then, adding Olay Regenerist to my regimen, most recently, the smooth and silky Fragrance Free, Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, that must have been created on Olympus and fallen to earth, that we mortals might also enjoy the prolonged glow of youth...

"People tell me I have good skin--same thing they used to tell my mother, who used Olay facial cream every night before going to bed. And I am convinced, after using Regenerist since it appeared on the market, that Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream helps keep my face looking younger than its sixty-four years! Thanks, Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The micro-sculpting cream is definitely for nighttime use and is very thick. If you skin is feeling dry, definitely apply this cream and it will hydrate right away. The one thing that I did noticed was that sometimes it would cause some dead skin to roll up into a ball when massaging on the face. I dont really experience this with other creams, only this one.

"I have been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream since it first came out. It is wonderful, as it goes on easily, is quickly absorbed and has kept my skin from aging. In addition, I do believe it has generated new skin cells, decrased the incidence of mouth creases from the mouth corners to the nose and lessened the appearance of fine lines. It is a wonderful product as are all the products in the Regenerist line. Buy it, and use it, you will be pleased [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Over the years, I have used quite a few brands of moisturizers .. some of them outrageously expensive and others quite cheap. None of them has even come close to the results I get from Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. It makes my skin soft and supple, makes fine lines less noticeable, and it has never once caused redness or any other problems with my very sensitive skin. It is the perfect moisturizer for me!

Leave it to Olay, whose products have been there for me since I was a teen, to come up with a cream that firms, moisturizes, and sculpts my sagging jawline.

Due to sensitive skin issues, I like to go fragrance free and this product is still luxurious and works wonders without the burn of fragrance.

"Used the Regenerist moisturizer for the first time a month ago after finally opening ""gift set"" from Christmas. I usually use regular Olay daily moisturizer with SPF 30, but ran out. All I can say is........I wish I would have started using the Regenerist line years ago!!! Love it!! I could tell a difference in the softness of my skin in less than a week. Would definitely recommend this!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this for the fine lines especially around my mouth and notice a difference since using it. It is a great moisterizer that is not greasy at all. I love the smell and refreshing feeling when I apply it. It is also great for touching up makeup mistakes with a q-tip. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love love love this cream! I've been using it for a couple of months and as long as I use it faithfully every single night the skin under my chin and on my neck stays smooth and doesn't get baggy or wrinkled [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical that this product would perform as advertised. But it was from Olay who has served me well in the past so thought I would try it. Well, just a few applications - maybe a week of use - and my skin is amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is a cream that I purchase to firm up my aging face. I use it at night; bedtime and after that I used it during the day while attending to my workload. I receive comments on how much younger I look, my skinsias glaring with a brilliance that lasts to this day, I couldn't be happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin was becoming drier and duller, to the point where I started to avoid mirrors. After trying a number of products I discovered Micro-Sculpting Cream, and after about three days my face started feeling softer and smoother than it had in years. I'm 67 years old, and I like mirrors again! Yay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for many years, and I love it! I am 46 years old but my skin still looks young, although I have those little wrinkles normal to my age. I tried samples of more expensive products but this is the best in quality and price. Many of my friends ask me what kind of beauty rutine I have and I always recommend this product to them.

"Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream is a must for anyone wanting firmer, smoother skin. Each night after cleansing my face I apply this luxurious cream to my face and neck. My skin is amazing, I have used this product for over two years and recommend it to my friends. As long as Oil of Olay manufactures this product, I will be a loyal customer. The price point makes this product an excellent value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for many years. And have always gotten positive remarks about my skin.

"I've been using this for the past 5 years. Let's just say I'm old enough for Medicare and It's very uplifting to be told I do not look my age. Its non-greasy, non-sticky formula just glides on leaving my skin looking refreshed. I believe it more than amply compares to designer products at a MUCH lower price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I purchased this product because after my 41st birthday I started to notice a few more smile crinkles around my eyes. I have been very pleased with the product. I recommend you only use it where you need it. I have been using it as an ""all over"" face moisturizer and its too heavy for all of my face. I noticed a pimple and I think it is because I am using too much moisturizer in certain areas It is however, definitely reducing my crinkles around my eyes.

I've been using this for years and it is my favorite night cream. Rich with benefits but not heavy. I look 10 years younger than my age. Even my sister thought I had work done. Don't stop at your face but do use it on your neck and découpage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

If I had to choose one skin care product that I would not be without..this is it ! It absorbs so well ..never greasy and makes you skin feel so smooth. But the best review I could give is that hear so often ....HOW OLD ARE YOU??? Who doesn't love hearing that they look 10 or 15 years younger.

Olay Regenerist gets 5 stars from me. I have been using Olay since I was a teenager. My grandmother always had a bottle on her dresser. Now I get the advantage of the advanced Regenerist line. My face looks and feels moisturized and has a luminosity I don't get with any other product. I will continue to use the Olay Regenerist line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried this for the fist time about a year ago. I will never change to another cream. I have tried so many creams in the past that felt good on my skin but there were never any visible results. With this cream I noticed results within the first month. Also, the price is not the lowest but quite manageable. I will continue to use this cream.

I absolutely love the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. It feels so soft and apply s so light and sheer that I have no problem wearing under my makeup. I have noticed a big difference in my skin.

"Results are what matters, right? This cream reduces those annoying lines that come with aging and eliminates the finer little wrinkles that appear. The result is a smoother, younger looking finish to the skin. Regenerist gives results that make me smile (and a smile is a line that nobody minds).

"For years, I used expensive department store brand moisturizers. I was delighted to find Olay Regenerist at a reasonable price. The results are as good if not better than the expensive products I had been using. After using Olay Regenerist for over a year, I received one of the moisturizers I had used previously as a gift. After using it, I could see no difference which increased my appreciation for Olay Regenerist. I like the feel and weight of Olay Regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was great. Very smooth with no greasy residue. Quick to being absorbed. No strong smells.

"I ran out of the micro-sculpting cream and used something else for approximately two weeks. It was no where near the quality of Regenerist. When I finally replenished my supply, I saw an immediate improvement and so did my co-workers. My skin I received so many compliments. I've sworn by Olay products since I was 16. At 50, my skin has thanked me for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm turning 50 this year and I've tried many products but I always come back to Olay. I love the way it feels on my skin. I believe Olay products have taken care of my skin over many years and keep me looking younger.

"I've been using this for around 4 years now. It is light to the touch and refreshing to the shin... I'm used to using face creams and I've seen a change to the positive as to my skin texture and wrinkles. At my age I should have many but just minor forehead ones...

I am over 50 years of age and I have found this to be an excellent anti aging cream. It is not too heavy to use during the day under makeup but I can also use it at night.

My Mom has always used Olay products and she looks 15-20 years younger than she is. I do not need more proof than that. I have been using Olay since I was in my early 20s and it has paid off.

Critical part of starting a wrinkle reduction plan. I use it after retinol products and skin just glows in the morning.

Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is one of the best moisturizing creams I have used. I started using this cream when it was first released to the public and still use it. It nourishes my skin and leaves it with a very refreshing look and feel and the ingredients of amino peptides smooth the fine lines and wrinkles. I have repeatedly been told I look 10 years younger than my age and I credit that to the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am 57 years old and I love this product. A short time after I started using it people were asking me what make-up was I wearing. Truthfully, I did not change my make-up I changed my skin care.

Amazing product, and I am now hooked on Olay products."
One day we look into the mirror and it scares us... I had my day a few years ago and now have a host of creams in the closet gravebasket.... I'm just finishing my first jar of this product and am so happy! Really the lines around my eyes are almost gone and I see a firmness that I thought age has taken from me.. Thank you so much Olay for this cream and for keeping the price within reach!
"I have been blessed with good skin. At nearly 71, most think I'm in my early 50's, and don't wear makeup. Found out very early make-up causes my skin to break out. For the past 10 years I have been only using the Olay facial care products. Thanks Olay for making great products which keep me looking younger than I really am.."
"Not the same as it used to be. It clumps horribly once I apply it and it doesn't do a thing to diminish the appearance of frown or forehead lines as it used to. I don't even have the same glow using this product. It must be a new formula, but I don't like it."
I have been using Olay Regenerist Moisturizer for at least five years. I love the creamy feel on my face and the light protection it provides my skin. I apply it morning and night to get the full benefits. I am 74 years young and am told I look younger.
Tried this product for over 8 weeks and didn't help the wrinkles in any way. I am 65 but think I look pretty great for my age. I am totally disappointed and thought Olay products were pretty reliable and good. Did not help in any way. The cream is nice and it felt good on my skin but was not effective at all. I am going to request a refund.
MY mom is 80 years of age and has used Olay products for as long as I can remember. She has NO wrinkles and I contribute this to OLAY product's. My DR even suggested my husband use Olay for dry patches of skin. It worked wonders! Mom says Olay Regenerist makes her skin baby soft.
"I've been using this for about 4 weeks now. It's pretty thick and needs time to dry before applying makeup. My skin feels tacky. I've seen improvement so I think I'll keep this for nighttime or winter and get something lighter for summer. I'll stay with the Olay products, though."
I love the way this cream feels on my skin. I have used very costly products and can say that this product has many positive attributes. I have normal to dry skin and I noticed a difference after 1 week of use. My only concern is that I wish the product did not have parabens as I am trying to use products without these ingredients. I may continue to use the product because of how my skin is feeling and starting to look. If the company took away the parabens they would have me as a lifer.
"I have used Olay for years, I am 39 years old and I still get comments from people thinking I am in my twenties. Love the new Regenerist, especially the smell, Olay, I wish you would come out with a body butter product and wash in the Regenerist! It would be great if you did!"
"I've been using Olay products for over 30 years and still love them today! Regenerist Microsculpting Cream is my favorite moisturizer, I admit I've tried other products over the years, but I always come back to Olay Regenerist, it's simply the best!!! I'm 65 years old, but am frequently mistaken for 50-55. The only thing I would change about this product is the addition of an SPF, then I could use it during the day, as well as at night. Thank you, OLAY!!!"
"Having tried every Olay product(well, almost) I was surprised at how much I LOVE this! It has helped with my dry eyebrows. and my puffy under eye area. I only use it at night or when not wearing makeup. I don't like the feel of it under makeup. But as my skin gets drier, I will probably change my mind,"
"I have used Olay since it came in that little ""Pink Bottle"" and was called Oil of Olay!!! Now ""Regenerist"" products are my daily routine. Micro Sculpting Cream, Micro Sculpting Lotion and Serum are on the vanity to remind me that even at my age ""I CAN look good"" and sparkle with a good, daily regiment of Olay."
"Needs less grease and more 'microscuplting"". It's a decent moisturizer for no-makeup around the house, but doesn't mix well with foundation makeup - makeup just lays on top, emphasizing wrinkles, which, of course, is the exact opposite of the desired result. Haven't seen ""firming"" of jaw line in the 5 years I've been using the product. No difference in smile lines during that time either. Good start, but try again."
"I have used Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream for over two years and I continue to see the fabulous results. My skin is smooth, more elastic, wrinkles/lines are reduced. I especially like the choice of an unscented formula. This product works well under makeup and I wouldn't use any other moisturizer."
I absolutely love Micro Sculpting Cream! Sometimes I think I can do better....then I switch around to something else....and I always go back to this cream. This cream really moisturizes and leaves my skin looking soft and supple....so many other products end up leaving my skin feeling and looking dry. I'm 47 and I'm told quite often that I look alot younger......I truly believe its this cream!
"This is absolutely my favorite skincare product. I wish it came with an SPF so I could use it all the time. It is easy to use, goes on and absorbs and my skin definitely looks better when I use it daily. I have not tried the eye care product, but I will."
"Yes, Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream is my new best friend. I use it both day and night. It is non greasy,but hydrating. Easy to use with makeup. And best of all, it REALLY works for me!! My skin was so dry I thought nothing would help for long,but over a few months time my skin just keeps looking better!!"
I have used Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream for the past 4 years! I absolutely love it. I recently tried the Fragrance Free brand and it worked just as well as the original. I noticed that my skin soaked up the cream and looks radiant! I have tried other creams (2 separate brands) but within the week have went back to Olay. My skin does NOT look as though it has aged in the past four years! Thank You Olay!
"I have not seen any change on my skin, I've been using this product for at least 3 weeks now and I have not seen any of the improvements mentioned this product will make. I do clean my face with regenerist gel and I love it, but maybe the micro sculpting is not for my face. Would love any recommendation from Olay as I do believe they are good products but like anything else, not everything has the same effect on everybody.."
"When I was young, around 18, I noticed how flawless my aunt's face was. I ask her one day how she kept her face so aglow and she replied, ""I have always used Oil of Olay."" She was in her fifties as I am now. I started using the products and have ever since. I love the soap, moisturizer, and the anti-aging creams. When I tried to stray away to other costly products I never was completely sold or satisfied. I always came back to Olay and am there to stay. My skin thanks me for it. Sincerely, DebLou"
"Frangrance free or not, this cream is the BOMB!!!! I even prefer it to the Wrinkle Revolution complex cream. This has reduced my wrinkles and keeps my face feeling hydrated. Just love it! This, in combination with the eye roller, has made me look many years younger than the 43 years that I am. Keep up the good work Olay!!!"
I have been using Olay products for years and love them all! I have just started using the Regenerist line and am very happy with this moisturizer. I love the feel of it and my only complaint is the fragrance.(my reason for the 4 star rating) I wish Olay would come out with a fragrance free version.
"I've been using Olay for a little over 15 years now. I am in mid 30's and look younger than my younger two sisters. This is the only product I trust and will ever use. When people find out how old I truly am, they are taken back and can't believe I am in my mid 30's and not in my mid 20's."
"Best for normal/oily, NOT dry skin. WAY TOO MUCH FRAGRANCE!!! 4-yr old daughter hates the way this smells and asks me not to use it - she's right. Good skin care shouldn't smell like cheap perfume. Please do my skin a favor and make fragrance-free versions of all your products."
"While I like this product, I wish it was unscented or had a lighter scent like the Olay complete night fortifying cream. If there was an unscented option, I would buy it again, but as for now I most likely won't. If you can handle strong scents it's a pretty good product, but it's not something for me."
This stuff is amazing. I am crazy about the way my skin looks and feels. Woman at work are complementing me on my skin. I have never in my life loved the way my skin looked. I ran out of my usual cream and read about this one in Good Housekeeping. I decided to give it a try. I saw a difference in 3 days. I now describe my skin as dewy. Can't wait to try your other products!
"I have been using this for a few weeks and haven't noticed as much of an improvement as I have had with the night recovery cream. I don't feel as moisturized shortly after using this one. I love the olay creams so I'm going to keep using this one, maybe I haven't been using it long enough to see anything but for now it is just ok. I like the smell and I do feel a sort of toning sensation with some uses. I hope with prolonged use I will see more of a difference."
"Not only is this a great wrinkle cream, but it also works Great on your hair for the ""fly away frizzies."" I somehow accquired a sample of this ""sculpting creme"" and did not realize it was for wrinkles. Thinking it was ""sculpting creme"" for hair, I used it and now use only this in my hair! No more ""anti frizz"" or ""humidity control"" hairspray or hair wax!!! It does not even leave my hair oily or gunky, only smooth controlled style."
"I have worked for cosmetic companies and have tried many products, but, the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream is one of the finest products I have ever used. I have been using it for about 2 months and have noticed an unbelievable transformation in the texture and firmness of my skin. It is often difficult to select a product because there are so many to choose from. This product is not hype--It really does produce a visible difference. I strongly recommend this product for results that you can count on."
"I have been trying to find a product that actually keeps what it promises, and is affordable at the same time. Olay has come a long way, and this product makes my skin feel and look good. It's not greasy and the it also smells good. I was a convinced L'Oreal user, but have now switched and will take a closer look at the other Olay products!"
"I tried several products, but nothing ever worked. My checks had lost much of the elasticity, fine lines, and deeper wrinkles around the mouth. I noticed a remarkable improvement after only two days with this product. A very little goes a long way and it really works so it is well worth every cent."
I have used expensive ($200) bottles of anti wrinkle creams/lotions over the pst few years and none have been as effective as this product. I am 60 and no one believes me. They ask how I can look so young...I now have the secret but I share this secret with everyone.
I have been using this product for 6 months and noticed a visible difference in my skin texture and appearance in 2 weeks. I have no lines or wrinkles in my face at 61 years of age. I can't be without this product. I receive daily compliments from women as young as 20 who can't understand why I have no wrinkles. I recommend this product to everyone who compliment my skin.
"I have been using Olay on and offover the years. I've tried other 'expensive"" products too. I saw and ad for the Regenerist Line of Olay. I have been using it for about a week. I do like it, I am going to change my line of skin care to Olay Regenerist for sure. I only wish the Micro-Sculpting cream had SPF. I would recommend this product. My skin is softer and looks healthier."
I'm pro makeup artist I always keep a extra jar of this amazing product on hand at work my clients always ask what do you use on your skin it always looks so youthful and glowing I give them the only thing I use on my skin and they rave about it smells fantastic not heavy at all on the skin or greasy use it twice night and day thats all
"I currently purchased the Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream and compared it to my expensive exclusive facial creams and it was amazing. Not only did I see a decrease in my wrinkles, the overall texture was more supple after using the cream faithfully."
"I had been using a firming cream that was working just fine. Then I began chemotherapy last summer. My skin was like parchment paper, and it was incredibly depressing. I began using this cream and I started to get compliments on my skin. People were astonished how good I looked despite the cancer treatmet! Obviously I love this product!"
"I loved the texture of the cream, not too thin or thick, goes on very easily...my skin fellt very hydrated and smooth. I felt an instant boost in my skin. I would highly recommend this product for people with dry. combination skin and the price is great!"
"The only thing I'd change is that I don't know if its supposed to be a night cream, day cream, used with other creams or what. And if its a day cream, then they need to make it with SPF. Love the smell, great product, but Olay's lineup is nothing less than confusing. I think Olay has the best science behind all of their products."
"When I turned 40 I said I got to start looking and feeling better. So I heard about Regenerist Miro-sulpting cream from Olay and I knew it had to be good because my mom had used the regular pink olay lotion for years, since I was a kid. She look's great and she suggested this for me and I'm very happy about the results. Even though I used olay lotion's I just didn't see a difference for me until I started with Regenerist Miro-sulping cream. I'm really happy about this product."
"This became my must have cream, can't go to sleep without it! I thought I was just of an age (48), where creamy moisturizers would not absorb as well, despite the use of exfoliators and peels. However,could not beleive very next am,I was left with a supple face and could not detect any ""filmy"" feeling. Wish I could turn my non-Olay products in bathroom cabinet into Olay."
"I felt like I won the lottery when I started using Olay Regenerist sculpting creme. I have been using other products for years and when I decided to try Regenerist I instantly noticed a change in the condition of my skin. I will never buy anything else. As a matter of fact, Target had it on sale this week and I bought 2 jars so that I could have one for home and one for my travel bag. I just don't want to be caught w/o it!!!"
"I purchased Regenerist Micro= sculpting cream and used it faithfully. I noticed a definite firming of my skin and areas around my eyes and jaw. The cream is very easy to apply and has a nice, light fragrance. I will be buying this product as often as needed.Living in Florida, I need to make sure I take care with my skin and Olay is the product to use."
I use this cream every night and see a difference in my complexion. I receive soooo many complements from women as well as men. I tell evryone the same thing over and over again that i have been using Oil of Olay products since age 11. Some people ask me if I do Botox and I just laugh! NO
"I had gastric by-pass surgery in 2001 when I was 49 years old and since loosing the excess weight and going through menopause shortly thereafter, the skin on my face had taken a beating. Not wanting to do anything surgically, I tried many products. The Olay Micro-sculpting cream was the first thing that let me see a difference within 2 to 3 weeks. While I don't look 30 at all it did lessen my wrinkles and even the sag in my skin enough to where I felt comfortable again."
"Most creams of this type leave my skin feeling tight and almost crinkly. This cream stays moist without greasiness. Another good factor is that it does not have to be applied thickly. A little goes a long way. I'd love this exact formulation with a high SPF for day...Way to go, Olay!"
I really enjoy this product - my skin tends to be somewhat greasy in the summer - and while this is a thicker cream - it seems to leave almost a matte finish on my skin as opposed to a shiny look. And to top it off - it does not make my skin break out at all! I really like using it as an evening moisturizer.
"I use this cream twice a day and can tell the difference in my skin. I use in the morning after cleansing with Olay daily cleanser, apply cream and then make-up. This cream helps my make-up go on smoother and look cleaner. I also use this product at night before bed. I buy the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream at Sams so I get twice the product. I recommend Olay products to all of my ""older"" friends. With the Olay products you get all the ingredients of the pricey departmant store products, but not the price."
"I began using Olay products in 1975 and still use them today. This last year I tried the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream and have discovered it to be the best product yet. My skin looks and feels smoother, healthier and younger. I can even go without make-up now and feel comfortable. My skin seems to drink in the product. Best yet, my husband loves the way my skin looks and feels."
I have been using this product for 6 months and my skin looks and feels great. I have been using Olay products since 1990.I will be 52 in November and people are shocked when I tell them my age. They always say that I look 40. What a wonderful compliment and I know it is due to using Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. Thanks Olay!
"I've been using the Micro-sculpting cream almost since it first came out and am totally pleased with the product. I use this faithfully every night and have seen a difference . . . even my daughter has told me how smooth my skin looks since using this cream. In fact, I use the entire Regenerist line and wouldn't trade these products for anything! Thanks for this line of products!"
"This product is AMAZING! It makes such a difference in the look and feel of my skin. I had gone to the store to get more before I ran out, and someone was selling a product they claimed was just as good my Olay. I was talked into giving it a try. After 1 week of use, this ""new"" product had ruined my skin, or so I thought. I started back on my Regenerist and within days my skin started to look like, my Olay skin again. Thank GOODNESS! I love Olay!"
"I have been using this product for about a month now, and I love the way it makes my skin feel. Because I am in my early sixties, I will try just about anything that will give my skin a lift and smooth it out. I live in a very dry area, and so far I am very please with the results of your product."
"Olay's Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream is truly wonderful. I goes on really creamy and sinks into my skin immediately. It is not greasy, just thick. It makes my face feel very alive the whole day. I have no dryness even tho I live in AZ. I don't know if it makes my skin look younger or tighter and I don't care because it makes my skin feel alive and supple. I know it is expensive but it is worth every penny!"
"I never thought I'd find myself using anti aging products or even admitting to it and here I am writing about it. But this cream is wonderful and I'd rather tell the anonymous cyberspace the truth than my boyfriend. Besides what he doesn't know won't hurt him;) My skin is replenished, glowing, and healthy. Thank you Olay."
"This is the cream with the best results for sculpting your jaw line and face that I so far encounter that truly delivered the results that promise. I have tried so many firming creams from the most popular brands, including online products that promise true results but fail after use. Olay Micro-Sculpting cream is the only one that works for me. Very pleasant fragance ,best results. I will keep buying it for a long time. I get wonderful results for a youthful and firm look."
"ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTER USING REGENERIST MICRO-SCULPTING CREAM I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE ON MY NECK AND ALL OVER MY FACE. THIS MADE ME FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT MYSELF THAT I HELD MY HEAD HIGH WHEN I WENT OUT IN PUBLIC, WHAT MADE IT SUCH A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE IS FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOTICED THE REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE"
"I love massaging this product onto my face and neck after cleansing my skin. It is not at all heavy or oily. It makes my skin feel dewy, fresh, hydrated and silky smooth. I have used this cream for well over a year now and I think my skin looks firmer and feels stronger and healthier. This is the one product I could not do without."
"This is probably one of the ONLY products I've ever used the was really as good as promised in their ads.It's amazing-it never feels greasy or heavy, but yet penetrates deep enough to totally change your skin's appearance. I noticed results much faster than anticipated. I can't imagine a better product on the market (and I've tried a bunch, some ridiculously expensive) - it's my one ""can't do without"" product !"
"I love the Micro-sculpting cream. It feels good, it goes on well and it seems to have made a difference in the texture of my skin. I have not yet seen an improvement in the firmness but I'm hoping it will help that issue as well. I have recommended this product to several friends who have tried it and love it just as much as I do. I like this Olay product more than any other Olay product."
"I have always used Olay products, orignally in the pink glass bottle, and I still do, only now I have Olay with a lift. I am 44 years old, and have been using Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream on my neck and jaw-line for the past year, and see a real lift in these areas. It goes on smoothly, as do all the Regenerist products. What a lift."
"I am a die hard Lancome product user. I have spent over $100.00 for their regenerist firming cream. I decided to try Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. To my amazement, it does the same job that the expensive cream did and is one quarter the price. I am so happy that I have found Olay and will forever be an Olay user. I intend to try all the other products. Thank you, Susan"
"I have been using the micro-sculpting cream for a few months now. I have tried so many different creams but, this one is certainly different. It feels like silk when you put it on. It blends in quickly and does not feel greasy at all. My skin looks radiant and feels so soft. I was having some flaking of my skin prior to using this product, and that has now subsided. I love it!"
"I never had a lot of wrinkles, but the past couple of years I noticed my face was sagging. This product actually works better than the professional facials I've had. We just had our yearly family photo taken, and I look younger this year than last year."
"I usually don't spend this much on face cream, but watching the commercials, I bought it. Yes, it is worth every penny. It costs approximately $25 and lasts and lasts. After using it for more than a year now, I refer family and friends to join me in the tightening of the face. It REALLY works. I use it on my neck also. A little goes a long way. Don't wait, do buy this product. I am a very fussy person with regard to face products, so trust me when I say it works!"
I've been searching for hydrating lotion for years in this dry environment in LA. I have acne-prone skin and at the same time my skin is getting mature and dry with my aging. All other lotions failed in hydrating or preventing pimple outbreaks. This cream stands for all day long in hydrating with no pimple breakout.
"I really like this product. I tend to prefer ones that are lighter, but it's advantageous in this case that it is a thicker consistency - you can tell it's going to keep working after you apply it. Very pleasing scent too. Works great as an overnight cream, or under makeup and powder."
I have used Total Effects for years now and find them excellent for my needs. Now I am using some of the Regenerist products and will continue to replace some of the Total Effects with them. I have always had problems with dark circles under my eyes and these products are helping to minimize these areas.
I have tried many Olay products through the years and decided to try this one also. I had not really heard anything about it before my purchase. I used one complete jar and could see a difference before I finished it. So far it is my favorite Olay product for my age group. I definitely plan to continue using it.
"I've been an Olay products user for nearly 20 years and I love this product even better than some of the department luxury brands I also use. After using it for two weeks, my skin feels more supple and the overall complexion has become more brighter and the tiny wrinkles has minimized or disappeared. I start having my husband use the Olay products as well and he has a sensitive skin like I do and he likes how his skin feels after applying it. Keep up the great job Olay team."
I have been using Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream for over a month and my skin looks and feels spectacular. My age spots and wrinkles are diminishing. I love the feel of the cream and you only need a small amount for a complete coverage. Thanks Olay!
"regenerist is great in everything i'm in love because cleit give me the best of the for my skin and also is great because i use it all the time and my complexsion is grething beter plus my fine lines and etc is gone,and you feel clean and you gain your self essteam and tha't is Regenerist all about."
"I tried this a few months ago with my mother. We started it the same day. I am 26 and she is 46. Within two weeks of using the cream, I started receiving compliments from the guys at work asking what was different about my skin. I told my mother, and she said she was receiving the same compliments!!! I reccommend this product to anyone and everyone at any age!!! I will continue to use this cream forever!!!"
"I tried Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream expecting to feel as though I had once again contributed to the economy and my under sink supply of unused products, but not see any measurable results. After diligently using about half of the FIRST container, I purchased my second jar, knowing that this would become part of my daily regimen. I saw improved elasticity and appearance to the structure of my face. I love it!"
love ALL Olay and your prices are the best. They work and I am 62!
This cream is light and non-greasy. It goes on smoothly and my skin feels so fresh and alive.
Plumps your skin and reduces the look of wrinkles. Great product and great price.
"Great, it worked thge first time I put it on, no greasy film. Radiant and wrinkle free!!!!"
this is a very good cream to soften and elasticize facial skin.
Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is very effective on the target areas of my face. It is a very smooth cream and wonderful to apply. I love it !
This product is terrific. Best one I've used to date...and I've been using Olay for approximately 20 years. Keeps my face hydrated all day long.
"This is a miracle cream - nothing has ever worked for me before, but this one did... Simply liquid gold in jar!"
Love it. I am a senior adult and have dry skin and I can see and feel a difference in my face from using Micro-sculpting cream.
Definitely noticeable difference after using Regeneris Micro-sculpting cream. ..skin surface glowed and seemed more uniform and more youthful
This product is equal to or even better than the expensive department store brands for a fraction of the price.
This a great cream that also is very moisturizing and delivers exactly what it promises; it sculpts and lifts!
I used the entire container and saw absolutely no difference in my skin. It was a waste of money and time
This moisturizer is my holy grail!! Every time I stop using it I notice my skin doesn't look at youthful or glowy as it does when I'm regularly using this. And it keeps my skin looking tight and sculpted! #contest
"This is an amazing product!! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of crows feet, fine lines, and wrinkles. It starts to work in just a matter of days. This is perfect for all ages. It helps you look younger and more rested."
"I really like this product, but the fragrance is overpowering. Otherwise, I would give it 4 stars. It also makes my Rosacea flare occasionally, but seems to work well on lines and moisturizes well."
"Using for the first time, and after a week, I'm blown away! Can't wait to see the difference in 30 days. My skin looks healthier, brighter and glows. A bit pricy though"
It is not greasy and blends in quickly. I can't say anything about wrinkles because I've only had it for a week. So far I really like it though and plan to keep using it.
"My skin was rough n bumpy, until I started using this product. I love the smell & feel of this moisturizer. I use it twice a day, everyday. I am so happy a friend recommended this to me. I will be a life long user! Thank you Olay!"
"This creme does help fine lines and wrinkles, but it is no miracle. The key is to give it time to work. When applied to a clean face it absorbs well and the light scent is pleasant."
I surprised myself.....I don't do reviews but this Olay Regenerist is such a treat to my skin! My skin is the softest it has been in years! Thank you Olay!!

I've been using Olay for years and it has always been amazing. It has made my skin softer and smoother. My skin looks great even without make-up. Great money-saver for me.

The olay regenerist cream makes my skin feel soft without feeling greasy. This is most important to me. I can use this daily and feel like I'm doing something good for my skin.
"I really like this cream! It made my skin so smooth and it moisturizes well. I saw a noticeable difference in my skin after use, would definitely recommend! *I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program*"
I have been using this for about two weeks every night now. I feel that it has smoothed the skin on my face and brightened it so far. I am looking forward to seeing the long term results this can have.
I have sensitive skin and this did not cause any problems at all. My skin was left soft and looking the best it ever has. I noticed improvements in my skin very quickly. I highly recommend this cream.
"I was so excited to try the olay regenerist moisturizer and how well it made my skin look and feel, I saw an improvement in a matter of days my appearance of my skin look smoother ,younger and fresh"
Wow this product is amazing..It moisturized my skin leaving it smoother and clearer..It protect my skin from the sun..Feeling younger looking skin...I love it..
I like it because my skin gets very moisturized. I feel like giving a gorgeous Glow to the skin. I use it daily and I have really enjoyed it. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program
This product is a great product it is worth every penny it had made my face smooth and soft it is better than any other product I ever used before!!!! I would recommend this product to anyone!!!!
"I love, love this this product. I would recommend this to anyone. My face is so soft and my fine lines on my forehead look softer. I'm 37 and people don't believe me, thanks #olayinsider campaign"
The Micro Sculpting Cream Face Moisturizer is wonderful. It is not greasy and moisturizes even the driest skin! After using it for a few weeks I could even see some fine lines disappear. Love it!
"Im loving this Micro sculpting cream, I've used high end to regular retail store products and have to say this is my favorite!!!Have seen a huge difference in my face!!"
Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is so amazing! I just turned 30 and this cream has been a game-changer in removing the tiny wrinkles and imperfections that I had. I feel so young and beautiful from inside!
I loved the scent of the Olay Regenerist Sculpting Cream. It went on very light and made my skin look fresh. My fine lines are a little lighter. In the morning My face is a little firmer. My husband even noticed the difference.
This face cream works the same as any other face cream I've used. It feels good going in my face. It's hydrating. I haven't really noticed any anti-aging properties though. I would get this if it were on sale.
Although it sags fragrance free it definitely has a smell but it smells great! It makes me feel instantly moisturized and tightens the skin. I love it . I recieved samples of this product for testing
"I LOVED my Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I started seeing a difference within days. My skin was firmer, tighter, felt lifted and refreshed. I was able to review Olay products as a part of The Insiders program."

I Love the cream but when I take off the lid the little white protector does not want to come off. It takes me almost 6 minuets to pry it off with either a tweezer or scissors. Horrible packaging.
I have been using this cream for years. It is the best. My face looks awesome. Little wrinkles and I am going to be 40 and do not look like it. I use it at night. The price is good I recommend it to everyone
I love this product but the person who re-designed the seal of the jar should be forced to open the jar for every purchaser. Impossible and frustrating to get the jar open. At least add the instructions on how to to open the seal on the box.
"I was reccomended this product by a friend and was skeptical about it. The first time I tried it, my face felt fresh and renewed. It was not greasy feeling and dried quickly."
I have always used a high-end moisturizer but they have become so expensive and I just decided to try this. I love it and have recommended it to friends. My skin looks great.
Ouch at 76 my wrinkles started to really show - there was a sample of this cream in my In Style Magazine - so I tried it and was amazed at the results the first time I used it - what a surprise - Love it -
"I have been using this product for years. My skin feels amazing and looks great. I have strayed to other products to try, however, I always return to this product as I find it does the best for my skin. I use it both as a day and night cream."
I have used Oil of Olay products for over thirty years. My face feel so soft. I am frequently told that I do not look my age and that I don't have any wrinkles. I know this is due to using the Oil of Olzy reginetedt products.
My mom has used Olay my entire life (40yrs). She has always been told she looks younger than she is. Her answer has always been Olay. I have now been using it for the last 5 yrs. I hope to get the same response from people when I am her age.
I use Olay products since I was in my ealry 20's. I have heard about micro sculpting cream and I was excited to use it but it dose not work for me. I have been using it for past month and my wrinkles are still there.
"After a week of using this product, I noticed a tighter, more firmer facial line areas, such as under eyes, above lip area and forehead. The skin on my neck is also more firm. The best part, my skin feels good. It is no longer dry."
I've been using olay products since I was 20 years old i'm 53 and dont look my age Lesson learned from my mother who told me and my sister's to always maintain your health and beauty as you age I'm a firm believer Thank you Olay❤
Many compliments from co-workers.Good results.Younger looking skin with in 5-6days. I am able to compete with other co-workers half my age.Product is velvet to the touch and give me a velvet finish vs. a matt finish that I like better.
This product is amazing and have taken great care of my skin with a very youthful look . Just try it for yourself and watch the transformation you will be amazed. I was and have used Olay products for years

One of the best for my skin! Ran out recently! :( Have used oil of Olay for over 45 years!! I've tried other products. Always go back to Oil of Olay!!
"I'm new to the Regenerist family and absolutely love it on my mature skin !!! It's softer and smoother and just looks all around better....BUT....how about give me more product and forget the ""fancy"" jar and packaging ????????"
Buy this cream for my daughter regularly. Used one time for myself and it was too heavy especially in the Texas humidity. Although my daughter loves it as her skin is sensitive and dry.
Nice product that does the trick Especially by the eye area the crow feet wrinkles have plumbed up and my lines have minimize. I am picky about scents and although there is some fragences it is a clean and soft scent
I have used this for so long that I don't even know how long! I love it. It always makes my face feel very smooth and soft. It is not super heavy or greasy at all. I consider it one of the best night crèmes on the market.
"I love this product and so glad that my daughter gave it to me. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and it smells really good too, a light and airy kind of scent.I do think the price is really too high though."

I have tried many different skin care products over the past 35 years or so and this one is the absolute best thing I've ever put on my face. I will never buy or even bother trying another facial moisturizer again (unless they stop making this one).
This was the first product of this line that I purchased. I have been a Cliniqe user since I was 16. I have to say that this is the most fabulous cream that I have ever put on my face!!
"many people spend a lot of money in night cream,I do not need to do that,I got OLAY,the best of the best,my miracle in a bottle,and I will always trust in the results..because people make comments abaout my skin,what am doing? simple..OLAY."

This product does what it claims. Ihave gone thru many brands and many types from your same company line and from other companies. This is amazing stuff
I use this lotion everyday and the improvement in my skin is amazing. It feels so good going on--my skin feels like its getting a drink of water and the smell is so nice. I love this product and recommend it to everyone.
"I don't know if it actually does what it claims to do-micro-sculpts and lifts but does moisurize, smells great, and goes on smoothly(not greasy or heavy)."
"Upon application of this marvelous cream, your face instantly becomes hydrated and smooth. You can actually feel it soaking into your skin. A great product, especially if you live in a dry climate!"
"I decided to give the Regenerist a try. After about a week, I noticed that my skin not only looked better, it stayed hydrated all day. It is the perfect consistency for me. I love Olay products and plan to try the ProX next."
"Ever since I started using this product, people notice a youthful glow on my face. I get a lot of comments that say I keep getting younger and younger. Although I'm in my early 50's, I have been mistaken for mid 20's-30s"
"This is rich cream leaves your face really nice and smooth! It really gets down into your skin, feels so firm but soft. I have used Regenerist products since they first came out, love them."
I love the way my skin feels after I put this cream on . IT FEELS SOFT AND SMOOTH ! Every one compliments me on my skin they say it looks like baby skin. I will definitly be continue to use this cream .
I have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream since it came out and I love it. It makes my skin look and feel so nice. I actually feel young again.
"This is the best Olay product yet. I love how it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. When I tell people that I am 57 they don't believe it, which I appreciate. I will keep on using it, it is a great product."
I started using this product about 2 months ago. Results are excellent. It is the best and I will recommend this product to everyone. I have no regrets. It is expensive but effective. No more sagging.
"I have been using the Micro-sculpting cream for about six months, and I absolutely love it. I use it morning and night, and my skin always looks and feels moisturized and hydrated."
I LOVE my Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream!! It is so affordable and WORKS just as well as a $150 cream I have used in the past. I highly recommend it!
"I exchanged White Diamonds perfume for the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream about six months ago. I was influenced by Consumer Reports. I am glad I did. I love it. No one guesses my age, plus my skin feels so smooth, even my ears."
"I am 60 and have tried many products in my lifetime. I would highly recommend this product to do the right amount of moisturizing while giving your skin a needed lift. I also have my 35 year old daughter using it. Try it, you'll like it!"
"This cream is wonderful, rich & thick but not greasy.. leaves my skin feeling dewey & plump. loved the feel. as good as La Mer or better. Saw changes in my skin within days. love it!"
I faithfully use the sculpting cream product daily. I love the results and the softeness of my skin. I have tried many different products and this one really works. I wouldn't be without it.
This is an excellent cream for every night . You will wake up with a more beautiful and soft skin . My makeup fiil and look more natural and my skin fill wonderful.
"Since i have been using this my skin feels sooo smoothe, and soft, I think i see an improvment in my skin, although i have not finished my first jar yet, but I feel like its an improvement. i would highly recommend it."
PRO: I LOVED it! It is a cream but it did not make my combination skin break out. It made my face feel softer and diminished tiny lines. CON: The price makes it hard to keep buying.
I have been using Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream for three months now and I love it. Olay is the only product line I use on my face and I have never been disappointed!
"After just 14 days of use, my skin reflects an amazing firmness and glow. Something I haven't seen in 15 years. I work with the public and even my customers have noticed something different. Thank you so much for such fabulous products."
I had been using a high cost name brand for twenty years and decided to try Regenerist Micro-sculpting. I love the way it feels on my skin and that it has a clean smell. I would love to be able to try samples for the rest of this line.
"I love the way it feels! This is the first moisturizer I have been able to use and my skin doesn't feel oily! It absorbs completely, not heavy. I have combination skin and this seems to be the perfect fit! Thanks Olay"
"not sure about the wrinkle reducing factor, but i use it just in case, in the day, in addition to nightly retin a. it definitely is too heavy for my aging but still greasy skin - i get more pimples when i use it."
I am a little over a week into my jar and so far I have not seen one improvement. I have fine lines around my eyes and and wrinkles around my mouth. I use the daily thermal face wash and the micro sculpting cream and I have not seen any difference at all.
I thought that this would have lived up to it's name but it didn't I've been using this for two weeks now and I see no difference on my face those ugly fine lines around my mouth are still present! Don't get me wrong this is just good for moisturizing you're skin it goes on nice smooth barely feels like you're applying anything onto the skin but that's as far as it goes!
"I have loved this product for years. But you recently reduced the thickness of the plastic piece below the cap and now I cannot get the product open. It is to thin to easily remove it. I spend at least 15mins a day trying to remove this piece. Yes, I know you are supposed to throughout this piece after 1st opening it. However, I travel a ton and without this piece, it explodes all over my luggage. Please go back to the old packaging!"
"I tried this product and was terribly disappointed. You can not apply it if you plan to apply foundation/bb cream, etc. It instantly dries the foundation/bb cream seconds after applying making it impossible to blend your makeup. I've never experienced anything like it. I even tried it with a different brand of foundation to see if it would react the same as it was with my Clinique foundation and it did exactly the same. Also, my fine lines seem worse. It's like a reverse effect. Truly odd."
"I can't make this up. After I apply this (and I LOVE how soft my skin feels and I do see a big wrinkle and line difference after a mere 6 days of using this - and the scent is divine), there's areas that get a blueish grey ""crust"" on it. Pretty unnerving. It's also very very greasy under my eyes, but not a deal breaker. I still love it and use it. I just wipe the offending bluegrey crust off and apply more. It's just so strange though. Any ideas, Olay workers?!"
moisturizes and creamy leaves no fat on the face but leaves the face very smooth
I feel fresh and nice everytime I use the cream. A good product to have.
"Love this product and got the best price, too."
