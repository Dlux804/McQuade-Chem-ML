"I've always had extremely sensitive skin, therefore finding a lotion that doesn't cause an allergic reaction after a few days to a week has been very hard for me, until now that is! This product has no harsh chemicals or anything that will cause issues, in fact it is full of good vitamins, plus it made my skin very soft & smooth with just one use. I'm very happy that I purchased this, it's great! Hope this helps. :)"
Need it
Love it but
Only drawback is this packaging
"I've used a ton of things over the years. This is the best moisturizer I've used. Its light, not greasy and works well with my combination break out prone skin. My 18 year old daugter also uses this product and loves it!!"
This is my first time trying Simple Replenishing Moisturizer . I like the smooth feel when applying to my face. It doesn't leave my face feeling greasy or oily . Great first time trying & was priced good for me.
"I have a very sensitive skin and this is one of the few that has no bad effect on my face . no greasy,Do not clog pores, moisturizing day cream and night..."
I had this it's good good for your skin takes away dry skin great.
This is the best moisturizer I've found. Unfortunately I can't get it out of the bottle easily so I can't use it. If you change it to a pump I would try again. I tried transferring to another bottle bit I can't get the top off and can't easily squeeze it all out. I had to throw it out half used.
Great product works well and keeps u moist. Apples smoothly
"I have normal skin, slightly dehydrated but not dry, and early lines forming, over 35. It is a light moisturizer, so didn't do much for me. But I think it would be good for younger people with normal skin, who don't like to wear a heavy moisturizer or who don't need much hydration. This is the product I should have used when I was younger instead of nothing. Btw absolutely love the toner in this line which is why I tried the moisturizer."
It maked my life easier it has changed my life for good
I have extremely sensitive dry skin and this is the only moisturizer I have used that does not leave my face red with clogged pores. It is very light and absorbs into my skin quickly.
"I have acne prone skin, sensitive skin, and i am worried about aging. This takes care of all three! My skin feels so soft without alot of heavy greasy cream. It doesn't make me break out at all which some of the most well known and popular over the counter/drug store brands do. GREAT PRODUCT! My face hasn't looked this good in a very long time!"
"This stuff goes on nice and smooth with great coverage, however it burns. It is quite uncomfortable and I had to wash it off. I have extremely sensitive skin and have spent oodles of money on tons of products without success. I know it's not good but I normally don't use any moisturizer at all because of my sensitivity. This is yet another wasted product. I'm still recommending it because it clearly works for others just not me."
"This lotion is very nice. Moisturizes well. Not greasy, though a bit thick. No (or light?) scent. I received this as a sample and was very pleasantly surprised with the ""Simple"" products. I'm a new fan. Never heard of the brand before, but so far, all of the Simple products I have since tried have worked well for my skin. I'm curious about the price ($9+ for lotion?), but it is a nice lotion... not heavy, but not water-y. It leaves my skin feeling nice, so I'm very impressed (and that's saying a lot...)."
My mother in law gave this product to me a few days ago and its what I have been looking for. I have struggled with my skin since my early terns and I cannot believe I am just now finding a product that works. My face is clear in the morning and is not oily during the day even in a humid environment. My skin tone is more even. My pores are smaller and the redness is gone. I'm almost in tears writing this. I cannot wait to try everything and am looking forward to a body cleanser line!
and have done for about a year now. I've always suffered with eczema and have found it really hard to find a moisturiser rich enough to get rid of dryness but gentle enough not to irritate my sensitive skin ... This is a review from a UK consumer about the UK Replenishing Rich Moisturiser
"bought this moisturizer 2 days ago and so far Im pleased with it,its not greasy or sticky and even though its a 'rich moisturizer' its light and goes on easy.I have dry and sensitive skin and Ive had no problems with it so far,Im going to try out all the other products,hoping this skin care line will be THE ONE for me."
"I am from England, and my sister has been shipping this over to me for years - imagine my delight when i saw it was to be sold in the US. It is the ONLY moisturizer that does not make my eyes stream. All the sensitive creams here do that to me. I love it, and would recommend it to anybody. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combination skin which has always given me a lot of trouble when searching for moisturizers. They are either too light and leave my skin dry with fine lines and flakiness or too rich leaving my skin oily and giving me breakouts. I have been using the light moisturizer during the day under my makeup and the replenishing moisturizer at night. I love waking up to soft, calm skin in the morning!"
The first time i tried the moisturizer was when I was studying abroad in London. My skin was the best it ever was and when i returned to the States I was so disappointed when i realized that repurchasing it would be almost impossible! I am so excited that Simple is now available in the U.S. This moisturizer is oil-free which is exactly what i need. It is lightweight but moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have had such sensitive skin my whole life, Im 31 now and have been using the same mosturizer forever, it was oily, broke me out and my skin was still dry ALL the time. No matter how much I put on it didnt make my skin soft...Until now! I tried Simple and this ACTUALLY does what it says...my skin hasnt ever felt this soft and smooth, no breakouts from this and there is no dryness all day...soooo suprisingly great! Thank you SImple for finally making a product that really works! ♥"
"I am from England, now living in Chicago. I have used this lotion for around 28 years, it is Fantastic. I use it as an aftershave as well as a moisturizer. Using it after you shave and after swimming is great there is NO foul smell and it keeps your skin smooth all day. I am thankful I can now buy it in the USA."
"I have pretty dry skin. I break out from it and I flake on my nose. I also have really sensitive skin. I went to the drugstore to get a moisturizer, and I decided to get it. I've noticed notice my breakouts have been clearing up and I when I use it it gets rid of my flakes completely. I really like this moisturizer."
"I've used this lotion off and on again for a few years. It dries quick and lacks silicones found in Neutrogena and Olay lotions for sensitive skin. Another plus is that I prefer SPF free, and it's hard to find that these days. This lotion also has a pleasant ""natural"" scent."
"I have really dry skin all year round, especially in the winter. I've tried every lotion on the market and I've never found one that works better. Goes on light and doesn't make my T zone oily at all. Also has evened out my skin tone. My skin has never looked so good, I will never buy another brand again!"
"I have combo skin but this product is not moisturising enough for me. The only reason it's getting 3 stars is because the ingredients are gentle enough for this moisturiser to mix with any oil. That is the only reason I've repurchased it. Simple need to make an ""Intense moisture"" version of this for everyone who has dry skin."
"I've had dry skin for who knows how long & then I started getting the wrinkles ugh! & I am way too young to be having those. This product worked overnight like oh my gosh! Love love love this! Secret to clear skin is taking care of it. Face wash, Exfoliator, sea breeze, toner, and moisturizer! & you will be satisfied! won't hurt to try Thank you Simple your products are amazing!"
"I love the product 100%, the formula is not greasy, and very hydrating and it is easily absorbed into the skin. Making your skin feel silky smooth however, the only down fall to these product is the packaging. What I mean by that is, when I have used enough of the product to the point where I have to give the bottle a little shake or two, I seem to experience the product is flooding out of the container and it won't stop. Then for the next 30 minutes, I spend trying to some how get all that lost product back into the container."
"I originally received a sample through another website, and was more than pleased with it. When I ran out, I learned Walmart carried it and bought it. I LOVE this. The cream is really rich ( a little goes a long way); it penetrates my skin, doesn't dry out like other alcohol bases cremes, has no smell, doesn't stain clothes. My skin used to be dry as sand paper, but now soft and smooth again. BUY THIS =you won't regret it."
I've had issues with moisturizers from other brands that left my face cracked. I've only tried two moisturizers before and this is definitely my favorite. Doesn't leave my skin oily and doesn't irritate. Gets the job done and does it well. Would be a 5 star for sure if I've tried more moisturizers on the market
This is a great moisturiser it works amazingly especially on dry skin. You won't be disappointed. However although it is very effective and has very limited contents On the skin it is gentle and I would definitely buy it again. It is good value for the money. I would reccomend it
"The moisturizer is as advertised: rich. Its good for the winter months where dry skin is a common occurrence, but otherwise it can be a little too thick and sticky in my opinion. However, I mix some aloe vera gel with it and the combination does wonders."
"This used to be the only moisturizer I could use, but last winter, it suddenly stopped working. My nose and forehead would get so dry they'd be flaky, but also oily at the same time. It was a nightmare to try to figure out. It only got better when I started using a different moisturizer. I think this one is just TOO gentle for me."
This is the best product I've found for sensitive skin! Love it!
soft and easy to apply. no skin irritation
i love this moisturizer. i have dry to combo skin with little to no acne. i used to use this all the time but then i switched to another one
I use to buy this over the counter Can't find anymore. I was so happy when I could order this product-sent right to my home & with free shipping.
"I have sensitive skin, and this doesn't irritate at all. Doesn't leave me ""sticky"" and has spf for sun protection."
I was given this product as a gift 4 months or so ago and honestly I am so happy with it. My skin is never dry or greasy or oily. My skin has also been 100% clearer since using this product. It is fantastic!
I used this product for both morning and evening. My skin felt rich and moist after only a few uses. The product was gentle on my skin and made it feel silky after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have dry skin that gets even drier in the winter. For my face, I have to use a bit more product than I have to with other products, but I don't mind because it actually makes my face feel hydrated and not just greasy."
This moisturizer is the first one i have used that lasts all day makes my skin so soft.My skin has never looked or felt this good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very sensitive skin and love the way the lotion goes on and makes my skin feel. One of the best products I have tried and will continue to use it.
"I was highly satisfied with this moisturizer. After just one use it left my skin touchably soft and smooth for a whole day without reapplying or using another product. It's not greasy, oily, or strongly scented which is nice. It really is simple"
"Love this product! You have winner here. Stop buying the high priced Oil of Olay@ and others. This is it. Very light up make up, and without. Thank you. I will buy more."
Just started using this moisturizer and it's great! I use it after washing my face in the morning and before bed. It's just what I was looking for; a truly simple and effective moisturizer!
"I have use this a week and you can see changes on your skin the fist day, I used before Olay, but now, this is amazing, my skin looks healthy, is not greasy, my skin is hydrated and feels great on my skin"
"Previously I have bought the light moisturizer and sometimes have to reapply it because I have dry skin. Not with this one, it works great without being greasy. I LOVE it."
I use the Simple moisturizer with spf when I know that I will be outside. It goes on so smooth and never feels like its clogging my pores. I love that its oil-free as my skin is typically so oily naturally.
I've been using this product for well over a year now and it is the only moisturizer that is kind to my skin and doesn't make me breakout. It's very light and doesn't leave an oily residue after application. MY GO TO PRODUCT!
"This moisturizer is like an on-off bad boy that you should have stayed with from the beginning. I've bounced between natural moisturizers for years but always come back to this, less than clean, one. My porcelain, sensitive skin loves this in humid, hot summers and dry, brutal winter. I'm prone to flakes and redness- but as I'm 26, also break out easily. I try to stick to cleaner products. This is one of those times it's been worth it to stray. Staying with this bad boy, and no shame."
"I've tried numerous moisturizing products and none have worked as well as this! My forehead, chin, and nose bridge are horribly oily almost all the time. With other products I'd have to apply a only once a day and use just a bit each time too, but I have to use this more than twice a day, and this stuff doesn't feel heavy or leave a filmy feeling like a lot of others did either."
loved this moisturizer when i had combo to oily skin!! this moisturizer is light and fragrance free which is great for sensitive skin! it drys fast on your skin but leaves your skin highly moisturized! this is my go to moisturizer in the spring summer and early fall!
"This is incredibly good thing. İ always had problems with my skin, it looked dirty and had some pimples. Few weeks ago İ bought this cream and İ cant believe my face, it is that much of a difference. Trust me, İ tried everything, lots ıf different creams, even medicines, no thing helped me until this cream. İt made my skin look straight, it is incredibly soft."
"Just like the hydrating moisturiser in the same range this stings, in the new improved version. I was categorically told only the hydrating one had changed, however I found old products in a local chemist, which I can use fine. How can an improved product be so bad to your skin. Simple really don't care about your skin, just their profits. Do not use if you have even slight sensitive skin."
"I keep this moisturizer on hand for emergencies in the winter when my forehead has dried out. It does an excellent job of earl ring moisture to damaged skin. However, it does leave the skin looking a little shiny or oily. If I use this, it's to save my winter skin applied just before bedtime. Then I use a less oily moisturizer in the morning."
Leaves your skin feeling lovely and hydrated. It lasts all day and is very affordable. I thought that the packaging was really nice and is perfect for sensitive skin. The only thing I didn't like was how heavy it was on year skin because I prefer light moisturiser
"Love how moisturizing this is. Its not heavy nor greasy. It goes on like a gel because of how light it is. I use it under my make up everyday. No particular smell, i sometime enjoy this when i do my routines... but it does not bother me that is fragrance free."
"Smooths on well within seconds, lightweight, immediately moisturizes, and great for Winter months because it blends in well and will balance your skin. The rich moisturizer is easily available at drugstores at a great price. I do plan on repurchasing this. This product really helps keep my oily skin soft and in control. I also have mild acne and this does not inpact that. Very happy first time user!"
"A really great everyday moisturiser. I use it everyday as a base for my make up. Better for all year around use, may want to invest in a thicker cream for winter time, when the cold draws out all dry skin! I find this is almost all supermarkets and local drugstores, so is a really reliable brand to locate. Will continue to buy for reasonable price"
I use this as a final cleanse after washing my face with cleansing oil and foam. This picks up the last bits of my makeup that the oil and foam didnt get. I notice a big difference with my skin from when I use this versus when I don't use it. I break out more/have little whiteheads when I don't take this final step. This is gentle and refreshing. I never feel like it is stripping my face of anything. I honestly don't know why I people would by the expensive micellar waters because this performs so beautifully at such a great price.
"I think this is one of the best drugstore moisturizers you could get. It's very inexpensive yet hydrates your skin without leaving it greasy. I feels light and if you're looking for a nice moisturizer that won't break the bank, this one is your ideal one. It feels like it would work well with most skin types."
I love this moisturizer! It hydrates my skin perfectly and it does not feel greasy or heavy at all. It is almost a gel-like consistency and it is thin but rich. I have dry skin and this moisturizer is a great affordable alternative to some of the more expensive ones I've tried.
It is very good at keeping my face moisturised. When I have tried other moisturisers they keep it moisturised for a few hours then it stops however this one last for 24 hours. I have found this product very effective and long lasting. They have a great formula for the product and it has helped my skin from breaking out alot
"This is a great moisturizer for dry, sensitive winter skin. I was worried at first about the thickness of this product in terms of potentially causing breakouts, but I have been pleasantly surprised. My blemishes actually heal much faster because this moisturizes and keeps my skin healthy without clogging my pores."
"I accidentally bought this instead of the other version for oilier skin type. It has a very weird smell that lingers, but otherwise, I think it provides enough moisture for the winter dry skin, is affordable, has great ingredients, and is convenient to bring around. Nothing special though and I prefer gel moisturizers."
"This product is brilliant for me skin , perfect for sometimes oily skin with some dry patches , I am an on going user of this product , it is very gentle on the skin which leaves a smooth finish perfect for before make up as a base before primer as it isnt sticky or perfect for after cleaning at night defiantly recommend"
"this is extremely hydrating. a lot of other facial lotions don't leave my face moisturized enough but with this product, a little goes a long way. I use almost daily and it lasts for months. recommended for daily use, this doesn't make me break out either."
"kind to your skin, thick but not heavy, and inexpensive, This moisterizer has been my go to for about 2 years now, with not shockingly noticeable results, but my skin is never dry after using this!! this moisterizer is perfect to put on before wearing makeup to help make it last"
Makes face feel real good. I have had no problems with it.
Works well as a moisturizer. No scent
I have spent a lot of money trying products for my sensitive rosacea skin which have only irritated my skin. When I was in England my sister in law used the Simple products and I gave the moisturizer a try. Using it for 2 weeks I could not believe how my skin has calmed down. It is a wonderful product and I am very thankful that I tried it.
"I received a travel sized sample of this Lotion in the mail. I LOVE IT! I have used tons of other face lotions that claim to be non-greasy and non-fragrant, but this one really holds its word! It made my face feel smooth as a babies bottom with my first use. I have been using it about a week now and I already see my complexion improving. It feels so light and fresh on my skin, I love it! I can't wait to purchase the full sized bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Hello this product is one of the best products I have used before and it really makes my skin tone look way better than before I started using this.
Works great! Highly recommended for anyone with sensitive or dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin, but I tried this product and I love it.I have the whole line of Simple.No problems with my skin."
"I love this moisturizer! It keeps my skin hydrated all day and doesn't break out my sensitive, acne prone skin."
"I've only been using it for a month, and it seems to be working. Doesn't clog pores, and gives your skin a natural glow."
I have spent lots of money trying to find the right moisturizer for me. Finally something that actually works!! I'm so glad this line came to the US!
Got got it for my self took a shower got out. Dryer my skin and got really bad dry skin then I put some of the cream on and it worked!
I'm so happy I ordered this product I would tell a friend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
not oily no strong smell fresh scent light can use it every day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've had this for ahwile. It helped when I had acne. Now that it's colder outside the moustrizer doesn't last very long and my skin feels dry again.
Great daily moisturizer. Light on the skin and can wear under makeup or alone. Works well with oily skin.
Excellent night cream. Very moisturizing without clogging pores. Works great in the winter for mature combo to dry skin.
"Good thin moisturizer, I use every morning, doesnt leave greasy look on skin. Doesnt cause breakouts. Good for sensitive skin. No scent."
"I use this moisturiser every day, I use this to prep my face before make up and it works amazingly! My favourite product to use as per my skin care routine"
This is a good moisturizer for someone who doesnt struggle with any skin issues but still wants to keep a moisturizer in their routine. Its gentil and not to thick which is a plus.
"After the first day of using this product, my daughter and I both have broken out with little red bumps on our face. So disappointed since this states it is for sensitive skin."
"This is by far the best face cream ever!! I have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts, ever since I started using this line of product I'm breakout free and my skin feel and looks amazing!"
"I have oily, sensitive and acne prone skin and I just feel this moisturiser is so gently on the skin, and has really worked. It is super affordable, and I would recommend to any skin types."
"I always use this moisturiser! It's just been a product I've stuck to using over the years. It's brilliant for my sensitive skin, affordable and over all a great product."
this is so thin so it doesn't feel like a barrier or an extra layer on the skin. it's great for my sensitive skin and keeps me moisturized even in the winter when nothing else works
This is one of my favorite thing to use after I use a makeup wipe. It really removes the excess dirt and make up that you didn't know was there. It is also very gentle on the skin.
Loved this moisturizer worked really well for me !! It's really cheap also !! It gave my skin a dashing glow and helped my dry parts !! It was very gentle on the skin !! It's not as good as other brand but still works very well !
This moisturizer is amazing. It is gentle and it is great for sensitive skin. It was not too oily. I did t even feel it on my skin. I would recommend trying this product if you can get your hands on it.
"I use simple all the time as i have sensitive skin. this is my go to moisturizer, it leaves my skin soft and smooth without being greasy, it never causes any breakouts either"
Perfect day time moisturizer! Lightweight and great for combination skin. It's a clean product and extremely affordable. It works so well and one of my favorite moisturizers. You definitely have to try it at least once!
"I really didn't care for this. It was extremely watery, had an odd scent, and left my skin oddly greasy but still felt dry. I wouldn't waste the money since there are better options at this price point."
"Very gentle product and didn't do too bad on my sensitive oily skin. Not oily so it shouldn't cause excess breakouts, good for daily use and affordable."
I love this stuff. Very basic but gets the job done. It has no perfume in it and never seems to irritate my skin. My boyfriend even borrows it sometimes!
I like the simple brand line ! These are gentle and very inexpensive . I don't currently have them in my home but it's a brand I would pick if I needed to replenish my cleanser or moisturizer while traveling .
"I've been using this brand off and on for about 3 months now. It's pretty affordable and gets the job done for my dry, sensitive skin. The only thing that I do not like about the product is the smell."
Super good moisturizer especially for dry and sensitive skin. Better than most at the drug store and a lot cheaper than high end. Would buy again and recommend to friends.
This product is good for sensitive skin as the ingredients aren't harmful compared to other moisturisers. It doesn't sting to put on and is reasonably priced. The bottle is a little hard to get product out of when nearing the end though.
This moisturizer is pretty thick/rich so I like to use it at night. It comes in an easy to use bottle and is pretty general on skin. It's a good product for the price and I would use it again for evening time.
"Straight after you've used it, it helps to create soft skin on your face and is not hard on skin. Perfect for sensitive skin! I love this product, I use it everyday and I no longer have dry skin!"
"This is a great product for this that suffer from any skin problem, it's gentle and smells good. I am a first time user but will absolutely be a repeat buyer. The price is great for the quality and the size is great, I would definitely recommend."
"This is an excellent, gentle moisturiser which is great if you're on a budget as it's extremely good value for money. I use it as an every day light moisturiser and have for years now- would definitely recommend!"
I enjoy this moisturizer. With it saying this is rich I thought it was going to be too much for my face but once I started using it every day my skin took a liking to it and now I can't not put it on otherwise my makeup doesn't look right.
So I usually use Cetaphil but I like to change up my skin routine sometimes. I always go to Simple products because I have really sensitive skin and in the winter time it's especially drier than normal. This Simple moisturizer works awesome!
This simple moisturiser is really amazing! It's smells so good and it's super hydrating on the skin and has a super soft and creamy texture! It lived up to expectations and was really effective! I am always recommending this one to others
This moisturizer was more oily than moisturizing. I felt it sat on top of the skin and didn't really sink it. My face is usually dry but I felt after trying this a couple times my face got more oily throughout the day.
"This moisturizer gets the job done! I use it mostly as a day moisturizer before my makeup! Its very gentle and has no smell! Its okay in price and value! I enjoy it a lot, I would repurchase it again!"
"Nice moisturiser, does the job, it's very gentle, doesn't really have any scent. It's very light, not thick at all and soaks in quickly. It's not the most moisturising but it's still good."
"Got this bottle as a free sample. I use all over my legs which are incredibly sensitive after shaving--no more itchiness & flared-up skin. It doesn't leave a greasy feeling at all which I like. However, the price for the amount of product is surprising. I'd recommend this only if you absolutely need a product to handle sensitive skin."
"I've struggle between having combination/sensitive skin and around the fall my skin broke out badly and dried up. My skin tone became uneven and dark around the chin from lack of hydration. I tried other lotions and creams but they were too heavy and made my face oily. But this moisturizer helped bring back moisture in my dry thirsty skin within a day! I couldn't believe how soft it felt! However, my skin tends to get oily too so I don't want my skin to be over-hydrated. Love this moisturizer so much now!"
I bought the entire line based of price and reviews I ended up with my skin even more dried out then when I started this product smells bad and did not moisturize my skin at all the cleaners also smell bad and dried out my skin do not buy this product
"Today I bought this for the first time. I already trust this brand and love the products. My face was desperately needing a moisturizer! My soap was drying me out badly, my face felt so tight! Ugh lol. After one use my face feels great and not dry at all. So far I've had on for three hours and still feeling good:) you only need a small amount. I also have blemish prone skin and this is so gentle and calming for that skin type.a must buy. Probably the best one up at Walmart. I love natural products:)"
Smooth and clean when applying after washing. My girlfriend said I was very smooth and clean.
I bought this last week and I am happy I did it help my skin alot
It really works my skin feels bad a baby and I love it I will always use it
Sounds great. Can't wait to try it. My skin is dry and sensitive
I bought this and I was very pleased with the results
I like that its fragrance free and gentle on my sensitive skin. Does the job and doesnt break me out. I like the packaging and will use again.
Helps a lot with my dry skin! I use a drop around my dry spots in the morning and night after I wash my face.
Amazing I use this for my legs as they get really dry after swimming so I use this and it stops them from going all dry and sore.
"Very nice formula applies easily , no oily residue or feeling greasy , lightweight and feels so soft , moisturizes heavenly !"
I really enjoy this product. It is also a very fair price. I have sensitive and dry skin and did not have any issues.
"This is a great moisturizer. Personally, I use a lot of this in the winter when my skin dries more easily."
"Its so nice and soo goood , because the color is great, and the price is suitable. In terms of size it fits ."
"This a really good, cost effective facial moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves your face feeling smooth and soft."
I love this. Especially in the winter time. I had a weird outbreak in the winter something like eczema near my chin and this helped it so much
I really do love this product to help take off my makeup it doesn't irritate my skin I would definitely recommend this to everybody
I use this everyday it leave my skin feeling amazing and stop the blemishes also leaves a lovley natural no makeup glowy look
Absolutely love this brand! I have extremely sensitive skin and they are the only products to never burn or irritate my skin in any way!
"my everyday time anytime goto, hands down....too good for sensitive skin, it's really kind to skin...pricing is so reasonable...I always use it."
This is lovely and creamy moisturiser makes my skin really soft without leaving it to oily. I love the simple range
This moisturizes is ideal for sensitive skins. Their ingredients are pretty clean and its fragrance free
One of the best brands I've ever used! I love how my skin really gets hydrated! I approve and recommend!
"I have been using this for the past month and i have dry to normal skin, VERY sensitive and it works GREAT! FOR ME"
Did what I need and was simply a nice feeling the smell was very clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this for the first time based on its claim to be for sensitive skin in the commercials however it burns around my nose.
This product gave me cystic acne like I haven't had since middle school. Plus it made my skin very greasy without moisturizing it at all. Avoid this product. Simple has many other more impressive products.
I've used this night cream when getting into skincare and I really enjoyed it! It hydrates my skin and gives enough moisture! I would repurchase again soon!
"This is my GO TO moisturizer! They stopped selling it near the stores where I live so I order it! It's perfect for my skin. When I wash my face it's really dry, this gets my skin back to normal and I don't have an oily face after!"
"It works really good and I love it. My friend she has it and it works really good. So I wreckamed this for people how have dry skin, acne and many more."
At 62 I have damaged skin due to sun exposure for so many years. I was informed about this moisturizer by my daughter that it was a great product. Now I use it all the time with good results.
I absolutely love this product! It's the best moisturizer I've ever used. Leaves my skin hydrated all day long. It doesn't really have a smell. Love this!
"I got this as a sample from walmart with my order,I have asthma and have trouble with perfumes in products,I tried this product and did not have a problem with my asthma and helps smooth screen I would recommend this product to my friends"
"I use Simple's night cream, moisturizing face wash and eye cream on a daily basis and LOVE them. I needed a daytime moisturizer and chose this one since I have not had one problem with other products in the line. This moisturizer had a strong, odd smell. It smelled old but I could not find an expiration date. Products for sensitive skin should have no fragrance. I will be returning the bottle."
"I was excited to try this product after reading all the wonderful reviews. I have very sensitive skin but it's not prone to breaking out. After 3 days of using this product my face was so broke out, including cystic acne all over my chin. It was so painful and looked awful. I discontinued the product and my face cleared up. I was bummed because this is much more affordable than my current moisturizer. Just didn't work out for me."
This moisturizer is the best I have tried in a while. This affordable moisturizer quickly replaced my expensive Clinique face moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this! It leaves your face feeling hydrated for hours and does not give your face an oily feeling like some moisturizers do.
I just recently got this to try out and I really like it! My friend recommended this and Im so happy I have tried it Ive noticed just after the first few times how my skin is so much softer and is already becoming less dry it also does not have a very strong smell
Very good for dry skin and adorable! I used it for quite a few months but I tend to have to change up my skincare every few months to keep my skin clear. I also like the packaging. I've used their toner and cleanser which were fantastic for removing leftover bits of makeup
"I've been consistently using this moisturizer for quite a while. I love it. It's great for my sensitive/acne-prone skin. I usually use in the nighttime, and it keeps my skin soft throughout the next day."
"Lately, I've been having trouble finding it in the stores I usually shop at (Target, CVS). I'm concerned... why don't these stores carry it anymore?"
"I use this every day morning and night and it really hydrates my skin , I love simple products as there natural and kind to the skin. I got mine in a drugstore and I would recommend I've brought products from simple for a couple of years now and I'm going to buy more !"
"I'm a huge fan of Simple products, I use them daily for my sensitive skin."
"I guess I got a bad batch or something because this moisturizer smells terrible. It has a very strong 'old' smell, it's so strong my husband called me out on it ""your face smells weird"" lol."
"It worked great for about three days, before my skin had a bad reaction to it. I had tiny bumps all over my face, also very itchy and sore. Promptly returned the product when I figured out it was the cause. I even checked the ingredients for sodium laureth sulfate, which my skin has reacted to before. It was not listed, unless under some other name? Laureth-7 perhaps."
This is the only moisturizer I will ever buy from now on! That's how awesome this moisturizer is. I prefer to only use natural based products for my personal hygiene and care. The moisturizer has a light feel and makes my skin feel moisturized without feeling greasy. I highly recommend!
I bought this a little while ago and I love it! It keeps my skin very moisturized and it feels very smooth. The only negative thing about it is that it feels slightly sticky right when you put it on but that wears off quickly and it doesn't bother me.
"I have dreadfully sensitive skin and when go-to moisturizer was discontinued, I was beside myself (I've used it for 17 years). After several failures with other products, I found Simple Replenishing! This lotion is wonderful wonderful wonderful. It is rich without being oily, no fragrance, no sunscreen, no extras that just cause me problems. You got it right and thank you for making this product. I'm now kind of glad my other one was discontinued because my skin feels even better with this product. Bravo!"
This is one of the most far out best skin products on the market. I refuse too use anything but this. If your your tired of itchy elbows or flaky skin this is definitely for you. This also make a great gift for birthdays and holidays. Remember you have too treat yourself every now and then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So, I'm giving this product 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it will do, it gives you tons of moisture to replenish your skin. My only complaint is that if I use this on a daily basis, my skin becomes greasy. But I think thats because I dont need quite that much moisture, every single day."
I've used mine for about 3 months now because you literally don't need too much product to moisturizer your whole face. I used to have dry patchy skin and ever since I switched to this my skin have be incredibly soft and moisturized. I highly recommend using it.
"I use the Simple makeup remover cloths. So Simple, Gentle and works Great. Then I use the Simple Replenish Rich Moisturizer. It's light, moisturizes my skin and causes no acne or trouble on my face. I really like the ""Simple"" Ingredients. My only wish is that it could be at least SPF 30. I Will use this for the rest of my life :)"
"I was sent this product to test, I had tried it a long time ago but as my skin ages I find myself thinking I have to use more expensive products that are aimed at wrinkles etc. However I like to return to simple products like this that are kind to my skin when the heavier anti-aging products irritate my sensitive skin. Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is a keeper I will return to again and again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"If you are looking for an everyday moisturizer for sensitive skin then you should give it a try. I have received this one through Chick Advisor and I have been using it at night because I have oilyer skin type and I found that it absorb quite nice without leaving skin greasy. Great for every day use as a basic moisturiser, but doesn't do much else for the skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like this particular product - Other moisturizers I have used in the past, seem to be on the greasy side and do not absorb so easily in the skin. This one has a really nice, lightweight texture that make it easy to apply to the entire face, especially when you're skin may be oily or dry. It is perfect to use before applying primer as a base. Also very affordable! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like this moisturizer, but it's not strong enough for the harsh weather where I live. I'll certainly be using it more frequently when the weather gets better! It let my skin feeling smooth, the scent is great and I didn't experience any breakouts with this moisturizer- which is huge plus for me. I never felt greasy wearing this lotion. :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Amazing! Feels super light on my face, absorbs fast, moisturizes well. I especially like that it has next to no scent. I noticed that my foundation looked much more even after I used the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. I would definitely recommend it, especially to people with sensitive skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm always scared to try new moisturizers as my skin can be temperamental yet often very dry. Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer ended up making my skin very happy. It's light and yet definitely helps with the dryness I experienced during this never ending Winter in Toronto. If you're looking for a basic moisturizer without fragrance then this one's for you! *I received this product for free as a ChickAdvisor employee. All opinions are my own.* (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this as part of the Product Review Club to test. I thought it was a good moisturizer. It was pretty light, sunk in relatively quickly, the scent wasn't overpowering. It was nice, although I have dry skin so I needed something a little extra to deal with my dry patches! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The cream left my face soft and relaxed, I applied in the morning and it was effective all day. Good for sensitive skin, I did not have to worry about a break out, goes on easy, with just a small amount. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was chosen to receive this product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. This product is light and I would recommend this as an everyday moisturizer. If you have oily skin, I also believe this would be a good product as it is fairly light and doesn't feel oily. It would be a great base to use under make-up. Another thing is that this product doesn't have a scent, which is what I prefer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was chosen to receive this product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I loved the moisturizer. I can suffer from dry skin around my nose and eyes especially in winder time here in Northern Ontario. It quickly fixed that issue up and I have been about to apply my foundation smoothly since I began using the product. I would definitely recommend it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product has a great price point, but unfortunately my sensitive skin had a negative reaction to it. It became a bit itchy and red, and although I tried it a couple times to see if I had a better shot at using it, I just couldn't unfortunately! I was provided this product for review. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I thought I would really enjoy this product due to my very sensitive skin. It has cleaner ingredients than other moisturizers. But when I started to use it I noticed that around my nose and mouth areas, it started to dry up even more. It then eventually started to peel lightly in those areas. I unfortunately had to stop using it. :( (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to this product. My skin was red, burning and itchy seconds after applying this to my face. The cream also had a smell that reminded me of a hospital which lingered for the better part of the day. It's a shame because I was really excited about trying a new moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"For me it's a no go, I had a small reaction and a small light rash under my skin after using the SIMPLE Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. It is a great price, it did hydrate my fact, but for some reason I had a reaction to the product. The only reason I would not recommend is based on my own personal reaction to the product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer quickly absorbed and left my skin feeling hydrated and soft. However, I didn't notice any difference in the appearance of my skin. A lot of moisturizers leave my face feeling greasy and feel very heavy which in turn causes breakouts. This did none of that. The price is fantastic for a moisturizer that is this effective. I received Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for free in exchange for an honest review from Chick Advisor. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free for review as a member of the PRC. I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer. I love that it is completely unscented. It's actually quite thick and rich, so a little goes a long way. After using it for a couple of weeks the condition of my skin is so much nicer! I'm definitely going to be buy this again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a great, simple moisturizer that is great for everyday use. I use it after I wash my face at night and I like the way my skin feels when I wake up the next day. It is a nice texture and isn't too thick or too runny, and it absorbs fast enough that you don't feel it sitting on your skin. Great option for the price! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free from Chick advisor and it was a very 'ok' moisturizer. It was good but fairly average. It was hydrating, but not as much so as my Nivea Soft which I use religiously. It's something I would get if they stopped carrying my current brand. I didn't notice anything vastly amazing, it was just a good product in general. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the fact that this product is very light, if I had one comment it would be to add a sunscreen to the formula. I don't like using moisturizers that don't have any sunscreens in it. In the winter I like to use an SPF of 20 and in the winter I prefer a 30 SPF. Overall, a nice product to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the way that this moisturiser keeps my face from drying out through the day without causing me to breakout, even using it daily. I only needed a small amount of product to cover my entire face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got to try Simple Replenishing Rich moisturizer as part of the Product Review Club. It hydrated my skin well and did not irritate my face. There wasn't much of a smell. I do prefer a scent that wakes you up in my face moisturizer. A citrus scent would be nice. I also like a product that includes spf for sun protection. I would consider purchasing again if spf was added. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as part of the chick advisor product review club and I really wanted to like it. I felt it did moisturize my face and make my skin feel soft but I felt the lack of fragrance didn't smell nice and made me want to wile it off, the smell really lingered. I probably won't buy this product but I would recommend it to others who are sensitive to fragrance. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was given this product to review by Chick Advisor and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT ! I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and my skin feels great . It does not leave a heavy oil residue on my skin and I have yet to break out . I have tried many brands of moisturizer and this one is definitely one that I will be using again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as a member of the Product Review Club. I am sad to say that I don't feel like this product moisturized well. After 3 weeks trial period, I honestly found no difference. Maybe that this product is rather intended for the teenagers. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received the product as part of the chick advisor review club. I was really impressed with how my skin felt while using this product. I was taken back by the lack of scent as I tend to enjoy scented products. I really loved the tingling feeling associated with using it too... So that was very much welcomed (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I did try Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for free sent from Chick Advisor. The product is very good and was perfect for my oil and dry skin. I din't have any reaction to the product and it help my skin to have nice look. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really like this moisturizer. It helped keep my skin feeling soft under my makeup. I do wish it was a little thicker as I have a very dry chin area but all in all I would recommend it to my friends and family ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Thanks Chick Advisor for letting me try this absolutely FREE I wasn't sure of the moisturizer but it smoothed my skin nice light scent #SimpleSkincare @SimpleSkincare you don't need much at all and is effective and affordable (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Meh - I have combination skin, so finding a balance that doesn't leave my skin greasy or dry is a fine balance. I found this moisturizer if used consecutively (day after day) would leave my skin feeling oily. I am going to try another week of two times a week only and see if that helps more. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The cream is very rich. When you apply the cream , your face is moisturizes instantanely. Leave your skin very soft. You don't need much to apply in your face, a simple amount of cream goes a long way. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've been looking for a great moisturizer because my skin has been really dry. I super happy to find something that worked for my really dry skin and oily skin. No irritations. I've notice a difference since I started using it. Thank You chick Advisor!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"#GotItFree #SimpleSkincare @SimpleSkincare the Moisturizer is the icing on the cake after using the make-up removal wipes followed by the Micellar water, without any issues or irritations on sensitive skin. Does not leave a huge oily shine on your skin after using, which, for myself, is a bonus. This is a great skincare trio for all people with all skin types and especially for people that like to wear make-up. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I liked this moisturizer plain and simple (see what I did there?). It's not my favorite moisturizer but as far as an effective DAY moisturizer goes, this is great. I found it to be a light, fast absorbing moisturizer but not enough for me at night. For the price, you can't beat it for day hydration! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
So I have acne Prone skin and I break out with almost every product… Except for this one! I have been wearing it before I put my makeup on and it absorbs quickly I like that it is very light in scent. Though I did receive this product for my honest review I will be re-purchasing when I run out (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Thank you ChickAdvisor's Product Review Club for sending me Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer! This is a non fragrant, light moisturizer that never feels oily or greasy, I really like how easily it absorbed into my sensitive/dry skin. I will surely continue to use this product and recommend giving this a try! Your skin will be happy! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am so impressed with this moisturizer. It has no scent, it absorbs really fast, and it is NOT greasy at all. I have never used another moisturizer that works all day long with no oily feel to it. I highly recommend this Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer is very good for sensitive skin. It didn't cause my skin to break out and it was very rich and hydrating. I would recommend this product, but I'm not sure I would buy it for myself based on the price for the amount you get. Although a little moisturizer goes a long way. I received this product for free to review from the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've used a variety of Simple products in the past so expected to be happy with the Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. I was not disappointed! This product leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and it does not at all irritate my sensitive skin. I really like that it doesn't contain any fragrances or dyes. I received a complimentary bottle of this product through ChickAdiver's Product Review Club in exchange for an honest review. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"A nice light moisturizer which is excellant for day time moisturizer . I have very picky skin and by very picky I mean break out over anything .This doesn't make me break out . It feels light and cool when applied to the skin and doesn't sit heavy . It was great under my primer & foundation , didn't make it slip or move at all which is a huge bonus as a lot of others not only can but from experience will .. Will be buy again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer just isn't for me. My t-zone felt uncomfortably sticky and I had a major breakout a few days into using it. The cream was very thick and creamy which was pleasant but unfortunately, it wasn't suitable for my skin-type. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is gentle replenishing moisturizer. I love it because it leaves your skin subtle, fresh and hydrated! Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer is affordable and does the job of hydrating the skin. The best thing about this product is that it doesn't contain perfumes to irritate the skin! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this product! Definitely would purchase in the future for sure. I noticed a difference in my skin right away...felt smoother and softer and looked healthier, overall. It's light weight and doesn't feel thick on your skin. A little goes a long way. The bottle is big and has a lot in it for the price, which is also reasonable. I think I may be changing my moisturizer to this one, now!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was selected by ChickAdvisor to test Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. I love Simple products. Affordable, effective and gentle on my skin. There is much to say about this moisturizer, which is a good thing in my opinion. It's gentle yet effective, isn't filled with colourants and scents to irritate my already sensitive skin, isn't greasy and absorbs well! It's a great all around moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this product, I did give it over 2 weeks before wanting to give a review. I find its very light and doesn't make my skin feel heavy, it also last a long time too. I am very pleased how it feels and would highly recommend other to try it, especially if you have sensitive skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I needed a new moisturizer for my acne prone, oily skin and needed something light but still moisturizing. I have combination skin, so some parts of my face get oily, and some dry and patchy. A lot of other moisturizers I've used are too heavy, and break my face out. I tried this moisturizer and I love it. It is very light, but very moisturizing. It does not break my face out at all, and gets rid of the dry skin without making my face oily."
"I received the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I have very oily skin that is often dehydrated. I decided to switch my regular moisturizer to this one for a week to see how it goes. It definitely moisturizes very well, but it is way too rich for my skin! I think the price is decent and this would make the perfect moisturizer for someone with very dry skin. I will be giving it to my sister (who has dry skin). (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Wow, this skincare line rocks! I found that this moisturizer left my skin feeling more nourished even after the first try. It doesn't irritate my skin at all, and it goes on nicely. It was really effective and wonderful to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was very happy with the moisturizer. My skin is usually pretty oily after using most creams and I was pleasantly surprised my skin was hydrated but not oily. Using the moisturizer with the other two steps made my skin look and feel radiant! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was lucky enough to receive this product to try. I liked the consistency and scent of this product and because of the thinness of the product I used it as a day lotion. I usually tend to choose day lotions that have SPF in them, however this one does not. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was lucky enough to receive this product and I must say that I really like this moisturizer. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way! This product does not have a strong smell and it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy and heavy. It also keeps your skin moisturized all day. I didn't experience any irritation while using this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this from Chickadvisor to review this product. It's a great moisturizer which worked well with my skin. Smooth and not to oily- would definitely recommend for anyone looking to try a new product. The Simple line is fabulous and more natural which was definitely a plus. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really liked the 'simple' factor here. Not a long list of ingredients, nothing fancy, no expensive looking jar with minimal product. It works well, smells nice, doesn't leave a greasy residue. It sinks in fast and leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product for free as part of the Chickadvisor Product Review Club. This product had no scent to it. I liked how it felt when I rubbed it gently on my face. It felt smooth and soothing on my face. My skin felt nicer and softer. And I have dry skin on my face and it made it better. It also felt good on my neck. It works better than other products I have tried that are similar to this one. I would definitely purchase this product again and would recommend it to a friend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I like this product but it's not my favorite. The moisturizer have no perfume and vitamin and nutrients wich is good for my skin, but the cream stay a long time on your skin. I feel like my skin is oily. It will be better if the moisturizer is absorb by your skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I think it is an adequate general moisturizer, but I did not notice any ""wow"" results. It does not seem to be any more effective than the usual drug store products. I would recommend it for people who need light moisturizing but I don't think it is powerful enough for seriously dry skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've tried Simple products a long time ago so was very excited to try this new Simple moisturizer for free from Chick Adviser. I have sensitive skin so was a bit hesitant but after trying it, I'd totally use again. It isn't too smelly and goes on smooth without feeling oily. After a few days, I noticed my skin feeling softer. Would highly recommend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product free of charge for testing purposes as part of the Product Review Club- thanks ChickAdvisor! Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer I use it for few times and got very positive results... my skin love it... I love it... good quality moisturizer to use everyday.... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using these moisturizer for a few weeks now and I really like it. It is super gentle on my skin and never leaves my face feeling dry or irritated. It absorbs quickly into my skin, doesn't leave my face greasy I am trying it for free right now. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have tried many moisturizers, and I'm definitely very happy with this one! I received it free, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity. Definitely very very hydrating, which is the ultimate goal of a moisturizer. It definitely does its job! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My skin is dry and sensitive. Most moisturizers I've tried before may be great before bed but not under makeup. Or the smell turns me off no matter how nice it makes my skin feel. Finally here is a moisturizer that is light, creamy, no dyes, no perfumes, no sting and is not greasy. Add that I can put it on a few minutes before makeup and my makeup doesn't slide off my face and I have enough reasons to buy more. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Was really happy I was selected to try this product out. I found it made my skin feel soft and not greasy, I really liked this product and would buy it again. It didn't make my skin break out like some other products do (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product as a Product Review from ChickAdvisor. I used it in the morning under my makeup, and in the evening after cleansing. I found my skin felt healthy and nourished after use, and liked that it was not perfumed. I would normally use a product with an SPF, and this doesn't have one, but the quality of the product, and the way it made my skin feel were great - I would suggest it to others to use! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Not a huge fan of this lotion. I wasn't a fan of the smell and found that it didn't moisturize very much. Also wasn't a fan that it didn't have any sun protection which is generally something I look for when buying a facial cream. Better for before bed applications I guess. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I would not normally buy a drug store facial moisturizer, and assess quality by price. I was therefore happy to receive Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer from Chick Advisor to sample. I was pleasantly surprised: it's light, hydrates the skin well and absorbs easily (no sticky feeling). I always feel my skin tight and dry after washing and this moisturizer immediately hydrated my face. Happy to have tried it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I waited a bit to review this one, because I wanted to give it a chance to work before I reviewed it. I liked it, but I didn't love it. It wasn't the thickness that I like for my very dry skin. It added moisture but wasn't as noticeable as what I usually use. I gave this one to my husband. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. After using a deep cleansing mask I had put this on and my skin just drank it up. It didn't leave a shiny residue and it made my skin feeling smooth and supple. I also carry it in case I have days where my skin in feeling drier than normal especially after swimming. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product free. It was with two others. I use it every morning and I will definetely buy it in the future. It's light, not really with a perfume, my skin is soft and it goes under my makeup perfectly. I truly recommend this one !! Thanks a lot :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As this cream is odorless and is absorbed instantly, I used it in different times of the day. At work, when the area becomes too dry, the skin needs extra nutrition. At home, in the morning before applying makeup and sometimes in the evening before bedtime. Following the application, the product absorption is very fast and leaves a sensation of wetness. Odorless and fat, after a while the skin is naturally beautiful and hydrated. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product from ChickAdvisor to test. This review is based on my personal experiences using the product. I really enjoyed this moisturizer. It was not greasy or sticky. It went on smooth and replenished my skin. I have very dry spots on the corners of my nose and in between my eyebrows. After a few days of use they were no longer dry. #TrySimpleSkincare (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Disclosure: I received this product for free as part of the Chickadvisor Product Review Club. This moisturizer is light and a little more watery than I am used to. However, I LOVE it! It moisturizes really well and leaves my skin moisturized all day which is a great thing. It has no scent which is an added bonus. I will probably buy it in the future as the price is great especially in comparison to Aveeno. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got to try this product through Chick Advisor product review Club. This moisturizer is okay. I t has a slight scent to it which is also ok. I much prefer creamer, richer moisturizers. It pairs well with the cleansing wipes. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The fine folks at ChickAdvisor sent Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for me to test and review as part of their Product Review Club. The Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer works well as a daytime moisturizer. It has a very faint or barely detectable scent which I appreciate. I found the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer pairs well with the Simple Micellar Cleansing Water as part of a morning or nighttime skin regimen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. It is true that it replenishes my skin in the morning and keeps it nourished for the rest of the day. It is very rich and moisturizing for my skin. This is much better than other moisturizers that I have tried in the past that make my face oily. I would definitely recommend this Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer as this is worth the money and effective. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love it! It truly is ""simple"" but works like a charm - goes on smoothly, no irritating scent and leaves my skin feeling moist and supple. I believe I have found my go to skincare line and it's affordable unlike some of the competing brands of which most are more costly. I will be grabbing it next time I go shopping so I don't run out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have to say this product smells really bad and is thick and slimy. I couldn't get over the smell. It smelled rancid or like dirty socks.. :s Although slimy in texture it did apply nice to the face and didn't irritate my skin afterwords. Maybe my sample was old, or maybe that's just the smell. But due to the smell and texture i will not be re buying. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thanks to ChickAdvisor for sending me this product for free. I loved how light the formula was. It was completely non greasy, gentle on my skin and a pleasant fragrance. I was disappointed at the lack of SPF however and for that reason I would not buy this product again. If your looking for a moisturizer without SPF though this is a great find. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really wanted to like this product. It's moisturizing, it doesn't smell bad, but it left my skin kind of greasy. It's a thick cream which I don't mind, what bothers me is that the skin doesn't absorb it right the way. I didn't use a lot but still had to work it on my skin to be absorbed. I have a dry skin, so usually my skin loves moisture, but this one feels off. I feel like i would use it as a night cream rather than a day cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Like the concept of the moisturizer and is fairly thick product but can't get over the smell. I love the fragrance free option but there is just something that turns me off. Good sensitive skin product but not for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I found this product to be lightweight and unscented. It absorbed quickly and my skin did not react. It seemed to work well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer is so light and quick absorbing! I was skeptical at first but quickly changed my opinion of this product after a couple of uses. I noticed that the moisturizer is very hydrating, light and quickly absorbs by my skin. I am loving this cream and will definitely purchase a full size once I run out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Thanks Chick Advisor for this #TrySimpleSkincare selection! Great for sensitive skin! It is light and unscented. I also found that it was not greasy when applied. The packaging was also really nice and great for travelling! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Light fresh and made my face look glowing..everybody was asking me what i changed. Thanks to #ChickAdvisor for the #freeproducts, Shared with a friend who felt in love and bhought the product as well.... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Over several days I used the Simple Micellar cleansing water and after the cleansing I applied the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. I personally found it worked well on my skin. I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer seems to be effective for my skin type. It left my face feeling smooth and soft. I enjoyed using this product and was please with the results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really like this moisturizer! It goes on nicely and absorbed fast. I like using it before applying my foundation because it makes my foundation go on smoother. It is nice because it is a natural product, so i (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Final step to a great 3 step goodnight-to-me pampering routine....I am smiling ear to ear by the time I complete moisturizing my face. Thank you @chickadvisor and @simpleskincare I enjoyed the #trysimpleskincare campaign (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this moisturizer. Chick Advisor sent me some to #TrySimpleSkincare for free, and I was extremely pleased. It is light, but not so light that my skin feels tight. It isn't at all greasy, and feels great. I've been using it consistently for a couple of weeks and my skin feels great - no breakouts, no dry patches, nothing bad. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I used the moisturizer as part of a three part nightly routine. This was used as the final step and the moisturizer was used just prior to going to bed. My skin was very soft and clear. No blemishes developed as has been my experience with other night moisturizers. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as part of the Review Club. I liked the fact that the moisturizer was unscented. It went on smoothly and absorbed into my skin really quickly, leaving behind soft skin for the day that did not feel greasy at the end of the day. The consistency was very light, and slightly thin. Something that I liked was that the bottle gave instructions on how to put on the moisturizer (upward and outward), a little thing but good instructions (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I use moisturizer every day. I prefer a moisturizer that goes on light and absorbs quickly into my skin. This moisturizer feels a little sticky and feels like in sits on top of my skin. I am not a fan. I also found that I have had a bit of breakouts since using this. Not sure if it is the root cause, but it's the only thing that has changed in my beauty regime.

I received this Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer from ChickAdvisor for free by being a member of the Product Review Club for the purpose of testing and reviewing. So far I am loving this moisturizer. It does an very good job at hydrating and keeping the skin moisturized without that clogged oily feeling. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I am a gal who knows her way around moisturizers and Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer holds it own. It wasn't greasy but left my face supple and feeling great. A must try. I got mine as part of a trial but will be adding to my routine. Love #simple (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this moisturizer as a tester and I really like Simple line. I found this moisturizer to be nice and light weight and easy to apply to stay moisturized. I did find this product to have an unpleasant smell, it wasn't over powerful but was enough that I wouldn't use on my daughter due to her sensitivities to smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free from the Chick Advisor Product Review Club. I love this moisturizer! At first I didn't think this would be a very rich moisturizer at all but I was wrong, it goes on thicker than I thought and it really hydrates my skin well. It has a very subtle fresh scent and it doesn't irritate my skin. I'd definitely recommend it to family and friends and I'll 100% buy it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product to review for Chick Advisor. I would love if this lotion had an SPF to it because other than that, this product is a SLAM DUNK! Perfect for my sensitive, dry skin. Definitely didn't feel greasy ever and felt so light! Limited/light scent for those who are sensitive. Price is good compared to other brands, size, the fact that you don't use too much for every application and it can be used daily. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was chosen to receive and review this product through Chick Advisor, and I'm so happy to give my opinion of this mosturizer. I love that its unscented, but I was suprised by how soft it left my skin feeling. It absorbed into my skin fast, didn't leave my skin feeling greasy and it lasted throughout the day. It didn't irritate my skin. I'm really impressed with this brand! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer is very good, it doesnt have a strong smell which i like, and it goes on nice and smooth. Its light weight and is effective at keeping my dry winter skin nice and moisturized. I would use it again and i would recommend it to others :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I enjoyed my free sample of this skin care line. I found the scent was very light. The moisturizer was very light weight and did not feel sticky like some others. This formula was very gentle on my skin it felt very natural. The price is about average for facial moisturizers. Overall a good product. I received this product free as part of the chickadvisor product review club (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was a little scared to use this moisturizer because i am a normal combination skin type. I loved using this moisturizer. Its been a week my skin feel hydrated and soft. The size of this moisturizer is great usually the face moisturizers are 50 ml this one is 125ml. The only thing i would change about it is its smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this in the product review club. I usually use a fairly heavy moisturizer and all spa quality products so I held this product up to a pretty high standard! It feels lovely on the skin, but doesn't provide enough moisture for me to use at night. I've been using it in the morning under my makeup and I find that it is a perfect daytime moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a great, affordable moisturizer that is suitable for sensitive skin. The scent is very light, and the product spreads very easily. You don't need a lot to moisturize your face, so more bang for your buck! I used this when I had a few more blemishes than usual, and it did not make them any worse. My face feels moisturized all day, which I like. I received this from Chick Advisor to provide my honest review. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got this product free to try from the Product Review Club. I like it so far - it seems to be doing a good job of moisturizing my skin without weighing it down. It just leaves a soft feeling on my skin; not a greasy one which it nice. I've had no problems with the sensitive areas of my skin either. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
My skin is always dry or has these dry spots that just wont go away. I have bought lots of moisturizers in the past ( i have lost count) and Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer was the only one that would det rid of the stubborn dry spots I had. It didnt make my face oily. I have found the Face Moisturizer for me. Thanks Chicks Advisor (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I have been using this facial moisturizer for the past week and my face is noticeably softer. It's gentle on sensitive skin and felt lightweight on my face. The only con I would say to be frugal with it. A little goes a long way and found if I put a generous amount of my face, it would break out. I also liked the fact it doesn't have a strong perfume. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product from Chickadvisor for review purposes. I'm really liking this moisturizer. My skin tends to get sensitive with the change in seasons and this moisturizer has been gentle, while moisturizing my skin. The smell is subtle which I like, and the texture is vey light. Love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer was light, natural (not heavy or greasy like some) It was easy to use. It was priced about the same as other Moisturizers but more effective (which is good, because this winter has been drying my skin like crazy) ** I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got mailed a sample and asked to review this item. I've used Simple brand before and with somewhat sensitive skin I can say this stuff isn't harsh and its enough to moisturize my face good. It isnt sented strong so thats nice to. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I love this product on my face. It leaves it so moisturized without having an oily feeling.

"I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I really liked this moisturizer! It didn't have a strong scent like some of my other moisturizers, which was good. It dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day long. It is perfect for wearing under my makeup. I couldn't really ask for anything else. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was sent this to try via ChickAdvisor. I love the Simple brand and I really wanted to like this. But I didn't. First I don't like the smell and second it wasn't the thick, creamy, moisturizer I'm used to. It really didn't work for me. I don't think I'll be using this in the future. I would look for something unscented if I did. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this as part of the Product Review Club. Let's start with the positives: it is easily absorbed and didn't irritate my skin. But the fact that it is perfume free made it very unpleasant for me to use as I found the smell very detergent-like. Plus, I found it wasn't enough to moisturize my skin. I will pass on this one unfortunately. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got to try Simple Replenshing Rich Moisturizer for free for being part of the Product Review Club. I found this moisturizer to be very effective. It moisturized my skin without leaving it greasy, it was really lightweight, just the kind that I like, and there was hardly any scent! It absorbed into my skin really quickly, and left it feeling super soft. I'd definitely buy this product again, and recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thank you for choosing me to try this product for free. I found this moisturiser to be effective and light. I love that all the products sent in the kit were lightly scented. It gives the feeling of moisture, without a heavyness. The packaging is very similar to the Micellar cleanser, so I have accidentally applied the moisturiser to the cotton thinking it was the cleanser. (I admit - twice ;o) I think I've got it sorted now, and I plan to continue these products for my routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Okay moisturizer. Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer works for me for light moisturizing. In dry weather when my skin tends to get dry I find that it doesn't moisturize as well. I like that my skin did not get irritated and I did not experience any breakouts. Received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I used Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer along with the Simple Micellar Cleansing Water and Simple Micellar Makeup Remover Wipes. The moisturizer left my face feeling soft and hydrated my skin. I didn't find that it irritated my skin and worked well under my makeup. I used it both daytime and nighttime. Nice to find a skin care trio that fits into an active lifestyle and simple to use. Would recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club and found it perfect on my sensitive skin. There is no fragrant so good for those who may get irritated from the perfumes on most moisturizers. It was very lightweight and absorbed right away. It kept my face moisturized throughout the day and I enjoy using it before I go to bed so that the next day my face is still soft. Would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin. Price point is great too. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"**I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. Of the three items from Simple I got to test, this was the most disappointing for me. I found that it felt a bit too heavy and greasy on my face and I got oily very quickly after application. While the price is nice, this product is just not for me. It may be good for someone with drier skin and needs a bit heavier of a moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received the product free from Chick Advisor for the purpose of my review, all opinions are my own. I really enjoyed the simple Replenishing Rick Moisturizer. It was light weight and non greasy. It absorbed quickly, like water. This product did not sting or irritate my skin and it did not create any further imbalances. It works well under my makeup and as a pm moisturizer. It is refreshing to have facial products without scents and artificial coloring. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As I was looking for a moisturizer, this was excellent. After washing at night & moisturizing in the am this product is wonderful, smells very nice and it feels great as well, which is important. It has nice consistency & applies well. It dries nicely too. I am super happy trying this and getting it free was awesome! Totally! Thanks! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been having a really hard time with my skin lately. It has been super dry and most products irritate it and leave my face red and blotchy. I love the Simple moisturizer! I love that it's unscented, it's so gentle on my skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn't make me look all red and blotchy. It's a nice, light moisturizer and soaks in quickly which makes applying make up soon after very easy! I will continue to use this product, it's great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really enjoyed this product. I sometimes have mild redness on my face and I noticed that this didn't cause that to get worse and it actually helped it go down a bit. The one thing I noticed is that it had a strong smell, which has to do with the fact that they don't use perfumes or dyes, but the smell seems to disappear after a few minutes on your face. I received this product for free thanks to the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"i loved this moisturizer. its perfect for everyday use. i think it would be perfect for all skin type, it does not have a greasy feeling. it absorbes well and fast into the skin. I think it helped heal the acne scars on my skin. I am not a fan of the smell, for me it kinda smells like an expired product which makes me question if its still good. but it does say there is no perfume so thats probably why. i really enjoy the fact that this product is more natural, therefore less harmful to my skin .

I was thrilled to receive this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Review Club and I was not at all disappointed. I am constantly on the lookout for a great moisturizer that isn't oily and leaves your skin feeling hydrated. I also love it because it does not have an overpowering scent and leaves your skin feeling hydrated for most of the day. I would highly recommend it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I recived this as a sample and tried it right away. It was not a greasy cream and absorbed to the skin well leaving it soft . It is not a greasy cream and adsorbs to the skin well leaving feeling soft. For me I really disliked the scent if this was unscented I would use it regularly.

I got to try this product free from the review club. I did really like this product. It was scent free and very light on my skin. With other moisturizors in the past I have been left with a very heavy feeling but the simple replentishing rich moisturizor absorbed in to my skin quickly and left no residue or oily build up. I would defiently try this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product free to try from Chick Advisor. It leaves my skin nice and soft. Even my hands feel soft from applying it. It didn't cause any break outs or irritation. The only thing that I didn't like was the smell. Although it's supposed to be unscented, it has sort of an earthy, dirt-like smell to me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like this moisturizer its great to wear under my make up, light and not overpowering. It's very gentle on my skin. My skin is really sensitive and breaks out easily but Ive been using this stuff daily since I received them in the mail and haven't had any new spots! The only thing I don't like is the smell of it, it is unscented but i just find the unscented ""smell"" isn't that pleasant, but that hasn't stopped me from using it!

"I received the product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. My experience with the product based on the package claims was okay. It did get rid of my dry skin. I would compare this product with other similar products I've tried in the past as it works, but leaves my skin feeling oily, especially if I've used too much. I would not purchase this product again and/or recommend it to a friend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is not a rich moisturizer. I've used this a couple times since receiving it as a campaign with ChickAdvisor and find that it does an ok job at moisturizing, but that's it. It doesn't do any additional features: no mattifying, no spf, nothing. It says it has added vitamins, but I don't see a difference. It's a plain moisturizer if you're in need of one, but my skin didn't find this moisturizer to be too fantastic. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Really moisturize my skin, it feels cold and soft when you apply it. The cream is rich and fits well for sensitive skin. For me, the smell wasn't in my taste, some kind of natural oil but very subtitle (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
At first I found this very greasy on my skin and would only use it at night. Now I'm not sure I've found it absorbing in much better. So I'm still on the fence about this product. For a night time moisturizer I like it a lot. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have really bad combination skin , this really helped my really dry areas around my nose and top of my forehead. I wasn't a big fan of the smell . My skin for sure is way more softer and smoother after using this for a week. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product as part of the ChickAdviser Product Review Club! I was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer. My skin is combination, and the dry areas are really dry especially in the winter months. I usually have to stick with my one proven moisturizer. This product was light and non-greasy. And it left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. For the price point, it's a definite steal. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I struggle with this product. It is very hydrating,which I love for the winter. However, what I did find, is that this is a better night product even though it is a daytime moisturizer. I say this because my foundation didn't apply well on top and it ended up being very blotchy and I had never had this problem with other daytime moisturizers. Over night though, it worked really well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product moisturized my skin pretty well. I wasn't a huge fan of the scent though, considering I was putting it all over my face. It's supposed to be unscented, but it definitely had some kind of scent to it. I'm generally not a fan of unscented moisturizers in general though. I prefer moisturizers that have a specific scent. I received this product in exchange for this review from the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
My face just drinks this lotion up! I was amazed the first time I used it. Didn't leave my face greasy or oily like some lotions do. No problem using this and then applying makeup afterwards. It is unscented. I maybe would like a mildly scented lotion a bit more. But am fine with this too. Overall great moisturizer. Defiantly would buy again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I know this is called a ""replenishing rich moisturizer"" but I didn't find it nearly hydrating enough for my dry skin. I suppose I could use it in the morning along with a serum under my makeup, but I'd rather use something more tailored to my skin's needs. I did find this line really good for my sensitive skin, so if you have normal skin that's a little sensitive, this may be a better fit for you. I received this product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
It's a very good moisturizer. Does everything it claims without leaving any greasy residue. My only issue with it is that it kind of stinks. Hard to wear it due to the smell. It's unscented but sometimes unscented means it has a bad scent. (LOL) Not sure I would purchase it again unless they change the scent. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wouldn't be bothered by the scent it has. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"For the price, this is a great product. It moisturizes well and isn't too thick. It feels light going on, but also moisturizes well. I also love Simple products because they are fragrance free. I received this product from ChickAdvisor, but I would absolutely purchase this product in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a ""simple"" moisturizer. It's moisturizes and that's it. I don't see my skin more clear or I don't see my little wrinkles fade. I don't think this product is for you if you have specific needs. but it will be perfect if you have a normal skin. The package is huge! You don't need much to cover all your face and neck so you'll have it for a very long time! ** I received this product for free via chick advisor product review club. This opinion is mine** (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was skeptical at first because I often find ""natural"" and ""sensitive skin"" products to not be moisturizing enough for my skin. However this moisturizer proved me wrong. For a day lotion it is great, and for the evening I just start with a serum to add that extra layer of richness my skin requires. I really like that is absorbs quickly without leaving a ""watery"" layer on my skin. I also really like that it doesn't have any scent - which is hard to sometimes find in a good lotion.

I have very sensitive skin and everything irritates it. This product was great didnt irritate my skin or make me break out. I will definitely purchase this product in the future and recommend it to friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer is light and quick to absorb. I was surprised that my skin didn't break out with this product, as it usually does when I switch skin products. As well, I have very sensitive skin where my skin turns bright red when I introduce a new skin care line. Simple kept my skin looking great with no redness. Very impressed, especially for the price!

"I am really glad that I was able to try this product. I have bought a few Simple products before and have been happy with them, so trying another one was a great opportunity. I found the formula light and since I have an issue with heavy smelling scents, I was worried that this would bother me. However the smell was perfect for me. I will probably buy this product in the future. I was given this to try for free from Chick Advisor. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

"This product was okay. The ingredients aren't impressive, but I like that it's fragrance-free. It did not irritate my skin and was somewhat hydrating. The formula is lightweight, so would be nice for summer as a daytime moisturizer. I would recommend this more for people with normal skin. I don't think it is rich enough for people with dry skin.

I found this moisturizer to be light and non greasy. It worked well for my skin which can be sensitive at times. I found it to work well. It goes on light and doesn't have an unpleasant smell. It didn't seem to clog my pores and worked well under make up. Thanks Chick Advisor for allowing me to review this product for free. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"this is great. I have problems finding moisturizers because i find that the oily parts of my face have a problem absorbing it! This stuff dosnt feel oily at all, it leaves my skin soft and moisturized but not too moisturized where you feel like the product is just sitting on top of your skin. There is a faint smell but it disperses quickly so I dont mind it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Sometimes a girl just wants to be basic. I really enjoyed the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer because it was just that. Simple. It added moisture it was not greasy.

I received this product from Chick Advisor's Product Review Club. I truly love this product. The lotion is light and you don't need to use much to get a nice moisturized feel. I used it every night before bed and in the morning and found it worked great for my skin. It's great to use under makeup because of how light it is. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who doesn't like scents or anything heavy and strong. Great product and something I would buy! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product from Chick Advisor's product review club to try and review. I found this moisturizer not as thick as others I have tried however a little bit goes very far. I like how there is not too many ingredients in it to weight it down. It is very light. Once absorb, it's like it is there at all which making put on make-up easier. Out of everything that I put on my face that is scented, I am glad that this is unscented. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

I recently had the chance to try for free Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer that was provided to me for trial by Chick Advisor. I really appreciate it.

Within a week my face was left very soft and smooth, even after wearing it under a full face of makeup every day. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for free from ChickAdvisor for review purposes. This was the first time I'd tried any of the Simple Skincare line and was really impressed with the moisturizer. It was gentle on my skin and I appreciate it being free from perfumes and dyes as my skin has been known to flare up as a result of additives. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have received this product for free as being a member of ChickAdvisor Review Club. Traditionally I do not use a mositurizer as I have very oily skin. But this product is very light and worked very well for me. It made my skin feel super soft and hydrated the perfect amount without creating more oil on my skin. Definitely something I will purchase in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have received this product for free as being a member of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. This moisturizer has a light texture. I put it on my face two times a day (once in morning and once before I go to bed). I have combination/oily skin and this product helps to moisturize my skin throughout the day without feeling oily. I am happy with the result so far. This is a great product and I will recommend it to my friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this from the ChickAdvisor Review Club for free. I have tried Simple products before and they are awesome products for drugstore prices. This one is quite good. Doesn't irritate my skin and does a good job hydrating. Only downside is I am not a fan of the scent. Not the most pleasant. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really loved this moisturizer because not only was it a freebie from Chickadvisor but it was extremely gentle on the skin & wasn't oily. It didn't feel my skin feeling sticky or anything. It left my skin looking moisturized & healthy. Plus I live in southern ontario where the weather has been extremely bipolar, which made my skin dry & dull, but thankfully this moisturizer brought my skin back to normal. Skin saver.

"I receive this product free from chickadvisor. product review Club. This is the first time I have tried simple products, and I loved this moisturizer it felt like silk in ur hands. When applied to your face it did not leave it feeling sticky! I have been looking for a new moisturizer, and I think I am sticking with this one! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Nice light moisturizing cream. Doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. I like that it's Unscented. With my sensitive skin, chronic urticaria, it did not irritate my skin. I would recommend this product. Thumbs up (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This moisturizer was fantastic! My only issue is that I needed a bit more than I would usually use. It was great for my sensitive skin and didn't leave me oily at all. I would definitely buy this again! I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I've tried so many different ones to try to get rid of the pesky dry spots on my face and nothing worked, until I tried this. So far, every dry spot is gobe, I make sure to apply some at least once a day. The only thing I'm not fond of, is the smell. I know it has no fragrance added, but it still has a bit of a unpleasant smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Love the price and the fact it has anti aging properties... Was sent this by chick advisor for free can't beat that! Overall it was okay I just wish it had a natural fruit scent of some sort. Very simple like the name promises. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This was my first experience with the Simple brand and I am so glad I was selected to test it. I had been using high-priced MLM based products, and these are very comparable, although the kicker - these do not contain perfumes of any kind. My skin is glowing! Thanks Simple and Chick Advisor! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really liked Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer! It made my skin feel soft and the smell was really nice. It didn't make me breakout like some moisturizers and I could put it on under my makeup without it feeling greasy. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I liked the feeling of the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer, it was not greasy just made my skins soft. I was using it before applying my makeup and it did not create any acne. My dry skin was mostly gone in a couple days. I really like the moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The first thing I noticed was the smell. I have a sensitive nose, and this one smelled bad. Other than the smell, it was a decent enough moisturizer. It's creamy and effective and kept my skin soft. I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The price of this moisturizer is what really sells me on it. My high end moisturizers are at least $40 each, so finding a gentle one that doesn't break out my suuuper sensitive skin is always a blessing. Although I found the texture a little greasy, (I have become used to a water-based gel product) I did not find it unpleasant. I found that the formula seeped into my skin quickly and did not leave a residue on my pillow when I applied it at night before bed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Really enjoy using this moisturizer, makes my skin feel so soft and not oily, also doesn't cause my skin to break out. I looks Forward to my daily routine while using this product. So amazing such a fresh feeling in my face. Definitely a product I will continue to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'm one of the chicks who got to try Simple replenishing Rich Moisturizer and I can say for sure, this product is AWESOME!!!! I have a very sensitive and dry skin and after using this product for a week, my skin didn't look that good in ages. It moisturizes your skin perfectly and it last all day long. I will DEFINITELY buy this moisturizer again. Thank you SIMPLE SKINCARE & CHICK ADVISOR for giving me the opportunity to try this marvelous product!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. This is a great basic, scent-free rich moisturiser. It absorbs really well and does not leave your face oily looking. I like my moisturisers to have more anti-aging properties, so I will be giving this to my man. I know he will love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried a trial of this product the trio actually which consisted of the simple wipes/water/lotion. I loved the wipes and the water but the lotion I couldn't handle. The cream itself made my face feel soft and replenished but I couldn't handle the stale smell that it had. I understand the scent free but I don't understand the stale smell. Did I get a bad bottle? I don't know. So the effectiveness was right on..but the quality was a little to be desired. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I Received this product from the Product Review Club. Another great product from Simple. Hydrates my skin without the greasy feel, and it works great under make up (doesn't feel heavy) This is a great addition to my skincare routine! #TrySimpleSkincare (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thanks ChickAdvisor for selecting me to test Simple Micellar Replenishing Rich Moisturizer for free in exchange for my review. This is my first time trying Simple products. When it comes to this moisturizer, rich is absolutely right! I used only a small amount and it's enough for my face and neck. The only thing I would change is to make it smell pretty, maybe a hint of floral fragrance? (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product from the Chick Advisor Product Review Club and was exciting to try the trio of Simple products together. Unfortunately, this product dried my skin to where I had to stop using it. I am unsure if it was solely this product or a combination of the trio, but I was disappointed. The product went on with great coverage and was lightweight but within 5 minutes I could feel tingling and my skin became itchy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer came just in time! Recently I was prescribed some acne cream by my doctor and my face became really dry and irritated. This SAVED my face from becoming worse. As it is fragrance free, this was a plus in my books as I am very acne prone and have sensitive skin. I didn't find this to be overly oily and a little goes a long way. This also did not break me out as I find with most moisturizers can do that. Thanks ChickAdvisor for the great product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I found this Replenishing Rich Moisturizer to be a wonderful addition to my skin care routine. Its non greasy and absorbs fast while leaving my skin feeling fresh and smooth. The only complaint really is the smell, its quite unpleasant as most unscented products are. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer was a pleasant surprise! I have to admit I am a bit of a skin care snob sometimes and I was quite pleased with the hydrating properties of this moisturizer. I love the fact that it is specifically for sensitive skin and found it absorbed quickly with no greasy residue. Overall definitely an A in my book! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I couldn't believe how great this moisturizer was. It truly is a rich moisturizer and leaves your skin feeling so fresh and light. It sinks in right away with not that much rubbing in and it doesn't leave an oily residue which is nice. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really enjoyed using this product i like how soft my face feels after it, i like how hydrated it feels its super light weight. I have really oily skin and i found it works well with my skin type which is fantastic! ive been buying it for quite a while now and i will continue too :D (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The sheer reason I'm not recommending this is the smell, it smelled like I was rubbing clay on my face! I don't even know how well it moisturizered as I had to wash it off my face ASAP! I'm happy I got to try this for free because had I paid for it I'd be pissed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is one moisturizer that i will be buying for sure. Before receiving these products to sample i had dry skin because of the harsh canadian winter in Montreal, and since i have been using this moisturizer my skin is so much smoother. its like i never had dry skin.i simply love it and will definitely be buying it again!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I didn't love this moisturizer to be honest... :( It smelled bad (I know it's scent-free but it had a weird smell to it) my skin felt tight the next morning and I didn't feel like I had moisturized... :( (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have found my new daily go to for moisturizer! Hands down this is in my Top 3 favourite skin products. I have even put aside my expensive high end moisturizer in favor of this beauty. It's so gentle on the skin yet SO moisturizing. Definitely a must try. I will be repurchasing this in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This was an average moisturizer"" I liked that it was up scented because I already wear expensive perfume and don't want anything to ruin that. The moisturizer sinks in quickly and softens your skin. #GotItFree #TrySimpleSkincare. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this from Chickadvsior as a trial i have very sensitive skin so i was eager to try this out as everything on the market irritates my skin and so far it seems to work. I am not a fan of the smell but the effectiveness outweighs the smelli did not get a reaction from using this so i will definitely buy again #Chickadvisor (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this free as part of Product Review club. I thought this was a decent moisturizer. I prefer my moisturizers to have spf but I think the intent of this one is just to be a gentle, healthy, daily use moisturizer. It does a good enough job and is meant for sensitive skin but I'm crazy about the scent. It's not strong (and possibly meant to be unscented?) but it smells like glue to me... I probably wouldn't buy this again, but mostly because it lacks the sunscreen protection. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like everything about this moistruizer..except the smell. It smells HORRIBLE! For a product that will be applied to my face, I would definitely like a better scent to it! Or, none at all! It does fade, takes approximately five minutes or so, but until then its gross. If you can handle that, then by all means I reccomend it as it is an effective product. Just smells...nasty (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I liked using this brand of moisturizer, because it wasn't greasy and is not harsh on my sensitive skin. It went on nicely on my face and neck and did not leave a greasy feeling. I wish it had sunscreen protection, because I use this as a base for my makeup, I had to put another face moisturizer with sunscreen as I have sensitive skin. Overall, it is a good moisturizer that is easy to apply and kept my face supple during the mild winters. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have super sensitive skin...and oily skin! Awesome combo...I know! So after almost two weeks and using the moisturizer morning and night, I am IMPRESS - this product does not leave my skin oily (even after a long day at work). It has helped me so much with the winter dryness - I will want to keep the Simple regime up for sure! Thanks Chick Advisor for the opportunity! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this moisturizer, it is light, smells fresh and actually does what it says it is going to. I have a dry nose and it is a struggle for me. This did just the trick and pairs nicely with everything else. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product as part of the Product Review Club with ChickAdvisor! I LOVE this moisturizer! It's such a nice, light, smooth, creamy texture and smells wonderful, almost like citrus! It makes my skin feel so soft afterwards, and for a breakout prone mom of one, I love that I'm seeing fewer pimples and more healthy skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. This moisturizer is perfect for medium to oily skin (not recommended for very dry skin) as the formula is very lightweight and non greasy. I like how it's unscented and doesn't irritate my skin. I use it right after a shower to put back any lost moisture into my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I got lucky to try this product free with ChickAdvisor product review club. I always had difficulty finding moisturizer that work for me. In the winter my face is dry. But I am happy to say that this product leave my skin moisturize for a long long time! The smell is great also, and you feel greasy. This moisturizer has become my favorite and will continue to use it part of my routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I am very picky about my moisturizers, I usually find them either too heavy or not 'enough'. These are a good balance in the middle. The formula is light and fresh so you don't feel greasy, but it's a great, light moisturizer for daily use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I receive this product for free through chickadviser to try and Sample Andr and review The lotion went on very slick which was nice didn't leave your skin feeling greasy it was soft the only problem I had was that the smell I can't even describe it it's not bad butt kind of like a hospital if you would understand that but overall it was great (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Very good moisturizer! Will definitely be on the lookout for it. Didn't leave my skin blotchy and my face didn't feel dry the next morning. You don't need to apply a lot to your face. Great value too. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. It left my skin feeling very moisturized and not too oily. I have combination skin and I found it suited my skin perfectly. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this for free through the Product Review Club. I am really impressed with this moisturizer! It left my skin feeling very soft and fresh and was great for my sensitive skin. As with all my moisturizers I added a few drops of tea tree oil before applying and I found that using that with the moisturizer my skin actually looked more clear! I will absolutely be purchasing this again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have pretty sensitive skin so when I comes to face creams I have to be pretty careful. This product doesn't irritate my skin and leaves my extra dry face left moisturized all day. Natural ingredients the way it should be! *Received free through chick advisor (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this moisturizer free from Chick Advisor to review. I must say this is a great moisturizer. It feels so nice and light. A small amount definitely goes a long way too. This left no greasy look or feel to my skin at all. I truly felt that my skin looked healthy and refreshed after using this. I think this is a great moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"WOW, I love this moisturizer. Within two days of use, the replenishing rich moisturizer had my skin sooo soft. It has a very light, clean smell which isn't overpowering at all. I really enjoy it as it smells fresh. It didn't leave a greasy feel and was absorbed within a minute or two! I received this product for free through chickadvisors product review club! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
this is a good product. I compared it with Vichy products and it is less greasy than the Vichy and has a fresher scent. It is a lighter feeling moisturizer which is what I prefer. I just got this product this week so I have to try it longer to see what the long term affects are. I break out easily if it's a greasy moisturizer and I haven't seen a pimple yet. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as part of the fab Chic Advisor product review club. This moisturizer is really great. I have found that it does not clog my pores at all, it is almost scentless and leaves no oily greasy residue feeling on my face after use - just the feeling of hydration. The formula feels gentle on my sensitive skin leaving it soft and hydrated. Great price point too - rivals some much more expensive brands! Will be purchasing again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried this moisturizer it didn't make my skin react negatively. I have combo skin and it didn't cause any breakouts. It's lightweight and blends easily too. It also doesn't leave your skin looking oily and there is no sticky or grease feel. I would definitely recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Even though this is called a rich moisturizer and does moisturize well, it's rather lightweight, which I loved about it. It was easy to go on and didn't irritate my sensitive skin at all. It left my skin feeling smooth and supple. I have combo skin and found that this did not leave me more oily in my t-zone :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Received this free sample from Chick Advisor to try the Simple skin care line. Love this cream, does not leave my skin feeling sticky or tacky. Did not cause any breakouts or skin irritations either. And did not make my skin oily. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I tried this product because I found it on clearance. I commend the product for using a more natural approach to skincare and how it does not contain perfumes. I may purchase it again, mostly in part because I moisturize on a regular basis. However, I didn't find that there was anything overly special about the effectiveness of the product as compared to other facial moisturizers that I have used in the past. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer is lovely. It isn't a thick formula, but also isn't too watery either. A little goes a very long way! It left my skin feeling nicely refreshed and has helped with the dryer patches I get around my chin and forehead. I so far have not had any negative reactions, and will continue to use it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Simply in love with this moisturizer. Skin felt so relieved after using it. Price is good for what it's for and what it does. Great for the sensitive skin type I am definelty going to be recommending this to people. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product for free as part of the Chickadvisor Product Review Club. Great feel on the skin. Did not leave my face oily or greasy. No scent, which is nice. I consider this a great pick for the price, considering the result I got on my skin. The ingredient list had me a little bit concerned and I would've liked more natural ingredients and less harsh chemicals. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product to try from chickadvisor however I have tried it before and really like this moisturizer. The brand simple really works for my skin since I have sensitive skin and can not have anything that irritate my skin or cause breakouts. This was moisturizing but at the same it didn't feel to greasy on my skin which was nice. It absorbed into my skin quite nicely as well. I will continue using this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product free for testing purposes for the chickadvisor review club. I LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE this product! I have very sensitive red skin and this is one of the few moisturizers out there that doesn't irritate my skin! It goes on smooth and hydrates all day, I don't feel like my skin is itchy and it helps with the dry patches I usually see/feel throughout the day. 100% a product I would repurchase! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Ok so I loved all the other products of simple skin care except this one, I have a very dry forehead and it did not moisturize enough and it got dry not an hour later, another thing is it smells gross, honestly I thought maybe it had gone bad, I put it on my face in the morning and could smell it through to noon, almost like a dirty wash cloth. I will not be using this again, however all the other products from Simple Skin care were amazing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this in the mail and tried it out instantly. I love it! It doesn't make my skin look greasy and it's not a heavy lotion like a lot of others, it goes on so easily and makes my face way to smooth. Love this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer free through the Chick Advisor Product Review Club and it is really nice that after only a couple of days of use my skin is really more hydrated! Works well! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product free through the Chick Advisor Product Review Club. This is a great moisturiser for sensitive skins. It absorbed completely into my skin, leaving it feeling nice and soft. I love that there is no smell to it and I love that it's natural. Even my hubby likes this one for his sensitive skin after shaving! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I use this moisturizer in the morning before doing my make up and wow I love it. My skin is so smooth and feels hydrated all day long. The only thing I don't like about this product is the smell ! But I like the outcome so much that I will probably be buying. I got the Simple skin care products for free (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was pleasantly surprised with this product as I was able to get the hydrating benefits I look for in a moisturizer through a moisturizer that is still light weight. I suffer from really dry skin especially in these winter months so I need something fairly hydrating although light weight so I can wear it throughout the day under my makeup, this product delivers just that. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I bought this product a few days ago because I really fell in love the with face cleansers so I figured I would love this one too. So far I think it's great on my skin and makes it super soft and doesn't make my skin oily at all BUT for some reason I just cannot stand the smell which is really depressing because I really like it but every time it's on my face I want to take it off because it smells :/ Over all a great product if you can get past the smell
"I have searched for years without success, to find products that won't burn my ultra sensitive face. I ordered the cleanser and moisturizer, tho wasn't expecting anything different. Imagine my utter shock when I used them. Not only gentle, but lovely moisture with no burning. I will never try anything else. Thank you for this wonderful line."
I actually bought this a week ago because i was in search of a new moisturizer . and i picked this one up on a whim im so glad i did i have a cobination skin so i get oily and dry . when i first used this i actually had a cold and was blowing my nose so much it was chapped and very dry i put it on that morning after taking a shower and the dryness of my nose and the chapped parts where gone . this leaves my skin soft all day im very impressed
"I bought this a couple of days ago and i dislike it a lot. It dries onto the skin too fast and after applying foundation, my skin has become terribly dry. I also used the makeup remover as well as the moisturizing cleanser. My skin has a lot of breakouts now and I regret this brand. I don't like it at all and i highly regret buying the products. IF anyone is looking for a trustworthy brand, go for Estée lauder. You will never regret their products :)."
So I have very dry skin all year long especially under my eyes and I hate it because I put concealer on and u can see my dry flakey skin under it. With this moisturizer my skin is so soft and it instantly hydrates! Never going back to anything else I love it! And it feels so good going on my skin.
"After reading every bottle on the shelf, I decided to try Simple Replenishing Rich Moisture. So happy I did! None of the junk my other face lotions have had, and it has the best, most absorbable texture of any lotion I've tried. No greasy shiny feeling, and you barely have to rub it in, it absorbs so well. Telling everyone I know about it!"
"I bought this about a month ago, and I had not realized what bad my other moisturizer was doing to my skin until I started using this one. Obviously it took a while for my skin to adjust to this moisturizer after using the other one for such a long time. But after using this for a month my skin feels AMAZING. It makes my skin so soft and not greasy. It doesn't break my out or make my face red after rubbing it in, (like the other one did) this is such a great product!"
"I have tried dozens of moisturizers and they ALL make me breakout. This is the FIRST moisture I have been able to slather on my skin and the only results are plump, soft, clear, glowing skin!! Please DO NOT change your formula. Love that it doesn't have dimethicone. Everything has it now and my skin doesn't react well to this ingredient. Love love love this product!!"
"I have been trying to find a non-greasy, light moisturizer that doesn't cause pimples on my 41 yr old face, but does the job it's supposed to do. Well, I think I have finally found MY product! NO redness, NO pimples. Just soft perfectly moisturized skin. :() Thank you, Simple!!!"
I use an acne retinoid and have very sensitive oily combination skin. This moisturizer is the best!! It never breaks me out or has ever given me any type of rash since its non comodogenic and hypoallergenic... which is hard to find. It's also veeeeery moisturizing which is perfect because the retinoid I use drys out my skin. And it doesn't make you oily!!
"I've been using the same moisturizer for 5 years now, but had to get a travel-sized moisturizer to take on a trip. I found a sample of Simple - Replenishing Rich Moisturizer buried in my closet and decided to give it a try. I love it. It goes on smooth and absorbs into my skin without leaving a greasy feeling. It keeps my skin hydrated, and I like that it does not have a fragrance. I've found my new favorite moisturizer."
I absolutely love! It's so light this is the only lotion i use on my face it's like splashing water on my face (its not that light lol) but it feels as if i just rinsed my face with water kind of & it really keeps my face moisturized all day long literally! It defiantly isn't like one of those lotions that make your face feel heavy after applying or sticky & melting off. It's just perfect i swear i never had anything like it can't wait to try other products
I love this for the winter because my oily combo skin gets dry pathches. This moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling heavy and clogged with lotion. I don't think it does anything transforming to the skin but is moisturizes just like it's sold for
"I love this product and the Simple brand. Finally I found a brand that is perfect for my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean, refreshed and soft as a baby's skin. I've tried other brands who ""claimed"" their products are gentle enough for sensitive skin and those brands had fragrances/perfumes which were too harsh for my skin and caused my face to itch/breakout. Now I know why the Simple brand are called Sensitive Skin EXPERTS. Please, never discontinue this brand!!!"
"I literally have not moisturized my face for 25 years. I have rosacea and every other product I ever tried burned immediately and then caused massive rosacea outbreak, even other products specifically made for sensitive skin. I LOVE Simple and how my face feels after using it. Best of all no burning. Not even a tingle. And no outbreaks. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"I have very dry and sensitive skin, especially in the winter. I played around with so many moisturizers and they would get the job done, but I would have to reapply during the day. This 12 hour moisturizer lives up to it's name. My skin is softer and then ever before and since using. I only apply it once in the evening and again in the morning before I apply my makeup and I have not had any red or dry patches on my face."
I received a free sample of this through a website. It works great with my acne prone skin! Most moisturizers make my skin break out more. I like that the moisturizer is not scented because when they are I usually get a sinus headache from the scent.
"I love this moisturizer! I usually can't use moisturizer because it causes me to break out more, but after I started using this my acne went away! I was scared that it would make my face too oily, but it doesn't at all. I have very sensitive, combination, acne prone skin, and this is the first moisturizer I've been able to use without getting irritated skin and breakouts from it."
"I love this stuff!!!! I have very very very dry skin anything (I have lots of allergies to things in cleaners, toners, and moisturizers) I use to clean my skin dries it out - then it looks like I have had dermal abrasion :( This puts moister back into my skin."
Leaves my face soft and silky. This is my fifth bottle.
This is one great lotion for the face. Feels great upon using it.
Effective and cheap enough! I usually apply two layers on my face after shower in winter days.
"Seems to not only mousturise but also prevents and helps with spots, I love this product so much"
My husband is very picky and he loves this moisturizer.
OMG it works so well I'm so happy I got this product
The best product yet I have purchased in a long time!!
This moisturizer is wonderful. Absorbs fast and makes the skin feel and look soft.
It makes my skin smooth and helps my breakouts! I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was referred to me by a friend a few months ago, and is by far the best one I have used yet...."
"Love it, this product makes my skin like a baby, silk skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bout this 6 months ago when I forgot mine at home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for 30 days and my dry skin is gone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does not absorb into my skin.  It just sits on top and feels heavy and sticky.  I couldn't stand the feel of it.  So I went back and bought the light moisturizer which does much better.  
I was bought this and I was really excited to try it. I do think the makes my skin feel soft but it is really runny and greasy which isn't good for my oily skin. It takes quite a while for it to sink into the skin.
"This moisturizer helped with my dry, sensitive eczema skin during winter. It helped with the healing process of my skin and helped heal dry patches. This is great because it has natural ingredients and is very affordable"
Use this morning and night all year round. This is my goto light moisturizer that i put over any serum i use. It leaves a nice hydrated feeling to my skin and not tacky. Dedinitely recommend.
This lotion is perfect for combo skin. It doesn't clog pores and doesn't make you oily but it also moisturizes very well for the dry skinned areas. Haven't bought it for a while but would definitely repurchase!
Very moisturizing and hydrating with no irritation. It's light formula leaves skin smooth and refreshed without being heavy. A great affordable moisturizer.
This is a great moisturizer! I think there is one with an spf in it. That's the one I use. But it even works as a primer for me so on light makeup days this is all I use under my foundation!
"I was very disappointed by this moisturiser. The consistency if the product is too watery. For some Thai may be okay but I prefer my creams to be quite thick. Overall, the price of the product is great but I wouldn't purchase again"
Highly recommend this. Specially during the winter. Very moisturizing so I would recommend only using a little. I have oily skin so I like using this at night because it is so moisturizing. Very good product!
"I love its smell and how easy it is to cleanse my skin, after a day full of activity and with that makeup that I kept on my skin all day, and refreshes giving me that softness in my skin"
"This face moisturizer is great for sensitive skin. Its very gentle, has no fragrance,lightweight and it does a good job moisturizing my face. This moisturizer don't irritate your skin so don't be afraid when using it."
I've been using this for years in my morning routine. It absorbs very quickly and my skin feel immediately softer and silkier. This is my HG. Love it!
Really enjoy this moisturizer. It's refreshing and love that it has SPF. I like to mix it with my full coverage foundations to make them a little less coverage and include the 15 SPF.
"My skin is very sensitive so I was excited to try this brand, like others this caused me to breakout on my forehead, cheeks and chin. Very disappointed had to stop using it."
"After I saw the great reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. This product straight up smells like mildew --so gross! I could MAYBE get passed this if my skin did not burn and itch after using this moisturizer. So disappointed..."
"I really wanted to like this moisturizer but it didn't moisturize my skin enough. After a couple of hours it felt dry. It is very light consistency and if you have oily skin I guess it would be good. But, it did nothing on my skin. Won't repurchase."
It's probably just my skin but for some reason Simple moisturizer burnt when I applied it to my skin. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it can't irritate.
"I would love to try a sample of Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer. I use Moisturizer all the time, but I haven't found one that I can actually is great."
"I use the Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer at night. Unlike other night creams, it's light on my skin, and I have no signs of dry skin on my face."
My skin likes to dry out after I'm in any kind of water. I love this product because it doesn't make me feel like I'm adding a lot of junk to my face. I get a refreshing sensation that I love with each use.
"Received a sample of this & liked it so much I chose to buy it over a much more expensive name brand moisturizer. It's very light, not greasy & gets the job done. Love it!!"
"I've been using this moisturizer for years and it's the only product I've found (after trying EVERYTHING) that's suitable for daily use and always leaves me feeling fresh-faced and hydrated all day, every day. I love Simple Skincare products!"
The lotion literally smells like a dirty dish towel that has been in the sink for over a week. Decent moisturizer but you can get the same effect from another lotion without making your face smell like trash
I purchased this moisturizer a few weeks ago in an effort to tighten my budget and stop pending $40-$70. I was more than pleasantly surprised!! This tops Bobbi Brown and Clinique!

I love this product. I am a nurse and most moisturizer feel sticky. This lotion does not it does what is says it going to do [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Simple claims on the packaging that it is a replenishing rich moisturizer. That was what I was looking for so that seemed like a good enough reason to try Simple. It feels like a serum, and I did wake up without the facial dryness I usually feel."
I will honestly say that this is the best moisturizer i've ever used. It gave an perfect glow and freshened up my dry skin. I will absolutely recommend this to all my friends.
"first felt better than other moisturizers than there is a slight burning feeling, much like I experienced years ago with proactive, is their a way I can exchange for another moisturizer to try since this one isn't the best for my skin?"
"This product makes my skin feel moisturized after I tone it. It's perfect and isn't greasy at all. As I first time user, I know I'm already in love with my skin care routine. Thank you, Simple!"
I have very dry skin all year long. I bought your Replenishing Rich Moisturizera little while back to just try it. I use it every day now. I loved it from my first application - it went on smooth and my skin felt like silk. I am going to go out and buy another bottle today and also try the eye cream. Thank you for making such a great product.
I bought this 5 days ago.i used it one night.in 30 minutes my back started to itch all over.my back was all red.i know its this because thats the only thing I added to my routine.i am going back to clinique.its more expensive but its worth the money.save your money.
"I decided to give this product a try after reading many fabulous reviews. I have super sensitive skin but it's not prone to breakouts. After three days of using this product my face was really broke out, including cystic acne on my chin. I've never had this problem in my life! It looked awful and was painful. I discontinued the product and my face cleared right up. Bummed, since it's far more affordable than my current moisturizer but just didn't work for my skin."
I bought that moisturizer it made my skin feel great and it smelled really good.
"Didn't buy, have plenty on hand,very satisfied"
Great product
Happy happy happy smooth as a baby's behind couldn't be happier

it is amazing moisturizer that as made a different
If this is the toner it is very lightweight. It isn't scented at all and reduced the appearance of pores. One of the better toners.

Not great but not bad either seems like an average shampoo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
