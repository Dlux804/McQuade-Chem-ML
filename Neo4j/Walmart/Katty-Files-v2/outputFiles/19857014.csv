penetrates skin and one application last all day. after a week can tell it lightens dark spots
SHE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE AND LIKES IT VERY MUCH!!!
Is was for my husband he got dark spots and now you can't see them
Exactly what I needed
A friend of mine told me about this product. It was recommended by a dermatologist. I started using it 5 weeks ago for an age spot on my check.. I noticed a huge difference . The spot has become a lot lighter and its almost gone ... very happy . I will continue to use it .
"No smell, no burning and you dont have to apply a lot, just like it said, thin layer. I've tried everything, home remedies, namebrands, even went to a specialist which their products burn, stink so bad and then you have to go home with a bunch of products and you dont see any difference. Porcelana worked withing 4 days for me. I'm fair skinned and have acne marks and dark spots from the sun, I even used it on my burn on my arm from cooking and see it lightning it up."
I have darkspot in my face and it doenst look good at all i got this product and for 1 week the darkspot start to fade i like this product
Both the day and night cream worked well for a week and a half but then it made me break out on my face and neck. I have sensitive skin so I'm not using again but it did help fade away some freckles.
"I have been using this but I see no results so far. I bought this because of the other good reviews, but I see no results and I don't like the smell. Used for a month now."
Porcelana cream is a very good price that works very well compared to more expensive creams. Fade stains and brightens skin very evenly. good product.
i am very happy with porcelana even in the short time i have been usin it i see a biger difference from the other product i had been using.(gee i wasted so much time and money) I am sold on porcelana. thank you so much
"This product is better than the expensive skin products that I been buy for years. I love the way my skin looks. y tone is better. I am 56 and no believe it, no lines ivy in Hampton Virginia"
"So, far so good it has a pleasant fragrance and texture, is easy to apply....I'm sure results are not instantaneous, but I'm sure with continuous use the results will be great. I'm very optimistic....."
"Still working on this one. So far, I have no complaints. Seems like a good quality product but to really rate this would take about 3-4 months to do a fair rating."
"The first time I used this product it felt smooth and had very little fragrance so I thought it was a win. However, the second time the cream becams sticky and as soon as I put the cream on my face it felt awful!"
"This cream is the best cream on the market. It fades scars. I use it on my elbows, knees, and face. I experienced hyperpigmentation by too much sun exposure however just several weeks using this cream and the dark spots faded."
"Been using for 2 weeks now. I use the night cream even in the daytime. Slight improvement. Hoping to see better results with continued usage. Unfortunately, it smells like onions."
Have been using this for months for a sun spot on my face and some darkening on my neck. IT DOES NOTHING! Don't waste your time!
Worked with a dark spot in like two uses. I would recommend this product.
Good. Works very very fast. I noticed difference in 2-3 days.
Same strength as the very expensive creams at a fraction of cost.
"This is the cheapest version of 2% quinone, the active ingredient in most effective dark spot removers, done in a nice creamy formulation. You could pay $35 for a foo foo version. OK, I'm a retired chemist.."
Pros: Works a little Great price Cons: Stinks when first applied. Very thick! It's hard to apply to my arms.
"Great product, I am happy that I purchased it!!!"
