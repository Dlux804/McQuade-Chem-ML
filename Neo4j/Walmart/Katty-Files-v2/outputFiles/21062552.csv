I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now. My skin feels so soft and silky. I'm already seeing changes in my skin tone too. I was at the grocery store and someone stopped me and said how beautiful my skin was. I'm anxious to see what this product can do after using it for 4 weeks!
"First week I saw results, I had deep wrinkles above my lips, the creases are less noticeable, I have tried other products but they did not seem to work well at all. I can see results with this, so we will give it a few more weeks. It could only get better.."
"Easy to apply, creamy not greasy. Easy to apply foundation over top. Noticed a difference in overall face within 1 wk."
"this is great-i love it,skin looks better"
"I've been using these products, including this triple power serum for about 3 years now... I am 50 & have been told repeatedly that I don't look it. I don't have wrinkles, but wanted to get some products to hopefully help in the ""natural aging"" process with keeping it away as long as I can & as much as I can. I feel these products really help with that . I do recommend & will keep on recommending."
"The serum worked great! Most moisturizers feel heavy and greasy on my skin, but this one was so light and airy, I didn't realize I used it, until about a week later when I noticed a significant difference in my skin! It's a lot smoother, softer, and much more hydrated. Highly recommended, great value for the price!"
"I have sensitive skin and like how my skin feels with this product. It is non-greasy and has not caused any breakouts, which sometimes happens with anti-aging creams. I've only used the product for about two weeks, so haven't quite noticed a reduction in wrinkles. I have however, noticed that my skin is softer so will continue to use."
"It's lightweight and refreshing! Only issue I have is the pump stopped working halfway through the bottle, had to use the pump straw to get the remaining product out."
"I find that when I use it everyday my skin reacts. My face gets some pinkish burnt-like blotches and feels sensitive. It could be allergic reaction. I have temporarily stopped using it, but will try again."
"My skin is very dry, and I didn't find this product relieved it. Adding a day cream did help though, and I noticed that I didn't have to use as much of it."
"I purchased this product last week and I am very pleased thus far! My fine forehead lines are diminishing! The lines were deeper, but I also believe staying hydrated goes along way. I would be shocked if they totally disappeared, but right now I am happy with the results. I have to get up close into the mirror to see them. I have used other products, but this product has given me an instant change!!"
"I read recently that if over 50 you should really consider a serum instead of a cream. Even though I stay out of the sun now, earlier in my life I was constantly in the sun and now have the damage. After the first use I noticed a difference. Been using for a week now and I can tell a big difference. I have a glow that is incredible. Been using on face and neck and am tempted to start using on my hands. This product is the best I've ever used.....and believe me, I've tried them all. I am a fan for life."
"Loved the product. It does smell good, makes your skin perky and smells pleasant so that you can put it on right before bed even if your boyfriend hates when you smother your face with creams. It penetrates fast & feels light. Can be worn with makeup, sunscreen & extra layer of daily cream on top. Does not break out sensitive areas. A value product."
"I have been using for a few weeks, it felt good, not greasy or heavy. Than i started to notice my pores were clogging and had to stop. I was breaking out with blackheads where i never had before. I never spend the money (kids come first) for face creams and now i have one i cant use. Disappointed....."
"I have been using this serum for about a week now and have already noticed my skin texture getting better. My skin feels more even tone than it was a week ago! This serum is very light and wont clog pores, which is always my biggest concern with products like these. Plus, Walmart has the best price!!"
"so far, in just a week, i have noticed a big difference in my skin, wrinkles disappearing and skin looks fresher and brighter! cant wait until i have used it for a month."
"I'm currently using this serum and I'm really happy with the results so far, my facial texture looks more even and smooth. The serum is light not sticky and moisturizing it has almost no scent to it and so far I haven't had any reactions"
I have been using loreal triple power serum for the past two months and I have noticed a good improvement in my skin. I use the serum first and then the triple power moisturizer with SPF20 in the morning before applying foundation.
"I have been using this for just 3 weeks and already see a difference. Less fine lines, my skin is so smooth. Product is light weight, no heavy scent, I highly recommend everyone to try it !!!"
"I'm 34 years old with extreme dry skin. I have some rinckles. I use this product daily and my face loves it, it has removed all my dry patches that I get around my face I really recommend this product!"
This product deserves an A+
1st time I've tried this product and seems to be doing a GREAT job I will continue buying it
Love how it feels and smells. Seems to do the job
great product well packed very neat fast service
"I've never had something give me a rash, but after about the fourth day of use I developed a small patch of rash like a poison ivy rash on my cheeks. I stopped using this immediately and the rash went away in about four days. Beyond that I had problems with it being too greasy and with the perfume. I just don't like my skin care to have perfume in it. However I LOVE the Revitalife Serum Intense and have gone back to using that."
"this is different from other serums; is a cream, not clear and jell like. It absorbed better rather than staying on top and feeling filmy like the others."
I love using this on my face at night. It makes face so smooth.
fast results
"This product helps with frown lines. I have tried this product for 10 days on the deep deep lines on the sides of my mouth. Little by little the area has become fuller, smoother. This definitely did what it said it's going to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this yesterday, this morning saw visible results already! I have tried so many creams to no avail and throw away full bottles of other creams tried and useless to me, this one worked so well I had to see if any more info. was available on it. Thank-you L'oreal. Dena"
"I have been using this product for about a month now, and have really seen results. The wrinkles around my eyes are still there, but not as deep. and not as many. I have lost much of the crepe paper look that I seem to have developed over the last few years. It goes on easily and my skin just seems to suck it up. I was hoping for a little better results, based on the commercials, but some improvement is better than none, and I have seen good improvement, just not the great we all hope for."
Loved it and will buy it again. feels smooth and see results
This serum really works. I use it before the moisturizer twice daily and I can see the improvement.
"Love this lotion for my face. I'm a ""mature"" woman who needs LOTS of moisture. Love this under makeup."
This product truely works. I had gotten a sample and loved it. Got it for free to try and it had helped my eyes pop and wrinkles to fade [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved a 5 day sample of the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum. I'm giving it a 5 star rating! I think this really works at making the skin tighter
"I've only been using this product for a week, and my skin feels and looks smoother already. I bought it because the store was out of my Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle Repair. Lucky me! This is even better! Thank you L'Oreal for another great product."
"My skin felt and looked better after only a few days, the serum is easy to apply with the pump dispersing the right amount. I also appreciated the packaging being great. Not greays, spreads easily and lightweight. My skin feels so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I have always used moisturizer, Serum is a new thing for me. I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and was pleasantly surprised with the product. First, I noticed that it has a soft scent which was very relaxing. It also felt very light. The best part is that moments after applying it to my face, I couldn't feel it- It totally absorbs. My skin seemed brighter and more healthy than when I use moisturizer alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this serum because it was light and absorbed quickly. I hate putting on too many face creams in the morning because I'm in a rush and just want to get my makeup on, so I loved that this one seemed to absorb quickly but left skin super soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little uncertain before I received the actual system. Now, I am excited to use the serum because I am still young (33), but I am getting older. I know that it is important to keep healthy and young looking skin. I plan to used the RevitaLift Triple Concentrated Facial Serum weekly as a part of my new routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely loved the results I got from this serum. I can't say enough. After just a couple weeks I had noticeable results around my eyes and mouth. I loved the smell and the texture was very silky. It seeped into my face without a greasy feeling and dried nicely in just a few minutes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just as the title suggests, this everyday serum took me by surprise. I had my doubts when I tried it, but after using it every morning and night for over three weeks now, I can honestly tell a difference in my skin! It's definitely smoother & more moisturized. Maybe even a little brighter too! Also, I love that it absorbs quickly - that's a big positive for me! I will definitely continue to use this product in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift lifts, makes skin look nicer and more elastic and younger looking. It feels so nice and light to wear and any left on my lands is massaged into my cuticles. I feel and look younger and that's what makes me happy. Wonderful and highly recommended. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and I did not like it. It left my face feeling very oily and greasy and it didn't seem to soak into my skin as time went on. I have very sensitive skin and I am not able to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My absolute favorite thing about this product was the thickness of the lotion. For someone with serious patches of dryness, this moisturizer took care of business. It absorbed quickly and worked well. The two negatives might be that it is a bit heavy and it smells a bit chemically. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this serum for just a few weeks and I am amazed at the results I've had. It absorbs easily, not at all greasy and my wrinkles have diminished quite a bit. I LOVE this stuff and will most certainly purchase and continue using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this is one of the best products that ove used over the counter. My forehead wrinkles have minimized already! I get botox twice a year, but I think this will make my trips once per year! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and my skin has improved drastically. It leaves my skin feeling uber moisturized and incredibly soft like a baby butt lol. I have noticed my skin has feel firmer and smoother. Combined with the revitalift deep action moisturizer and triple power facial day lotion with spf 20 you have a triple power house. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have oily skin and I'm over 50 years of age. I have tried everything and don't expect any of them to work, but LOreal actually did a good job. I love the serum. I've only been using these products for a short time, but my face feels tighter and the dark spots are fading. This is not an over night miracle, but if you use it twice a day like LOreal states for you to do, I believe you will see a difference in your skin. I will continue to use these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and was hoping it would be wonderful - I have been suffering from dry skin and was on the market for a new treatment. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I tried the cream for several days and began experiencing painful breakouts - despite my dry skin remaining. It has been itchy and red ever since. I wasn't a fan of the scent either... it reminded me of my grandma's house. Will be looking for something different. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using L'Oréal revitalift triple power serum for the past 2 weeks. It has a pleasant perfumey smell that's not too strong. I like the way it feels under my makeup. I don't feel I've seen much in results but think it needs more time. I'll continue using it for now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the product. Not heavy and absorbs quickly. Noticeable difference in only about 2weeks. Skin is smoother and feels very soft. Only gave 4 of 5 stars because not me but some may feel and be bothered by the smell of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used L'Oreal Paris Rivitalift triple power Faisal serum for the past two weeks and the results were great! I can already see a reduction in those fine lines on my forehead and smile lines. My pores seem smaller and acne scars smoother. I am very pleased with the product and will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'Oreal revitalift serum is really good. I have noticed a big difference on my fine lines and the overall texture of my face. My dark spots also seem to be fading. The serum isn't greasy and is definitely worth the price. Works as well as some high end serums. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was easily able to look on their website to learn more about the ingredients. The first day I tried a small amount on my forehead. It had almost no scent and smoothed on nicely. Since my skin felt no irritation at all I use it on my whole face and neck daily. It's very moisturizing and is perfect for the dry winter skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for the last few weeks and it continues to impress me. I suffer from very dry itchy skin but since I started applying this serum and moisturizer every morning and every night my skin has felt amazingly smooth and hydrated. I really enjoy using this product and will continue to use and recommend to others that suffer from dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I give this product 4 stars, because although it wasn't right for my skin type, it definitely doors is job in deep moisturizing, and smells great. My skin does not need moisturized, so it made my skin feel overly moisturized. If you have a need for an excellent face moisturizer, I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found this serum to be so smooth and silky and makes you feel like that too! Goes on so easy only need a small amount also. Waited to review after using for 10 days but could have done it in less it works quickly. Really makes your skin feel like silk. Also easy dispensing which is critical to me.

"I was naive to try L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum because i didnt believe i had wrinkles. Well. I was wrong, because i have noticed so much difference. I applied it to my ""problem"" areas in the evening after washing my face. then after a few weeks now i have most definitely seen improvement of my fine lines. maybe i can keep saying im 29 for a few more years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not a person who has ever tried a serum before. I am always worried that my face would feel too oily, however, I did not find that to be the case. I have used this for about two weeks, and have noticed a slight difference around my eyes. I do have good skin on my face, so I am not sure if this product is necessary for me, but I feel that I am helping my skin by using this! I enjoy it and love the smell and would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my second review of this product, as I've now been using it for a month, and I love it! It smells so good, and goes on so easily and soaks right into my skin. My skin feels so smooth and has brightened right up.it just feels so good as it soaks into my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not only is my skin sensitive, it is also oily. L'Oreals RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum made my skin softer and even helped with making my skin tone more even. My face didn't break out and it never made my face look greasy. This is perfect for people with oily skin. A must try for anyone that wants younger, brighter skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift triple power concentrated facial serum for just over 2 weeks. I liked that it did not feel greasy after applying. It easily absorbed into my skin. I liked the smell. I have yet to notice younger and firmer skin. We are our worst critic but I do hope to see better results in the upcoming weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this serum under the deep acting facial moisturizer. I love these RevitaLift products as they are not oily or heavily scented. This is a nice serum. It layers nice with the moisturizer and doesn't add heaviness even with makeup on top. I have really been impressed with how my skin is feeling with these products. My skin feels plumper, soft and the texture is even smoother. Will definitely continue use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this product is one that is a new style of product to me that is not heavy or oily it is light and pleasant and a little goes on with ease I did not have any problem with dispensing the product and the scent was not over bearing an it was a great help with some fine lines and it applied easy and was absorbed well into the skin - loved it will continue to use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the concentrated serum treatment. I have noticed that the crows feet around my eyes are less noticeable. The wrinkles around my mouth are not noticeable at all anymore. L'Oreal Paris Concentrated Serum treatment is light weight, and did not clog my pores so I used it in the mornings, and before I went to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this serum is great for using all alone, it leaves my face looking and feeling moisturized and taut. It is not as heavy or intrusive as other serums I've tried. If you are sensitive to scents this product may be a little too much though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well I really liked this product! I was little skeptical at first because for one my face is very sensitive & I always look at the ingredients first, check out reviews for the product & also check out their site before I try it out but overall I had nothing but great things to say about the this product. I didn't break out and I've been using it for about 3 weeks now. My face feels a lot smoother and not oily so overall I give this product 5 stars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this treatment. It makes my face feel so smooth and soft. I do only use it about 3 times a week because I do tend to break out in a little acne (very little) if I use it every day. I have normal type skin. This is not an oily product and you only use very little for an entire face and neck. Little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the concentrated serum and it did make my face feel a but firmer. I used it both day and night. It felt a bit thick and I had to wait a bit before adding the moisturiser so it would sink into my skin. I disliked the consistency and the smell of the products. I currently use Mary Kay and it isn't as heavy if a product and smells mic better. TR hr results were good though. It did firm the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product far surpasses what it even claims to do. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and there is a noticeable difference. My skin is so much smoother and has a better overall appearance in general. I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of product. Be sure and let it thoroughly dry before applying make up, though. It has a kinda greasy feel until it's dry! Overall, though, I LOVE IT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Serum is a must have! It compliments well with the moisturizer and only strengthens the results. I've had a scar on my forehead for years and I've noticed it diminishing since I've been using the Serum . The smell is wonderful and it absorbs into my skin and makes it silky smooth. I am going to continue to use these products in my everyday skincare routine, And so should you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum feels like a treat on the skin. Many serums are translucent and sink into the skin as soon as you apply them, making it difficult to apply them evenly. This serum is creamy in consistency, plus it's opaque, and it feels moisturizing and has good slip, meaning it's easy to spread over the face. A little goes a long way. My dry skin is VERY happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found the serum to be moisturizing. But I felt that it was heavy. I like a lighter serum. It felt heavy going on going on but when it soaked in my face didn't feel too heavy. I wasn't a fan of the scent either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the products a few weeks now. During the first week I started to notice a difference in the way my skin feels. There's no over powering smell and it goes on smooth. The only thing I don't like is it leaves a slight film. Meaning if you rub your skin, it rubs off a little. I'm not sure if it neds to dry longer or what. But overall I like it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this serum for a few weeks and I am thrilled with the results. My skin feels soft and overall texture has improved greatly. I feel like my face looks brighter and youthful. My foundation goes on smoothly and looks flawless. It does have a faint fragrance but it's light and appealing. The price is very affordable and I would wholeheartedly recommend this product to all women. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like L'Oreal products and this is no exception. It's a nice serum that is lightweight yet effective and it's also affordable. I feel like my skin looks healthier and glows more from using this serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is ultra silky. The first time I put in on, I couldnt believe how smooth my skin felt. It doesnt leave a greasy feel either. i tend to use this as a base in my moisture regimen, before my night cream or my day cream and make up. Nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first opened this bottle I noticed the smell right off. It has a very nice fragrance. I tried the serum for about 3 weeks, using it everyday on my face especially around my eyes. I do not have alot of wrinkles and after about 3 weeks time I did not notice a difference on the wrinkles that I did haven. I think that if maybe I had more wrinkles, I might have noticed a bigger difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like this product although not sure if I have noticed any differences. I am a little older so I have a few wrinkles, not sure I would call them fine lines, but I haven't noticed anything disappearing. It is very smooth. I would like fragrance not to be as strong. I will continue to use for a while to see if I notice any changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Good consistency in the creams, they are not greasy, they are absorbed fast, it keeps the skin moisturized, it needs a little more sunscreen, it is not for me because it irritated my skin reddened and it made me itch, thanks for allowing me to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this serum, although I am not entirely sure what it really does. It goes on very smoothly and has a pleasant scent. I have been using it under both moisturizers. It definitely makes my skin feel smoother when I put it on, so I would recommend that it is a fine product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
my mom is using them and she really seems to like them shes always wanted to try loreal but they are expesive wee like products that you can try before you buy instead of wasting your my on something that doesn't work [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin did not take too well to this moisturizer. My skin is naturally oily and sometimes adding a heavy moisturizer makes it look like an oil slick. We had some change in weather and my skin dried out a little, so using the moisturizer then was nice. I would recommend it for people who don't get oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the triple power concentrator is the step out of all 3 that really makes a difference. I have tried all 3 and have loved them all. This one has a pleasant smell and you don't have to use a tin of it a little goes a long way. I also love the fact that it's not greasy feeling on my skin. I have sensitive skin and had no issues with any of theses three products which is a plus for me and maybe many of you who end up with skin irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this serum, mainly because I saw results! My skin looks brighter and more even. I have tried a few serums in the past but quit using them because they felt sticky on my skin or smelled bad. This was not sticky at all and it dried and absorbed fast. Not much of a smell. This along with the moisturizer and SPF lotion work great together as an easy daily skin regiment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not sure exactly if this product helped, but I felt special using it. It has this wonderful shiny, glittery base. You only needed a little to spread all over. Afterwards, though, my face felt wet and greasy. I am not due if it was from this or the moisturizer over it. I didn't tend to want to use them all 2 times a day. I did not see any changes after 2 weeks of almost daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the L'oreal Paris revitalift triple power serum. I used this in the mornings and noticed that fine lines near my eyes were harder to see. It went on well with just a little bit of a greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is amazing! You don't need much to spread over your entire face. It smells great and it has made my skin much more soft. I see some improvements in the appearance of my pores and fine lines and this product has an additional benefit (SCORE!) of making my face less greasy throughout the day.

I have been using this for a week now and notice a difference in my complexion already. The serum is easily absorbed by my skin and my skin is smooth and soft. Still waiting to see if the dark spots dismiss any [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did notice some slight changes after using it a couple of weeks. It's non-greasy and makes my skin glow and feel soft. I will continue using the product as directed and see what happens after a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the RevitaLift Facial Serum treatment. It was light and moisturizing at the same time. I didn't feel like it clogged my pores and left my face feeling smooth and ready for the moisturizer. Also, I absolutely adored the fragrance. It was very refreshing. I would highly recommend this product to others. It feels like a treat to pamper my skin with! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in my 30s with very sensitive skin which is prone to dryness - especially this time of year. L'Oreal's serum is a great first layer followed by the facial moisturizer. It works well on its own or coupled with the moisturizer. I love the light feel, and I like the subtle glow my skin has when using it. The scent is light without being overpowering. I'll definitely continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for two weeks and I can see and feel a difference. The box and the bottle are true to size. There is not a false bottom making it look like you are getting more than you are. You only need a little bit of this serum to cover your whole face and neck. It is not greasy or oily and feels wonderful on. Light weight but heavily powerful and silky on your sink. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing! It has hyaluronic Acid to repair wrinkles, it plumps, volumes', smooth's & evens skin to make your skin smoother and even skin tones in rapid time! I've been using it for 3 weeks and have noticed such a difference. I don't have a lot of wrinkles so I can't speak for that aspect of the product claims but my skin tone is much move even and I can't stop touching my face because it's so smooth & soft!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The facial Serum treatment was an excellent product. I loved the smell and feel of it. It wasn't greasy at all. Used with the other Triple Power products makes it work better. I would buy and use this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oréal Revitalift serum is fantastic! Just a small pump goes a long way, which ensures that this product will last! I have used it for about two weeks, concentrating on the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. It feels great, smells great, and really has a soothing quality to it. I would be quick to recommend it to someone looking to help rejuvenate their skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this product is amazing! Once I started using it daily my skin began to look so much better. Used along with other L'Oreal products, the wrinkles around my eyes faded and my skin became much softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The texture is what sold me on this Facial Serum Treatment. It was so smooth and creamy. I am so used to trying oily or watery serums. I saw a small difference but it was used such a short period. I think it made my skin look and feel beautiful. It will definitely keep this in my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great lightweight moisturizing serum. Apply before the daytime moisturizer and it provides all day skin comfort. I have used this product for 2 weeks and I have noticed a more even skin tone with subtle tightening of the skin. This does have some light reflecting particles in it that I did not care for. Overall this is a great product and I would recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so glad I was able to review L'Oreal revitalift. The fist thing I noticed is the beautiful Red bottles. They look rich and they just shine on my bathroom counter. The first product I used was the serum. It went on so smooth and it didnt take very much to cover my face. It felt so rich and my skin just drank it in. I feel it is a very good product that will help soften my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After almost trying it for a month, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power became my favorite face and neck daily routine.. Felt the differnece day after day, shinny soft and smoother face and neck.. kept doing it morning and night and had found perfect result .. even I don't wear makeup when I am in hurry because I felt how is my face shines and smells nice .. Will definitely recommend, love it and already had my friends used it and love it too.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for two weeks and I love it. For me, it has worked better than any other product I have tried before. My skin's texture has really improved and and my face looks brighter and more youthful. I will using it all the time for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how the product is very lightly textured. It's not a heavy, greasy, thick product that makes you feel all 'gunked up'. After you've applied it, you don't have the feeling that your face is weighted down. Also, there is very little fragrance, just a light, barely there scent--nothing to clash with any perfume you wear. It smooths easily over your face and neck, it doesn't drag. A good first step each morning and at night getting ready for bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is a great start to a daily facial cleansing regiment. It was easy to use and I began to notice a difference in the appearance of my skin after only two weeks of using this product. My skin is softer and has a more radiant glow to it upon consistent use of this product. I will continue using it on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'Oreal RevitaLift serum is awesome! I have only had two weeks and I can already see the difference in my skin. It has gotten smoother! I use it in the morning and in the evening. I use it underneath my makeup and it does not disturb my makeup at all! All I can say is that I'm extremely pleased with the serum and I am 100% sure that I will never use a different product! I am in love with this product and I think you will be too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for two weeks now. My skin feels so smooth! My fine lines and wrinkles are less visible. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment has a pleasant scent that isn't overwhelming. Overall I would buy L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment again. My skin is soft and smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am using the revitalift loreal serum and I absolutely love it. Sence using it my face feels softer and looks more vibrant. Before buying it is would want to know if it helps in any way... I can definitely say I can see a difference and I would keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pretty skeptical about using this serum seems others I've used didn't do anything. This particular product really gave me noticeable, smooth skin. It is extremely creamy and left my face incredibly smooth. After a couple days I didn't even feel the need to have to put any make up on because my skin felt and looked radiant. Definitely recommend this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit skeptical since trying other similar products even by L'Oreal. This Serum it richly smooth yet not too heavy and doesn't leave a caked on feeling. I have major face spots on my cheeks and after one week I can tell it is toning it down, or making it more even. This may not matter to some, but the styling, shape, color and cool soft steely feeling of the bottle is appealing to me. It's an expensive feel that ""says"" I'm a worthwhile product, not in a cheap plastic container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the L'Oreal serum every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. It helps to smooth out my skin on my cheeks. It also diminishes the tired look by my eyes. It does not get rid of any dark circles but it does help the skin to look young to help battle that. I have noticed that my crows feet by my eyes are not as bad either which is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this serum. It goes on with a very lightweight smooth texture. IT leaves my skin feeling really soft, and not greasy at all. I've been using it for a few weeks now and my skin is much softer and revitalized. I can't say much about any fine lines as I'm not there yet, but I would imagine it would have some effect. Definitely worth checking out if your skin needs moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment is youth in a bottle. My skin looks a bit plumper. Crows feet that had extended to my temples, are now only visible on one temple. Thinking maybe the lines are finer on one side. Quite a strong fragrance. Worrisome upon application. Dissapates in a few minutes if applied liberally. Lines and small bags on upper cheeks from allergies, vanished in 13 days. My face has become thirsty for this serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this product as cooler weather came in my skin got dry and cracked. The moisturizing in this product was amazing my skin feels soft and smooth again. It's so easy to use and I could see and feel a difference immediately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal Paris revitalift triple action works wonders. I've never tried a product that works as well and as quick as this product. I began to see results in just 5 days. My skin looks more youthful and glowing since I've incorporated this product in my skin care regime. I highly suggest you give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. It has made my skin look so youthful and vibrant that I've been getting countless compliments. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a user of more higher end skincare so I went into this with not so high expectations. With the few days that I have been using...I am noticed a few positive changes with my skin. I think it is great to offer something like this in the drugstore because not everyone can afford expensive products. My skin is pretty sensitive but I did not see any adverse reactions. Looking forward to seeing how well these products will fare in the next few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very pleased with the results from the L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. After the first use I noticed an improvement in the color and texture of my skin. The facial serum has a nice texture that doesn't feel heavy. I have used it every day for two weeks and am even more impressed with my results. I would recommend this product to anyone that is concerned with fine lines or uneven skin tones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this serum treatment because the day after I put it on, I saw visible results. My skin quality was smooth, looked even, and felt fresh. I would definitly buy this product again. Amazing results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the way L'Oréal concentrated serum feels going on my face!!!Felt like silk,not greasy and heavy.I honestly could see a difference in fine lines on my face after only a few days...Definitely recommend any woman to give this product a try....You won't regret it:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for 3 weeks now, and can honestly say it does really work if you have fine lines. I did see only a slight improvement in deeper set wrinkles. I found the product is not greasy, and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to counteract the aging process. I will be a continuing customer for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum was like applying soft butter on my face. It was so smooth and the smell was great! I used the serum under the moistizer and my face was never hot. Using these both made me glow. I will continue using these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 46 year old with wrinkles around my eyes and smile area. I have been using it now for 2 weeks and I love how it has softened the appearance of my lines both around my eyes and mouth! It smells fresh and is not greasy! I have been applying morning and at night! I would recommend this product to all different kind of skin problem areas from aging! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only had the product for a little over a week and love what I have seen so far. The smell is a nice, but a little powerful. My frown lines and laugh lines are diminishing and my face tingles when I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this serum and unfortunately, my sensitive skin instantly broke out! THis product is not for me, but I can say the texture is perfect and it made my skin feel soft and velvety. I'm sure others will have great luck! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first started using this it felt nice. It went on and rubbed in nicely. I have sensitive dry skin, yet becomes oily as the day goes on. It's a weird,annoying skin type. I found though it seemed like it would work great for me, as the day went on, my face became much more oily feeling. With my skin being sensitive it actually made my face break out and burned my eyes. It may be a great moisturizer for some but for me, it wasn't beneficial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really look forward to using this as part of my night-time routine. This lightweight serum has a silky feel and absorbs so quickly. I do not have dry skin so that is very important. I think all skin types can use this. My skin feels baby soft after putting this on. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the Revitalift serum for about 4 weeks. When I first tried it, my skin tingled and felt incredibly soft and smooth. I have used this product 2x a day under the Revitalift day lotion and Triple Power cream. I have noticed a reduction in spots and lines around my mouth appear smoother. I also have noticed that my skin looks more vibrant. I really love this product! I just wish it worked a little better on deeper lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this serum works wonders! Makes skin look luminous and younger. Love it. It feels light, skin feels firmer and hydrated. My skin was immediately more radiant and soon my tone was more even and balanced looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was looking for a new line of products to use as I was using another line. When I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, I LOVED it!! It is so rich feeling and my skin soaks it up and feels luxurious!!! I feel that my skin feels pampered while using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this product and will be purchasing more today. The smell, like all Loreal products, is amazing. It feels wonderful on your skin. And one week into using it, I had people asking me what I was doing different because my skin looked better than it ever had! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Holy smokes, I've been using this serum for 2 weeks and the difference in my skin from then until now is crazy! My scars are even fading out, and my redness has gone down! I knew that it wasn't just me thinking it was helping and tightening, when my husband made a comment about how pretty I looked when I woke up the other morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is good. I like the way it smells, It is not over powering. It is a little oily so I did not apply it to my chin which is a problem anyway. This product is light and smoth and easy to apply. My friends said they noticed a few of my lines around my eyes had disappeared and I noticed a dark spot on my cheeck had lightened up. I recommended it to my friends and they are gonna try it and let me know what they think. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was amazing and they work awesome together. I've tried so many things and they never work but I used this as directed and I was not disappointed in just two weeks I started to see and feel the change in my skin. I will definitely continue to use these products and definitely encourage my friends and family to do so as well!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My experience with the L'Oreal Paris revitalift Triple Power concentrated facial serum treatments was mostly positive. However initially the scent was a bit off-putting I found that the scent quickly dissipated. This product left my skin feeling moist soft and silky smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying this product for some time, I will continue to use it however I've not really seen any results so far. The scent is nice however I feel it leaves a bit of a residue feeling on my face and it definitely is not made for active women as I feel it sweating out with the slightest bit of activity. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I must have had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients or the fragrance because I started breaking out almost immediately after using it. I used mostly the serum and deep-acting moisturizer but would switch to the day lotion if I was going to be outside a lot. I really wanted to enjoy the benefits of revitalized skin but only noticed blemishes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a wonderful product! My face is much brighter & smoother after a couple of weeks of use. I don't have wrinkles yet, but prevention is the best method. Its easy to apply, goes on smoothly. I'm not crazy about the scent, its a bit perfumed, but it is not overwhelming. It feels like velvet on my skin and its not greasy. I have oily skin so I'm glad that it doesn't increase my oilyness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin has never felt better. I use the concentrated serum every morning and every night along with the day lotion and the Deep moisturizer. My skin feels extremely soft and I have noticed after a few weeks of daily use that my skin on my face and neck are becoming tighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed the opportunity to try L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment (1.0 oz) It was really easy to use and the serum was non-greasy. The product also improved my skin texture and the results were noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a 46 year old woman, and my skin has starting to catch up in the past couple years. I'm constantly looking for age-fighting products that I don't have to get a second mortgage to purchase. I love the L'Oreal Paris serum! I've been using it on my face and neck for about 3 weeks, and I'm starting to see a difference. Also, I have extremely sensitive, allergy prone skin, and this product doesn't cause any reaction! I am sold! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never really took care of myself, and never used anything like this before. The serum is really good! I could tell a difference within a few days. As soon as you put it on, you can feel it working, tightening up your skin. It took me a few applications to get used to that feeling, but it's worth it. As I've said you can tell the difference in your skin in days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The serum product itself is a nice product as a facial moisturizer. It was smooth, non-greasy and absorbed well. The smell was a bit too perfume'y to me. Not horrible, but not a ""fresh"" scent either. I can't say that the appearance of my skin changed in any way that I noticed. I did not have any adverse effects such as rash or allergic reactions. This is good as I do have fairly sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! The scent is stronger than I usually use for facial products, but I love it. I used this immediately after washing my face in the morning and evening. It made my face feel so fresh and clean and so soft. I definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this serum, my skin has never looked better! I put it on each night and wake up looking younger and refreshed! It feels great on my skin too, smooth! No stickiness or burning. My skin looks more even and my spots have evened out! I would definitely recommend this product! I am noticing less wrinkles too, and smooth, supple skin! This gives wrinkles a 1-2 punch! So amazing! My skin looks great without foundation! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In trying the L'Oriel Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisterizer I was pleasantly surprised in the smell. It feels light on my fingers but I think I put too much on the first few times so I now only put very tiny amounts on my face. If you put too much your face feels very wet and I really did not like that. I have seen slight lightening of dark spots but I like the way my face feels after using this product a while [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This combined with the triple power deep acting moisturizer have totally turned my skin around. I have sensitive skin and it didn't irritate it at all. In fact it has taken my dry skin and it made it soft and moisturized. Makes my skin look and feel younger!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this stuff! I use to buy expensive facial products bc they were the only thing that didnt dry me out! The loreal revitalift produvts i recieved have gotten my skin feeling awesome and ive been telling tons of people about it. My aunt,mother,and grandmother are super intrested to try it! And also the smell is great not too strong but enough fragrence to fwel clean when your putting it on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment was amazing! It felt really light on my skin and sunk in very quickly. A little goes a long way! I would definitely repurchase this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to say I am overly impressed with L'Oreals concentrate serum. I've been using the serum for over a month and my skin is so smooth and flawless, it is perfect!! Lightweight but super moisturizing, and it smells amazing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the serum treatment has such a nice light scent to it. It feels like silk between your fingers. I have noticed a difference within a week that the few lines forming around my eyes were diminishing and skins elasticity had come back. What a difference with using the serum morning and night. The cost I very reasonable compared to some of the your other high end eye serums. My skin's overall appearance is much smoother and more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment might be the greatest thing in the world, but I will never know because I can't keep it on my face for more than 10 minutes. This serum has so much perfume in it that I had to wash it off my face in order to avoid getting sick. It gave me a terrible headache for hours afterward, and I'm not even typically sensitive to smells! I would suggest L'Oreal try using a drop of fragrance instead of a dropper full. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. After about a week I was really able to feel and see the smoothness in my skin. I don't have many wrinkles so I couldn't tell the difference with that. But, the product brightened my skin as well. I will definitely recommend every woman to give it a try. The scent is mild and serum is light weight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a serum that would go on light under my moisturizer. This serum made my face super smooth & after a week of usage, I really felt like my skin was less inflamed, & really brightened it up!! I let my mom use the product for a few days & she didn't want to give it back. Thanks L'Oreal for creating another great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product makes you feel special from the beautiful packaging to the amazing product inside. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment goes on so light and smooth. The pump gives you the right amount and leaves your skin feeling beautifully smooth and pretty. Love the light fragrance, none greasy and fast absorbing qualities of this product. Would definitely buy and highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my first time using a wrinkle serum so I was apprehensive. After a week of usage, I have to say that I am very impressed. My skin has fewer wrinkles near my eyes and chin. This product is a must have for women on the go who have fine lines that they would like to get rid of quickly. This product is easy to use, lightweight, non-greasy, and very effective from what I can see. I will continue to use this product daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way L'Oreal's Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum makes my face feel smooth and firm. Especially on my forehead which is my ""problem"" area (wrinkles). I have headaches all the time so I scrunch my forehead. The reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the scent. I am sensitive to smells and the scent is kind of strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is definitely a step in the right direction for loreal. Never before has the drugstore offered such an impressive collection of skincare that everyone can afford. I cant wait to see what they come up with next! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is amazing I've used this product and i can already see the wrinkles around my eyes smoothing out. This smells really good. The scent is not strong at all. I see my skin looking more refreshed, smoother and soft. My skin looks so much healthier. I'm really enjoying this product. It does not irritate my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum absorbs quickly cutting down on wait time before applying my night time moisturizer. It dispenses in just the right amount from the bottle so no waste. I have been using this for a little over two weeks and I do see a difference in all but my deepest wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using their product along with day and night cream for two weeks. It had decreased my forehead line bit has not helped my eye lines. Think I'm going to add an eye cream to the mix and see what happens. It has not made my skin oily like past products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the serum for 2 weeks and it seems to do its job. It goes on before the moisturizer to help moisturize the skin. The serum has a sheen to it that looks like tiny bits of glider but they are hardly noticeable. It goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for roughly 2 weeks now and I love it! The serum is a great texture, does not leave my face feeling greasy, and smells great too. I would definitely recommend this product...well actually I already have! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the way the serum smelled and how easy it was to distribute all over my face with one small pump. It didn't feel greasy and seemed to absorb well. I noticed the longer I used it, the smoother my face felt. I didn't see a big change in my skin tone but was only trying it for 3 1/2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i have only been using all three products for about a week now so probably not enough time to see major results. After the first use I thought my skin looked really red but after that it was fine. I have always wanted to try the Loreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power so I am excited about using them. I will definitley report back when I have used them for a couple of months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As of now I honestly don't think it would be fair for me to say it simply doesn't work, as I am quite dark-skinned & it seems that creams claiming to fade, if they are going to work need much more time than advertised...and I'm probably only 8 or so days in with this product. Because it smells wonderfully and it's lightweight...I'm confidently rating it with 3stars. My face tho maturing is quite youthful, therefore as of now at not quite 40, I have no noticeable wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum is so awesome. I have been using it every day under my daily moisturizer to help my eye lines less noticeable. After a few weeks of doing so, I can say that I believe my eyes are looking better. The lines are less dry and less noticeable. I am 46 years old, so at my age, I really want to look a lot younger, and with this product, I do see the results that I want! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really really really loved this serum! Evens out my skin tone, helped to reduce the tiny lines around my eyes and left my skin feeling unbelievably soft and smooth. Not sure how I survived before using this. I love the way my skin looks brighter with that lit from within glow- most days I hardly wear make-up...that's how good this is! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off I gave it 3 stars because in 3 wks of use it had just slightly softened the lines on my forehead but it has done wonders on the size of the pores on my face and evened out my complexion , made the skin super smooth and mostirized . I'm going to keep using to see if it helps the lines on my forehead , a little bit of product goes a long way I made the mistake the first time of applying and it felt so heavy on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After about 2 weeks of using it it's still really holding up as a great product! I can't say I've seen a noticeable decrease in fine lines, but the fact that my skin looks so good and clean overall makes it still a great investment product. The deep acting face moisturizer I use at night and it's a little thick, but if you're out in the cold, or your skin is dry it's an awesome way to keep your skin fresh.

I am young with mature skin. Fine lines under my eyes are a no go for me. We aren't best friends lol. I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for over 2 weeks. My lines haven't diminshed completelt but I did notice they aren't as deep. So with a few extra weeks to use this helpful product I will give another review. So far so good!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment now for over two weeks and I'm so impressed. I use this product every morning and again after I get off work and wash off my makeup. It doesn't leave a greasy residue like some of the other products I've tried and my skin is positively radient. I've been told that I don't look so tired anymore. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the RevitaLift Triple Power Serum for a few weeks now. My results were pretty quick, this product goes on so smooth and just softened my forehead head lines almost immediately. At 53 they are not deep but definitely there. Also love the light scent and fact that my sensitive skin is not irritated by this serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to be honest, I've never tried any L'Oreal products. The RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is wonderful! My skin has a glow to it after using it. It's moisturizing and so smooth on my skin. I'm definitely impressed. I haven't noticed a drastic improvement on fine lines yet, but my skin is definitely brighter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to try this product and I was not disappointed! It minimized all of my fine lines even helped to evenout my skin tone! Not greasy or heavy like similar products. I feel confident and happy after using it. So glad I got to try this out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was worried about using all three products, since I've had allergic reactions before. But, these were all very nice. My skin feels softer, more hydrated and looks much better after using for three weeks. I was really hoping it would help more with reducing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was my least favorite of the 3 products that I tried. It's rather thin so I never felt that the product absorbed into my skin and I used for two weeks without noticing any significant changes to my skin's appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Being naturally skeptical I had to look twice at my face after several days of using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. I can actually see my skin softening and my skin tone becoming more even. I red up quickly and I can tell I am not doing that as much. I am very anxious to keep using it and see how I look after a month. I can't wait!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. It has a really nice light citrus/floral fragrance and does not feel oily. This serum absorbs quickly into my skin and immediately leaves my face and neck looking younger and feeling tighter. My pores appear smaller and my skin feels so soft. My skins has a tighter and overall healthier complexion after applying this product. I would recommend using this with the the Revitalift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this moisturizer does just what it claims to do! Makes my skin tone seem a little ""brighter"" which is not easy in this dark MI weather!! And it also is making my face feel a bit smoother, while tightening up at the same time. I also enjoy the ""natural"" smell & ease of application! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved trying this facial serum treatment. I have been one to never try any serums before on my face, but this product made me completely change that! It felt light and smooth on my face. My face didn't feel oily or greasy, like I expected it to be because it's a serum, and the fragrance was really pleasant as well! I enjoyed using this and will continue to use this in the near future! Definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a product that I will continue to use. I hesitate to purchase new products for fear they won't work. This serum is light and smooth on my skin. It makes it so easy to apply. Even though I've only been able to use it for a couple weeks, I see a noticeable difference in my skin. My skin tone is more even. My skin is softer and smoother. There is a definite reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I would strongly recommend L'Oreal's products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a facial serum that didn't make my face feel oily, puckered or slimy. L'Oreal's Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment didn't make my face feeling like anything of the others I tried this past year. The lightweight serum was dispensed like a lotion, which I really liked because it was not running off my fingers. Where I noticed the greatest difference was how it minimized my large pores on my nose and chin. A definite item on my future shopping list! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is amazing , I'm 31 and already I've had some wrinkles appear under my eyes ""sad face"" but after using this product they have reduced significantly.... I apply everyone morning and night before bed! I had some doubts at first but that's no more ... I will definitely keep using this product... It keeps my face feeling very soft and smooth. My makeup actually sits better on my face after using this product.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the fragrance is nice, it is very overpowering. Within minutes of applying, I had to wash my face... twice... and the scent still lingered in my nose. The positive, my skin did feel softer after washing it off. I will pass these products on to someone who may be less sensitive to the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this treatment for a week i could see the diference in my skin, my face is soft and looks really nice and healthy, i had really marked ""chicken legs"" in the side of my eyes and this really worked those out! Really recomend and does not feel heavy at all you don't even notice you put cream on your face and i have very sensitive skin and did not have problems using this treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a nice light feeling on my skin. It is pleasantly and lightly scented. I have been using this along with the other two products sent to me daily for about a week and a half. I haven't noticed any significant improvement as of yet but, I do like the way my face feels after using it and look forward to seeing it help with signs of aging in the near future.

The RevitaLift Concentrated Facial Serum worked great. It was not sticky at all and every morning I wake up with a smooth skin tone. I would rate it at a 5 star the only thing that I didn't like is the smell. There is this slight odor that I just really didn't like. But otherwise it truly does do what it is set to do to your skin. I have noticed some spots diminishing as well. I will also mention that you don't even have to use a lot and the bottle holds more than a pretty decent amount. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff works amazingly with the Day Lotion. Sometimes layering two ""lotion type"" products will clog my pores. But not this stuff. It's like they were meant for each other. The serum packs the same amazing scent as the day lotion and goes on just as smoothly. Although it's considered a serum, it provides a lot of moisture as well. I haven't used it long enough to notice any real results yet, but I am definitely a customer for life based on what I have experienced so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little nervous trying the product. I don't have wrinkles, but I thought it could help with the loss of collagen/ overall sagging. I began to notice a little benefit after a week and a half of use. I can only think that if I keep on using it, I will continue to see benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the serum, not too thin or too thick. I use it Am and pm. I can't say if I notice much difference bc it's too soon to tell, but it helps even my skin out when I used it as well as makes my skin soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's, of course, not a miracle cream. However, I have been able to tell a difference in the short time that I have used it. My worry lines on my forehead are much less noticeable and it seems to even be helping with the dark circles under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never thought of using this product because frankly I didn't think any product from any company could do anything to make my skin less aged or less wrinkled. Well I was wrong, because my skin is losing the fine lines on my face. I totally recommend this awesome trio of products to anyone like me that is a cynic and skeptical of the claims made in the tv commercials. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is not bad. It does have a strong smell and does slightly tingle upon application to the skin. However, I think I may have been applying too much at a time.....remember less is more. My skin doesn't look firmer nor younger after 3 weeks of application but the dark spots do appear to be diminishing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment! This product left my skin feel very soft and smooth. The only drawback was I feel the scent is too strong. Otherwise, I love the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel like my skin is so much more smooth and feels really soft since I have been using this product. I really would recommend using this product and it is so easy to use. It doesn't make your face feel sticky or greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment! This product left my skin feel very smooth and soft, the smell/fragrance was a little over powering. But overall awesome product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just like other L'Or��al products this did not disappoint. This left my skin feeling much improved. It helped with the fine lines that I was noticing. Would defiantly recommend this and the entire line of L'Oréal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love the Serum! I am typically just a face wash person but had noticed recently that my skin was getting rougher and some wrinkles :(. I've been using the serum twice daily for 2 weeks and my skin feels TONS better! It feels tighter and my wrinkles are fading :). Love this stuff! I mean, just look at my before and after pictures! My freckles are lighter, my skin looks healthier. Its awesome! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing i noticed about this product was the scent. It is very chemically and very overpowering. I didn't like that at all. Otherwise, the product isn't bad. It absorbed quickly into my skin and was a good base for layering my other skin products in top. It didn't leave my skin feeling greasy or oily which I appreciate. My skin felt softer after applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this product is great! I used it around my target areas that are giving me the most problems right now and you can definitely tell the difference! My skin looks healthier in those areas and the wrinkles are less. I think the triple power is something that works for me and I am so happy that it does!

I have used this product for 2 and 1/2 weeks now. I have noticed a difference for the better in my facial complexion. Brown spots and fine lines are fading away. It does not fell like it is on my skin after I apply it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What a wonderful product ! It has become part of my daily skin care. I have very sensitive skin and this product leaves my skin feeling soft and beautiful. I liked the fragrance until my 9 year old son one night said "" mommy what is that smell"" he leaned in closer and smelled my face and said "" it's your skin, you smell rwally good"" so now I don't just like the fragrance bit I LOVE it ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Iam thrilled with the results after using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment after just two weeks. My skin is looking refreshed, younger and I feel like I am glowing. I have noticed my face looking smoother and it feels much softer now. I can't wait to see how great it gets with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am all about the serum! It's light, if feels great on your skin, it blends in with your skin very well, it absorbs quickly! It's a great prep to the other products in the revival lift line! I've use the serum without using other products and my face still feels so soft and smooth all day long! The serum is one of my favorites! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I suffer every fall from dryness around my nose and in my browser area this was no longer a problem once I started using these products.One thing to be aware of is the warming sensation you get when using the product, it doesn't burn but it heats up just a little. The second thing I noticed is it would rub off my face for the first 3 to 4 days which was very irritating after a week that was no longer an issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think these products work best in conjunction with one another. I use the serum, then the sunscreen most days. At night i use the cream. Its a little heavy and sweet smelling for me during the day. I love using the sunscreen as my moisturizer because its the perfect consistency and doesnt smell like sunscreen. I think this is fast acting and would definitely purchase [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'oreal really has a hit on their hands with Revitalift Concentrated Serum. I've noticed that my complexion is much smoother. The formula is creamy and lightweight with no stickiness to it. My skin has a luminous glow to it. I love the scent. I love looking younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used the serum morning and night for over a week now. I honestly can say I have seen a difference in my skin. Its brighter and my skin tone is more even. I have rosacea, so I'm always careful with my facial products. I'm happy to say the facial serum hasn't bothered my skin one bit, in fact it's improved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This L'Oreal Serum is lightweight, non-greasy and smells great! I use it every morning and every night before putting the L'Oreal face creams on. Only a little bit goes a long way. The packaging has a a vibrant red color and the bottle fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum is not greasy at all. It almost has no fragrance and it is very light. It is absorbs in just few second and your eyes won't feel the ""vapors"" that other night creams make me feel. I used it the very first night I receive the package and in the next morning the serum was there when I washed my face. It didn't attached to the pillow. In the photo below I have the serum + the lotion with SPF 20 and it still looks without shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the feel of this product on my face. It goes on smooth and evenly. Doesn't rub off on my clothes, but stays on my face where I put it. I think my wrinkles are decreasing, but it does take time. my wrinkles weren't created in a day and will not disappear in a day. But this feels like it's helping to soften and decrease my wrinkles. I'll continue to use these products and tell my friends about L'Oreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was sceptical at first but after a few days my skin felt amazing! After 2 weeks my wrinkles on my forehead looked so much better I plan to keep this product in my daily routine. Not greasy at all, smells great, and I think you get your money's worth a little goes a long way [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always been a skeptic when it came trying new products on my face. I am looking forward to seeing positive results from this serum. I am hoping that it smooths the wrinkles that have formed on my forehead from me scrunching it because of my headaches. Which brings me to why I only gave this product 4 stars on my first reviews is the scent. It is a little strong for someone who sensitive to scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't notice much of a difference in using the facial serum. In one week, the product promised to make your skin texture appear smoother and even and unfortunately after two weeks, I did not notice a difference in my skin texture at all. I don't have wrinkles, so I cannot testify to the effectiveness of it's claims, but I also did not notice my skin being re-densified or my skins texture appearing more refined. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's been 2 weeks since I started using the facial serum followed by the moisturizer and I love the way my face looks and feels. I have noticed the my skin is ALOT softer and smoother after using this. I really like the amount of moisture you get from the daily lotion as well as the sun protection. I would definitely recommend to all looking for a fresher face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for two weeks and love it. I use it morning and evening. It is weightless and is something I can put on my face and still use moisturizer or make-up and not feel like I am caking on the whole medficine cabinet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this stuff is amazing! I have been using it now for almost three weeks and the difference in my skin is very noticeable. I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter months and my wrinkles tend to show more. I can really notice it around my eyes. This product makes my skin feel supple and soft. It's not greasy or oily at all, and a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'oréal facial serum for six days now and i really like the way that it works. I have noticed a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes in that they seem to be less baggy. I have also noticed that my face all over is more firmer . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"From the first time trying this product I knew it was going to be great! My face felt smoother and just LOOKED better! Now having used the product for 2 weeks I find that I no longer feel the need to wear foundation, just a little eyeliner and mascara and I'm good to go! This product is a must have for someone just wanting the look of their younger self back! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I swear that since I've started using the serum (less than a month), my wrinkles are far less deep. I had a crease on the side of my nose that always bothered me, hardly noticeable now. I have several lines along my forehead...much more minimized now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think for me this product was too oily. I tried it for a week and got pimples on my chin, however I stopped because I thought maybe it might be because of mother nature visiting and I really wanted to give it an honest review. I have restarted it this week which has only been 2 days and it seems ok but I want to give it the proper time. The package says 1-4 wks so I will give it at least a whole week. The product smells nice so you don't have to worry about that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is so creamy and helps me fight that dry skin that creeps up in fall. I love to use this at night and wake up with soft skin! My fine lines have definitely become less noticeable! Goodbye dry skin!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the product! I've been using it for 2+ weeks, alternating all 3 products. The scent is not overwhelming to me and the products go on nice and light. They don't feel greasy or leave a film. My dry, tight skin is gone! I use them in the morning and at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is wonderful. I love the scent of this product, I love the way it feels on my face. It's like mousse on my face. Heavenly. Combined with Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer, it is making my skin feel and look more youthful. I look forward to using it for weeks to come to see how much better my skin can look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this set for over a week!!! My face feels soo soft!! The following day after the first time I used i could feel my skin hydrated but not oily and I was afraid that I would break out because when you combined all 3 products in the morning routine it feels a bit heavy but my skin had no reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this serum twice so far and I felt the same result both times tighter skin. I am hoping with the continued use I will see a visual change as well. It sure goes on smooth and I look forward to my results in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really don't like the heavy feeling on my face. I like a thin but soft moisturizer. I tried it for a couple of days but it was just to odd feeling on my face. I'm not one to try new things but hey I gave it a shot. :). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Loreal Paris Revitalift Triple power concentrated Serum is wonderful. I have been using it every day and night under the lotion and cream. Its not greasy and goes on so smoothly. The lotion and cream are great as well. I use the lotion in the day and the cream at night.I noticed the product were moved from were I have them and asked my husband, he has been using them and loves them too. Way to go Loreal.

I've been using this product twice a day for the past two weeks now and I am starting to notice that my skin is smoothing out and is plumper. A little of this product goes a long way. It has a lite clean smell and feels velvety smooth on the skin. It is not greasy whatsoever nor is it heavy on the skin. I really like this product and can't wait to see the future results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this serum! I am a huge fan of serums! I love how this serum isn't greasy or flakes off. It absorbs easily into my skin and doesn't cause me any type of irritation. I like that the scent isn't loud, a soft scent. My only problem with it, is that it doesn't have a cap on it. Other than that, it is an awesome serum! I can't wait for this product to solve my skin problems. I have recommended this to the ladies in my family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a mom of 3 life is hectic, my face shows it all to well. Since starting using the serum, I've noticed fuller skin, softer, and a nice glow. For skin care options, the price is reasonable with positive results. The look of the product feels luxurious without breaking the bank. Definitely enjoying the serum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to try this product and was absolutely amazed at the difference it made in just 2 weeks. My eye wrinkles just started to disappear! This is such an easy product to use and it made my skin feel fantastic. A huge plus is the product did not have a greasy feel and it smells nice. I have definitely found my new face cream! Love it!

This product has a light but great small. It is not over powering at all. At first glance I thought it looked to thick and would feel heavy on my skin. That is not the case at all! IT goes on smooth and light. It makes my skin feel great all day! I would definitely purchase this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the whole L'Oreal Paris Lift program for the last 2 weeks. I can already physically see an improvement in my complexion, it's working well on my fine lines.

I tried this Serum along with some of the other products in this line. I really liked the feeling of my skin after using this for several days.

"I have been using the product for a little over a week, and so far I like what I am seeing. While I can't say that I have noticed a difference in wrinkles, my skin does feel softer and appear healthier since I have started using the product. The product goes on smooth and does not feel heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is amazing! It is easy to use as it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. The product doesn't leave a greasy feeling, and leaves my skin super soft and looking radiant. I don't like the fragrance despite it being very subtle. I've used the product for two weeks, and my skin has a healthier look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before using this product, I wanted something with hyaluronic acid, which helps with anti aging. I was pleased to find out Revitalift Serum had it! I Ike the way it feels and smells. It comes in an easy to dispense container and the packaging is nice as well. The directions are specific and detailed for when to use the serum and what order to use each product, when adding eye cream, night cream, etc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for over a week now and have seen some good things and some bad things with this product. Here's the good 1.) It made my skin feel smooth & silky. 2.) It did re-hydrate my skin & tighten it. Now here's the bad 1.) After a few days I noticed that my face started to feel greasy. 2) Due that greasiness even after washing my face twice a day I started to break out. I'm not sure this is a product that I would buy on a normal basis to my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Serum is wonderful! After cleaning my face, I rubbed it in and it went on smoothly and absorbed into my skin. A little goes a long way. The fragrance is pleasant to me. My face felt nice all day long. I use it both morning and before bed. I've only used for two weeks but feel my face is smoothing and firming slightly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great serum. It's a little heavier than your usual serum, but still refreshing and not too much for oily skin. It absorbs very quickly. My skin feels firmer and tighter. I like using it in the evening, after shower, and before my face cream. After using it for 2 weeks I can definitely say that the appearance of my wrinkles has reduced, and that the tone of my face looks brighter. I would definitely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is an excellent product. Two treatments and I could feel a difference in my skin. I was so excited with the results I went promptly out to purchase the eye serum. Amazing how little an application takes so I believe it will last and totally be worth the purchase price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that L'Oreal ReVitalift Concentrated Serum works great! I've been using it morning and night as part of my facial rituals, applying it to my face and neck, for the past two weeks. As soon as I apply the serum I can feel my skin tingling. Within These two weeks I can see a difference in my skin! It's amazing how smooth my skin feels. Also the fact that it has a great light fragrance to it is a great bonus! I highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Let me give some background on my skin. i sometimes have breakouts and my skin tends forever to heal. I have a couple of small pockmarks on my cheek. The bottle and packaging looks very high end. A little bit goes a long way. It absorbs quickly and the texture is great. I have been using it for 10 days now and I am completely in love. My skin texture has changed, my blemishes are healing, and my skin is glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really do love this product. It has totally eliminated my dry patchy skin. My skin tone has improved. I love my smooth skin. I am looking forward to it reducing my wrinkles even more by 4 weeks, because it has done everything else it claims. A little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this facial Serum. It goes on so smooth and silky. I noticed within the first two days a difference in the texture of my skin. This product does not dry your skin out and is not sticky. I really like the smell too. I would recommend it!! Oh, and the price is very reasonable!

"I've tried quite a few high-end serums and I found that I really do like this one from L'Oreal. It really is lightweight and penetrates the skin pretty quickly. I've only been using it for two weeks, but I'm loving the look and feel so far. It sits well under my moisturizer and makeup, without feeling heavy or caked. I will definitely continue to use this serum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for over a week and I can already feel and see a difference! My face feels more hydrated and smoother then before and I have noticed fine lines and wrinkles have started to fade! I also love the smell of the serum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product delivers as promised, I immediately felt a difference after a week, my skin fell softened and more younger, I had my doubts but now, I would highly recommend to anyone concerned with aging skin. Hidden gem for me. Now when I use a face illuminator, I look like I had a facial peel. Love it❣️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am going with 3 stars this time because it is still too soon to really tell if these products work. I have now been using all 3 products in this line for 1 week. They still make my skin feel soft and dewy but I do not see any difference in tone or wrinkles. I live in Florida and get a lot of sun exposure and although I always use sunscreen I still have dark spots and I have also lost volume. I will continue to use all 3 products and review again after 3 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loved the revitalift concentrated serum. When applied it absorbed quickly and didn't leave a greasy feel . Left my skin feeling ultra soft and had a very pleasant smell. After trying all three revitalift products I can say I will continue using them and would suggest them for anyone else . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this serum! It goes on silky and lightweight! Didn't irritate my sensitive skin! Would recommend it for anyone concerned with fine lines or wrinkles. Or someone interested in preventing any future aging. The price was fair, packaging easy and size was large. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a very lightweight serum that's more like a lotion than the typical clear serums popular in the market. It's not greasy and easy to apply quickly with the bottle's built in pump. My skin feels immediately smoother upon application. I also like using it on my eyes as the serum is not heavy and light enough for that use. This is a good all in one treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although it may be great to some, I found the serum to be to greasy for my skin. After four days of using, day and night, my skin started breaking out. I made sure to use no other products with this to get the full effect and use right after washing my face. The good things though about this product is it comes in a nice pump bottle, one squirt covered my whole face, and it had a good smell to it. I would recommend this to those who have very dry skin only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this serum. I expected it to be heavy and kinda greasy. However much to my surprise, it really wasnt. It was quite light and easy to apply. A little goes a long way as its spread quite easily. It left my face feeling nice and soft and it left a really shimmery glow after application [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product worked really well. It has a very light scent, goes on easily-glides across your skin, and actually appears to add volume to your face. I have been using this product for a week now, and my wrinkles/fine lines aren't as apparent. My skin feels smoother, and my boyfriend asked me if I had lost weight lol. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves looking youthful and amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for 1 1/2 weeks and, so far, I like it. It has a light fragrance, is not greasy or oily and readily absorbs into the skin. Can't say I have seen any difference in the appearance of my skin, but the skin is 70 years old, so that will probably not happen. I do like the feel of the serum and will continue to use it to give it a good trial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment after one week of use twice daily showed temporary improvement in facial wrinkles. Slight improvement in sagging skin. Temporary because the effects did seem to wear off by the end of the day. My skin texture does seem smoother. It is a weightless feel on the skin, not greasy or oily, very silky smooth to put on the face. It feels like an expensive serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for a week and love this stuff! I have been putting it on at night and it absorbs so quickly into my skin which is wonderful! I really enjoy the smell as well. Don't be fooled by such a small bottle because a little goes a long way. I am really loving this product line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this serum is a great product! just apply it in the morning and night after your facial cleaning! it will be disappearing. my skin soaked it up in a couple of seconds and leaving my skin feel soft and refreshed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This serum is a good product. I use it twice daily. My skin tone appears more even. My skin appears to have a nice glow and feels very soft. I really like the product because it's lightweight. The serum feels great on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had to use the serum for a while before I saw results. but I have noticed that the lines around my eyes and mouth seem less pronounced than before. The serum went on smoothly and made my skin look brighter. All in all, I will buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this serum. It didn't seem too thick and it blended in well. I have used this product over a week and do see my skin looking healthy. I have been using all three of the products together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this serum is great! It has a pleasant fragrance that isn't overwhelming and smells clean. Goes on easily and isn't greasy. Absorbs quickly. My face didn't feel sticky or oily, just moisturized. I will definitely pick this up again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The concentrated facial serum is very light weight and non greasy. It goes and smooth and light on my face. The first couple of days trying this my skin was feeling a little tingley. I guess that means it is working. This didn't have a sticky or heavy feel on my face. My skin feels great and from. This is a great product to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the serum daily at night and in the morning. I like the smell as I feel that i'm getting a facial. I like using the serum under my eyes since its a very thin layer of skin there. I feel that it has become more firm and hides the early states of aging well. I even feel like that it has brightened up my skin as well. The consistency is good. It's not runny or solid and really works into the skin easily. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This L'Oréal serum is amazing! About three days in I noticed softer, smoother skin. I would definitely put this product in the same category (or better!) than department store brands. I'm using AM and PM under the moisturizer and my skin feels hydrated with less fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried this along with the moisturizer and love them both! Especially like the fact that there is just a slight fragrance, I don't care for heavy aroma so this was a definite plus for me! Feels great on my skin as well! Will recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the product for 8 days, morning and night. Goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, and has a pleasant smell. As for it's benefits. I haven't seen any visual changes although it tends to make your skin feel a touch more firm. More updates coming as Revlon RevitaLift says full benefits are reach in 4 weeks.

"I love love the revitalift serum! I put it on after cleaning my face and I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, my skin looks brighter and my pores seem smaller the texture of my skin seems smoother this is definitely a keeper and will now be a regular in my nightly cleansing routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am now 12 days in, using all three products. I continue to see improvement in the lines around my mouth, but no real change in lines around my eyes since last week. My skin looks amazing, smooth and soft and looking healthy. Friends have asked me what I am doing because I am looking younger. I will continue to use these products since there have been definite positive results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift for a few years now with some sparatic gaps in usage. I can see a clear difference in the softness and reduction in fine line when I use the products regularly. I love the way I look when I'm using this product. It helps keep me looking as young as I feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product. First the bottle made it easy to dispense. I have tried many other serums with a dropper or squeeze. This bottle is very convenient and made application fast. Second it absorbs quickly into your skin and disappears. Leaves no white into skin cracks. Third, i felt it working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is wonderful! The first night I used it, I noticed dead skin beading up as I smoothed the serum on - this happened the next few applications as well. Now my skin is much more even, smooth, and soft after using this twice a day for the last week. I will continue to buy this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like these products. My face is less bothered by the dry air our woodstove produces. And, I notice a brightness to my skin as well. I love the aromas from the products. They feel creamy going on, they smell wonderful, and are softening my skin. It is wonderful not to feel the soreness our dry climate caused my skin. I will continue to use these products. I am so surprised these products didn't cost a fortune, because they'll stay part of my beauty regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product about 2 weeks now and love it so far! It doesn't leave my face greasy like other moisturizers have and it doesn't sting after putting it on.

I think that the L'Oreal Paris revitalift triple power concentrated facial serum treatment has become part of my daily facial routine. I loved how easy it was to use. It was not greasy and it did not irritate my skin. I noticed a diffence in my face in just one week of using this. I have and will continue to recommend this to my friends as well as my family. Thanks for making a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product for those with minor skin issues, wrinkles and such. It is very light, so your face isn't greasy looking or feels greasy, and you see immediate results with added softness . I barely have wrinkles by my eyes but I do see a slight improvement in them. Can't wait to see the results in a few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm going on 2 weeks with this miracle serum and I think I'm in love. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is working wonders for my skin. I'm fairly young so wrinkles aren't a concern for me but I definitely feel a huge difference in the firmness of my skin. And it's also helping out with the laugh lines and dark circles around my eyes. You're doing great L'oreal! Keep up the good work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try the Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It was a nice, subtle scent upon opening. It feels light and goes on smoothly. It's a nice feel on my skin, not too heavy. My skin feels great. I've been using it for about 2 weeks. I haven't noticed much change to my appearance yet but will continue to apply daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product is amazing!!! i love it, the cream is sooo silky and smooth. your skin feels soo soft and its smells really nice. its not greasy or too thick and i am sticking to this daily routine from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Omg! Last night after my shower I tried the Facial Moisturizer and it was soo soft and smooth, and the smell is sooo good!!! My face was soo soft afterwards. I look forward to using this everyday in the morning and at night. It leaves your skin feeling refreshed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At age 68, I really don't have a lot of wrinkles, however, I do notice my skin starting to sag. I decided to try L'Oreal's Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum treatment to see if it could help strengthen the skin, especially on my neck. I love the slight smell, not too strong, of the product, and the fact that it's not greasy is a big plus. I've been using it every day and my face feels so soft..it just feels so good. I think I may have finally found just the right product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The facial serum needs a little more time for me to really know if this is a product for me. It smells and applies nice. I liked it. It just needs a little more time to see change in my face. Thank you for the sample. I'll need to use this product longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Applying this at night and in the morning as helped decrease the under-eye bags that I have. I have also noticed my skin seems to be brighter. It appears to have a glow to it like it really is hydrating my skin. I'm looking for to it helping transforming the look of aging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After one week of the serum I felt my skin tighten - It is non-greasy and has a pleasant scent. Goes on easily and does not leave a film. Moisturizers can be applied on top of the serum without any buildup. Did not lighten dark age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a fantastic product. I use it every night and morning and all day long I just want to touch my face, it's so soft. My skin looks younger and has a wonderful glow! It's not greasy at all (no spots on my pillow!! It'll last a long time because a little goes a long way!! I highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product 2 times daily as instructed for about 2 weeks now. I like the way it feels on my face and neck. It seems to soak in quickly and not leave a greasy feeling on my skin. Can't wait to see how my face looks and feels at the end of the bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum is Very Fast absorbing! It left my face feeling super soft and ready for my moisturizer within sixty seconds. I have oily skin and this worked perfect, It didn't give me any breakouts at all. I've already bought a backup bottle!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment my face feels revitalized, brighter and more evenly colored! Just a few dabs is needed, no sticky mess and a light, but very nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried all three products and unfortunately it aggravated my skin. It was moist at first but after it dried my skin became very tight, dry and itchy. It actually caused a skin issue to resurface. On a lighter note, the moisturizer worked very well. It was soothing, smooth, and lasted all day. I would use the moisturizer on its own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy using the facial serum. It is soft on my skin and leaves my skin looking and feeling more youthful. I have somewhat oily skin, but the serum does not make my face more oily. In fact, after using the serum and the moisturizer together, my face does not become oily at all throughout the day. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the serum for 1 week now, and so far, the results have been amazing! My experience was just as the package claimed. ""In 1 week: skin texture appears smoother. Skin tone is more even."" I'm looking forward to my 4 week results!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has really brightened up my skin!!! I didn't know that my skin was dull until I started using this and seeing the difference. People have been complimenting my skin and saying that I have a glow!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've just been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum for about 3 days, but I can already tell a big difference! My skin tone is so much less dull now...plus it feels super smooth! I even went to work without makeup today! YIKES! My face tends to be very oily, but, so far, I don't seem to have that problem with this serum! I'm excited to see my results in the next week or so! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combination skin that leads more towards oily. This serum provided enough moisture that I did not wear a moisturizer on top of it and it did not make my face oily or greasy. It made my skin appear plumper and lasted though out the day. My makeup applied well over it. My only complaint is that Hyaluronic Acid is listed on the front of the bottle but was the 21st ingredient in the product so I doubt it is a very high concentration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great for all skin types. Even those with oily skin who gets some acne. It didn't break me out at all. On the contrary my skin felt silky and soft. This serum smells and feels great. Wrinkles are reduced and skin is more luminous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I also received this as a free sample. All opinions are my own. I use this day & night!!!! It has helped with the texture of my skin & the brightness. It keeps my skin moist & smooth. Again, the only concern I have is the scent. It smells great but some would be put off with it. Especially with sensitive skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Finally, received my free trial of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Trio on October 29, started using it on the 30th. I can't see that I have seen a difference in less than one week's time using this product but my skin does feel wonderful! I will update my review once I have used it a bit longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only had this serum for about a week and a half but so far it's decent. I like how lightweight it is and it seems to sink into my skin quickly. The only thing that I really do not like about it is that it smells like perfume. My husband will not use it at all because of the smell. If they could take out the perfume smell to it, I would have given it at least one more star. I think that it will take a few more weeks to be able to tell a difference in my skin, but so far so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would recommend this product if you're looking for a light scented, daily moisturizer that doesn't sting or burn and works! I've been using the product for a full week now and the payoff is beginning. I don't have a dark area under my eyes as I did last week, and my skin feels moisturized. This isn't completely shine free so if that is what you're after put it on early before your usual routine and once it absorbs I didn't notice the shine as much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Loreal Revitalift product line is one of the better ones out there. I have been using the serum since October 26th. I haven't really noticed any wrinkles diminishing yet but I will continue to use it. I have noticed a bit more brightness and firmness to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
using this serum i can feel and see a big difference.Was sceptical about trying any products till i found the right one.You dont need to use much and my skin looks smoother.Always respect the L'Oreal brand and glad this was the first wrinkle creams i got to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment. After using high end products and not having good results I was amazed how smooth my skin felt after only one use. You only need a small amount and it is lightweight. After one week, I noticed such a difference. I will be recommending this product to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
While i can't really say Ive noticed a decrease in fine lines yet...(only been using for a week) I can see where it will work... The softness of my skin after using this is amazing. Scent is fabulous. Will definitely keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this product, using it at night before bed. It went on smooth and easily. The only issue I had was putting it on before bed and hopping right into bed. It felt like it was all wiping off on my pillow case. I might like it better if applied a few hours before bed to give it a chance to soak in. It made my face feel fresh and vibrant. Didn't notice any wrinkle reduction, but have only been using it for a week now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this lotion! I am coming to the point in my life when the wrinkles are starting to show, and I need to start using this regularly. I like the smooth texture. It makes my skin feel tighter. This will definitely need to become part of my morning routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was extremely skeptical at first. I have been using RevitaLift facial serum and my face feels and looks amazing! After a week I was amazed how much I love it. I talked to a few girls at the store when I walked down the beauty isle and a woman actually had it in her hands. I talked to her about it and ended up convincing her to buy it! I will definitely purchase it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this serum for about 1.5 and I can see small changes int he skin around and under my eyes and nose. I am a new mother and don't always get as much sleep as I need. This serum combined with the moisturizer has made me feel more confident leaving the house without makeup on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this . it's not greasy or thick. I don't have the bags or circle's under my eyes that were there before I started using concentrated serum . it smells good and doesn't have a burning sensation . my skin was a little oily feeling in places, but only for the first few times after using it. It's worth getting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a wonderful product. After a sing the product to two weeks I notice arhat my wrinkles were less visible. I'm so excited with this product and I will recommended to my friends and continue to used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i liked the smoothness of the cream but not so much the smell. As soon as i started rubbing it on my fave i started to have a warm sensation and started to become very itchy. unfortunately i think i am not able to use this product. Thanks for the chance to try before i bought it though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal revitalift is awesome. When I smoothed on the triple power it felt really good and smooth and smelled great I could see a difference in the eye bags. Even my daughter said she could see the difference I will be buying this again and again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

After 1 week of using the RevitaLift triple power concentrated facial serum treatment my face feels amazing and smooth. My skin has started to tighten making me look and feel younger.

"I wanted to try this for a week before reporting. My favorite of the collection is the serum. The serum just gives me a smooth finish. The fragrance is really nice.It doesn't feel heavy at all, I love that I can layer the serum along with moisturizer under my foundation. I can definitely feel the difference in this past week. This is a product I will be purchasing after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like using the serum treatment. It makes my skin very smooth and it really smells great. The serum is very light and easy to use. I intend to keep using the Loreal products. I really like the Moisturizer too! It went on easily and was not heavy. My skin feels so much better, not dry at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
#Bzzagent #gotitfree #L'OrealParisRivitaliftTripleConcentratedFacialSerumTreatmeant Honestly if i seen this in the stores i would never buy this for my self so getting this was a treat in its self. I actually love it it smells wonderful and it is so silky smooth when i apply it to my skin. I seen a big difference in just one week of using it normally i would not of bought it but it has opened my eyes to a new product in witch i will keep buying..

"This serum has a pleasant smell although it can be a bit strong. The consistency is just right, not too runny or thick. I loved the way it made my skin feel, it has a very softening effect that's not too greasy. However, if you already have oily skin or acne prone skin I would not recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's works very well. My skin is glowing better than ever! Its very smooth and rich.. I would recommend these products to everyone I know. The best part is that it is working already and I've only been using it for a week already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this serum, and I've tried quite a few. It doesn't feel heavy, and it evened out the texture on my face nicely. I use it morning and night, and my skin feels so soft. Added bonus is the nice smell it has to it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It went on silky smooth. Had a great but not overpowering scent. Did not make my face feel greasy but seemed to absorb quickly. After using for just a week I noticed my face was not sunken or dull but had more life to it and showed signs of being more healthy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! I've been using it going on two weeks now and have begun to see improvement. The product feels light weight which I really like and a little goes a long way. I've seen the most improvement around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am in loving this serum so far. I am a dedicated user of facial care products. So, it is absolutely vital for me to find a skin care regimen that works. I love the fact that this product is light weight and easy to apply. It also leaves no greasy residue which is fabulous if I put it on underneath makeup as well or alone. It also absorbs quickly into my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first when I tried the serum and it felt thick and sticky on my skin then it dried and felt very light. Also after the first week, my skin looked dull at first, but then I continued to use it and I could really see the age defining effects. I use a lot of very expensive serums and I would say that TP Serum has the high quality effect that they have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! I have never tried L'Oreal facial products before. I don't know why I waited so long! I would definitely buy this product. My skin feels moisturized and looks firmer. I used this with other products in the L'Oreal line such as L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. They all work excellent together. I had no irritation from this product line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely love the RevitaLift Facial Serum. I have to say I was a bit susceptible at first being that I have oily skin, so I tend to stay away from anything that could possible make my face breakout. But since using the face serum, my face feels and looks a lot smoother and bright. I love how it doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my face and easily absorbs into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the serum under the moisturizers and I am so pleased with these products! They make my skin feel smooth and hydrated! I will have to use the products longer to see the full effects, but I really like them so far! I have sensitive skin and break out easy when I use certain products so I love that I can use these skin care products with out any breakouts or rashes.

I ordered this product for my wife who is always trying different Facial products and hasn't found one she likes. I got this in and oh my she said she has never seen one work as well as the L'Oréal product do as far as the way her face feels. Thanks it's great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wasn't sure about trying these products at first, I'm kind of picky about my skincare products. Let me say, that the products in this line are fabulous. I'm converted. They smell amazing, but not overpowering. They are creamy and go on smooth and leave my poor dry skin feeling moisturized and wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really noticed a difference within just one week of using this lotion. My skin was smoother and brighter. And the lotion has a great fresh smell. I did notice that if I rubbed my face later in the day, a residue would ball up and I'd have to pick it off. I'm guessing that this is because the lotion acts like a filler and that's what is rubbing off. I still love the product though and will continue to use!

I love the scent of the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Serum product-so much so that I actually look forward to washing my face! It leaves my skin very silky to the touch and I have noticed smaller pores around my nose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so pleased with this product! I have been using the Loreal triple lift power concentrated serum for 1 week and SEE noticeable results! Lines around my eyes and set in line on my forehead are way less prominent! Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been so impressed with the way my skin feels using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power. Just a little bit is all it takes to start my morning with soft skin with wrinkle fighting power! I love that it doesn't have a heavy scent as well. I have tried many other products that have a certain smell that gets stuck in my nose! I can't stand that! Here I am over 12 hours since applying and my skin still feels great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really am pleased with this product. I was very hesitant to try it due to my sensitive skin and it seemed to have alot of perfume but I had no reaction and I see a huge difference lots of dark blemishes have gone away thank you LOREAL for sending me this free sample. I will be purchasing this product always. No need to spend a large amount of money on the competition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for a while now and it is wonderful. Nice fragrance, doesn't have a greasy feeling and my face feelings amazing. I have afternoon carpool duty and one of my coworkers mentioned how she could see a change in my face and I happily told her it's because I have been using L'Oreal Pairs Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. This will continue to go into my daily and nightly routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was super excited to be on this trial. The bottle is great, and the pump gives out a perfect amount! I'm enjoying this so far and will continue using until it's gone to see if there are any major appearance changes. In the meantime, it seems to be doing its job! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this and you can actually feel it working. I have been using it for 4 days now and I will continue using this product. The bottles are so pretty. I couldn't wait to try this as i somehow knew i would like it. I have read good reviews on this and now i know what they were talking about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love love love this!! It's light and not sticky one bit! I have used this twice daily for the last week and can see some improvement under my eyes. The skin is beginning to tighten up some and my under eye bags and wrinkles are starting to fade! I have tried millions of concealers and treatments but this one is really doing the job!

"It hasn't been very long , roughly about 3 weeks, and already I can feel and see results. Of course it's not genie in a bottle, but it is working for me. I'm close to my big ""60""... So any help is good for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and was surprised at how much smoother and tighter my skin felt and looked after only a week of use. I could see lines minimize and my skin hasn't looked this good in years! I was skeptical, of course. I'm so glad I tried this! I don't have any problems aging, but why look older than I have to!

"After using this product for 2 weeks my face feels tighter , pores smaller and wrinkles less noticeable. It leaves your face feeling amazing. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new facial treatment. Quite impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was not oily at all and my skin feels really soft after using. MY only draw back is it is very perfumed and irritated my eyes a bit during the day. I for sure am going to continue using at night though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment. The first think I noticed when I applied it to my face was the over powering chemical smell, it is not pleasant. This product has way too much fragrance for my liking. It did however quickly absorb into my skin and left my skin feeling smooth. I wish the company would make a more natural product without all the added chemicals. I will not purchase this item in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is not a heavy or oily serum. It is light and creamy. It goes on smooth and easily. A little bit goes a long way. Did not make my skin shiny looking. It didn't feel greasy nor did it leave a sticky film on my skin. The moisturizer went on easily afterwards. I wanted to know if this would make my skin softer and less wrinkled, but after one week I honestly do not see any difference in my skin's appearance.

"This product is tops!! It was very light going on and my face was moisturized all day without any greasy feeling and no weight on face. I love this product and highly recommend it.

"This serum felt creamy and absorbed quickly into my skin. I used it in combination with the Revitalift day lotion. The combination makes my skin really moisturised and a bit luminous. My foundation looked much better with this magic combo. However, I haven't noticed an improvement in skintone, fine lines, or dark spots. Maybe it will take a few more weeks for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this serum for a little over a week. I love it! It feels smooth going on my skin and leaves my skin feeling very soft. I will continue using this product and would highly recommend it as I think it's fabulous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the facial serum is nice to use under your night cream. It makes your face feel soft and gives it a nice shine. I have oily skin but would recommend it for every skin type. I will most likely purchase another bottle and continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product lotion like, not sticky. As someone with sensitive skin, I was initially worried about break outs or a reaction to the product, but I've had no adverse reactions to thei product at all. In fact, it has improved my skin tremendously. My dry skin is completely gone and my wrinkles are fading. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing! I tried it now for about ten days. I use it at night on a clean face. I normally have combination skin, oily at the t-zone and some pretty brutal dry spots on my cheeks. I saw a noticeable difference after two days- and was asked if I was wearing makeup(which I wasn't)! My natural glow is back, I was getting quite dull. Highly HIGHLY recommend this product!

"So far so good with the serum, it has only been a couple of days so I am hoping to see results around my eyes and forward. Again, like the other L'Oreal products I have tried it's not sticky and goes on light! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I used this product to improved my eyes area. It was easy to use. In a week I can see that I do not look so tired. It is not super oily, it drys well. At first I could see it was oily but my skin quickly absorbed the serum. Well recomended [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These three products are amazing! I have been looking for a product that truly leaves my skin looking an feeling moisturizer and the Revitalift triple does that.

"Oh boy, after trying the RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment, I'm hooked. I love the smooth and non-sticky feel of the serum when I put it on but the feel of my skin afterwards is even better. I am already noticing a difference in my skins' texture and appearance. It feels toned, the tiny wrinkles are disappearing, and the larger wrinkles appear to be smaller than before I started this. I will never stop using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not sure if I can continue using this product. While the consistency is decent, I am not a fan of the glitter in the serum. Is that what's supposed to give you the ""glow""? More than anything, my face gets red and irritated each time I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think anyone would appreciate how well this product works. The improvement you will see in your skin will surprise you. My wrinkles looked less pronounced and all over firmer. My husband noticed I was using something different and commented on how good I looked. I will continue using it as long as it is available. High quality.

"I really like this serum. I was worried it might feel greasy on my face, but it actually feels really nice. It initially feels a bit greasy, but within a couple minutes it soaks in. My skin is not breaking out from it either, which is typically what happens when I use any type of moisturizer. It only takes a tiny amount too so this will last a long time. I would buy it again. My skin seems to look brighter too since using it now, but cannot say long-term as I have only used it for a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, I have a somewhat oily skin type, so maybe that is why this just felt to heavy for me. It does smell really nice and fresh, not over powering. It goes on nicely. Just, after a hour or so, my skin kind of had a filmy feeling to it. My skin did look at little nicer after time,but it caused a few minor whiteheads. This will probably be great when it gets really cold and dry in the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum really is concentrated! The first couple of times I used a little too much and it felt a bit heavy. Once I adjusted the amount it feels fantastic on my skin. After one week my skin already feels softer and looks brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only used it for a few days, but love the texture. I'm excited to see the results, since I haven't been using it very long yet I haven't seen any miraculous things but am hopeful like it says between 4-8 weeks I'll see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like using this serum. I've been using it in the morning and in the evening before applying moisturizer. It's a nice consistency, not too thick but also not runny. It's very impressive for the price range and the fact that it's something that you can pick up at the drugstore. I've only been using for several days so can't really judge on the different it's made to my skin yet but I'm not breaking out from it or experiencing any redness. My skin is soft and smooth.

I was super excited to be chosen for the L'Oreal Campaign. Was impressed that it was full size items. Tried it the first night I got it. Put all 3 products on and went to bed. My skin is already really oily so it made my face feel greasy and within 2 days my face broke. Didn't work well with my foundation and my face felt oily all day. Very disappointed.

The serum feels so silky and smooth going on. I've been using it twice a day and just love it. I use it as an eye cream in the morning. It leaves my face feeling very soft. Two things I dont like about it: 1. The scent is very strong. 2. When applying makeup too soon after using the serum (and possibly the sunscreen/lotion) it peels off in bunches. It forms these rolls of lotion/skin/something that form all over my face. It's kind of gross but mostly annoying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never used a serum before, but I have been using this one and so far, so good. I have been using the serum in combination with the L'Oreal Revitalift moisturizers and I am very happy with them so far! The product goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. So far I feel like my skin looks more bright and healthy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how it felt . Great Moisturizer & hydrating my skin It was very late, not greasy or oily.i would tell my friends and family, but I just wish all of them where all unscented..but the scent isn't bad . I would buy it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the facial serum in combination with the facial day lotion & the deep acting facial moisturizer I have enjoyed using all 3 products. My only complaint is the fragrance of the serum. Too me is seems to smell a bit like hand sanitizer. I will continue to use the product because so far I have enjoyed using the product. I haven't been using the product more than 3 weeks so it's hard to tell if it's had any benefit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am in love with this whole line. After 2 weeks of use my skin is visibly brighter, and even in tone and texture. This entire line is non-greasy and you can feel it absorbing into your skin. There is no doubt that I will be using this line for as long as I can. The worst feeling is to put a lotion/serum/etc on your face and be able to feel it and feel like you need to be constantly blotting away oil. But with this product it feels just as good as it will make you look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I am amazed by the results. It doesn't take much time to apply and the fragrance is wonderful. My skin is smoother, softer and starting to notice less fine lines. I can't wait to see what the results are in 4 weeks. I do recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've enjoyed using these products very much! It is silky smooth. There is a slight scent that is really nice, but it fades away quick. Did not irritate my sensitive skin and made it feel smoother and more even. The packaging is beautiful and luxurious too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I can hold off on the facelift as long as I keep using this magic serum! I have used it twice daily for a week now, and I can really tell the difference....my skin is softer and my lines are much less noticeable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loreals new serum is the best one I have ever used. After using it for 9 days every day after I get out of the shower it has made my skin tone so even! I can feel it working immediately. My skin feels lighter and looks so much healthier! I can't wait to continue using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never really understood a serum when I am typically a moisturizer type of girl. That being said, I really liked this one although I am still not entirely sure what a serum is supposed to do. It wasn't too heavy and went on feeling great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited when I received these loreal products. I did the whole regimen starting with the serum. Since I feel I don't have many wrinkles, I only did it once a day, in the morning. It doesn't feel oily or made my face shiny. The dose is great, it covers my face and neck without extra pumping. I don't know if only one product will do magic, but together I got many compliments. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this serum would be perfect for everyone. It's so light and my skin absorbed it so fast. I even used it on my hands which are horribly dry and it really helped me feel hydrated. It has a very light scent but it's quite pleasant. I'm not sure what it smells like but it's nice. I am very glad I got to try this product out complimentary by BzzAgent for my honest review. The size is very generous and a little goes a long way. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this for my neck, and I actually used it on my dry heels! I put it on my feet before lotion and in the morning, they felt better. I wouldn't normally try something like that, but I experimented and it worked out! No more cracked heels!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product works as well as another high-end facial serum product that I've tried in the past. I've used the product for about a week now, and I have already noticed a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles - especially around my eyes and my mouth. It has helped improve the texture of my skin, as well. I will say that I avoid using the serum on my forehead, as I tend to be naturally oily in my T-Zone, and the serum seems to add to that issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Serum and the Deep acting facial lotion now for 2 weeks and I think it is a wonderful product. Goes on smooth, pleasant scent and my skin feels great. I have tried many more expensive products and this one is a great value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the L'Oréal Facial Serum Treatment. I use it around my eyes and around my mouth and jawline. It does not have a greasy feel to it. Very smooth and rubs in well. It does not have a strong scent, it's very pleasant. I like the pump bottle, it's easy to use, and you get just the right amount. I also like the fact that this is a very affordable product. The bottle is a nice size and will last awhile. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product might be my new affordable home spa daily anti-aging product. I love the smell and how it completely soaks in after applying it. Unlike other anti-aging serums, there is no greasy feel or residue that I want to wash off later in the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was worried this line would break me out. As soon as I smelled the fragrance, I worried that it would be too much. But I'm happy to say a week later my skin feels great, and if anything, my skin is even clearer. I was bummed I couldn't bring this on my work trip, and I missed it. This is a keeper for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this serum for about a week and my skin is feeling smooth and soft. I use it morning & night and with the highest concentration of pro-xylane, a Loreal ingredient, I expect great results in the coming weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this L'Oréal facial serum and I love it! It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so good! It also makes the L'Oréal moisturizer go on even more smoothly too. I love how it makes my skin feel and look. My fine lines are not as noticeable since I have been using this product. I like how it works and I love that it is triple power concentrate! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The concentrated facial serum feels great going on. I have only used the product for one week, and my skin is feeling soft and moisturized. I am hoping with continued use my fine lines will be reduced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for about a week, I can say that I like it and may buy more when my supply runs out. I like that it goes on smooth and doesn't feel like a thick layer like some other similar products. I have not noticed any difference in wrinkles or fine lines. I have noticed that my skin feels softer. I also like that it doesn't take much to cover my face, a little bit goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product until I realized there was glitter in it. I'm very picky about the products I put on my face and using a serum daily with glitter is not for me. Besides the glitter, I found the product to be light weight and it did not leave a greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this lotion. It is very lightweight, and feels clean, not greasy. I have been using it for about half a week and am very pleased with the results. I will be posting before and after photos of my face when I have reached the 7 day trial mark. I can already see a difference with the fine lines and darkness around my eyes. That is exactly what I was hoping to achieve with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really thought this was a great product. It went on so smoothly and it didn't feel greasy like a lot of those serums do. I've been using it for just over a week now and I can already see my 'crow's feet' starting to disappear. I'm just thrilled about it! I've already started to tell my friends about it. My face feels like it has more tone in it than it has in years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"a little goes a long way with this serum. love that it doesn't take a lot to cover all areas in need. smells great too, not to strong but no too light either. perfect thickness and rubs into my face without taking forever. skin is left feeling and looking smoother and bright after a little over a week of use. doesnt make my skin feel or look oily either, which is always a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the concentrated serum, deep-acting moisturizer, and day lotion for about a week. The products make my skin feel soft and I love the smell, however I am finding that the products do not completely rub in. I'm getting some lumpy stuff when I try to apply my foundation after the products. I'm going to try night time use only for the next week and see how that goes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a while now and it is wonderful. Nice fragrance, doesn't have a greasy feeling and my face feelings amazing. I have afternoon carpool duty and one of my coworkers mentioned how she could see a change in my face and I happily told her it's because I have been using L'Oreal Pairs Revitalift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. This will continue to go into my daily and nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The reviews on L'Oreal with other users is beyond my expectations i'm sure that i have used L'Oreal so things that speak to you glowing skin moisturized skin smooth radiant complexion beyond its best i tried a sample buzz agent sent me i'm amazed at the results.

I think L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is amazing. Right away I noticed my face was smoother and more even toned than it was before. I have only tried the product for a week now and so far am very happy with the results. I look forward to looking in the mirror now! Thank you L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am using all three products. I have been for a few days. The products smell great. I love the smell. Makes my skin feel very soft. Not a greasy feeling. I can't tell any difference yet in using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I felt like the Revitalift serum was good for my skin. It felt soft & well hydrated in the morning after I used it and through out the day. I have sensitive skin & I did notice that I tended to be a little red in the morning. I've have only used it for about 7 days, I feel like I may have to use it a little longer to see my wrinkles improve. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am blown away by how fabulous this product is! Just after a few days I noticed a significant difference!! Hydrated skin and glowing, improving my mommy lines and just overall appearance. Highly recommend this product to everyone, I don't feel it's just for someone mature; it is never too late to hydrate and pamper your skin ladies!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is amazing so far. I have only been using it for about a week now and I can already notice a difference! My face looks brighter and starting to look younger! I'm definitely recommending this product and will be purchasing it or myself in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this serum. I don't usually use any serums but this provided easy to apply moisture. I'm not sure if it helps my skin age wise....I feel like fine lines and such are still quite visible bit it definetly adds long lasting moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of the serum. I could not tell if it worked right away, but I liked the feel of luxury before going to bed at night. I am starting to see some hydration changes in the past week. I will continue to use this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly, I thought this would be a typical serum but it is by far the silkiest that I have ever used. It blends in so quickly without the greasy filmy that I often get with others. I also love to use it as a base for my makeup because it helps foundation and blush spread and absorb so evenly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has a floral scent that is a little strong, but it fades quickly. It goes on very nicely and soaks in quickly so your face doesn't feel weighed down or like there is something greasy sitting on it. I use it on my face, neck, and chest and have noticed the texture of my skin has improved and seems firmer or healthier. This is not necessarily a product I would have bought without a sample first, I am used to serums being thick, or sticky, or not soaking in well. This was a pleasant surprise! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually don't use a serum, but I really liked the L'Oreal RevitaLift Serum. The problem I usually have with serums is that they are too oily and thin and are difficult to spread evenly across my face. Much to my surprise the L'Oreal Serum was not like that at all. The consistency was between a lotion and an oil so it was thick enough that it was easy to spread across my face evenly. It absorbed quickly and didn't feel greasy. My face felt very moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using for several days I can see a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin and evenness of my tone. It is lightly scented which I love and goes on smooth. Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had never tried anything like this before, but I am very pleased with the results. My skin feels better than ever. I feel as though my pores are less noticeable, along with my forehead wrinkles. I don't know how well this product would work on its own, but along with the other RevitaLift products, I feel it's a really beneficial set. I would definitely consider purchasing these products after I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the serum before applying the moisturizer. It is clean and light and is absorbed into my skin perfectly. It fills in the fine lines very nicely. As an Olay Regenerist user for decades, I was really impressed with how nice and soft this product made my face feel. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Oh my goodness this stuff is AWESOME! I have acne prone skin and it did not cause breakouts! Yay! It makes my skin feel so smooth and silky yet not greasy at all. This feels like one of the high dollar department store products I've used in the past but without the high price tag. I love the way this looks in my bath! Such a high quality product! Packaging is great, product is great, skin looks better after using this product for only 10 days. I'm sold! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. This product is silky smooth, goes on like butter, and after just a week of using this product both morning and evening, I can feel a difference in the way my skin feels. The only downside of this product is the fairly strong perfume smell, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I first put the serum on it smelled like a hair product. I am going to focus on my eyes and the lines on each side of my face and hopefully the wrinkles will start to fade over the next couple of weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
No residue or film that is left on the skin. I have always been skeptic of the ffacial moisturizers by I have been using for the past couple of days in the morning and at night and I have to say I nnoticeably see a difference and i am impressed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product has shown some improvement to my skin. I have noticed mostly around my eyes, they do not look as tired. The product is light weight & smells nice, it doesn't have a strong smell. When applied to the skin it makes it feel like it's taking a breathe. A little bit goes a long way, so this bottle should last for a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Revitalift Concentrated Serum Treatment is wonderful. After washing my face, I use the serum and spread it out on my neck as well. It's soft, smooth, and has a delightful scent. My face feels good and looks fresh during the day. I like to pair it up with the Deep-Acting Moisturizer cream at night. And, in the morning end with the Sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am happy with all three products, but the facial serum is great! It goes on and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I can apply my make-up and not feel as though it is going to mess up. I can see a difference in my skin and I've been using for a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ive been using the product for a week now and did take before and after pictures. I do not notice a difference but I do like the way my skin feels. Definitely made my skin softer but dont notice a big difference in the appearance of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I most frequently use premium skincare products, and this is on the better side of average. The fragrance is a bit artificial for my taste, but the product spreads evenly and easily, the texture is just right, and it's not too heavy under a moisturizer. I would need to use it for a longer period of time to determine overall impact on skin, but so far, so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love everything hyaluronic acid ,it's great for your skin . The product itself fells light but once on face it's smooth and firms . Definitely deserves a try and will become for sure a must have ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have used the L,Oreal RevitaLift Serum Treatment now for 2 weeks and love the results. The serum is a concentrated loation and goes on so smooth. The results are wonderful.

"My skin is very fair, ultra sensitive and combination. In the winter, my skin tends to be drier. So, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is something I need.This completely moisturized my skin, without drying it. It was not heavy in texture or smell and it don't take much. I have been using it for 2 days and I am very pleased with this product. I recommend it 100%.

I was sooo jazzed to finally receive this campaign! I am enjoying using the Facial Serum. The formula is light and absorbs into your skin quickly. It feels good on my skin. My skin feels moisterized and toned but not tight or tacky as I have experienced with other serums. I have only been able to use it a couple of days so far but first impressions are all positive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did enjoy that my skin felt plumper in the morning after applying this face cream. However this was to heavy for my skin type. My skin was plump but also greasy. I really wanted to like this product because many face creams leave my skin not feeling hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is a terrific product. With so many products on the market this is a very good product. It will be replacing my regular facial care products. I usually have dry skin. My face is soft and I can see the disappearance of the uneven skin tone. I was also concerned about breakouts because I have sensitive skin.....Absolutely NO problems!!!!

"Great product. Feels great against my skin, non greasy, goes on smooth .. It absorbs great. Made my skin feel like I received a small facial. I will recommend this product to all my friends and family. Love it. I will continue to use and buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My trouble spot is the 11 lines between my eyebrows, that is my most noticeable wrinkles. I have used this product twice a day for a little over a week, and as of now I can see a slight difference, I am definitely going to continue using this. I can see a difference in the skin texture as well, my skin feels softer and smoother. I think over all I would recommend to anyone and I have already recommended to the ladies in my family.

This is my first time to try L'Oréal facial products. My first experience has been a good one. I was going to try this a week before I made a review but after only 2 days I can't believe how much my skin has improved. My skin is so much more smoother and softer. I am very excited about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product twice a day for the past 5 days. The first few days I was not very happy with it because my skin felt oily after application. Once I figured out that a little is all you need my opinion changed! I love this product!!! My skin feels so hydrated and smooth after using it. The bottle is a large size so I can see it lasting for quite some time. Please try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was pretty skeptical about this stuff. I was actually pleasantly surprised. It has only been a week but my face feels softer and looks healthier. I only have an issue with the smell but that is okay. I will definitely be buyung this when I run out. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love love the Revita Lift Serum. I have very sensitive skin and used this everyday for a week in the AM and PM. I had no problems at all. I loved how smooth it made my skin feel. I will be using this everyday from here on out and even keep it in stock at my house. My skin to me looked less dull after using this for only a week.

"I have only been using this five days and already I have had people compliment me on my skin. My face is noticeably brighter and smoother already! Iam in awe! The ""frown lines"" that make me look so much older than I feel are magically fading and the brown spots on my cheeks are following them right out the door! I am in love!

"Day 4 of using L'Oréal revitalist triple power serum, and I can say I cannot be any happier for this product. Super light weight, a little goes a long way, absorbs quickly , and leave your skin non-greasy super hydrated and smooth for hours. Best part is you can tell it works! I feel like I am using less make up, just a light weight face powder and I'm ready for the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to receive this freebie from L'Oreal. So I've been using the Serum for 4 days now, and I love the way it feels. It is silky and smooth on my skin and leaves me feeling very hydrated. I tried all three products together, but to me it was a little too much. Last night I used just the serum facial moisturizer and this morning I used just eh moisturizer and SPF day lotion. I like that mix much better for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my first time using a serum product and I can't believe how I've ever lived without it. One tip: After you apply the serum, allow a few minutes for it to completely absorb into your skin. I found that skipping this step made the product feel tacky on the skin and made makeup application twice as difficult. I'm very satisfied with the results and the glow it's given me. The texture of my skin is a lot smoother and looks great even on low to no makeup days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The face serum gladed on like and feels like silk. It has a wonderful scent that gives all day, my face has never felt so soft with any other. It even toned out my face 2 my(happy)surprise It will a definitely be a staple to my skin care.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the serum 3 days ago. I use it both day and night in addition to my moisturizer. It feels great going on. Makes my skin feel smooth. Doesn't leave a greasy feeling either. I have very sensitive skin and I've had no problems using this product. It also has a nice smell unlike others I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this serum every night and day for the past few days. I do like it although i find it leaves my face a little greasy. Not enough to keep me from using. I took a before picture and in a week or so i will do an after to see if i notice any changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used all 3 pruducts as advised and Wow my skin tone was even and looked flawless. It fells rich with moisture and feels like it has a blanket of feathers on it. The great thing is it is not greasy. I will keep using product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that is product is good. I tried it a couple times. The smell is very strong, but it fades after a while. I would still reccommend it to friends and family. It was good for sensitive skin and does help remove some fine lines i have on my face.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try this! I have pretty nice skin and I'm very particular about what I use. I use Retin-A, but I'm always on the lookout for a good serum. I really can't get past the smell. It smells very strong of what I would call ""old lady perfume."" It's not like it was a fleeting, I was aware of the smell the entire time. It felt nice comma the texture is smooth and I think it has a bit of mica and it which gives a nice glow. If it came in an unscented form, I could love it.

Ive been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for about 4 days now and at first the serum almost had a faint burning feeling but I didn't have a reaction so I kept using it. It is smooth and it smells good too. I'm going to keep using it and see what happens in the next couple weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I enjoyed trying this product!! I think that it was beneficial to my skin. I have used this product for a week and it has already made my skin feel smoother. It wasn't really greasy like so many other products are on your skin. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm always looking for a way to prevent and treat wrinkles and sagging. I'm only 33 but know that prevention is key. Within minutes of applying, I could feel the difference in my face. It felt smooth, firmer, almost dewy. By the next morning the difference was noticeable. My husband asked if I'd gotten a full nights sleep! (We have a 4 month old) will definitely keep using this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical at first about the product, I have fine lines around my mouth area and did not think this would work. Results for me were immediate! I could tell my skin felt and looked different. My skin is more radiant and the lines are not completely gone but definitely minimized. I have been using for only 3 days, can't wait to see the results after 30 days.

"Today I tried the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Facial Serum with the two moisturizers. I have VERY sensitive skin, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It definitely helped with the dryness, but also helped with the redness. I'm looking forward to what my face will feel like and look like in a week or two, since one morning is making a difference. I couldn't be happier so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal RevitalLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is a great product for older users. It really makes my skin feel and look smoother. The product doesn't have a strong scent and is not harsh. It's a great product and easy to use. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do not have many wrinkles, so I can not speak to how well it works to that effect, but after receiving it I started using it immediately and got results (hydrating and Lifting) in the first few days! My face is soft/hydrated. I for sure will recommend this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is great for making my skin feel softer, but I didn't notice a significant difference in my wrinkles. My skin felt softer to the touch and didn't feel so dry, which made me feel more comfortable, but I didn't notice any difference in the mirror, except that my skin did look more moist and hydrated. I thought the fragrance was a little too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I receive my package a few days ago. And I have been using it ever since. Upon opening the packages I was very impressed with the sleek and elegant containers. As for what's inside I've only been using it's only for a few days. The sense is inviting in the texture is light. I like the way it makes my skin feel. It doesn't make my skin feel heavy as the day goes on as I have oily skin. I can't wait to see the long-term effects of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Been using for little over wk. Absolutely love it. Skin looks more even and gradient looking. Youthful as my hubby says... Usually i have issues with new products and sensitivity but not at all with the serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is more than I expected. I have used a product of this nature due to my sensitive skin and allergies to many products. I decided to take the plunge and try this. AMAZING does not begin to describe the way my skin felt after using this product. No irritation only great feeling and looking skin. I feel this product would be a wonderful thing for a first-time user to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using all three products for five days, day and night. My skin is smoother and looks healthier. It absorbs quickly is light and has a clean scent.

"I have sensitive fair skin and am always skeptical of new products. No problems with blothes or breakouts...amazing! Lightweight and absorbs quickly. The skin texture is hydrated , firm and soft.

"The Serum Treatment is the first product to be used after cleansing at nighttime, followed by the Deep Acting moisturizer. I love this whole line of products due to the fact that after you but it on it doesn't feel heavy on your face and the clean scent is a plus too. So far I have noticed a difference and I like the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the serum treatment. Most serums I have tried are always thick and greasy. The L'Oreal Paris brand is absolutely different. Very light and refreshing. Even though it says to put it on my face and neck, I just want to put more on just because of how light it feels on my skin and how refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is amazing! I love that it doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my face and it soaks in pretty quickly after application. Some serums leave your face feeling so greasy that you just want to wash it right off but not this one! I put it on and let it work it's magic overnight. I just started using it and am excited to see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is a great rejuvenating serum. A small amount goes a long way because it is concentrated. It smells great and is easily applied on the face and neck. It makes fine lines vanish, firms the skin and evens out skin tone. I like that I get a healthy glow when I apply it. The longer I use it the better I look. It's a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for one week. I live the silky smooth feeling I n my face. Does not make my face feel sticky. I think my line are starting to go away. It gives my face a nice shine. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally use all natural moisturizer in my ski care routine, so I was a little hesitant to try something new. After my first application, I could feel some tingling on my face. The smell was pleasant, but not a natural smell. I used a small amount, but noticed as I gently applied it, the product balled up as I rubbed it into my skin. I am still skeptical... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first day I tried the Serum all my tiny, fines lines smoothed out. Not only that but my deeper lines became less prominent. At first, I was concerned that it would bother my adult acne, but it seems that the Serum is doing great. Cannot wait to compare my skin in a month! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very happy with this product. I have sensitive skin and cannot use most products, but had no problem at all with L'Oreal Paris Facial Serum. I have only been using the serum for a few days, but am already seeing results. My face already seems softer. I look forward to seeing the results after using it for a few weeks. Great product!

"On Saturday I received my first campaign YAY! I waited until Sunday to actually give it a try. The smell is very pleasant, lite weight in touch and non - greasy feeling when applying. Love the packaging a nice cute red glass bottle with white lettering. I have used this product for almost a full seven days now and it's truly wonderful my skin feels and looks fabulous. L'Oreal has a new found customer for life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The serum smells wonderful and the packaging is quite pretty. It has a nice, light feel to it. On its own, it would probably be great. The issue I have is that it's part of a ""routine"" with several steps, and it's just more than I can handle. I don't wear makeup, and usually just wash my face with water and a wash cloth. Having to use a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, and day cream in order to achieve the promised results is a little much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just got this in the mail and couldn't wait to try it out. I have used it 2 full days and nights. I put it on in the morning before makeup and at night after i wash my face. So far I'm loving it. My face feels softer. I haven't noticed much on the wrinkle part, but I will continue to use it and keep checking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I got my L'oreal Paris RevitaLift products yesterday and started using the Triplepower Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. It's way too soon for results but I will say that my skin instantly felt smoother and softer. I think that has to show in softening wrinkles and moisturing skin. I am anxious to see in a couple of day what happens!That is what I look for when I buy a product like this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this every morning so far since I got it and every night! It works amazing ! I love it . It's the first step in my skin routine. It's not sticky or heavy. It has no smell to it . It's a nice light weight moisturizer. I will never go without this now that I see results and how awesome it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is great! After just the first day of using it, people commented on my skin looks good. After just a few days, my skin looked so much healthier and smoother. Thank you L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only had a the product a few days. I find the product a bit heavy feeling on my face, especially when used as recommended with the moisturizer and day lotion. I am also not a huge fan of the perfume smell. I need to use it a bit longer before I am ready to say if it has improved my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the Loreal serum is ok so far. Only tried it for a few days now along with the deep lotion. Im on the fence about it, I need to try it longer to give a better opinion. Soaks in quick and makes my face feel soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The best product I have used. It really does help my wrinkles disappear. I think its magic. If you can't explain something then it must be magic. Well today, I believe in the magic of L'Oréal.. Try it for yourself if you dare. I was shocked! I hope when you go to the store and buy it its still on the shelf. The word may go around the shelf may be empty so RUN to your car and drive and get it NOW!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the size of the product seems a little small, but that is still yet to be determined, the container says it is concentrated. I liked the smell of the Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment It did not feel greasy on my skin. Even after it dried/soaked in, my skin still does not feel oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With my 40th birthday only a month away, I am VERY concerned about aged, uneven, rough skin. As promised on the results, my complexion appeared more radiant and I noticed a slight glow compared to how my skin was previously. I did not have to apply very much of the product to feel this result, which was nice since I feel like it will last a while. YES, this is a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I applied two drops if this serum after I washed my face tonight, and it feels amazing! The serum has a very pleasant (yet very mild) scent. I'm highly sensitive to scents and typically buy fragrance free products, but I love the smell of this serum. The serum goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. My face feels really soft. I was worried that it would feel greasy on my skin, but it doesn't at all! So far, I really love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very impressed with this product, along with the Facial Moisturizer & the Facial Day Lotion. I've always had very dry skin & have tried numerous lotions & moisturizers. After trying the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift products on my face it started to feel very smooth & not dried or oily. You need to use very little to spread on your face & neck. I would definitely recommend these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I added a drop of this serum to my night and day lotion, both of this Loreal campaign. I am someone who always felt the need to purchase separate eye cream however after trying this I feel that this is prefect for around my eyes as I have dabbed it under my eyes. Loreal makes great, smooth face lotions that has a smell that is not overwhelming. I love that a little goes along way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The serum felt a little greasy to me- it felt good and my face felt soft. I think the longer I use this, my face will want to have more of it on my face. So far I like the product and I will continue to use. As for the fine wrinkles I have I have noticed that my wrinkles are a little smoother and fells hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With the serum treatment. This is the first L'Oreal facial product I've used and I love the scent, the way it feels on my face, and how I immediately noticed a brighter complexion. Most products burn my face, leave red splotches and irritate me because they feel heavy but this treatment left my face feeling amazing and that makes me happy. I'm going to continue to use this product day and night to see how quickly I see more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This 3 step product is pretty good . The one thing I do recommend is using the deep moisturizer at night leaves face very moist .. The concentrated serum is my favorite along with the day lotion SPF 20 light feeling, alot smoother since i have started the skin product. I will comment on my results in few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Today a coworker, said I had a glow and another had said I smelled good. It was a win-win situation. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum was light and it absorbed very well into the skin. The fragrance is awesome. It has been on all day, and I can still smell it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love it makes my skin feel tighter. A little goes a long way. It smells good and absorbed quickly. There is a slight shimmer (not overpowering though)in it which I love. Not greasy or oily and not sticky. My skin feels smooth right after and it doesn't feel like I have a load of stuff on at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment I have used is a wonderful product that is light and pleasant smelling. I honestly don't feel like i have it on after i have applied it. It doesn't feel mucky or thick and heavy like some wrinkle serums can be. I would give this product two thumbs up I am a big fan already and can't wait to [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment is amazing!! This stuff is the real deal when dealing with small lines!! From the moment you put it on your skin you feel a difference! This is a wonderful product, not greasy or oily like so many others. My face was very soft and my lines less visible. Thank you so very much BzzAgent for sending me this product to test. I will surely buy more of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing it really works and doesn't take longer than a few days before you can notice a difference. My wrinkles and fine lines are going away it's amazing! And it also smells really good too! And all you do is apply to your face and neck twice a day, morning and evening. This is a product great for anyone of any age.

"I am currently testing L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. I only started testing on Sunday but so far I love how it leaves my face feeling. It is very moisturizing without leaving a greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think it's the right consistency for adding moisture and setting a base on my face. I've read other reviews that others hate the smell, but in contrast, my husband said he loved the smell of my face :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the silky smoothness of this serum. It doesn't smell like plastic or chemicals (which is one of my biggest complaints with serums). I just started using this and my skin feels great. As far as the long term effects, I can't say. But so far, so good. And it's affordable--which is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using the Facial Serum Treatment for a few days, but so far I love it! It leaves my face feeling moisturized but not oily. The packaging is also nice, as it comes in a glass bottle with a pump and one pump of the serum is plenty! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using both the Revitalift triple power facial serum and the deep-acting facial moisturizer as a combo for a few days , there is a noticeable reduction of the enlarged pores between my brows.My skin had a dull ashiness, but after using these (2) products I see a dewy glow and feel a soft suppleness. Because of the fantastic results that I've seen in just a few days of using Revitalift I'm eager to see the results of continued use. THIS ONE'S A KEEPER !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love, love, love the serum. I applied the product and my skin is glowing before I put my makeup on. As we get older we need to make sure that we retain that youthful glow by eating right, exercising and using excellent products on our skin. I travel frequently and also like the convenient sizes and packaging. I have found the skin care products that I needed to make me feel and look better!

I am trying a new face cream routine. started with this concentrated serum. it smells good. it goes on nice and doesnt leave my face greasy. can see and feel a difference after a few days. cannot wait to see the difference after a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have really enjoyed using this serium. It smells great (very clean smelling) and absorbs quickly into your skin. My face feels extremely soft and there was absolutely no irritation and I have very sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Day 1(PM): Triple concentrated serum had a smooth feeling on my face, absorbed thoroughly and left a non-greasy feel, has a pleasant scent. Followed by deep-acting moisturizer which had a thicker consistency than the serum but also very smooth and absorbed well into my skin. My skin feels Uber moisturized and non greasy, so far I really like the product!! I will update after 1 week of daily use and at 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved my package today 10/26/2016 and was excited to use it ! I did the first two treatments tonight before bed and its wonderful! Smells great and feels awesome on my face !

First day using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift. I notice it's not greasy or oily feeling and it's soft. It has a nice fresh sent. It is smooth on the skin and makes your skin soft. It works good with makeup on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been interested in trying a product with hyaluronic acid for awhile. IT got cold quick here this fall I've been struggling with dry skin on my face aND the edoes of my ears. I use this after my shower, I smooth over face and neck, it absorbs pretty fast, which I like. I put it on before bed and woke up without a oily face that to me is amazing. A little goes a long way with this product. Overall I've noticed as of today soft and more moisturized skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm usually not a fan of serums because they tend to be too oily for me, but this one is totally different. The L'Oreal Revitalift serum has a creamier texture and isn't oily or greasy at all. It has a pleasent scent, and absorbs into my skin nicely. It's too soon to tell if it has made a difference in fine lines, but it makes my skin feel like velvet and brightens my complexion. I'm loving this product so far abd can't wait to see the changes with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the opportunity to try loreal triple power concentrated facial serum. I've loved loreal brands for years, so no surprise that the product/product line is amazing on taking care of those pesky lines and wrinkles! I noticed the difference in one use. Each time I use the product is notice that I'm not seeing the lines and wrinkles as I was before using the loreal revitalift tribal power facial serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the very first time I've tried products like these. I was worried about it leaving a filmy/greasy feel on my face. Boy was ever wrong. The cream went on super creamy and smooth. It left my face feeling so soft and the fragrance was very pleasant. When I woke up this morning my face was still very soft and still not oily feeling. I'll get back to give you updates as I go along. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This serum is EXCELLENT!! It does EVERYTHING that it says it does.....as soon as i applied this (you apply it once in the morning and once at night and you don't need much) They said four weeks? no no.. i saw results in three days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I initially tried the serum treatment and was primarily happy with it. My face felt very smooth and had a slight glow to it. On top of that the smell was not overbearing and had a pleasant scent to it. There was a slight 'sticky"" feel to it but this went away by the time I woke up in the morning. My first impression is favorable to this product and I look forward to the long term results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Started the products this morning. So excited. Used all 3 products and the Serum is very light and makes my skin feel awesome. The Moisturizer again soaks right in, no greasy feeling or heaviness. The Day Lotion is an added bonus! Once all products dried, ( I let each dry before adding another product) I applied my makeup as normal and it looks great. Can't wait to hit the 1 week mark. So far so good. PS: The picture is awful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm not very experienced with serums, so I wasn't quite sure what I should be expecting. It wasn't heavy and seemed to absorb quickly. I do like that theres hyaluronic acid, my skin responds well to that, adding a lot of moisture. I'll have to keep using to see if it eventually evens out my skin tone, but so far I'm liking it.

"The Loreal RevitalLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment was a product I truly enjoyed! From the light claiming scent to the results, I am satisfied! The product at first is a little oily, but once rubbed in thoroughly the product feels light weight and my face looks every bit more radiant. This product makes my skin feel rejuvenated, and as time is creeping up on me this product makes me relive my younger years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Finally a serum that isn't oily or greasy, making it miserable to apply and head straight to bed. Prior to trying this, most other brands would take FOREVER to absorb or dry and many times I'd end up washing it off. This stuff is smooth and easily absorbs so you can follow it with moisturizer (like any great regime). So glad I got to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oréal has outdone themselves with this product. It has a great smell and the feel is silky smooth on my face. It has absolutely no greasy feel and seems to melt into your skin. It's a must have! And a small amount goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can sum up my experience with this item by saying: I SAW RESULTS IN ONE WEEK!!! It goes on smoothly, has a very light fragrance and absorbs very quickly into the skin. serum has a really nice texture and blends into the skin with no greasy feeling. It is comparable with much higher priced serums! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for three days now. The transformation of my skin is amazing. The dryness has completely disappeared, and has been replaced with glowing moisturized skin. My friends have already noticed a glow that wasn't there before trying the product. My morning regimen has been replaced, and I'm rejoicing about it. I have found a way to give my skin LIFE.

"This lotion smells amazing. A little goes a long way, a small pump covers my entire face! This is the first day I've used it (last night and this morning), and my skin feels so smooth!

"For any woman with combination skin, this is a great product. Not only does it NOT add oil to already oily skin, or dry out skin that is already dry...this product feels luxurious and rich going on but, is lightweight. It soaks in quickly and leaves your skin feeling fresh, clean and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed a difference in my skin by the second day of using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum. My skin was so smooth I couldn't stop touching it.

I used my L'Oréal Revitalift today. Put it on right away. I have had it on for a hour now. My skin is smooth soft and feels refreshed. The smell is amazing not too strong but beautiful. I am 41 years old and This is the first product I have used ever. A little goes along way so this will last a long time. My face does not feel greasy. looking forward to using this product for years to come. I will review back in a few days. Feeling excited [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like that it is lightly scented, so it doesn't get over powering when combining with the other moisturizers. Just like the deep acting moisturizer, a little bit goes a long way. Which is great, seeing as a bottle will last awhile. My skin feels slightly toner after using. After using a few days my skin is noticeably softer and laugh lines are softer. Over all a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this product was great. You only have to use a very little bit to do the job. I did notice, however, that it is not good for under makeup. I went to put my liquid foundation on about 45 minutes after applying the product and it made my makeup ball up and flake all over my skin. I will just remember this next time. I still enjoyed the product and how soft it made my skin feel. It smelled fun, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how quickly it absorbed into my skin and that my hands didn't feel oily afterwards. It spreads nicely and smells great! I am sensitive to smells and often have to wash scented lotions off, but I hardly notice this one. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin looks great after using this every night. I love the way it feels when I put it on it is almost like liquid silk. It absorbs fast and is not greasy feeling. It is super concentrated so it only takes a small amount. I will honestly use this product from here on out unless I happen to try something that I like even better. By far keeping my skin supple and soft this winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has worked wonders for me. My skin was in some desperate need of hydration. I really has no idea how much until I started using this. I have seen my skin just take to it and change within the past week. I know this is a must have product for my skin. No breakouts,no irritation..just great skin.

"OK, so I just experimented with skin care from a prestige line, and it WRECKED my skin :( I RAN back to L'Oreal and stocked up on my RevitaLift® Triple Power™ Concentrated Serum, RevitaLift® Triple Power™ Deep-Acting Moisturizer AND RevitaLift® Triple Power™ Eye Treatment. Within 24 hours, my skin was back to its beautiful self. Thanks, L'Oreal!!!"
"I just purchased this item based on reviews I've read, and decided to test it on my neck. The texture is thicker than I was anticipating (more of a cream), though sill seemed to absorb fully and doesn't feel greasy. My only issue at this early stage is that there seems to be a burning sensation, and has not gone away after 10 minutes of being applied. Hopefully this will go away--if not, it will have to be returned."
Works wonderfully! Took a week but saw a tremendous improvement.
1st time using this but it seems to work nicely.
I love love this facial serum. It'smade my face feel fresh & young again. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
