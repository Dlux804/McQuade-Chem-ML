I bought this while travelling in the UK and it has become a staple in my routine - however this product is not yet sold in Australia and I am running out! My skin feels soft and is noticeably hydrated. Please bring this product to Australia so my skin doesn't suffer!
"This is literally my favorite moisturizer I've owned. It hydrates and doesn't cause any breakouts. It helps with the redness in my face and really soothes my sensitive acne prone skin. If you suffer from acne and are scared to try a moisturizer cause youre afraid of breakouts, try this one. It really is amazing and so gentle. I love it"
This gentle product really does moisturize your skin. You can literally feel the water and moisture being drawn to your skin. It's a light gel consistency yet very moist. It literally does stay on all night. I used this on the dry patches on my face day and night lol. It has a very light fresh scent. Product compliments of influenster/simple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It has a lovely watery texture that just glides on and absorbs remarkably quickly. Completely scent and dye free. It does make my skin tingle with every application, and brings up a light flush so I'm a little bit wary, but multiple applications have not caused any further reactions. I have almost finished the sample tub I received for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin overnight typically dries out pretty badly during my sleep during the wintertime. I put this on my face after my cleansing routing at night and wake up in the morning with a nicely moisturized face! It has kind of saved my skin from oil as well overnight. Thanks so much influenster for sending me this box for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this stuff. I have fair sentive skin and my cheeks get red easy. This cream never burns or irritates and has such a calming relieving feeling. Btw all of my other make up and serums are high end(no drugstore) so I don't buy this for the great price, I buy because it works"
I got this complimentary of Influenster and it was really hydrating. It was super gentle and nice for sensitive skin. Did not cause any outbreaks & it made a difference to my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Bought both Simple skin n quench sleeping cream and hydrating gel cream and I have to say it's not a wow factor at all. My skin still gets dry in certain spots after awhile and have to reapply. I use facial oil to mix it with the moisturizer. I'm 50 now and it doesn't give radiance or collagen to my skin. Can still see dullness and fine lines. It's only good for basic moisturizer but nothing to improve skin tone and brightness. I don't think I'd purchase again. Sorry!
I will be so so so devastated if this is ever discontinued. It is one of the few things that calms my face down after a bad breakout!!
"I have combination skin. This product yielded the same baby-soft skin that a high-end Korean sleeping cream did at half the price. No breakouts, ever, with Simple products. Reasonably priced, and they deliver excellent care for sensitive skin."
The cream itself is suitable for California winter. I woke up with drenched skin. It felt like a thin layer of oil is applied already to the face in the morning.
"Love this stuff! Barely feel it on, and it's kind to my skin. Win win!"
I have very dry skin and when I used this I could almost immediately feel my skin getting tighter. The next morning my skin actually felt drier since I subbed this in for my usual skincare routine. I received this product free for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am through my first pot and off to buy a second I have suffered from acne roseacea for 30years and has totally changed my complexion thanks to this lightweight highly moisturising cream no redness at all now and it feels amazing too apply...really refreshing! Don't stop this product simple it really does work well done and thumbs up simple!!
"The day after I applied this, my skin formed tiny little bumps which is an immediate reaction I get when products just don't work on me. I like the consistency so I'm using the rest on my body which seems to handle it better than my sensitive skin on my face. I received the product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was able to try this out complimentary for testing purposes for Influenster, but it sadly didn't help my skin overnight. I have combination skin, so the first night I applied it all over my face and I woke up the next day very oily. The second night I decided to try out just the dry spots on my face and I noticed it did help them a little, but they still felt a bit dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am beyond happy that I received this product- not only does it hydrate beyond belief, it doesn't leave my skin oily! It's deeply moisturizing without leaving any residue on the skin! Thank you Simple Skincare! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like the Simple Skin Quench Sleeping Cream for a few reasons: 1 - The cream is not scented. 2 - The cream has a ""cooling"" effect at skin's first touch. 3 - Extremely moisturizing. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for review and absolutely loved it. It provides great hydration while you are sleeping so that you have a fresh hydrated face before you apply makeup the next day! It is comparable to Clinique's moisture surge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been traveling a lot due to different acting gigs. From Hong Kong to LA.. plane rides galore and my skin gave up on me. All of the sudden it became so dry and was sensitive to every “natural” moisturizer I tried. Until I tried Simple- Skin Quenching Sleeping cream. I can not go to sleep without it, the difference for my skin from only the first time is unbelievable. My skin now feels so refreshed thanks to this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's worth a try if you're having some dry skin issues! However i wasn't the biggest fan, felt and sat weird on my skin and it made me break out for a few days after the first few times of using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use the cream at night after I wash my face and I can immediately feel my face smooth! I wash my face apply the cream and when I wake up my skin looks clean and feels smooth to the touch!

I like the product so much that I will be purchasing once my sample runs out (: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was sent this product free by influenster, it is amazing! I have used it every night for about a month, and it has changed my skin drastically!

"I really enjoyed trying this product, however, I did not find it to be as helpful or moisturizing as I wanted it to be. I've had other face creams that were better for night repair. Not bad, just not enough to buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product complimentary for testing and I've been using it for about a month now. At first I wasn't sure that it was doing anything to my skin until I decided to lather a little bit more on than I usually did at night time. This made a huge difference! This product hydrates my skin and I noticed fewer dehydration lines than before. This cream always leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated and so silky smooth after I apply and it dries. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I typically don't use many products in my night time routine but this stuff is great! I love the light, airy feeling when you put it on. The next morning expect moisturized, non-greasy skin.

My skin has been super dry due to this crazy NC winter but after trying the Simple skin quench sleeping cream my skin was so hydrated and glowing after 2 days. So thrilled i received it as a complimentary gift in my Influenster box [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Hi

I really find this product very moisturizing. It does exactly what it describes it does. I would recommend this as well as their other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sleeping cream is VERY lighweight, it is more watery/get consistency. It does moisturize but, I personally like a thicker moisturizer for night time. I think it would be perfect for people that likes lightweight moisturizers. I love that it's scentless and that it's SIMPLE (not many ingredients so perfect for delicate skins). I received this product for free for teating purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"So far, I'm loving this moisturizer! It doesn't feel thick and heavy like most moisturizers- it goes on really light. It feels super soothing without making my face feel oily. My skin can get really dry with all the acne products that I'm using, but since using the moisturizer, I haven't had any problems with dryness.

I have dry skin to begin with so winter in the Northeast can be a nightmare. Adding this product on top of my hydrating oil has been a great combination to lock in moisture.

"I received this sleeping cream compliments of Influenster, and though it is very hydrating when during initial application on my face, there was a slight tingly feeling afterwards. I was slightly paranoid that it was irritating my face so I read the ingredients list which included more components than I expected. I may try this product again during the warmer months when my skin is not as dehydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for a couple of days now and I'm really enjoying it. I have oily skin so the formula on this product id perfect because its lighweight and it doesn't sit on my face.

I tried this product out for the first time last night after receiving it for free in a voxbox!

I just got this in my Voxbox and the first night I used it I was pretty much amazed how lightweight it felt on my skin and how hydrating it was! For someone oily I think this would be a good night cream product because it was more of a gel consistency rather than a heavy cream which I love. It is very lightweight on the skin and it soaked into my skin real fast. I didn't feel like I had product on my face which I love and best of all there was no scent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I received my voxbox for free of this product and oh my gosh I love this stuff!

I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ive been using this product for four days. One star for each day, the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because as a ""sleeping cream"" i expect it to provide more hydration. When I wake up the next morning my skin doesn't look as fresh and soft as when I use my Cerave night cream. This could also be affected by the harsh winter weather in NYC. I will continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really liked how this product works. It really does hydrate/mosturize my face, this is perfect for sensitive skin it doesn't irritate. Doesn't have a strong scent which personally is a + for me.
