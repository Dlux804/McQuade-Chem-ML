This product glides on smoothly. A little goes a long way. I use it in the morning and at night. It does not feel sticky. There is no string fragrance.
This is s fantastic moisturizer! It melts onto your skin! I use it all year.. cold winters and hot summers. The price is significantly cheaper than beauty stores. Check it out!
"This is the most incredible moisturizer. I'm over 65 and my skin is noticeable smoother, softer, and clearer. Diminished fine lines and has helped fill in the 11s on my forehead. Price can't be beat."
best hyaluronic acid cream out there so far. skin stays moisturized for at least 6-7 hours.
