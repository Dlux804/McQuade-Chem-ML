"I gave this to my 97-year-old Mother a couple years ago, and she is crazy about it!! I got this one for her, for Christmas, and she is thrilled. Most products fall flat, on their promises, but not this!"
Have used this moisturizer for many years and cannot bring myself to use any other. It keeps my face feeling smooth all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't have aging issues...yet. But I did have sun spots popping up and really needed to start moving away from acne creams that were over-drying my skin and start focusing on toning and moisturizing while sun-protecting. This Total Effects cream is magical! It feels great, it keeps my face happy, AND it took away my sun spots after four weeks of use. I only use it once a day after my face wash. I cannot express how much I love this product! Thank you!"
I have very dry skin and this moistureiser works wonders. Only after a couple uses my skin was soft and smooth. It is not pricey at all for the value. The packaging is nicely done and looks high end. This product is wonderful. The only room for improvement would be different scents.
Very lightweight and comfortable! It is very effective too! I love the fact that is has sunscreen to protect my skin while nourishing it at the same time.
"This moisturized is a staple in my daily routine. I use in the morning to provide some daily protection from the sun, and it keeps my skin healthy and moisturized all day long. The only down side I could see is that it does not provide that deep, pore moisturization even with multiple applications."
"I've used the olay 7 before, without the sunscreen, and I liked it a lot; I don't think this one works as well, and the sunscreen does not absorb well at all."
Goes on evenly but feels heavy and thick. Not to mention it is pricey and hard to find. Most places keeps this behind the counter or it's on a low shelf out of line of sight.
The best thing in world it my favorite part of getting up everyday an using this awesome light no oily mess left behind products I will definitely always tell everyone about this product
"Definitely a go to product! I was able to see slight changes to my skin after regular use. It's pretty budget friendly but not as budget friendly as other products. Because it's a duo product, you definitely get the bang for your buck."
Absolutely love this. It makes my body feel incredibly soft and beautiful. In the summer with the sun this helps with the sunscreen being in it. It doesnt di any damage and helps put the most moisture into skin
"First of all.. What sort of magic is in this container? I have been using the Olay Regenerist night cream for about a year, and I just decided to try this product out. In one week wrinkles are clearing up. Especially in the area of my forehead period I live in a country that is very hot and humid and pores can get clogged easily. This works perfectly. I don't think I can go back to Olay Regenerist . I have found my new love"
"Well, my opinion don't really matter because y'all know how promising olay is. My first use of it was when i got this map-like dark spots on my face, and even dead face skin, in addition. My mom suggest using this olay moisturizer and voila! I really love the result! Highly recommend it!"
is this the product that is sold as a moisturizer but is a makeup? if it is....it is a dual combination type which I use every day and have for over 5 years. I have used many top line makeup products before and always comes back to this one. very light not heavy and goes on enough to cover what I need to. doesn't feel like I have makeup or a mask on. love it!!
"This is my fall-back moisturizer, you know, the one you always go back to after trying a few over-priced ones that you dont see results with. I really like the pump on the bottle (les germs!) and the lightweight formula absorbs quickly into my skin. I dont find that it bears when I apply makeup afterwards. I switch between this and the Regenerist in summer for a higher SPF. I would absolutely recommend this moisturizer as a good drug-store brand! 4/5 because I want a higher SPF."
This is really nice! It does have a strong scent though thats the only downside and it seems to ball up if I was my face with a bar of soap but apart from that its really nice! I feel like it has something in it that makes you glow after youve put it on!
Ddidn't really see any changes after using it as prescribed. Not a fan of it so can't really recommend it to anyone. Make sure to go to an expert and let them see which skin type you are so you don't buy the wrong product. Was way too expensive as well.
i bought this product for my mom it works as anti ageing serum it provides skin with well balanced formulas that help to skin looking young it works for my mom on her dark spots and she really love to using it most of the face serum took so much time to absorve in skin and feels greasy but this serum is fast absorved into skin and dsnt feel greasy
"This used to be my go to moisturizer. I loved that it was a serum duo so you really felt like you were getting it all. I have extremely dry skin due to living the the Southern California desert and this made my skin feel so hydrated and supple. The only issue I had was the pump stopped working which makes it so you can't get any product. This happened to me on 2 occasions, but still a good product nonetheless."
"Aaahhhh. What to say about this product I'm just loving loving lovinggggggg itttttt so freaking muchhhh. This product is so effective. I will highly recommend this to everyoneeeeeee. Yessss , i will surely buy it again. Thank you so much for such productsss."
i feel it like a bit of sticky on my face after sometime (an hour or two) i hate the feeling but tolerable maybe its because its hot in my country and pollution are everywhere i just commute everyday so maybe its the sorrounding that contributes as well
I love this moisturizer for my skin to help it feel soft and glowing. It is affective in delivering everything promised on the advertising and packaging is convenient and easy to use. I also love the fact that it has some sort of spf so I can go threw the day without having to be to sun burnt.
I love using this during the summer it helps to keep my skin clear and protected from the sun. I love that its also a moisturizer so I can totally cut out that out of my routine because this is both a moisturizer and sunscreen! I have this on my guest bathroom counter and I get alot of compliments on how soft and smooth it makes my guests faces.
This stuff is great. It gets rid of dark spots and dull looking skin. The scent is nice and it's not to strong or irritating to the eyes and skin. It moisturizers the skin without leaving it super oily. The packing is great and convenient due to the pump.
I use this after I wash my face and it's all clean and shiny. I add a squirt to my hand emulsify it and rub it into my skin and shoulders. It makes me feel soft and fresh and energized. And it makes my skin feel balance mf. Not oily or to dry!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Olay as one of the best products from the drug store ! It is cheap and gets the job done . A lot of people do not have the money for high end products such as myself from being a full time student, so using products that work just as good as high end products makes life so much easier."
"While I usually love Olay products, I didn't find this product live up to the standard I usually get with Olay. It felt heavy and slippery. I didn't notice much of a change in my wrinkles or fine lines. However I did notice that it moisturized my eyes well."
"This is a very good product. It feels very moisturizing when you put it on but after a while, it doesn't seem like it made your skin less dry for a long time. The packaging is very good for its price. It is a very good product for the price that it is. I would buy it again."
I started using this a few weeks ago and I don't think I will stop! My skin is pretty dry and this helps it without leaving me dewy or sticky at the end of the day. I have seen improvement in both my skin tone and texture as well. Price is affordable compared to most. Highly recommend!
"Smooth and silly, I really love the feel of this on my skin. It doesn't cool my pores or feel heavy. The moisture level of my skin has improved. I like the pump but it seems to put out a little too much; one pump covers my face, neck, decollete, ears and back of my neck."
"I love all products made by Olay, but this moisturizer and serum duo is one of my favorites. The product goes on lightly but then gets to work. I put this on everyday under my makeup and it keeps my face feeling moisturized for at least 12 hours. Plus SPF is great!"
"the product, great smell, elegant package, cheap, easy to find, effective, good texture, creative package, I just love it! It really makes you look great. Nourishes skin. Using it for many years. Only thing is it would do much great with SPF higher than 30 for Indians."
Hey.. This is the great product. Smells awesome. Non oily on skin. Perfect moisturizer for a girl like me who loves skin care and no more chemicals ! It really makes you look great. Nourishes skin. Using it for many years. Only thing is it would do much great with SPF higher than 30 for Indians.
"i love both of them , they keep my skin moistruzed and smooth and so soft as well , also they protect me from the harch sun , i would love to buy them again , and i will reccomand it to anyone for sure ii saw a big improvement on my skin for sure once i used it"
"Just..an amazing product. My skin was breathing again, glowing.. It was ""fed"" really well and I had that feeling during the whole day"
I really like to take care of my skin and this product produces a special mut effect in mine I always use it
Great product. I would recommend it to others. It comes in a good functional package. Good product for the price.
Can apply it as primer and also you can apply it after washing your face in morning as well as evening best for skin care
a great product makes my skin really refreshed soft and smooth. I love this product would totally recommend.
Love! I have a very oily face it did not make me oily it actually felt like I had it on all day long! It made my skin so soft and it stayed that way. Definitely will recommend.
"Is perfect for every day, have everything that you need for the routine! Moisture, serum, solar protector and a little bit of color! It give you a nice and healthy glow, no foundations or concealers. Just this baby and your ready for the day."
It works good but its super pricy so i only buy it every now and then but it does what its supposed to do and i definitely recommend it. The only disappointment about it is how much it cost other than the price of it its good quality.
"Great overall product thats gentle on the budget and your skin, its definitely a staple in my makeup kit, it exceeded my expectations and Im a repeat buyer! The packaging was eye catching and made it easy to compare to other similar products."
I love this CC cream! I add this to my face before applying makeup because it gives my face a better complexion and really keeps my skin from drying up during the cold winter months and has sunscreen in it for summer. Over all great product!
My skin does not like this moisturizer at all. This moisturizer does not absorb into my skin. It just sits on top of it and if I touch my face it clumps up onto little particles that look like dried skin peeling. It also has a horrible smell.
I'm not a huge fan of this moisturizer...but it does a good enough job for being a drugstore brand. For some reason it doesn't soak into my skin very good...everyone's different so give it a try!!
This serum is great!! Worked really well on my skin made me feel so fresh and moisturized !! Well worth the money !! I would 100% reccomend to everyone ! I even got some of my friends to try it out and they loved it !!!
Love this cream and loved the tinted version. Definitely will continue to buy. I like how it didn't leave my face feeling greasy. It's a daily user for sure.
I really liked this moisturizer + serum. My skin stayed hydrated all day. My skin looked smoother and brighter. More of a glow to it. Price is not to bad either.
Just started using this product and love it it makes my skin so soft and feeling refreshed. I have only bought this product once but will be buying again. It is a little pricey but well worth it. I highly recommend this product.
"The olay total effects moisturizer is amazing, its suitable for all skin types and works like magic! The results are great and the packaging is so nice. It's really gentle on all skin types. Really hydrating, would totally recommend to everyone."
I like this product. It smells great though I find it a bit greasy when being used in a tropical country. It's good value especially if it's on promo. I find it effective in making my skin look radiant and younger.
I liked this product but it wasn't my favorite. I felt like my skin was greasy after I put it on. I have sensitive skin so I don't think it was the right choice for me. The smell was good and not too strong.
A daily routine skincare product both for my mother & I. Makes the facial skin bouncy and smooth. But very less liquid ounce for a higher price. It is also possible to find other drugstore products with a higher SPF. Olay is the luxury of drugstore.
Olay usually has really great products. This was no different. My skin likes this moisturizer. I got it from stop and shop when it was on sale. I do not regret the purchase
This is another product that help my acne to get better its a good product and I like the company it always create good prouduct a for their customer.
This is a great product for all year around moisturization for your skin. It is especially good in the summer months due to the fact that it has the sunscreen built in. In the winter months he provides great coverage for dry skin
"This moisturizer kept my oily skin moisturized and the serum made my skin feel firm! I don't know that I would purchase it again just because I love my normal moisturizer, but I recommend it for someone looking for a good drug store moisturizer!"
"A tad pricey for a drug store product. I like the whip texture of the product, it goes on easily and adds hydration to the skin. I really don't like facial products with fragrances and this product does not come with a fragrance free option."
This product even has sunscreen! It's perfect for a early sign of aging. I don't consider it strong but start early and it will slow down wrinkles and lines.
"The moisturizer from okay is a decent product, it does help my face feel moisturized and clean. The only negative is I don't like the scent. I have found and better moisturizer that I use daily and like better."
I love this product i used this to moisturize my face before i put on my make up and its keeps me moiturized love that ut has a spf on it so i dont have to put another product on my face plus i didnt break out and thats a plus for me
I bought this positive thinking it was going to do more than it said on the bottle that was a very impressed all the ways go use it because it smells wonderful!
I really really like tgis cream. It works with my lines and wrinkles. You have to use it regularly though and you will notice a difference. Leavea akins so smooth and soft. I love this product. It's not to expensive for the quality of this cream.
"Although this face lotion is hydrating and does protect the skin on my face from the sun, I don't like how it leaves a white cast on my face. I like face moisturizers that completely sink into your skin and you can't see."
"This product is pretty great! I use it on my face and it takes my wrinkly problems away! Not only is my skin great, but I love how smooth it makes me feel!"
Amazing product. Makes my skin fresh and soft. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. I haven't had any break outs using this so that's also a plus point.
i love this moisturizer it leaves my skin look stunning when i add on my foundation i love this and also has the spf 15 witch is very helpful in the summer it over all helps my dry skin not look so dull
Really does moisturize and has a great scent to it. I received a free sample so I tried it out but Just not in my price range for a moisturizer. Did leave my skin feeling great though. Would consider trying again.
"This was a gift for me, and I do use this every night since becoming pregnant my skin is very dry but this seems to do the job. I do use this at night."
I live in Florida so a moisturizer that also has spf is crucial to avoiding incidental sun when I'm outside for a bit. This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling hydrated and lasts a good long while without having to reapply.
This is an amazing product!! It is not my favorite Moisturizer but it is still really good!! I would recommend this to someone who is looking for an affordable Moisturizer.
"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I'm inlove with this product!!!!!!!! It's gentle in my skin, so soft and smells so good! I love the concept and packaging of this product!"
It was a good product. I had never tried it before. Winter is here and my skin gets very dry. I used this and it helps! It doesnt leave a greasy residue either.
Since becoming an Influencer I love skincare products now. Living a healthier and happier lifestyle and olay led the way. I use the scrub and the serum at night. I can definitely tell a difference between then and now!
"I like this moisturizer, especially since spf is already included, so I don't have to worry about putting on an extra layer in the morning. I would totally recommend this to anyone. Make sure to get the serum also for the best effects!"
Their CC did wonders for my skin. I saw overall improvements. I noticed a lot of positive changes in my skin while using this. It gives a little coverage and worked well under a powder foundation. This is a FANTASTIC buy with a great price.
One of my favorite moisturizers and it's great that it's currently on rollback! I like the smell and it leaves my face well moisturized. I don't feel greasy when I use this which is a huge plus for me. I am also writing this review to share my thoughts and experiences with this product as well as to enter into a #contest.
Love this line and product! Last a long time. The results are amazing and I would recommend it.
This broke my face out and had it swollen for a week. I only used it twice
Good moisturizer for the price. It is my backup moisturizer when I havent ordered my regular one online. No complaints about this product
I love the way this makes my skin feel it's so amazing and it smells so good n makes everything smell good and doesn't leave greecey hands
I used this everyday . And its really helps my skin to have a natural glow. i used it also when i feel my face is getting dry .
"I love love love this product, and need more, the moisture it bring is amazing leaving my skin baby soft. Nonetheless is doesnt leave an oily finish"
I love this. It moisturizers my skin so much. It smells good and is great for its price and for all ages!!!
Love the smoothness it makes my skin feel. I have used it for about a week or so and I can tell it keeps my skin softer every time I use it.
All olay products are amazing n lovely if u can afford them that is I love them n olay whips is amazing too love it
This is a great moisturizing serum that you can get at any local drug store revitalizes lifts and tighten
Olay one of my best brand .... Thos product is really amazing and usefull I love it and how it works ... really go and buy it
worth your money..... at first i thought it was just like other brands but after using it i realize that i was wrong....
This item is awesome. It works just like it says it would. I would recommend this product to everyone.
"What I notice most about this serum is that it moisturizes and protects from the sun, I really did not see any greater results."
I love love it. Has seven benefits my mother never had this before. I don't regret buying it not one bit..
"I really liked this product, and especially liked the smell of it! It left my skin feeling so soft and smooth!"
Great moisturizer and I love the fact that there is SPF in the lotion. I am really into skin care and this is a great drug store product
I've been using this product for 10 years and I love it! A little pricey but very worth it! I use everyday and it will last me 3 months!
Like the fact that this mixes moisturiser with serum. Leaves face soft and smooth. Only use products with SPF so am happy that this has SPF 15.
It's a good basic eye moisturizer. I felt like it could have been more moisturizing since I tend to get dry under my eyes especially in the winter.
"This product made my skin feel silky, it was light weight and it smelled awesome. The price is pretty low also."
This stuff is great! It's makes using night cream so easy because it has the cream and serum all in one!
I used this because in the winter I get very dry skin this product felt great it wasn't greasy and it worked great
Goes on light and is great under makeup. The price is good. It is very convenient to find at your drugstore.
"Very hydrating, makes my skin feel fresh. In comparison to other brands the price for quality is pretty good. I would definitely repurchase this."
"My go to moisturizer. Leaves my skin feeling clean, non greasy. Never get break outs and my skin glows. Affordably priced"
This leaves my skin silky smooth and does not cause acne. I am pleased with the long results and feel my face getting softer every day
I liked this product and used it for a while. I stopped using it when I found the neutrogena hyaluronic gel boost.
Love the moisturizer it works great and makes my face feel so smooth and rejuvenated. I will re buy this product again soon
Made my skin feel silky and smooth. Helps with fine lines and wrinkles this product is amazing. Will buy again
Totally love this product works beyond anything else. Love the light scent. Non irritating but is efficient
My mom loves this product but when I tried it I feel like it left my skin oily so I am not sure if I would buy it again
"USED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY ON MY SKIN AND IT JUST BLEW ME AWAY HOW IT MADE MY SKIN LOOK AND I,M A, FIRST TIME USER."
I love moisturizers that won't clash with my oily skin and this one certainly doesn't. I would recommend play moisturizers over all others.
Keeps skin hydrated and it fades away fine lines wrinkles and dark spots in your face and around your eyes.
"What a wonderful product ,it. Really does what the name says!! And its light weight onx your skin! What else could you want"
I love This products ! ‘Tis really works and gets ye job done. Using it every night before bed really shows a difference
Wouldnt really recommend because it feels quite heavy but i do like the packaging and find it compact for travelling
This is perfect if you are looking to moisturize and revitalise your skin. It sinks into the skin making it soft and smooth.
very moisturizing leaves skin feeling soft and smooth all day. Great texture and east to apply onto skin
Great to use before applying makeup. Keeps skin hydrated and moisturized and has SPF which makes it perfect for morning use.
heres the thing everyone seems to swear by olay and maybe i would like too but i just can't get past the smell
Great to use before applying makeup. Keeps skin hydrated and moisturized and has SPF which makes it perfect for morning use.
This product was recommended by my friend and today its a must have product in my list and do recommend this product
I have tried this and I must say it's really good . I just loved Olay total effect . It's one of my favorite product to use.
I like it very much because it is very costly and gaves good results. It is a day cream Discover natural fairness thats keeps you glowing.
Works so great and very nice packaging. Seems like a high end product but it's pretty cheap and effective!
Olay total effects moisturizer is one of the best I have ever used it takes away fine lines and wrinkles and leaves your skin do we soft all day long
Olay Total Effects range are truly great and very effective and you see results immediately it's highly recommend
My favorite skin care and moisturizer before applying make up and after cleaning and putting on before bedtime.
Good make up remover which also removes all dirt nd keeps the skin fresh without any dust remaims om skin
Olay total effect moisturizer plus serum is absolute remedy for dry skin and yes all can use this product
Great product. It is a light moisturizer that I like to apply at night and I wake up and my face feels soft and refreshed!
"I really love this Play moisturizer , it's great for your skin, it healthy and moisture and your skin looks and feels good."
"High quality product, great smell, elegant package, cheap, easy to find, effective, good texture, creative package, i just love it!"
Love this one as well. Want to get more of this I like it that much I see a deferent in my face. Repeat and recommend it to yall. Yes it did.
Ibreally love this product because its a moisturizer and a serum! I totally recommend tjis product girls!
Its a good product with nice fragrsnce and formula. makes my skin more hydrated and soft. Love it and i recommend to my friends
"This smells very good! So soft and applies very easy and creamy! Leaves your face feeling like a baby's butt, so soft"
I really love this product! This is an excellent brand. It gives me a perfect finish! I reccomend it so much!
"It smells good and it's really nice to blend not too thick so it doesn't irritate me , I like it and like olay products in general"
I have used this nd it is a awesome product. Leaves skin so soft and smooth. I would recommend this for anyone
"Olay is my FAVORITE brand for skin care by far. I began using it because it's what my mom always used, but it quickly became apart of my daily routine! I use this before i go to bed, before i put on my make up, and sometimes mid day when i feel like i need a little extra spf"
I love this moisturizer. I see results after the first application. My skin is firmer and smoother right away. It doesn't break my skin out. I normally where it under my make up and I look great all day. It definitely rolls back the hands of time.
After spending lots of money on expensive name brand products with little or not result I have come to the conclusion that you don't have to spend tons of money to get quality products. Olay products are great and they deliver what they promise. I instantly see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I statted using total effects after I got it for my mothrr and it was the wrong type. Rather than return it I used it. It has made an amazing change in my skins appearance. I recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tend to use the product for winter weather protection. The harsh winter winds seem to be more drying and I need this extra moisture to keep my skin fresh and clean looking. Living down South, this is a great product because you need the SPF all year. It's my go to foundation for 20 plus years and keeps you looking younger without heavy creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tradition is what geared me toward Olay products as they were used by my Grandmother, Mother and now me since I was 20 years old. This product does it all...balances skin tone, moisturizes but not greasy and I find it to be light in texture so it's perfect under make-up. If in a rush with no time for full make-up, the moisturizer provides just enough coverage along with the SPF 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There is no substitute for this item. If my favorites drug store is out of stock, I will search the entire city for this product. It leaves my skin looking young and fresh. It is very gentle on my skin. I would not use anything else! Its the perfect moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 61 years old and my skin is dry with some wrinkle .I had liked the idea that this contains serum ,has sunscreen and is fragrance free. I dislike this product it does not spread easy,my skin feels dryer and does nothing for my wrinkles.I would not recommend this."
Really like this! I love how hydrating it is to the skin and makes my foundation apply a lot nicer.
I love this moisturizing line of products. I use them every day and look younger than I am.
"Great product,totally recommend it to everyone with dry skin and need good moisturiser"
Since I have dry skin this products fits best for my skin tone. Keeps m skin moisturized.
"Love this moisturizer! Great to put on before heading out due to its spf, price point is okay"
Smooth application. Smells great and not irritating to my sensitive skin. Price is appropriate.
Love this product! Staple in my morning routine. I use it daily & eye cream at night.
Was a good moisturizer for sensitive skin and I am not a repeat user because it was expensive
Love love love! Didn't leave my face too oily and provided just enough moisture. Very happy
Love this moisturizer!! The duo with the serum is a perfect and less step for your skin routine!
Love this for every day use! It's a good moisturizer for everyday and suits all skin types
Not a fan of Olay products at all. I still have half bottle left And feel like money wasted
"I have been using this moisturizer for a long time, it really does the job for me. Highly recommend!"
"This is hardly used by me , but my parents use it on a regular basis as their night care routine & I can definitely say they love it ♡ #happyAndContent"
The best thing that I like at Olay Total Effects Moisturizer + Serum Duo with Broad Spectrum SPF 15 us that is not sticky and it absorbs fast. Perfect for my daily skin care. It works great for my combination 30's + skin.
"I really love this product, it helps memy skin to be more looks younger and smooth. It's not that much pricey. I recommend this to those who has dry skin."
This is my preferred moisturizer. I love that it has some body to it because I like a thicker cream. It spreads easily over my face and doesn't leave any residue feeling once it dries. I purchase this regularly!
Love this product it smells very nice and goes on very well. It does not leave my skin oily. It's Affordable price as well. I would definitely recommend to someone who is on a budget to buy this product.
It is a nice product for a very reasonable price. It feels nice on the skin. I have been using it for a while but didn't notice any changes on my skin. The packaging is nice but I think to switch to another brand.
I love this product! This product did not dry my skin out and my skin felt smoother and softer. I also noticed that it helped clear up my blemishes and I had less acne.
I really like the moisturization and sun protection of this reasonably priced brand. Soaks in easily. More ingredients/skin care benefits than some other recipes in the same brand.
"I love the three in one factor of this product. The serum and moisturizer regenerate and boost my skin, and the spf saves one more application in the morning which saves me valuable time. My skin is radiant!"
"I love Olay! This is one of my favourite products to use for under my eyes, the spf qualities really make a difference to the quality of the product. Feels super lightweight and feels like it brightens my eyes ready for the day!"
"Suits my skin which is normal to dry depending on weather. Started using it when U turned 30. And now at 32, my skin is still wrinkle free and smooth."
I love using this one especially in the summertime and after a day at the beach. It really helps my skin after a day in the Sun and my skin is feeling dry and in need of some TLC.
"Super light and hydrating, left my skin feeling soft and smooth , ware for every day under make up without feeling oily or too layered a great value for money moisturiser"
I love the way this Olay product with serum feels! It goes on silky smooth and doesn't leave my face with a greasy feeling. I often have difficulty finding it in stock. It sells out quickly!
"I've been looking for a substitute a tinted moisturizer I used for years that was discontinued. This is the closest I could find. It's good, but it's not dark enough to even out redness on the skin."
I love this product. I use it daily and it doesn't have a greasy feel to it at all. It makes my skin feel smooth and silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer, the way it feels on my skin, the way it smells. My skin just drinks it up : ) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Hydrates skin without feeling sticky or heavy, sinks right in. Smooth application thanks to the serum. SpF protection is awesome. Love the cute and sanitary packaging!"
"I have been looking for an inexpensive but effective facial moisturizer for a while, and after hearing about this one, I decided to give it a try. I have oily skin, so naturally anything heavy just comes right off. Even though this product is light-weight, it causes my skin to peel and flake all over, even throughout my driest areas. Swiping my cheek with my hand once causes layers of skin to come right off as if I was wearing a peel. If you have dry skin, I recommend this product to you, but oily-skinned women need to stay away."
It's really thick and leaves a little white residue on my face.
"Costly affair but worth it. Used 2 bottles in 2 years, smooths the face and just one drop evens out skin. Pores looks closed and skin looks bright"
This product is truly amazing my aunt got it for me and been using it since i always feel amazing and gives me such confidence using it
This product works! It's so amazing. Everything that is in this product works so well together which makes the product even better.
I love all Olay beauty and skin care products. This product is great to use as an everyday moisturizer. Highly recommend.
It is nice it also works as sunscreen because my skin gets red fast in the sun I like the packaging as well
The best facial mask on market hands down I enjoy how smooth my skin feels definitely recommend this to all my family and friends
"I have recently added this to my skin care regiment, i put it on after my moisturizer in the morning. A double protection against aging."
I took the Olay 28 day challenge and strictly used this as my moisturizer and I felt my skin being really hydrated and smooth
