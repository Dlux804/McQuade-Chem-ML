Always so nice to be able to use my older Remington Shavers knowing that Screens and cutter parts are available. Have one small one for Travel and bigger and longer lasting rechargeable one for home. Have been a Remington only customer since my 20s and I am now 74 : )
I should have purchased these replacement parts sooner. What a difference new cutters and screen make
Few week ago I purchase Reington Shaver Screens and Cutters and they are excellent.
I've had my Remington twin head foil shaver for a few years and I can't see ever getting rid of it. The quality is the best I've ever experienced. The battery charge seems to last forever still. I've only had to charge it twice this past year. I ordered replacement head and blades recently for the first time and was pleasantly surprised at how simple they were to replace. Snapped right in and only took a couple of seconds. Thanks Remington for a great product.
"Shopping on-line for this sort of thing is the only way to go. If I need to replace these parts again, I'll use the Remington website again."
I bought a Remington shaver about a year or two ago from Walmart thinking I would be able to get replacement shaver heads for it from Walmart. This was not the case for me. Walmart decided not to stock them so I opened a Walmart account thinking I could buy it online. The one I bought didn't fit the shaver so it was a big waste of money. I had to go elsewhere to get what I needed. Not happy with Walmart!!
"I had two MicroScreen2 shavers, one corded and one battery. Still have the corded in my travel bag. They give a much closer shave than the SPF300, close to a blade, even with a new comb and cutter. And they're smaller and lighter too. Bigger isn't always better! Will see what else is available when I replace the SPF300."
These replacement heads are expensive yet they are so cheaply made. They DO NOT shave like the original heads that come with the shaver. The original heads gave a much better close shave and last much longer than these replacement heads. Remington needs to make sure the quality of these replacement heads is equal to OEM heads.
"The foil on my F4900 razor tore and needed replacement. This is the part that replaces both the foil and cutters. Replacing the foil is as easy as snapping on the head. Older Remington's required you to remove the foil from the head and install the part, sometimes with some difficulty. With the new parts, the razor works as good as new."
After reviewing and comparing availability and price of replacement parts for my electric shaver I found that Walmart had the best online price. I placed the order and received a confirmation and the delivery date. I was pleasantly surprised when I was notified the parts were in a couple of days earlier than expected. All and all a very satisfying experience.
"I was upset when Walmart was not caring my product in the store anymore but they had it on line and when they said that it would take a week to get it to the store, in fact it arrived at the store three days earlier. I will be using service again in the future for any products that I am unable to purchase in the store."
I would not recommend buying Remington Shavers as none of the stores carry replacement screens or cutters so you have to order them which could take a week or more. Plus replacement parts cost almost as much as a new razor. I find the shaver blades and screens last about 3-4 months. I did find Walmart to be one of the cheapest places to order parts though.
"I was disappointed that I didn't get what the picture shows. I expected to get the shaving head and the cutters, too. Walmart.com needs to only picture what they're selling so we know exactly what we're buying. I'm not very confident in buying from them again."
"I bought an electric shaver for the cost and convenience and that is about it. You don't get a very close shave with these compared to blades but the convenience and the cost outweighs that, IMHO. Figuring about $25 per quarter ($100 per year) for blades, the cost of the replacement foils and blades for this shaver beats it hands down."
They are great screens and I like how well they cut the hairs
Fits my shaver perfectly and works well.
"Works great, just like the original"
I have made this purchase about 3 times in the last couple of years. Make the shaver like new and last a long time.
Its a great product for shaving it fits right in your hand you get a good grip and gives a clean and smooth shave
"Found the replacement screen and cutter heads for my shaver here, and even though my shaver is a few years old, they fit perfect and work well. Thanks!"
I bought this item about a month ago so that I would not have to purchase a new shaver. This makes the second time purchasing this item and my shaver is working great.
This is the second time we have ordered this item on line. We are very pleased with the product and the short amount of time it took to be delivered. Thank You!
"IVE HAD MY SHAVER ABOUT 10MONTHS USE IT EVERY DAY, IM ON BLOOD THINNERS AND MY DOCTOR SAID AVOID CUTTING YOURSELF. THATS WHY I HAVE A REMINGTON SHAVER I LOVE IT THANK YOU"
Couldn't find replacement screen in stores; so looked on line. Easy to find and website made finding the right screen easy. Delivered quick and correct. Will definitely use again.
"This part fits my razor perfectly, ordering was a snap and the part was delivered to my nearest Walmart. Very pleased. The price was the same or less than other online vendors, the plus was free ""Ship to store"" pick-up."
"I ordered these for replacement head on my father in laws shaver he purchased at Wal Mart 2 years ago. It was the only heads of this brand and style I could find in the store or online. It was not the correct size and although his shaver is only 2 years old, I never did find the right replacement and ended up buying a new shaver that that this head would fit as a back up."
"Have had this shaver for 3 years. Battery still lasts about a week. Shave with this style gets both longer hairs (ok, sometimes I don't shave on the weekends) and the daily-length ones. This is my third head, as I sometime am rushed, and shave in the car. That means that there are many ways to damage the head. Anyway, the heads last about 18 months if I don't damage them. Walmart had the best price, and quick delivery. All is good."
"Had my old set for about a year. Time to replace, ordered online Remington! Fast shipping!"
Glad I bought replacements rather than an entire new razor. Just like new again.
This is the third time I have replaced the screen and cutters.
It's like getting a new pair of glasses.
New cutting blocks and foil make the shaver operate like new again.
A quality shaving experience every time.
The new foil and blades have made my old shaver as good as new. I am thinking about buying another set in case they decide to discontinue them.
"Excellent replacement for my razor. Plus it comes with the head, not just cutters and screens, with the screens already installed."
I have more than 15 yrs. shaving with electric shavers. I have found that the Remington SPF Interceptor Foil by far is the best I have ever used.
quick and easy to order online hen a couple days later getting an IM that it is ready for pickup at store.
I was so pleased with the product and the price. The fact that I got free shipping made it even better.
"I would recommend this Remington shaver head , and the electric razor it is used on the Intercept . Very happy with this razor!"
The right parts at the right price. So convenient. I picked up at my usual store. I am very pleased with the service.
Very impressed! Turned my old electric razor into a like-new razor! Shaves are much closer and smoother now. Wish I had purchased this a year or two ago.
This shaver gives me the closest shave of any electric razors I ever had. I have used several different brands and Remington has been the best by far.
"I replaced the cutters and screen, and it's like having a new razor. A great shave!"
i received the product fast and it was exactly what i order. a great product.
Always had trouble with electric razors(tough beard) but this one for the price works really good.
Needed new shaver cutters. Big difference in how smooth my face is with new cutters.
"I like the proiduct, but I wish the foil would last longer without getting holes in the screen."
Fits well. Fast delivery.
"Great Product, shipped as advertised"
Fits my Remington shaver perfectly and works great.
Ordered this before and was very satisfied. Reordered again when I needed to. Does a good job.
was quick to order and simple to pick up and go. It was opened and was what I ordered. Nice.
Exact replacement for original failed foil.
"Fit, form and function - worked fine."
Good deal and easy to order and pick up.
The Remington Interceptor shaver is the best shaver on the market today. I'm
This fit the shaver perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.
Works as good as original.
"I ordered the wrong item for my Remington F5 razor, but the cutters and foils fit, so I kept it."
good product but shipping time was way too long for such a small item. over 2 weeks to come
Exactly what I needed for my specified model shaver.
My local Wàl-Màrt didn't carry this item. The free shipping to the store worked great.
Just what I needed to prolong the life of my Remington shaver.
"Part fit well, brought shaver back to like new performance"
quick delivery and fair price
My dad's razor head had a hole. He thought he would have to throw away the razor.
The product was easy to find on the website and the price was acceptable.
I could not find this part locally and was glad to get good service from WalMart online.
"This is the worst shaver I've ever owned. It's over-sized and under-powered. The shape is hard to hold onto. It takes ten minutes of steady shaving to achieve what I would call a barely passable shave. I received the wrong extra cutter and foil, but it doesn't matter because the shaver is in the garbage. I'll never buy another Remington product."
I think the replacement blades were over priced and the charge for shipping was was over priced since the item weighted nothing and could have been sent USPS and not taken 3 weeks to arrive. Overall very dissatisfied with product and replacement blades availability. Could not find anywhere in retail stores let alone the actual store I purchased the original razor at. If I had none it would be so difficult and costly I would have never bought the razor in the first place! Sorry you asked!
Easy to replace foil assembly and replacement cutting blades in one package.
Good quality name-brand replacement. Was easy to change out on my existing shaver.
the replacements blades and screen do not shave as close as the original equipment. It still shaves fairly close but not like it did with the original baldes. It takes many more passes to get a close shave.
"These foils only last about 3 months. They signify their demise by popping up a sharp wire from the screen break and scratching up your face. I like the shaver, but am disappointed with the durability of the foils."
The foil screens don't last half as long as the blades. They tend to tear after 1-2 months. You should consider selling the foil screens separately. I have to order extra sets and now I have a drawer full of blades.
"This is the 3rd Remington Shaver I have owned, and once again I love it! I've also tried Braun and others over the years but none brought as much satisfaction. Thank you for making consistently great products."
The shave feel great.
Good deal.
Lasts no more to be said
what I ordered
As promised
"Wish the screens were sold separate from the cutters. I have quite a few cutters in the drawer, just because I must order them along with the screens. This gets to be quite expensive for a Senior Citizen on a fixed income like me. Thought about switching Razors but like my Remington so much, this is not a possibility. Any consideration in this matter? Thank you very much, John Whalen"
"I have always love Remington Shavers, but now it seems everyone wants to make these things fancy. Go back to the basic models we used in the 80's and 90's These razors shaved as close as a blade, and would last for years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I finally had to let go of my last Remington Foil Shaver. 8 years of great shaves. The battery more than outlasted its normal life. The F5800 shaves even better and the battery is remarkable. 2 weeks is great! The interceptor is a great addition. No more stray whiskers discovered too late. Thank you Remington!
"I purchased this to replace a Remington F4790 dual foil shaver without intercept technology. I wanted something that addrssed the longer hairs and gave me a better shave. This F5 was not any better than the F4790, and the intercept technology is tough on my skin. It takes a long time to get a close shave. My unit did not come with a set of replacement foils. I would not purchase this product again"
"Does not shave as close as my old remington. Requires numerous passes to remove all stubble. There is a ""comb"" in the middle between the two cutters, and its sharp edges irritate my skin. On the positive side, it holds a charge really well and lasts a long time between charges. You will get numerous shaves from a single charge. It's shaped well and fits my hand well. The trimmer also works very well."
Great product. Has my razor working like new again
"The Remington shaver does a great job. I've been using it for the past 2 years. My only complaint is that the screens tend to develope holes in them long before I think they should. Other than that, a great product."
This is my second Remington shaver my first one lasted 12 years and now it was time to upgrade instead of just buying a new battery. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product is fine and necessary to continue use of razor. My big gripe is that the screens must be purchased with cutters. I have had several microscreen razors, like the razor but don't need cutters each time the screens are replaced."
"Although I find the razor to be better than the last Remington I had, I feel the price for the SPF 300 to be intolerable and will probably replace the razor with a different brands at a later date"
"These blades were a perfect fit for my F4900 Remington Razor and it made it shave like new again. I must admit I was concerned with the market filled with so many counterfeit replacement blades, but this ones legit, shaves great and the price was right."
Very disappointed in this replacement pack. I needed to replace the original blades and foil after about three months of use. The original gave me a close almost razor-like shave. This replacement set does not cut nearly as close. It is almost like a different shave now. I suspect it might be due to fabrication tolerances of the parts. I am also a bit concerned that this is a knock-off product instead of an OEM replacement. I hope the next set performs more like the original.
"Fit perfectly as it is OEM replacement parts! NOTE: The packaging does not appear to include the cutters, but they ARE included -- they are just packaged very cleverly inside the foil head. They are protected from damage by a plastic bag separating them from each other, and from the foil."
"I have a light beard so I have been able to go an extended period of time before ordering replacements. I think this is the second or third replacement blades over 8 years, but I was disappointed in these replacement blades. I went to replace because it was taking much longer to shave, but the new blades are even slower and they pull more than the old ones. Sadly, I bit the bullet and purchased a new shaver today."
"gets the job done without any cuts or nicks. Gives a pretty close shave. I use both my Remington and sometimes my blade razor. If you want a good shave, no mess and no cuts or nicks, Get this Remington shaver. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The foil on my Remington electric shaver started to wear after many uses. I needed to order a new one. It was shipped to the supercenter store In Jefferson city, mo on supercenter drive, and only took a week or less. I installed the new head on my shaver immediately and now I am a ""happy camper""."
"Love the Remington foil razors, good product, excellent price. The only issue is when you have to replace the head you have to go online for the purchase. Razors are found everywhere, replacement parts are scarce. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The ability to order blade for my SPF-300 by telephone and then mail deliver is excellent. The product arrived as stated. It was in great condition with no package problem. This is the 3rd or 4th time I have used this service. I am unable to locate the cutters locally.
"I've used Remington shavers since i started shaving, never had any trouble with them, a close shave, a clean shave, and a quite shaver. Well worth the money, no need to look for anything else. I am pleased with my purchase,and plan on continuing with Remington. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Bought raisor SPF3000 expecting it to last as others had. Found trimmer failed soon after purchase. Blades and heads too had shorter than expected lives. Replacements only available to me on line with expensive shipping costs. Gotta beat the horse till it dies to get any value from this raisor.
"My father loves this razor, was thrilled your replacement parts fit perfect. He so didn't want to give up this razor. Last year for Christmas I purchased a new ""different"" brand and he used it once. I caught him struggling with this old Remington and asked him about it. His face was so sad. Dad I said, next time tell me, and that's when I ordered his replacement parts and now my 89 yr old father, can't be happier! I will be sticking to Remington products for all the men in my family from now on! Thank you."
"Bought these replacement blades for my shaver. They are not as good as the original. I am not getting a close shave at all now. I was very happy with the original shaver blades. They cut nice and close, but the foil head wore out. The replacement is not half as good. I am not getting a close shave at all with this. Very unhappy with this product. I would not recommend it to anyone who has the same shaver."
"I like how easy it is to change out the old and put the new in. my only issue is that it seems like all new blade are not as sharp as the originals. I have had at least 3 remington shavers, not all the same models and every time i put the new replacement blades in its not as clean a shave as the original blade. I will still keep using my remington shaver."
My order was processed and delivered promptly. Replacement was easy and I was shaving within 5 minutes. I like my shaver because it is economical. Costs much less than wet shaving and simpler to keep clean. New to Electric shavers? You will love this one.
"I think that the F5800 is a great razor. It shaves closely and is easy on my skin. It holds a charge well. I have stopped using my blade razor altogether. My only complaint is that I had to buy new heads and a screen because one of the heads fell out into the wastebasket during cleaning and I didn't notice it. buy the time I realized it was missing, the trash had gone out."
"I got this electric shaver because on blood thinner. it cut my face all up because the screen got holes in it and cut me. I am disabled Hope you can replace screen F 5800 on limited income. looks like I am not the only one this happened to, Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this shaver for several years now. The cutters are great especially the center cutter which gets the high whiskers. It's charging feature is also especially effective, it takes a couple of hours. It cleans up especially well, you run the cutters under hot water and the top of the shaver and that's all there is to it."
I started using Remington products because my father did. I've liked the performance so well that I continue to use them. I tried another (more expensive) electric razor that didn't provide the same service as Remington products. I'll not make that mistake again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The shaver was purchased in May 2014. I have purchased new cutters and screens for it twice before with no significant problem. This time, the cutter assembly situated between the 2 screens in the top is not aligned parallel to the screens and will not allow me to shave without great discomfort. Never had this problem before."
"I have a sensitive face and have never been able to use any kind of blade to shave. I've used Remington shavers for over 55 years and they have always got the job done. I've tried several other brands, but I apparently have thick whiskers and none but Remington will pick them up. A good product for me."
"I own two different models of Remington men's shavers and wouldn't trade them for anything! I switch shavers depending on my mood. The cutters and foils last me nine to twelve months and I still could get a comfortable shave but I change them anyway. The cutters and foils are so easy to get from Remington in just days. Thanks,Remington! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I truly believe that this razor is one of the best on the market. One of the ways it makes excellent ratings is the ease of replacing the blades and cutter heads. When I went online I was directed immediately to where I needed to be and the purchase only took a few moments. This is a first-class product and organization.
"Plastic holding the F5800 razors cutter/foil assembly broke the first time I removed it for cleaning. This is the first time I only got 1 shave from a brand new razor. Gave a very nice shave but I can't afford to throw my electric razor away and buy a new one every day! I have used Remington foil shavers for over 30 years. That is about 10 years per razor. They ""ain't"" made like they used to. I'll check some other brands."
"I've been using Remington shavers for years, after I wore out my last electric razor I purchased a new one. It seemed like only a short time sense I bought this new electric razor, the screen wore out. Went back to where I bought it to find a replacement screen and could not find any. Went on line to find the price had more than doubled. My friends use other brands that do not have this issue. May have to think things over when the screen wears out again."
"This cutter head assy is an excellent product and restored my new shaver performance. In addition to the cutter action, there is a stray hair cutter at the center that offers great cutting effect. However this feature does make the price higher than for simpler heads. Since price is important to many users, this is a negative and therefore I rated this item as 4 stars."
I purchased the pivot & flex and I love it. It is much better than the rotary models. My concern is the durability. The head bumped the sink and the screen ripped. I had to replace the heads. You have a copy of my purchase. I don't know if that was covered under the warranty.
"It seems as if I just replaced the blades and screen (although it has probably been 2 or 3 months), and now the blades are not doing a very good job. Usually the screens tear before the blades get dull, but that wasn't the case this time. So, I would say that the screen is more durable than those I have had in the past, but the blades don't seem to last as long."
I really like the way I can clean the cutting blades under hot water--so they really come clean. The shave is really close and can irritate my skin if I over use it in the area around my mouth. Some users might complain about this if they have a sensitive skin. So far the head lasts about 3 months before needing to be replaced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"while the shaver, and the replacement parts when I had to order them work very well and were delivered exactly as promised, it costs almost half as much as the entire shaver costs just to replace the screen/cutter part I ordered. It would have been nice to just be able to order the screen, it was all I needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought the Remington as a last ditch effort to get a descent shave with an electric razon and used it new until it just didn't cut. At that point I bought the replacement parts and have tried again to get a close shave. I am disappointed with the results and am resigned to going back to an old fashioned safety razor to save time and get a close shave.
"I bought Remington shaver for my leg hairs. As a mature female I have thick - coarse hairs on my legs. I didn't think a women's shaver would be ideal for my body. The men's electric razor I do not use on my face, just my legs. It has been over a year since I purchased the razor and bought new replacement blades recently. The blades and new screen head are working well! Great quality for someone who wants to invest in this product long term such as myself!"
I purchased these replacement parts for an elderly neighbor. I asked him if he could tell the difference between the old cutter blades and screen. He said he thought the newer replacements cut quicker than the older ones he had been using. It doesn't take him near as long to complete his shaving routine.
I ordered these new cutters to replace the ones I'd been using for this past year. Had to order online because no store near me carries the replacement cutters. The new cutters don't cut as well as the old ones they replaced. Contacted customer care and they said they'd send out a new set. Very prompt reply to my concern.
I purchased this razor one year ago and just replaced the blades and screen. This is just an average razor. Even after a few passes with the razor it still isn't a smooth shave. It's also noisy in comparison to other razors I've owned. I won't buy another.
"Wanted to keep my MS2-390 as long as I could get parts. Thought it was my best ever. My new F-5800 performs very well. Intercept feature is particularly effective. Disappointed in the charger cord, very cheap & doesn't coil for storage. Overall a good value. Wait and see about durability. Have only been using it less than two months but have no reason to think it won't last 3-4 years. Would like to have seen a travel case included."
"...that I'd have to go to added expense every year or so, to replace the foil/cutters. Never had a shaver like that. In ~3 years, that's ;like buying another shaver. Cuts great, but would not recommend unless the initial price was much lower. 'Warning' should be on the exterior of the package."
"I've used Remington electric razors for about 50 years. The screens eventually wear through. I currently own 2 F-4900 razors and have been unable to find replacement screens from local retailers – even those where I bought the razors. Hence, I bought online in advance of my first/anticipated screen failure."
"Remington razor is average compared to other brands, but it is less expensive. Where they get you is when you have to order replacement blades and usually the blades only last me 3 months before I have to replace them. Sometimes it is cheaper to buy a whole new razor than just the blades."
While this shaver does not cut as close as the older models did it is still one of the best for me for now. The screen does not last as long before it wears thru and the cutters work on your face also. Replacement parts can not be found easily in stores so need to order online. The products seem to be made cheaper (but not less expensive) all the time.
"I purchased and am now using the Remington F5-5800 electric razor. I have had it 6 months and just bought the replacement blades and head as recommended. I must say, I have never been an electric shaver person but on a whim I bought this one and I must say I am receiving the best shaves I've ever had in my life. It has been a pleasure to use this shaver everyday. I love it. I recommend this shaver to anyone who really wants a close, clean and comfortable shave."
"Lord knows how, but the original screen developed holes. Ouch! The replacement screen and blades eliminated the problem and the razor runs like new. The price was the best I could find on the net, purchase notification and delivery were prompt. What's not to like?"
I have had this razor two year and have had to replace the shaving foil twice . I have spent twice as much on parts than I did on the original purchase. This is definitely poor quality product and I would never again purchase or recommend this razor. Model F 5800
"I bought the other guy first, you know, the one with the triple round head. I was impressed, at first, but then maintenance kicked in. I found it much too time consuming. After some thought, and checking, I bought Remington. So glad I did...I'm loving it.. Great shave, same as other but, one tenth the time to clean. And, I find it more comfortable. Finally, it cuts the long or short... Super great idea."
"I generally like Remington shavers so when the screen became pitted, once again, I tried to find JUST the screen only to be disappointed again. My cutters were fine but Remington chooses to ""package"" them as a set with the screen. The price for the ""package"" + postage + ""wait time"" to receive is not worth it. For about $10 more dollars, I could have bought a complete new razor and not had to WAIT. I won't do it again."
Arrived quickly and they sure make the shaver like new again. I'll try the head lubricant spray. It should make the foil last longer. That would be good as the quality is excellent and is the most comfortable shaver I have ever had. The only reason I gave one notch down on the value was the cost is a significant percentage of buying a new shaver. You can get the shaver at discounted prices but not the replacement foils. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Remington I have only used remington electric razors for at least the past 25 yrs. but the new cutter head on this razor is so loud it is totally unreasonable. The original head became just as loud after only a week or two which was the reason for ordering the new head. I switched brands but with the same style cutter head and it is quite the opposite. It is extremely quite and I get an equally good shave. Sorry Remington, I had to try something different. Dave48142"
"Very satisfied overall with this product. I have the F-5800 shaver with black diamond foil and would like to see black diamond offered as a replacement and not be limited to stainless steel foil. The interceptor is a great feature, it eliminates the need to break out a blade or use another grooming tool. I like my 5800!"
"While we would have liked to have purchased from the factory outlet at a discounted rate, we were glad the deal with the company direct. They shipped quickly and ordering online worked well enough once we could see our model could use one of the replacement heads."
I enjoy my shaver especially since i cant use a standard razor. When the blades are new the shave is very nice. The machine even hums better. I enjoy getting the new parts for that reason. My only complaint is that it seems way overpriced. I could almost go buy a whole new shaver for the price of the replacement parts. Really doesnt make sense. And getting the auto delivery doesnt really save you that much. Overall it is a good product despite the price...
I have pretty rough facial hair and grows really quick. I had tried other shavers but none worked very well. So I had been using the razor blade and shaving cream for many years. My wife and son picked the F5800 for me and its the best. The cutters and screen are great. It takes no time at all to get a smooth shave. Thanks for everything
"Googled Remington. Found I had a wrong part number, got the correct part number. Ordered part. Received part in 7 days. Part is now sitting and waiting until original part fails. I ordered a new part before (shaving head) the old part failed. During cleaning I noticed that the cutter fins were failing which is why I ordered a new part.Mel6"
"I love the shaver, however I have had to replace the screen and cutters on an average of every 7 months. The cutters are still fine at that point and would probably last another 5 months or better. I would buy several screens every order if they did not come with the cutters, however you must buy them together. I will probably look for a different shaver after this current screen goes bad, one that does not require replacing the screen so often."
"Whan I purchased the original razor it was missing one gutter. When I finally realized it I purchased a replacement head & cutters. I am keeping the original head and one cutter for replacement. The razor, now complete and functional, gives a great shave. Ordering has been easy and delivery was prompt. Thank you."
"I'm an African American man that suffered with razor bumps before I started using Remington electric shavers in college. The ones with this type of cutter and screen are a God send if you suffer from razor bumps, I've been practically bump free ever since!"
"The older shavers had the three full cutting blades which gave a much better close shave. You advertise that it is three heads but the one in the center doesn't cut close. It takes much longer to shave but it misses hairs and you have to keep going back over the area. If you have a three foil shaver, please let me know the model number."
"This is a step up from the 4800 shaver, nicer design, less noisy, heavier razor, and a step up in the rechargeable class of razors in general. If the motor doesn't quit after 2 years like the 4800, I will consider a true upward trend in quality of hand-held razors for Remington, since they stopped making the cheaper versions..."
"I just receive the new ones. I only hope they last longer than the originals which were worn through in just a couple of months. At this rate I'll be buying a new razor every year, which has never been my intent. I had really thought that Remington had finally produced a razor that didn't go into self destruct mode in the 1st year of operation. By the way, my Grandfathers razor still works. I should have had him buy me one back then. Very disappointed."
The pop up trimmer doesn't cut longer hair and does a very poor job cutting/detailing side bearns or mustache. The interceptor trimmer did not perform as well as I expected. The only good to decent thing is the foil on this shaver. I would go back to buying an older remington model rather than buying this piece of junk
"The cutters and heads are just what I needed to allow me to use the razor without tearing up my face with torn screens like I was doing. Now, it would be great if I can get the thing to turn on - the power button on my F4900 razor quit working - I could use my new cutters. I guess I'll have to get another razor that uses these parts so I'm not throwing money away."
"Since I've been using my shaver, my typical experience has been that I would get 6 to 8 weeks use from replacement SPF300 blades before they would become too dull to use. The last three replacement SPF300 blades have only given me 3 to 4 weeks before they became too dull. Maybe it's just a bad production lot and the blades will get back to their former level of quality. Prior to this recent experience, I would have given the blades 3 stars. Now, it seems that 1 star is appropriate."
"After waiting far to long to order the replacement cutter and screen for my shaver, it now works perfectly again after doing so. The offer for future automatic shipments is very handy, as I will not need to remember to order next time- the items will just show up when needed."
"Seven months ago I bought a Remington F-4900 electric razor and was very happy with the shave I got. The blades got dull and my shave wasn't what I wanted so I ordered new blades--I know the blades must be replaced every few months. The new blades perform as poorly, if not worse, than the old blades. It takes forever to shave (the blades don't seem to cut well) and I don't get a close shave."
The replacement cutter did not fit in the holder. I had to remove the cutter from it's bracket and use the original bracket to make it fit. I think you ought to look at it since some may not have an engineering background and simply return the whole assembly.
"The newer Remington cutters are average. They tend to wear faster than the ones I had used over the past 5 or 6 years. They newer cutters are a little less expensive, but they only lasted about 4 months as compared to the 6 months I had been used to. The lower price does not make up for the lack of durability."
"I have been a loyal Remington customer for close to 20 years and have really liked all of my previous razors. The pivoting head and foils don't shave as close as previous, non-pivoting, dual and triple foil razors I have had. The pop-up trimmer is terrible and barely works. I'm disappointed that pretty much all of Remington's foil razors have a pivoting head because I don't think it cuts as close as previous models."
"These screens and cutters for my Remington shaver do the job extremely well. I have sensitive skin, and they enable a very close shave with virtually no irritation. What little neck irritation there is can easily be taken care of by a decent after-shave balm. By a significant margin, these screens and cutters work the best of any such products I've owned."
"New head cuts well especially when I use pre shave powder stick. I have very heavy facial hair & do not think the shaver head will last for 6 months, because the last one would make my skin burn by 5 months If you have a better type of shaver or head that would last longer, I would like to know about the product. Thankyou."
"After about 2 weeks the razor is slowly adjusting to my face and gives a relatively close shave, although I would like to see better results. I think the shave would be closer if I weren't so gun shy about razor burn from the blade between the screens in the hair pocket. This design flaw is the major drawback of the product. The old razors without this feature worked just fine."
"I really like the flexable shaver head on my F5800 shaver. I get a really smooth shave every time. I feel like the shaver head gets every whisker on my face. I like the way it feels in my hand while shaving, it's very light weight for such a powerful motor behind the cutting blades. Only a few minutes to recharge now that's really nice."
Some of the earlier models were much heavier and harder to use. I've used Remington shavers for 20 years and the SF-4 has been one of the best shavers to date. It gives a smooth clean shave. It also is very ergonomically suitable for my hands amd is light weight. Thanks for thinking about the customer in design this product. Frank C
I have only just received the F5 shaver and it is too early to tell much about its durability and overall performance. The limited experience I have had with it has been pretty good but it doesn't appear to shave as closely as the Remington Model MS2 390 it is replacing after 5 years of outstanding service. Given my previous satisfaction with Remington shavers I must conclude that the F5 will also work out at least as well.
"I have a new Br 3500 but it does not shave close,So i purchase the Remington 300 to try it out. That the best move i ever made the 300 will shave closer,Better and easy easy to use its an outstanding Shaver. I Love it so I did purchase a set of Cutter and screen as i know one day will wear out and i will be ready. Robert"
"I find that ordering direct from the factory is faster, easier and cheaper than finding the replacement parts from retail outlets. The shaver took some getting used to as it didn't seem to shave as close as my Remington triple headed razor. However, once my beard got used to this unit, it worked as well as my old razor. Replacing the heads on my old razor is quite expensive compared to the newer one. Thank you for good service. B. Bronov"
Fit the old Remington F-5800 razor. Everything works fine.
these replacement blades work great. very easy to change out the old ones
Can't beat for the price. Works great. Fast delivery
I bought replacement blades and screen head and it is like a brand new razor. This is the best electric razor I have ever owned!
"THIS IS THE CLOSEST SHAVE I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME ! THE CUTTER BETWEEN THE FOILS , I BELIEVE , MAKES THE DIFFERENCE !"
The packaging is misleading as online it shows a separate blade packaged with the head. But what you get is the head and it doesn't show the blades which conveniently are packed now behind the head. So don't be confused you're getting everything
A new shaver head always represents an improvement over the use of an old head. This item greatly improved the performance of my Remington shaver. And the price was incredible.
"I bought this as a spare for the shaver I just reviewed. The four star rating is based mostly on cost, which was very reasonable compared to the replacement heads that I used to get for my Norelco."
I knew my Remington shaver wasn't doing its job. I don't know why I put off ordering a new shaver head replacement. I now get a great shave every time.
Shaving is quick and easy but not as close as using a blade. I've used Remington micro screen shavers for years and they shave closer as the screen is worn thinner.
Overpriced. A whole new razor might have been more cost effective since the battery is now failing. This just gets me mad since this practice leads to more stuff thrown into landfills. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"SPF 300 screens and cutter blades are great. They work flawlessly and like all Remington products I can trust that each new set will be as good as the previous products. Brand loyalty is built around consistent quality, performance, and durability."
"While my old shaver head and cutters were overdue for replacement, it was understandable that it tore up my face. However, the replacement was even worse. Maybe I need to grow a beard?"
"As always,Joyful they came quickly and were exactly what was needed even though the shaver is an older model. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When the foil on my shaver wore out, I found the replacement screens and cutter online. I was happy to find these parts because l really like my Remington shaver."
The product works perfect and there was a noticeable improvement over the old blades. Gave it 4 stars because of the high price but the product works.
"Have been using Remington products for all of my shaving life, being 76 that is a long time. When circumstances dictated me trying a few other brands, no way . . . . . . have always come back to a great electric shave, that is reliable."
The cutters I bought don't seem to perform as well as the original cutters. Maybe because they are not Platinum? I have used the new cutters now for over a month and it takes as long to shave with them as the old cutters did after 1 year.
This new screen and cutter was easy to replace. It made my razor cut like new again. I feel that it is over priced. It costs more than half as much as I paid for the razor new.
"Used my Remington shaver for over 10 years. Never had a problem with it, just kept ordering and using the blades and shaver head. Never failed to maintain great performance at a reasonable price."
"As a longtime user of Remington shavers, and I'm pleased with the quality and durability the products, and the SPF-300A is no exception. The SPF-300A screen and cutter features the intercept technology, which delivers an impressively close shave."
The SPF-300A replacement has the same quality as the original foil screen. And the original worn-out foil as easily removed and the replacement foil was as easily installed.
When I ordered the razors and screen it was easy and fast. The product came quickly and I have been very happy with the product and the service. Thank you.
The cutter which is designed to cut loose hair on your face also scrapes your skin when shaving. I do not think I am applying to much pressure when shaving. It would be better to eliminate this extra piece in my opinion.
"After the initial foil was torn, needed to find a replacement foil (or replace the entire shaver.) Searched about a dozen brick and mortar stores with zero success, and then found what I needed online."
"I've used Remington shavers for 50 years. I think I started before Univac sold the shaver division to concentrate on computers and changed its name to Univac. So far, this shaver is as good as all of its predecessors."
"Fine product; restored shaver to like-new performance. Can't comment on durability, yet, as I've just begun using these replacements. Value and performance appear excellent."
"I love it. No more yanked hair and painful shaving. I can go the whole weekend without shaving and use the shaver without any concern that my beard will get caught and yanked. I love it. Besides, it gives me the closest shaves ever."
I have used Remington shavers in the past and this new one is great. So much better than the Braun shaver. Replacement parts are so much cheaper! You get a closer shave than a Braun. I gave my 2 year old Braun to Goodwill!
I have two Remington razors both the same & the screens got a hole in them. No one carries replacements parts and I was so glad to be able get the parts to make them as good as new.
I purchase the foil head for my F5800 model shaver. It seems not to perform as good as the original. Also more noisier than the original. Not very happy with the replacements heads.
"I am disappointed that my shave with this replacement is not as good as the original. And, of course, I am not sure why. I was expecting better things and didn't get it!"
My dad loves your razor and he was upset his razor part had dulled! He is not one for change so I was surprised and glad that you provide replacement parts!! Thank you so much!
Dads 1 daughter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use Remington and have for the past 60 years but they are no way as good as the old Remington Shavers. I loved the Remington 45 type configuration and began shaving with them in 1957.
"Not expensive, but average performance. Not as close a shave as others I've had, but not bad. Only ordered this because the previous screen developed a hole of unknown origin, so durability not so great either."
"The blades and screen are not the issue. The switch to turn the razor on and off is defective after just over a year, rendering the razor itself useless"
"The housing holding the cutting razors broke when trying to clean the heads,. That was one problem. Then somehow lost one of the heads, and didn't see a way to order just them. So ordered yet another housing."
these replacements are very good but expensive and very hard to find especially if you are in Canada. No website and the USA website will not ship and you can't order from a Canadian email address?
"The only difficult part was trying to find the correct screen and blade set for my specific razor, after that the ordering process was very easy and the shipping arrived in a timely manner"
The cost of replacement blades is hardly worth it. For a few dollars more you can buy a whole new razor. The quality of this system does not live up to the Remington reputation. Next razor will be another brand.
Works ok WHEN it stays together. Have to push the foil heads back in place several times during a shave. Replacement head was hard to find and then this happens. Will look for a different brand.
I ordered SPF-300 replacement screen & cutter for my Remington F5 (F5800) electric shaver. It arrived on time and fits perfectly. I'll definitely order this product again.
I installed a new screen and cutter set into my 3 year old razor and am very happy with the results. After a few uses the razor now is as good as new for a fraction of the cost of a new razor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product, but your website doesn't function as it should. Difficult to pay with credit card. Knocked me out of the site while trying to give credit card info. TWICE."
The new screen and cutters for my Remington Shaver are a miracle. I get the closest shave you can imagine. I highly recommend this product when the old screen starts to get holes in it. My razor performs like new again.
"The screens and cutters give a good shave, though I cannot tell that the interceptor feature helps and I now prefer the SPF-PF73 shaver head for both closeness and smoothness."
The Remington F5800 provides a great shave for my curly beard. The ability to get replacement cutter heads is very much appreciated. The cost seems reasonable and the delivery was very prompt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This shaver is best I have ever owned. Foils last about a year and give a great shave. I also own the F-3000 model which is slow and foils last at most 6 months.
The new cutter heads do not wotk as well with the new screen as the 18 month old ones. I used a old screen and new cutters and that works a little better
"I thought it was the cutter, but apparently it was the cord that was frayed even though I had wrapped it with electrical tape. I replaced it once; not going to do it again. The cord should be replaced for free due to poor materials used."
"Thr BEST in a field of mediocer products. Why it is not the best seller of all shavers with a powerful motor, excellent cutter head, reasonable replacement costs and reliable??"
"Best remingtot razor I have ever had, and I must have bought at least 15 in my 65 years of shaving. Only negative comment is that is that it the on off switch is badly placed as it often inadvertently switches off whilst shaving."
I have tried everything out there and for some reason this razor gives me the best shave period. It blows the expensive razors out of the water [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Though I was looking for the triple head, this works just fine. I'm not an everyday shaver but cleans me up when needed. Have not had to recharge battery yet which is a plus in my book."
Since I don't have that 'He-Man' type of a thick dark beard the 'film' type WORKS for me just fine. I even purchased one of those 'temporary/emergency' ones some years ago that lasted for over 15 years.
"The replacement parts worked just like the original cutters. This is the second set I have ordered for this original shaver. Both sets needed four or five days of use before they gave smooth, close shaves. After that they performed as advertised."
I ordered this product for my husband. He really likes the F4900 razor and is pleased with the replacement cutters. My only question is how come the replacement cutters cost nearly as much as buying a whole new razor?
"An easy, reliable source for replacement parts for my older Remington electric razor. They make it shave like new. They always get my order right. Other on line sources have shipped the wrong parts."
"This is a good shaver and has lasted longer than the previous three other brands that I've used. For this one, I replaced the blades and gave it to my son."
"With the new blades and screen, shaving is much easier and smoother than before. I highly recommend this product to every one. :-D [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is often times difficult to find. So wonderful that Walmart carries this. My father is in a nursing home and relies on many to get his needed items. Thanks for carrying this product.
"I would like to see lower prices on replacement foil and cutters. I like the shaver, and have owned only Remington shavers for many years, but prices for replacement parts are high."
"This is a good razor and cutter. As my beard grows gray, it would be nice to have a more durable cutter and screen. I find the cutter dulls quickly when cutting a gray beard. I still prefer the old microscreen to this product for a closer shave."
All parts arrived in a timely fashion. They all fit my old machine perfectly. They all appear to be as good as the original items. A bit pricy; 1/2 cost of original purchase.
"Title says it, the shave is great and the cover is easy to remove for cleaning, The F5800 shaver is not the easiest to hold, slippery and the on/off button is easy to shut off when shaving. Satisfied."
"Bought a Remington electric shaver in February 2014; now purchasing my THIRD replacement foil. I expect foils to last 4 to 6 months; these have been failing at about 2-1/2 months. Like the shaver. but if happens again, I'm finding another brand."
Had not been able to locate this product in the stores. I finally went to the website and ordered them. My husband & son are very pleased with them. Will be ordering again in the future.
My shield lasted only two month before it got a hole in it. Have a new one will let you know//////// [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Remington products and have used them for 30 years. However, this is the first razor I have bought that has disappointed me. The cover sometimes pops off when I shave. Very disappointing! Need razor where cover is secure in place."
"Products are great but why are they so hard to buy? Used to be you could buy parts at the stores. But now you can only buy them on line, it cost more and takes longer to get!"
"I have used Remington shavers for many years with varying degrees of satisfaction - mostly good. My present one holds a charge for almost two weeks, and the cutter comb lasts for four or five months. It is the best shaver I have ever had."
I just replaced my blades and foil. The unit doesn't shave as well as I think it should. All of my previous Remington shavers did a better job. This one still does a better job than any Braun I have used.
i am disappointed that the blade broke six months of purchase .disappointed that the blade cost so high. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I started using Remington my shaves have been a lot better and actually faster. I would recommend this product to others that are not getting a close shave, my Remington shaver will do it."
I received my Remington Shaver for Christmas and I recently purchased Screens and cutters as a back up. I haven't used this shaver that long to offer a substantial review at this time.
This products features make it the best electric ravor I have ever used. Screens cut close and the cross cutter removes those little white hairs that the screens can't get.
"This replacement does not cut. The razor worked well for a short time, however the cutters wear out quickly. OI suggest you keep the shape but return to the early micro screen cutters and screens."
The 1st set of SPF- 300s I was very pleased but the set I received is dull and leaving my neck looking terrible. 1st time Ive ever had an issue with Remington through out the yrs!
"Had a Norelco for years and never had a problem, surprised to see the screen on this Remington crack, now if it does it once a year, like the lst one, it will cost a lot over the years."
So far this is performing much better then the other brand's floating head shaver that I had and quickly came to hate. I hope it continues to be this good.
good it does a good job but I just wish the price would be lower because I would change more and buy more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
No problem with shipping time or the product. I just don't see why the replacement head costs almost as much as the whole shaver. I really think that they should be able to do better than that.
The plastic frame that holds the screens came to me broken in half so I took the screens out of the new broken frame and put them in my frame so I could continue to use it without having to wait for a new on to be redelivered.
Great price which will keep me coming back for replacements. Shipping was timely and packaged well. The screen itself wears thin rather quickly however the F7800 has been a wonderful razor that keeps a charge for weeks and weeks.
"Does the job, just not easy to find with newer models on the market. If they ever phase this out, I hope I get a warning, the shaver is working excellently for the second year now!!"
I recently ordered a new shaver parts and blades and the servoice was fine . I had no problems finding the part and getting it ordered. It arrived with little delay. Bill
Fits perfectly makes for good shave.
"The foil shaver works great, but the pop-up groomer is awkward to use."
The search and order process was simple. Thus website detail made for a perfect match the first time. Shipping was fast.
The replacement shaver head and brushes worked fine. Much better to replace them than the whole shaver.
Picture shows blades are included....they are not. Wasted a trip to Walmart to pick up. I returned the item.
For some of us. Its not the blade we need so much but the foil screen. Why can't you do a bubble package with 2 to 3 foil screens in it.
The new blades seemed to be duller than the ones I had been using. I ended up putting the old blades back in.
"I have had this product for over 3 years and am very happy with its performance, and with the speed I receive replacement parts. Good job Remington"
I found it to be good the screen will last about 3yrs [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really happy that you make this product available online. Even the store where I originally bought the razor does not carry replacement cutters.
Excellent product but overpriced considering that it is 80% of cost of total shaver. Unfortunately the shaver is no longer available.
Works great....only reason I needed the replacement blade is because I dropped my razor and a chip came out of the blade
"The screens and cutters fit perfectly. Shaver works like new. Nice, close shave. Was else could you ask for?"
"High quality product for the money. Often hard to find parts in retail stores so burn up gasoline searching, NOT, just order it.Howeird50 ."
"The replacement screens and cutters are simple to install and they restored the ""like new"" quality of the razor."
Shaver cuts through even recently shaved beard ! New screen and cutter work flawlessly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This electric shaver is the best! I've used this shaver for almost 2 years and just order a new head and blades every year. Highly Recommended!
The order came quickly and at a very reasonable price. Removing the old and installing the new was so simple. Love my new razor.
These two items keep my razor operating smooth and shaving close. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
product works very well and produces a clean shave. Am sure it will provide many during its lifetime.
"This is the third head change, but they each last about a year. I consider this acceptable as the shaver motor/battery just keep going and going !"
I have to replace the head and blades two times in about one and a half year. Product needs some improvement or cheaper replacement prices
You should offer replacement screens as these develop holes and need to be replaced before any other parts.
I am happy with the product as far. Have used it daily the past month without issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Remington for 66 years and will never change [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been pleased with my Remington Shaver and glad I could extend the time I can use it by purchasing a ""renew/replacer""."
I bought this for my husband. He was very happy we could buy it on line. I was very happy with the price. I will buy it again!!
The shavers with this head give the best shaves ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I simply love the service,the blades are superb. Thank you ann stormer,and all you guys in the warehouse."
"Blades lasted about a year, very inexpensive to replace, received in four days. I will stay with Remington."
This replacement package makes my old Remington F5800 electric razor work like new. Not sure what more we could ask of a product. Works great!
I like the way the screens last and the delivery of the new screens was great. Would recommend this to my friends.
i really like the cutting blade between the screens [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Good value for the money, better than buying a whole new razor, husband said the razor is just as good as it was brand new"
"Like every Remington shaver . Great features, Very smooth and comfortable shaves . It;s the only one i will use."
This was a product that was best suited for my purposes. I will definitely return for future purchases.
The product (SPF 300 shaver head( is well-built and a trusted back-up. Ordering was simple and delivery was swift.
The right replacement blades for the right price! It's hard to find the correct replacement blades for my shaver...this site has it all!
"Easy to find, really fast shipping and great service [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The replacement screen and cutters are excellent. The original unit heads lasted me over 2 years. I hope they don't stop making this replacements.
I needed a new shaver blade which I bought from you because you sell them. The new blade works well.
very pleased that we can purchase replacement screens that fit an older shaver........cant find them anywhere.
I ordered the product because the foil on my razor had torn. New products came much quicker than I expected.
"BLADES DON'T LAST COST TOO MUCH, IVE OWNED 5 OR 6 SHAVERS, BLADES DON'T LAST FOR THE COST! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I find that the foil wears out a lot faster than the blades. This is the only complaint I have with this product.
"Have had my F5800 foil shaver for years. Finally the foil disintegrated. Got a genuine part from Remington, it snapped in, and on I went. PERFECT."
I LOVE MY NEW REMINGTON SHAVER IT DOSE A VERY GOOD [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always used remington products and found them to be excllent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It works fine. I just wish there was a local outlet so I would not have to send away for the product.
"The screen I received, had a crack on one edge of the foil. I didn't notice it until I had scraped my face a few times. Never even felt it."
Had a great shaver until I replaced cutters & shield. Double checked parts nos. & they're correct. Now what?
Over all it does the job without any scrapes or burns on the face after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The F5 shaver works fine however the Body and Back Groomer did not charge enough to operate any of the attachments.
the shave is better than any other product I have used [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 83 years old and have been using Remington shavers and parts for as long as can remember, always with complete satisfaction."
Have used Remington shavers for the last 50 years.The F5 does not get as close a shave as my Rem MS3 2700. but will keep on using Remington products.
"Love the razor, just wish the replacement blades we're available in the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this shaver and the cutters it uses. The shaver runs a very long time without recharging and the cutters do the job!
"had razor 6 months and screens that covered blades developed hole, had to order complete screen holder and blades rather just the screen itself!"
"Expensive, half the cost of a whole new system. I only needed a screen do to damage, but had to buy blades too."
When I received the blades they fit perfectly on the razor and even as my special needs son drops it and the blades fall out they still work!
"great product,extends the life of the shaver,but cost is about half of a new shaver. think before you buy!"
I am using this product for a few years now. It gives me a clean shave with no irritations. Durable product and well worth the money.
I replaced the blades and foil on my F4900. It performs somewhat better than before but not even close to the new 590.
The screen wore out in less than 5 months. The shave you get is great. Remington tells me rotating head is recommended for tough beards
The replacement foils & blades need to be available in retail stores. The price is way to high for parts designed to fail.
"This shaver is very fast, very reliable, excellent battery lifetine, good shave. Replacement screen was sent fast, too."
The product is excellent! it worth the price. and is durable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The items were installed about 2 weeks ago. They do no seem to shave as closely as those that came with the shaver, so shaving takes longer."
They are even better than the original that came with the shaver. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It was like having a brand new razor again after I used these replacements [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Seems to be a little heavier built then the original. Very pleased with the ease of replacing the entire cutter head.
Received on time and in excellent condition. Ordering was easy and straight forwarded. Could make installation instructions a bit more clear..
"After a half dozen different electrics, my Remington F4900 is the first that has ever given me a clean, smooth.shave."
This shaver shaves closer and with less iritation than any I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Good product at a reasonable price. Shaver works well and is easy to use and clean. Recharges very quickly when needed.
Screens & cutters function well when used with pre-shave lotion. Durability is also increased due to the lubrication of the metal.
I am totally satisfied with replacement cutters & screen. I get a real close shave. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
did not expect new cutters included in the price and have used for a few weeks and the qaulity seems very good
"I like everything about my razor,but the cost for replacement heads is too high. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product fit very well on the razor that I have. I will definitly order another one when the need arises.
The replacement screen is a great improvement over the original which gave me razor burn. Now my shave is smooth and close with no discomfort.
I viewed several other shavers before selecting this one ... it has been an excellent choice .... works great.
"Purchasing the new blades and screens was a snap. Got them in just a couple of days. I appreciate good service, Thanks."
"I like the way the SPF 300 works, but it's very expensive for as long as the screen lasts in every day use."
"After a couple of shaves, the shaver is performing as bad if not worse than it did with the old screen and cutters."
Quickly received. Another quality product from Remington. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been a Norelco user for many years...but now I'm very satisfied with my Remington Shaver...and it's much much economical cost wise!!
very good razor good that we can get parts fast to keep using the item [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using Remington four ten years now very good shaver one set back with this shaver the pop up trimmer died 3 months after i got it.
the foils don't last long enough for the cost of them !!! i could have a new shaver every time i order two sets !!
Ihave used Reminton electric razors for most of my life. The continuous improvements to the product keeps me coming back.
"It's a fine shaver, except for the SPF-300 replacement part. Where do you find it? I tried several different sites, but no luck."
"Does better job than previous 3-screen on my Remington on my type of beard. Previous Remington tended to miss individual hairs no matter how carefully you shaved, where this one doesn't."
The product is exactly as I expected. It is working great in my shaver.
MAKES THE SHAVER WORK JUST LIKE NEW.
Exactly as advertised. Worked perfectly.
"works great , arrived quickly, THANKS"
the replacement part is noisy and may not last ver.y long
OK replacement if the razor is still in good shape. Pricy for just cutters and screen.
Good service time. Much higher price than I would like to pay.
Got this great shaver for Christmas and loved it but head broke. So happy it could be replaced.
"It works like the original, smooth and sharp, only it is expensive for a spare parts."
They are pricey but what are you going to do when the screens a cutters ware out on your shaver.
You need to renew the shaver head and blades to keep the razor performing up to it's potential.
Good product; good service; prompt delivery; works just fine.
The product works as advertised giving a very clean & close shave without wasted effort or time.
The new cutters fit and were easy to install. Made things easier again.
"product as described, no complaints, have ordered several times. Wish they lasted longer."
Screen & cutter is a lot easier to change out compared to my last model. Sure to like that feature.
"Product is exactly what I needed, works great, good price, quick delivery."
excellent product. feels good to shave with a new cutter. thank you.
Exactly what I needed. Works great. Good shipping speed.
A good idea to replace screen and blades annually. No more skin irritation!
I came back to Remington foil after many years with rotary. The 7800 has exceeded my expectations.
These parts were what was needed to restore my razor to like new performance.
Great product. Very easy to order and I love the reorder feature.
"For me it is as close a shave as I get with a blade, and no bleeding ever."
Hubby really likes the product & says he likes how the shaver feels on his face.
The replacement SPF-300 Cutters do not cut as close as the original cutters.
I wear out the foil far faster than the blades therefore I need only the foil which is not offered
"Works as good as new, which is very well!"
able to use on my very tough beard - only one I have found to do so.
"works great, beats having to buy a brand new shaver each time."
Outstanding store - Outstanding product - Outstanding price!
These replacement parts make this just like a brand new razor. Very good investment.
Love this item. Should've replaced a long time ago!!!
Overall great buying experience
These blades and foil lasts almost a year. Very sharp.
"These do a good job, easy to replace, and last a long time."
I find this the best source for replacement parts.
"The product is a snap to install, and it's unbelievably durable."
Makes shaving good again. It replaces an item that was 6 months old.
I wish the original blades would have lasted longer
It was easy to install and seems to work as well as the original shaver did.
Thank you for revitalizing my old shaver. Worth every penny!
Remington replacements have always been a great experience for me
This is my second Remington razor. I will buy another when this one wears out.
this product does every thing I ask it to do every day at home or on the road
A good clean shave. Reasonably priced - Best shaver I have had in many years.
These shaver blades do a great job. they lasted longer than I expected.
use manufacture replacements parts to keep your razor in service for a long time
THEY ARE NOT SHARP AS ALL THE OTHERS I HAVE RECEIVED
The part I ordered fit like a glove. No complaints from me.
easy to unstall seems like the original didn.t last too long
For an electric razor it works very good and doesn't irritate the skin like some I have used.
This works better than the Remington rotary shavers.
product restored as new performance to the devicejohnn
"This Item made My razor perform like new, the installation was easy and well documented"
Remington is the best. Will not use anything else.
I have always used a remington shaver and find them very reliable.
"Ordered through the internet. Fast delivery. Excellent, smooth shave."
I like the razor. And the blades seem to last a long time
"Works quite well, and will stay with the Remington brand."
"Pricey, but less than buying another razor. My husband is happy with it."
I've used all types of electric shavers and find this one gives me a quick no-nik save every time.
couldn't find replacement at favorite store. ordered on line. store has it now.
"new screen and cutters made olde razor , just like new !!"
These are the best that you have made so far to work on my face.
Ordering parts was easy to find on line and shipped fast.
Product received within 2 days! Love my Remington!!!
"It's just a great product, especially for a tough beard like mine."
So glad to have found this website. So easy to order and fast delivery! Thanks!
Received product in a timely manner. Works great. Thank you.
The replacement Foil & blades were an exact duplicate of the original. Works fine
"The replacement works good, but I amnot sure why the original went bad after only a month of use."
Works great. Close shave. Nice to my sensitive skin.
Was able to get it ..it is not a part that is even on the Remington web site
This work good.....................................
The new cutters allow me to continue to use my old shaver that i dearly love. I get a clean shave.
The blade replacement kit were just as described. Best price I could find.
Exactly what I ordered and needed. Perfect fit for an older razor. Fast shipping.
Very pleased with this product. Would recommend this any one.
My Remington shaver has given me consistent smooth shaves daily.
Excellent product and service. Keep up the good work.
Excellent product...easy to install; new shaver performance.
Good shaver but could be a little lighter to hold for the time it takes to get a good shave
"Very good product, but pricey Had o order on-l;ine, no local retailer carried these"
"This item was easy to order, quickly shipped and received in good working condition."
Unable to find replacement parts in stores. Had to go on line to find replacement head.
The razor with SPF 300 replacement works as well as the original blades and screens.
The replacement screens and cutters do not cut as well as the original
I like how it all comes together. We don't have to buy separate pieces. It lasted 6 months!
"Im shure Remigton products are high qualityy, but I had to buy some pieces that I not need."
"Gives great close shaves, with no irritation. Strongly recommend."
You get exactly what you pay for re these replacement blades. As good as new!
Product is good and has been used since 1949. Owned about six Remington electric razors.
Titanium coating on the shaver screen would improve performance
The original screen and cutters were excellent. The replacements not so good.
work well-good fit and finish-only needed one of the three parts so price was a little high
Gives me a good close shave on my face. Also does a good job shaving what hair I have on my head.
Cost as much as a new one not worth the money Don't like the cost for what you get
Product is good have to replace heads frequently but gets the job do e
The parts arrived in record time. They were very easy to install and made the razor feel like new.
"Replacement parts are too expensive, probably better to just buy new."
replacement screen & blades cost almost as much as new shaver
I can't say enough Great razor! Would highly recommend!
"I received the product in a timely fashion, it was inexpensive, and it works wonderfully!!!"
This Shaver quit cutting in 3 days. It has been sent back. Very Disappointed.
2 yrs with this model and can't complain. Cuts very close to skin.
The new screen and cutter has brought my shaver back to like new condition.
Awesome product and excellent customer service. Flawless delivery.
Broke the 2nd time I used it. Through it in the garbage and bought a new electric razor.
Parts are of excelllent quality and were delivered promptly.
The best shaver ever with a fast and close shave even without pre shave!
Have used Remington shavers for at least 30 years and will continue to.
Replacement cutters and screens are just what was needed. I will reorder in 6 months.
This was a great buy for our money. Recommend everyone replace theirs too.
I have used Remington shavers for years and I really like this product.
F4 gives a closer shave. F5 does better with longer facial hair
I have been using Remington for 40 years and this is one the best shavers I have bought
Pleased with product and service. Timely delivery and proper billing.
"good close shave, long lasting blades. price good. very happy with remington products"
I've been using my electric razor for 1yr. I'll never go back to traditional razors. Thanks REMINGTON.
works fine as always
couldn't find in stores
