After applying for the first time my skin felt amazing. It feels fresh and hydrating but still light weight. I have noticed my skin looks better and has even lightened dark spots on my face.
"I've been using this product for a year now and I think my skin looks great. It's smooth and soft. The serum is not sticky, it goes on smooth and drys well. Love this stuff!"
A great product. I love how it goes on easily and disappears into the skin. No greasy film. It makes my skin look healthier and plump instead of dry and drawn.
Lovely creamy serum. Softens and plumps skin. Very nice.
"I am a 51 year old female and was starting to get some lines on my forehead. I started using this product under my moisturizer (Clinique moisture surge) and the fine lines disappeared! I've only been using it for about 3 weeks. Just remember, serum is to be used under your moisturizer, not by itself. I think I'm going to buy Derma e facial cleanser now."
I have been using this product for over a years not and it is the most affordable and quaility product I have come across.
Nice moisturing lotion. Good clean smell. Not too much like perfume. Really appreciate it.
"Product states its all natural, yet it has a heavy perfumed scent. Will not repurchase."
"This product just didn't hydrate my skin, I didn't feel any benefit from it. I love the night cream but that's turning out to be the only product in it's line that really works for me."
"I have to say, I'm disappointed in this product. I can't stand the smell so after using it once, I won't be using it again. Kind of smells like sweet papaya. So, if you're sensitive to smell, don't buy it."
