"I use this wonderful night cream every night and I wake up in the morning with smooth, soft and unwrinkled skin!!"
I was excited to see Derma E available through WalMart. It has the ingredients I've been searching for in a night creme. Great product and fast delivery!
"For a cheaper night cream, this is fantastic. After one jar I can already see a notable change. I especially love that it is all natural. I have very sensitive skin and I tolerated this very well. I normally use estee lauder products. I will probably discontinue their use now that I've found a ceam that is 70% cheaper and softens much better."
"I have never bought this before now, but after reading the reviews, I decided that it was worth a shot. Can I just say that I love it!!?! I am 37 years old and don't have too many wrinkles yet, but I do struggle with finding lotions that aren't oily and won't weigh my face down. This cream is light and smells delicious! I use very little~just a fingertip, but it covers well and usually I get my neck in that amount as well. I will definitely buy this product again and would also recommend it to others as well!"
"I use this every night, very soft, and no odor. I wake up with soft skin and I think it helps with small lines and wrinkles."
"Love it, love it, excellent face cream for night, never thought I'd see my wrinkles disappear, over the years I bought a lot of high end creams but this beats them all, highly recommend it to older women !"
This night cream is great. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly so there is no greasy feeling. My skin is soft and supple. I plan to use this product forever.
"This is a wonderful product. My skin feels so soft and looks hydrated when I use it. With so many skin care products, it's hard to tell if they are having any effect. This one is for real. Smells heavenly, feels great, makes a difference."
"A nice light weight, highly absorbable product. Not greasy. Fresh smell but not perfume-y."
"It looks like it could be a good product otherwise, but it smells like box-wine Ros√©. I got a hangover just from smelling the jar. If you like box wine, maybe you won't mind."
"Be aware that although hyaluronic acid is listed on the box, it isn't listed on the jar."
"This is a great night cream that leaves my skin soft, hydrated and not greasy at all. It is also easily absorbed. I am using it in combination with a retinoid cream and other moisturizers made my skin itchy, but this cream does not. I also use it around the eyes without problems. I have purchased other dermaE products and I am very satisfied with the overall quality if this brand. It also comes in a glass jar, which I prefer to plastic."
"Let me start by saying derma e products are amazing! I think this might be as well, but it didn't agree with my skin. Every time I used it, I would end up with little pimples. It smells wonderful and has a great consistency. I used it on my hands and it really softened and improved the skin, but couldn't put on my face without breaking out. I think I will stick to the Swanson brand hyaluronic serum."
"This night cream plus Swanson's Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a winning combination for smooth, supple skin."
This is an excellent product for day time face care - first thing in the morning and it absorbs into skin and in 10 minutes you are ready for your makeup.
I love this product since it works overnight to keep my face moist and wrinkles less noticeable. I've tried other creams but NONE have worked nearly as well as this one. It's worth the cost every bit!
I used both DermaE Hyaluronic acid day and night cream becuse my dried skin needs them both.
This is a satisfactory product however I prefer to use a lotion for convenience.
