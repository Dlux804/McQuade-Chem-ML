"I was a bit hesitant to use a moisturizing gel instead of a lotion, but having used this gel for over a week now, I am very happy with it. I haven't had any acne break outs since using this gel, which usually happens after i switch my facial products. The gel sinks right into my skin so i don't feel like i am waiting around for my lotion to dry, and it keeps my skin moisturized all day! I would definitely buy this product again."
I used to use the sensitive skin foaming cleanser in the purple pump but recently switched to this one! I like it so much. I have oily skin and love the cucumber. Blast of refreshing and clean feeling on my skin. Please never discontinue this. I use it morning and night and really like how clean and fresh my skin feels after washing. I plan on using this product for a long time. The cleanser also foams up well and is gentle so I can really get an effective cleanse. Keep making this product!
Affordable and the best gel lotion ever! I no longer have dried spots from my foundation. I will not be going back to regular cream lotions.This is the only gel lotion I will ever use!
I normally don't use a moisturizer because I have very oily skin. But I am using an blackhead scrub and medicated pads that tend to dry out your skin. So I needed a moisturizer. I have always had good luck with Clean & Clear products so I gave this one a try. I was so stunned as to how great it is. It felt so good on the skin and smelt so so good. It also didn't make my skin oily. In fact my skin has been less oily. I definitely plan on re- purchasing this product.
"I have extremely dry eyelids, this product is mild enough to use on my eyelids leaving them nourished but not oily or sticky or heavy like other facial lotions. It's a must have for your morning makeup bag. I can finally use make up again!"
It is a good product but is too bad that you can not find it at the store anymore. You have to order online and pick up at the store if you don't want to pay S&H.
This is the moisturizer I use in the morning before makeup application. I love it because it's not too heavy but gives my skin the perfect amount of subtle hydration. (It is definitely a dupe for the neutrogena hydro boost which is like $20!) It also is a dimethicone moisturizer so it could double as a makeup primer if you're in a rush in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
at first after using this product my skin felt smooth but after using it for a week I started noticing the skin around my nose got dry and started peeling . Would not recommend if you have dry or sensitive skin. I have oily skin and this product still over dried my skin. :(
"If you ever discontinue this product, I will die. It's the only option."
when I bought it I was very unhappy to find out that I got more bumps and flakey skin
This facial moisturizer is exactly like Clinique's gel oil free moisturizer. It leaves the skin smooth and helps to combat oil breakthrough.
"i personally didn't really enjoy the morning burst cleanser that came in an orange bottle, it was too strongly scented and hurt if it got in my eyes. then i tried the morning burst with cucumber and i absolutely love it! the scent is super nice and refreshing and does a great job of waking me up!"
"I have oily skin and this product caused my skin to become very dry, itchy, and acne developed around my chin and lips. Hadn't had a breakout in years until I started using this. I know everyone's skin is different but this did nothing for me. Going back to Neutrogena :)"
"I get extremely oily around my nose & forehead. Before this, I was using POND'S moisturizer which left my skin more oily. This Gel is light & takes away the oil from my problem areas. I use this with Noxema Anti Bacterial wash to keep the acne away. I would highly recommend! !"
"This was by far my favorite clean n clear cleanser so far. I felt it really cleansed my face better than other cleansers, and was similar to the morning burst cleanser that is in the orange packaging, but for some reason this one felt like it cleansed more than that one. It didn't break me out, and I also love the packaging and it didn't dry out my face. The only downside was it smelled kind of like kitchen dish soap, which was kind of odd but I don't care and will definitely purchase this again."
"I have dry and senstive skin. I have been looking for the right moisturizer to use for ages. However, the problem was that i could only find creams that had a ton of extra ingredients such as acne medications that irritated my skin. To make it worse, the lotions that I did like were expensive. This gel has been the perfect solution. Not only does it take care of my ultra dry skin, but it comes at an affordable price! I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin!"
"This product is probably the best moisturizer I've used, in terms of scent, quality, and lightness, It leaves my skin looking dewy which is what I want in a moisturizer. The scent is a light but sweet pleasant smell, albeit artificial. I only wish I could find this in a store. No matter where I go,I can no longer find it."
I didn't know what to expect when I first started using this product. I have a very oily face to when I apply lotion to it my face breaks out bad. This keeps my face hydrated and does not add extra oil to my face. Now my face feels butter smooth all day :)
Been using this moisturizer for years and absolutely love it! Actually hydrates but is super light and doesn't break me out or irritate my skin at all. Smells great too!
"My skin doesn't like thick, heavy moisturizers so this is fantastic. This works better than any of the crazy expensive department store anti-aging ""miracles"" I've ever bought. No fake promises or over-the-top fancy packaging, just a great little moisturizer that truly works. Great job, guys! :D"
i love this product. i have been using it for a few weeks now and it is awesome!. i recommend this product for teens because it is very refreshing and its good for acne prone skin. it did dry my skin a bit but with the gel moisturizer it gave my skin a soft and refreshing feel.
I have very dry skin and this product has been my saving grace for the last 8 years! I put it on right out of the shower and my face feels hydrated all day. It's literally the best skin product I've ever encountered and I will never stop using this. It also smells amazing
I was so excited to try this product! I loved the smell but it made my skin even more dry. I have dry skin to begin with and living in Colorado doesn't help either. I thought this product would help especially with winter approaching. After i used it a couple of times my face started peeling because it dried out my skin.
I have been using this for about 2 months now and us it every morning! Its amazing! I am going to repurchase it soon! The smell is amazing! this cleanser is very soft and smooth. It makes my skin feel evenly hydrated and soft! My skin is mostly dry but does have so oily spots. After using this it makes me feel even! I love it so much! I am going to soon try the gel moisturizer and hope it works just as well as this product did!
I have been using this product for the past month and a half and I have to say that I absolutely love it and that it works!!! Unlike other products that I tried in the past that would leave my face dry this one leaves my face feeling so smooth and hydrated. Awesome product and I really reconmend it (:
This product really works wonders! It leaves you skin feeling like and well hydrated and at the same time provides a refreshing smell! It is great for a winter skin care product due the hydration that it provides. This product will definitely be added in to my winter skin care routine! Job well done clean and clear!
I love Clean and Clear's Morning Burst Hydrating Gel Moisturizer. It is a beautifully light weight moisturizer that smells incredible and provides a good amount of moisture to the skin. It pairs very well with the Hydrating Morning Burst Cleanser but is versatile enough to work with any other product. I will continue to purchase this moisturizer as the years go by and I would highly recommend it.
"It does clean your face but it's very, very drying. If I don't moisturize after I get really bad dry patches and dry, flaky skin on my cheeks, nose, and between my brows. Even some moisturizers don't work well with this product. The only moisturizer I've used that's kept my face moisturized all day when using this cleanser is clean and clear dual action moisturizer."
This is out of stock everywhere and online its 1-4 weeks wait time. I am completely out and sorely missing it. Would love to know what's going on and confirm it will be back on the shelves soon. I finally found a mosturizer that works for me so hopefully it's not gone for good.
"I'm not one to get a lot of acne, I just get a few problem spots. I love this for cleansing and getting off my makeup. The smell is so nice and fresh which makes me want to use more of it. Every time I try something different I always see myself coming back to this product."
"I love this moisturizer so much, it's so light but still very hydrating. It feels so silky and makes my skin feel nice and soft. It has a soft scent but I find it very pleasant. I can't find this in stores any more for some reason though so that's sad."
I absolutely love clean and clear. I have been using this brand since I was a kid when my mother taught me the importance of cleansing my face. It's kept my skin looking beautiful. I rarely ever get a pimple. I love the hydrating cleanset paired with the essentials astringent and the hydrating moisturizer. I love clean and clear and hope it will always be available.
I absolutely LOVE this product! I have combination oily skin so it didn't add any extra oiliness to my skin. love how hydrating it is and works well with the other recommended products. My only problem is that i cant find it in any store i go to. I've been without to product for a good 2 months and haven't been able to find anything like it. Now my face is breaking out.
I must say I have been looking for the right moisturizer for years! I finally found this gel that gives my oily face the right amount of moisture thought the day. I usually don't buy products like this over the counter but it was worth every penny. And the best part is that it won't break the bank $.
"I was hesitant buying this, so I looked up reviews online while at the store. The bottle is very cute and the moisturizer is amazing! It's super light and leaves the skin feeling really cool and fresh. The gel makes it easy to spread and it doesn't make me feel greasy (like lotion moisturizers) The next day, my skin felt smoother!"
"This product is all around great! From the smell, which attracted me to this product in the first place, to how it wakes me up in the morning! Most products dry out my skin, but if I sleep with my make up on, I'll get pimples. This product made my skin soft and took off almost all my make up! This is way better than buying expensive make up remover."
"I have been using this for years and every time I try a new product I regret it. I have very sensitive and oily skin, and this product keeps my skin moisturized all day without looking shiny. I hope this product is never discontinued because I will always use it."
"At first I was skeptical about whether this cleanser would work well with my skin. Although it's really oily, I still have to use cream cleansers because others will dry it out too badly. I must say this one works very well! The cleanser foams and cleans very well without a tight drying sensation. The smell is also amazing!"
"I have very sensitive acne prone combination skin this gel moisturizer is amazing! Its cool, light weight, and refreshing. This product delivers just enough moisture for my sensitive combo skin, a lot of moisturizers feel greasy on my skin this glides on like silk I LOVE it."
"This moisturizer is amazing. I use it before I put on my makeup everyday. It sinks into the skin well, and makes your skin feel refreshed. In addition, it is lightweight and would be great for all skin types. It doesn't feel oily on my skin like some moisturizers can. It smooths and soothes the skin. I love it, and I will be repurchasing in the future."
This is my go to face wash when I wake up in the morning. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and I am ready to take on the day. It wakes me up. The bursting beads feel so nice on my face and the smell of the product is so enjoyable. It makes me want to wash my face over and over again. I would recommend this product to anyone.
"I'm not one to get a lot of acne, I just get a few problem spots. I love this for cleansing and getting off my makeup. The smell is so nice and fresh which makes me want to use more of it. Every time I try something different I always see myself coming back to this product."
"The fact that this cleanser claims to be hydrating is a joke and false advertising. After using this cleanser for a few days my face was so dry it was tight and flaky even after I put moisturizer on it still felt like sandpaper. I had to throw the bottle away. If you are looking for a hydrating cleanser, stay away from this one even though it says it right on the bottle."
I have finally found a moisturizer that moisturizes and don't leave my skin oily. I have extremely oil skin and the creamier moisturizers leaves an oily residue. This does just the opposite. I'm left with a matte finish. Absolutely love the product and it doesn't hurt that it smells great!!
"I am really picky about the things I put on my face. After using Pond's luminous moisture which left my skin splotchy, red, and oily I decided to try this moisturizer . It works wonders for my skin making it soft and supple without making me oily. I have combination skin and it really helps with that also I'd like to reccomrmd the facial cleanser as well. It really cleans and wakes me up in the morning."
"When I first started using this product, I noticed some tightness around my t zone when I felt my skin, but didn't think much of it. A couple days later, my skin started cracking and peeling up later in the day after using this product. I thought I was scrubbing too hard, so I tried gently massaging. If anything that just made my skin peel while now being dirty. It's frustrating."
"This product is AMAZING. It was so lightweight, and replenished my skin so nicely. It made my skin BABY SMOOTH. I stopped using this product maybe a year ago because I ran out and forget to go back out to get some. I never remembered who it was by until today, and I'm going to get some this weekend! After I stopped using this product, my skin has never been as smooth as it once was! No hydrating gel lotion compares."
It's the best moisturizer and good price love it
Really light and effective. Doesn't feel heavy or oily.
I don't have sensitive skin but this moisturizer made my face feel like it was on fire every time I put it on.
"The best facial cleanser i've bought. foams up well,cleanses right off, and doesn't dry/irritate my sensitive skin. I love morning burst hydrating facial cleanser, smells fantastic too!"
"I have oily skin and I was looking for hydra gel based products, this one is perfect match with gel based formula and light weight with great smell. I do recommend this product for oily skin types."
I have normal skin so I don't really have any acne I need to get rid of. But this product is an amazing cleanser and still leaves my skin hydrated and not to mention it smells really good. This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used!!!
i had been using the normal morning burst but that left my skin dry and with this on I feel re freshen after i put it on and i feel like it has helped me a lot. It has help me prevent acne to showing up
After I wash my face my nose/cheeks get very dry (on the container it says hydrating) and I'm not someone who get dry easily. It also doesn't clear up pimples.
"I have never found a face product that leaves my skin as soft and nurtured as this gel does. Emediatly after I put it on, my whole face feels clean and soft like it should feel after you moisterize it. Ten out of ten! Definatly will buy this again!"
"I've been using this for a few days and i absolutely love it! Great light feel and great makeup base! doesn't make my face oily throughout the day, and the scent!"
This moisturizer is the best! This is my first time using a gel moisturizer and I have no regrets. It leaves my skin so smooth and hydrated. On top of that it smells AMAZING! My new holy grail!
"I usually don't use moisturizers because I don't like my skin feeling all oily and sticky, but when I use this one, it keep my face hydrated the whole day and it feels so light like its not even there."
"I'm in love with this moisturizer. It smells delicious, keeps my skin soft and hydrated without being greasy, and absorbs in seconds. I'll be using this forever. Thanks Clean&Clear."
This product is OK it smells nice and looks nice but don't judge a book by I cover this made my skin super duper dry I mean I should get something free.
"I've repurchased this many times and haven't done that with any other product. I've always loved experimenting with products and rarely repurchase, I've tried other moisturizers but they never leave me hydrated for the whole day like this one."
I've been using this product for over a year! Its always wake up my face and I haven't seen any breakouts in a while. My face has stayed hydrated for a long time!
This product dried out my skin because of the ingredient Sodium Laureth Sulfate. I had to use moisturizer after using this product. I am now using oil free pink grapefruit and I saw results in three days.
I've been using this product for only a week and can already feel a difference. It's sooo moisturizing. Usually my face is super greasy or super dry. I've been using this and the strawberry face scrub everyday and I definitely feel a difference.
"I love this stuff. I have very dry skin, especially after I wash it. Every time I put this product on my face feels so fresh and moisturized. Definitely using this for every."
"This is one of my new favorite moisturizers. Hydrates gently, super light, smells lovely! Doesn't leave a heavy, shiny residue & doesn't break me out which is a huge plus! I seriously hope they never stop making this! Thank you, Clean & Clear!"
Every time I use this and the night relaxing face wash my skin turns red and burns and it'll be like that for days and it makes my skin really dry but it does work
"My other brand was discontinued so I decided to try Clean and Clear since I usually do have great results with their products... NOT THIS ONE! After a few days of using this exact product, my skin is extremely dry, flakey, itchy, and I am now breaking out. I don't recommend if you have like mild oily skin or any skin in fact."
I have moderate acne and this is not friendly for acne prone skin. It has a very strong fragrance which can irritate and clog pores. It might work for some people- but my highly sensitive skin broke out using this moisturizer. It also hydrated very poorly- so people with combination skin that need more moisture in certain areas beware.
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. It is actually the first and only moisturizer I have ever used. The first time I got it, it was from online and I obviously was not able to smell it before purchasing it, but it doesn't have a bad scent at all. It actually has a slight citrus-like smell, but it's not too overwhelming when you put it on your face. I will definitely be getting this again and again."
"This product smells amazing. It smells a lot better than the other morning burst products. However, it claims to be a hydrating face wash...but it still dries out my skin. If I use this product alone, it leaves my face feeling very tight and dry. I've been using the product for over a month and I continue to see dryness and flakiness around my cheeks and nose. So, like I said, it smells great but it doesn't really do what it says it will."
This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used. I have oily acne prone skin and this product makes my skin feel hydrated and balanced. I am 43 and have no wrinkles due to always having an oily complexion. Because of this most moisturizers for women my age are to heavy and pore clogging. Morning Burst Gel Moisturizer makes my skin look and feel amazing. I have spent 10 times the price of this moisturizer on high end products and have never gotten them same fantastic results. Great product..please never discontinue!
"This moisturizer is AHHHHHHHHMAZING. Seriously, I truly love it. I am thirty-three and still have skin issues. It's a struggle to find something that works for me but this is the ticket. Its very light but leaves skin feeling so soft. When I wash my face in the morning and apply my makeup after, my pores look great. This moisturizer is a God send for myself. I think you will like it. It smells nice as well."
"Amazing!!! On Monday mornings I can barely open my eyes but just a dime size of this and it will feel like a Saturday evening. It is refreshing and it makes my skin feel clean and clear. Again, amazing!!! I would completely recommend for a 'morning boot/burst.' I am not sure if it adds any more impact to your skin but it definitely wakes you up and clears out all of the ""guck"" gathered over night. (I use it at night also because I love it so much too.)"
"I was a faithful user of Morning Glow moisturizer and was saddened when it was no longer available. I have tried Morning Burst and am pleased with its performance. I was afraid the gel would have a drying effect on my skin, but it doesn't. Now I'm wondering if it will ever include any sunscreen?"
"This is great to use every once and a while, but it is foaming a little and foaming cleansers has a chemical in it that acne bacteria grows on on. After using it a few times I've noticed or my acne to start to appear again so dint buy it if your acne prone. My friend with normal skin uses it daily and has no problem so it's ok for some people."
"i love the feeling it leaves on my skin, and it smells so nice. i have sensitive skin but this works great, even though its one of my fav products i feel like its gonna dry my face though so i just like to put some moisturizer, but i dont think it will but its great!!!!"
I got this about a month ago and it's probably one of the best face cleaners out there. I am a swimmer so I have dry swim but it can get oily. This product has not made me break out at has also made made my face super soft. There is a smell that in my opinion smells like kids ‘Suave' watermelon body wash and I do like that smell.
"Let me start by saying I'm one of those weirdos that hates lotions and creams especially on my face, generally they just feel gross. With this stuff that's not the case. I put it on, my skin absorbs it and there's no greasy feel to it. My skin is soft and stays hydrated all day. I use it in the morning and at night. I think this will be my go to from now on. Please don't ever discontinue this! If only there was a body lotion like this!"
"This is the first moisturizer that I have used, and I'm not planning to stop using it anytime soon. I've been using this product for about eight months now, with no problems. I have acne-prone skin, and this moisturizer did not cause any breakouts whatsoever. It doesn't over-moisturize, absorbs quickly, smells wonderful, and leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh, and smooth. It's very light, and disappears after it absorbs. It moisturizes perfectly, and I love it. Thank you so much for making this product."
"Honestly, there is nothing to say about this product accept, it is DEFINITELY NOT hydrating. I have very dry, sensitive skin, and using this caused a dry patch on my skin. And, MONTHS later, I am still trying to get this dry patch to go away! The dry patch was beyond embarrassing and flaking was happening everywhere on my face. I'm glad I realized it was this product, and I will definitely never use it again, nor recommend it."
"I absolutely love this product. I bought this because I needed new moisturizer and I though this one looked okay. But when I first used it, it was more than okay. My skin instantly feeled replenished and hydrated. I also the the fresh scent. I completely recommend this product."
"I brought the morning burst and night cleanser since it came in a pack. I started using it and on the first day my skin started to flake up. I normally my skin is really oily, but this product has made my skin very dry. The product makes my nose hurt on the outside to where it feels raw. So no I wouldn't recommend this product because it hasn't done any justice for me."
"I am an oily skin person. You know who you are. 20 minutes into your make up routine it's already coming off. I was always so scared of moisturizers! I thought to myself ""a moisturizer would make me even oilyer!"" I started using this product, sample size, and I love it. It smells amazing, like some candy. A thin layer all over my face does the trick and my face feels healthy but not greasy."
I've been using this product after my morning burst facial scrub and it has been making my skin really soft but not under my chin! the skin under my chin has started to get dry and itchy. i really don't understand why because for the rest of my face it is moisturizing but not under my chin i'm not sure how i really feel about it
"Pretty disappointed in this product. I've been using it for about two weeks and I've noticed my skin feels kind of dry and irritated, especially around my nose and mouth. The first few days were fine, it cleaned my skin and left it really soft but now I find myself putting lotion on my face several times a day because it feels so irritated. I'm going to stop using it for a few days to see if my skin goes back to normal."
"As one with dry skin, its impossible to find something that can get rid of whiteheads without drying my skin out completely. During my search for something to clear my face, I started using different moisturizers, but most of them clogged the pores and made it worse. Then I started using the Hydrating Gel Moisturizer. It's fantastic! Not only does it make my skin feel great, it even got rid of some of my pimples! I don't know who created this product but thank you!!!!! :)"
I used this product morning and night and it left my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated. I would definitely recommend this product!
I really like this product I would definitely consider using it again It didn't make my skin to oily and it didn't make my skin to dry!
Works really really well. Totally reccomend it. My skin always feels refreashing as well as soft and exfoliated.
"I love this product so much! The beads don't stay on my face like they usually do, it smells good, is hydrating, and makes my skin feels soo good!"
"This product does keep small pimples away, but leaves my face very oily, and dries out the skin around my nose and mouth"
Very refreshing product a must in my household with two teenage girls. Most definitely would recommend.
"My boyfriend and I both use this lotion. It is very light on the face, doesn't feel too heavy. We drive all over town until we find a store with it!"
i have been using this product for about a month now and i love it i love how it is a gel and does not leave my skin all oily as most products do.
"Love love love this stuff! It's not greasy, it hydrates super well, and leaves a nice matte finish. Not to mention how cooling it is!"
I used this product for a couple days. And the next my face was getting really dry around my nose and my nose was really red.
"this is the best moisturizer ever! it is totally comparable to the neutrogena gel, but less than 6 dlls. it absorbs fast. does not leave a sticky layer, the scent is nice yet not overwhelming. give it a try it is the perfect daily moisturizer"
I love this product! It's the best moisturizer I can find. I wish I could find it in stores!
"I love this moisturizer! Sinks in quickly, very hydrating, and smells awesome. I have very sensitive skin and psoriasis and have had no problems (been using it for about 6 months)"
I love this product but I find my skin is always stiff and red after use. I still use it but I just don't know. I recommend this product because I think it is only because of my certain skin which is dry and oily
I fell in love with this stuff when it came as a sampler on a my face wash. I tried it and loved it right from the start. I have been coming to this web sight waiting for it to show up in a larger bottle. My facial care is now complete!!!
"My mom bought this for me, and I was amazed by the first time I put this on my skin. It was cooling, and refreshing; and the smell was enjoyable!~ This is great for any skin type from oily to dry. The absorbance time is only a minute or 2 minutes."
"I've only used this for a week and my face is so soft. My pimples have cleared up. I use it on my cheeks, nose, and chin and I don't worry about my face drying up anymore, my nose expecially. I would definitely recommend this."
I tend to shy away from moisturizers due to oily skin. I have tried a lot of moisturizers only to try a different one on the next purchase. This moisturizer is perfect! I just hope you don't quit making it now that I have found it!
"This moisturizer is excellent for the skin. Its especially good for acne-prone skin, because it's light and oil-free. It makes my skin feel even more clean and refreshed after washing it."
a god moisturizer.
please do not discontinue this product!!!!! personally this is better than clinique's dramatically different moisturizing gel!!! it feels more hydrating but not oily and makes my skin smooth. and of course acne free. please do not ever ever ever discontinue this product and thank you for this amazing product for its price!!
Both of my kids used this from ages 13-19 and it was their preferred facial cleanser for everyday use. Seldom acne breakouts & very gentle on the skin. My daughter is prone to getting very dry skin after showering & this doesn't irritate or dry her face out. My son loves it too. Afults can use it too. I used it & a couple other Clean & Clear products.
I started using this moisturizer after I had a horrible couple months of breakouts and super dry and oily skin. This moisturizer was the only thing to help me clear up my skin and it made my skin feel fresh and clean and not greasy! It's better than Clinique and ole! Best moisturizer I had ever use because it is so lightweight and it smells good too!
I had a cream moisturizer which broke me out so i finally picked up a bottle of this stuff since I heard that gel moisturizers are better if you have oily or combination skin like me and i have to say its worked like a charm! It's so lightweight and the smell of cucumber is very refreshing.
"I really like this moisturizer! It really is clean and clear! It doesn't leave your face oily and moisturizes so well. I am having a hard time finding it in my local stores, which I usually purchase this from. I hope it is not being discontinued. I am 60 years old and use this daily!"
I live in the UK and can't find anywhere to buy this product here. I have to get my sister in Florida to buy it for me and send it. Please can you tell me if this is stocked in the UK and where? Its the best gel moisturiser I have ever used!! Please please help me!!
"So when I first used this, it smelt good, made my face feel smooth and all that, but after three days my face became really dry and I started breaking out more than I ever have before. My skin started to flake off and it hurt so I am going to stop using it and see how it goes."
"I actually use proactiv, but I dont like to always use the moisturizer because sometimes the chemicals are just too much. At the same time, I still need a moisturizer. My skin tends to get pretty oily after a few hours and I was so amazed after using this product. I worked an 11 hour shift and still had no shine at the end of the day! It feels so nice when you put it on and smells wonderful too! LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!!"
I have been using this for 3 years now and i will never switch!
I've been using this for a week and already see a difference. love this product
Used this because the original morning burst dried my skin out. Was not disappointed!
it smells great (if you like cucumber) makes your skin feel nice and fresh doesnt make it shiny
Good product to use. I will recommend this product to my friends.
I love it feels like they re nothing there and it smells so good
"Very light and non greasy, best moisturizer out there. Have been using for over 2 years!!"
I love this product!! Not only does it moisturizer but it also doesn't leave your skin oily...another upside...my skin also looks a lot clearer!!!
I LOVE IT if you're trying to decide to get it or not get it noooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww get all their products and they all work wonders
This moisturizer helps me out a lot better since I have dry skin. It helps out a lot better than Vaseline.
"I struggle with sensitive skin and acne. Almost every product irritates or doesn't improve my skin. This product felt so soothing and lightweight, plus I didn't break out! Love it!"
I absolutely love this product because it leaves my face nice and smooth.I only use this product at night after washing with the night cleanser.This is a product that I DEFINITELY recommend for everyone.
"The morning burst hydrating facial cleanser is unreal. The bursting beads really wake you up and make you feel like a million bucks. Getting out of bed has never been so easy. I would 100% recommend my jaint, 10/10!!"
"I bought this stuff thinking it was just another product that says it will help my face but it really won't...BUT THIS DOES!! Not even an hour after I put this on it made my face look so much smoother, cleaner, and it even helped my pimples!!"
Best moisturizer EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! This products makes your skin feel SO silky soft without causing any breakouts. Clean and Clear PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT AWAY EVER!! Thank you so much for creating this product.
This moisturizer is the best product I have ever used! I have combination skin: very oily in my T-zone but dry in the corners of my mouth and nose. Most moisturizers sit on top of my skin and make me feel even more oily. This one sinks into my skin making it feel silky and soft. I can even wear it under makeup without having my makeup product slip off. Amazing for me & I highly reccomend!
"I never EVER write reviews but this ones a must... I've been switching from moisturizer to moisturizer for years now and completely given up. My friend let me try some of hers and that same day, I went straight to the store to buy some. This product is amazing and does wonders! The smell is just a plus. It leaves my face glowing, soft and healthy. I love it!!"
"I have combo/ oily skin and this is the only moisturizer I have ever used that doesn't make my skin fell oily or cause me to break out more. Smells great , and is lightweight. My local store hasn't had it in stock so I ordered 2 from the website. A little goes a long way. Love it. I will not use any other brand now . Seriously better than anything I have used from Avon or Mary Kay ."
This is my favorite face moisturizer. I couldn't tell you how many tubes of this I've went through. The only thing that doesn't make me break out! Doesn't feel heavy and smells really nice. I'm sad that my Wal-Mart doesn't carry it in store anymore and I have to order online but no big deal.
I'm a Asian-American teenager with sensitive and a oily skin. Yes like the other reviews the product does leave your face dry but after awhile your face will feel super soft. The only problem I have with it is the kiwi-ish smell? But that's just a preference. Overall this product has not cause me any break outs and has cleaned out my pores.
Over the past years I've been using clean and clear products . And my acne forehead never got better . Then later I switch to a higher end brand face wash and my forehead had cleared up . Then recently I was going to go on a trip to Mexico and i decided to buy this face wash . My forehead broke out again. And it didn't get better .
"I've been using this for awhile. I don't like it at all. I don't feel like it's washing my face. I feel like I'm just putting something on my face. My fave has been so dry, breaking out and flakey and I just read all these reviews and now it makes sense. I'm pretty sure it's this product. I don't like it. It might work on oily skin but not dry."
"It left my skin oily and dry! My face felt gross after I used it, almost like it didn't clean my skin at all. It does not have deep clean properties at all. Also, when it says ""Bursting Beads"", it only means that it has like 2 or 3 of them. I would not recommend this product at all, especially since it doesn't have what it says. I regret getting this product."
I started using this about 1 week ago and I already see a difference! I use it twice a day and I use moisturizer straight after using so my skin does not get dried out and it has completely cleared my face! I have been trying different products for months but this works the best!! Will be buying again when I run out!!
This stuff is amazing!!! My husband has a bad flaky rosacea all over his face. We were ordering some very expensive prescriptions that were barely helping his situation. My skin is very dry and sensitive to anything too oily. He would put on two coats of this about 5 minutes apart and was able to stop using every other thing he had to use for his face!! It took all the flakes from my nose and banished them. I love this stuff. Please never stop making it!!!
"I have only been using this product for a few days and it's been doing wonders to my face. This is my first time using Clean and Clear and I love it already. As soon as I rinse off my face with this it looks so much more clean and fresh. I can almost instantly feel the difference, my skin looks brighter , refreshed and just overall better. It also smells amazing! With a dual hydrating/moisturizing and cleansing effect, I'd recommend giving it a try."
"I love this moisturizer so much! It is perfect for my skin and leaves it feeling hydrated, but still clean. It is so lightweight I never feel it on my face, and I really love that about it. This moisturizer is definitely my favorite morning routine product. I don't ever want to use another moisturizer again!"
"This mosturizer is part of my day/night routine after I was my face. I borrowed from a friend one day two years ago and loved it and I have been using it ever since. In the last year stores around me have stopped carrying it so I have been purchasing a couple at a time from Walmart online. My skin can sometimes get somewhat oily after putting on make up and dry after I wash my face - this lotion is perfect because it makes my skin moisturized but doesn't get greasy. It's super light weight, I love it."
"I have acne prone, combination skin and this is just the perfect moisturizer!! It's so light weight on your skin, never oily or heavy. I use it once or twice a day morning and night after my cleansing routine. It's just done wonders for my skin!! Strongly recommend it for anyone who is tried of that horrid film of oil and heaviness most moisturizers leave. It's just amazing."
"If you hate the feeling of cream or oily moisturizers on your skin, I would definitely recommend this. It also smells good, and doesn't make my skin oily! I have normal-oily skin that is really sensitive, but ever since using this moisturizer, my pimples have become nonexistsnt and now my face rarely gets oily and it hasn't gotton dry since I've used it. I use it at morning and at night, though. Would strongly recommend."
Thank God for this stuff. I have been trying to get into a good moisturizer routine for a while because I want to slow aging down by keeping my skin hydrated. Products like Cetaphil's moisturizer just didn't absorb into my skin at all no matter how little I used. I can't speak for long term because I have only just started using this product but it absorbed very well and my skin is soft and hydrated--- not greasy.
Moisturizers make me break out and its hard to find on that does not. I have used a Gel Moisturizer from the department store and I like this one as well if not better! It is very cooling and soothing and does not break me out. I am on my second tube and will buy again!
It absorbs into my skin without making my face greasy. It works great for sensitive skin.
i hate the feeling of cream and this is so great because it still moisturizes my skin. it's great.
The product smells really good and it keeps acne away but it dries out your skin so much that on the tops of my cheeks are flaky!!
I have a very oily skin. If you too I'd recommend you try this gel. It makes my skin soft and doesn't leave any oily shine on my face.
I know you're supposed to use it in the morning but I use it before I go to sleep. My face gets oily at night and I have black
"I really love this stuff. I usually don't put anything on my face because I have oily skin and most products break me out, but not this. I can't find it in stores anymore though. I'm wondering if it's discontinued. I'm using my last tube sparingly."
I recently switched to this cleaner and i had previously been using another product by Neutrogena and i found it very drying for my skin. This product is very gentle but it still makes my skin feel incredibly clean and soft! I love it.
"This is a great moisterizer that doesn't feel oily and doesn't cause breakouts. Also nondrying. Just wish it would become available i the,store again."
"Product dried my skincare right out to the point that it was peeling around my mouth. Would not recommend to anyone. My skin is fairly normal, never been dry even in the winter. Disappointed."
"This product dries my face out & made black spots appear. My face have never really been dry & it has became flaky & really dried out. On the bottle it states “won't over dry,” but it has really dried my face out to the max."
"While it may work for some people it did not for me, dried out my skin, caused a severe, painful rash all over my face. Not sure where the Hydration lays."
"great product! one thing i must say is that it is extremely painful to get in your eye, and the packaging doesn't give instructions on what to do if you happen to get any in your eye."
I love this gel! It's light weight and absorbs quickly never greasy. It will leave your skin so soft. It's great to use under your makeup. I highly recommend.
I started using this moisturizer since last year and its has been my new favorite moisturizer. Its so light and refreshing. I always stock up whenever I see this in stock. Well done on this product Clean & Clear! Thank you!!!
I'm nearly 60 and I needed a moisturizer that wasn't heavy or have a strong smell. This gel is awesome! Walmart is one of the few places with a good price for this gel.
"1st time buyer, cleansed face, put on lotion, burned my face so bad to where I'm constantly regenerating new skin, looks like and feels like dry leather... not happy... my face is screwed :("
"I purchased this because of the nice commercial on it. But I should have stuck with Nutragena. This face wash literally drys my skin completely out as soon as i dry my face off. I've been using it for around a month and it has yet to take care of ANY of my acne. Ugh, I'm going back to what works !"
"I am an older woman ( 50's) and have never had skin problems. On a whim, I needed a facial wash and purchased this. I was stunned to discover that my skin looked fantastic with noticeably improved texture. I studied the ingredients to analyze why this would make such an improvement and the only factor I can attribute this to is fruit acid ???? In any event, it actually surpasses much more expensive facial cleansers. This will now be my go to facial cleanser ( extraordinaire ) !"
"Microplastics in Clean&Clear products go down the drain, into the ocean, making our oceans contaminated with plastic which fish, larger prey, and eventually humans ingest. Microplastics aren't just found in seafood, it's found in the water we drink. The plastic is making our ocean more acidic, destroying coral reefs, & killing animals."
Stop purchasing products that cause harm.
"I really like this product. I use it every morning before school, and it is very awakening. I really love how it makes my face feel very fresh and soft! Although, this product can be a little bit drying, so I would suggest moisturizing your face after use."
"This product dried my face out and I still got a breakout. My face is so flaky, especially under my eyes. My skin is raw and burns. I do not know how I am going to fix it for vacation in five days. I have not worn makeup in several days because of it, and currently still cannot."
"Best moisturizer I've ever used hands down. Not greasy, smells great, absorbs quickly."
best moisturizer I have ever used! It feels so light and makes your skin feel fresh
"Great product. Leaves skin smooth, not oily. Highly recommend."
Very light and doesn't make me break out so I am happy with it. Great for dry/combination skin.
"I used this and my face gets dry after I wipe my face so I put this on, and it dried up! parts of my face are still dry after I used it."
for me it was slightly oily/sticky for my oily/combination skin + it smelled more like mushy cucumbers over cucumbers/citrus unfortunately
This is well worth the money. It's light and non-greasy and a little goes a long way. I had one bottle last me two years.
"Not greasy. Lightweight. Refreshing. Nice, subtle smell. Better price per ounce than Garnier's gel moisturizers."
"I really love this product,. My face feels fresh and clean not oily and it keeps my face clear thank you."
"The Morning Burst Hydrating Gel Moisturizer feels nasty!! Bring back MORNING GLOW MOISTURIZER!! It was light and easy to apply and didn't feel sticky, like this creepy gel. GROSS!!!"
"I do not have sensitive skin,but this product made my face burn and itch. The next morning my whole face was swollen and my eye was swollen shut. Such a horrible experience. I will never be using this product or brand ever again ):"
"I've been using this for about a week now and I really love it. I have combination skin so it's hard to find a good cleanser that doesn't dry my skin out or cause me to break out in pimples, but this one seems to do the trick. It smells great too."
I just ran out of my fruit infusions and was devastated to find out they discontinued those cleansers. So I bought this. Made my T-Zone so incredibly oily and caused breakouts. Stay away from this stuff!
so about a month ago i started to use morning burst hydrating facial clearer i notice that my skin started to become pretty bad. i started to get a lot of pimples and a lot of redness. I don't really like this product.
"Honestly, this is the worst skincare product I've ever used. It completely dried out my skin and didn't moisturize at all. My skin isn't sensitive but this product made my face feel sore and itchy, don't buy it it's a waste of money!"
I use this every morning and after using my face feels clean and lighter. It keeps my face clean all day. I would recommend this product to anyone who wakes up with oily skin or just need a nice and clean face.
"it's my fav, i love this product. i use it everyday."
"Clean, fresh scent. Hydrating, no drying out once so ever."
"According to my Wife who uses this, it not greasy and makes her skin feel great and clean!"
I love this lotion! It moisturizes my face without making it breakout.
"light and absorb quickly , i have acne prone skin and this is not makes me more oily."
It smells amazing. Gyrating for oily skin and does not leave skin feeling sticky
