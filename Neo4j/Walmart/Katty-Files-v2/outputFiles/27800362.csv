I have used RoC products for many years. They are the best. I did not use them for a couple of years and sampled many other well-known brands. I was very dissatisfied with all of them. I am happy to say I have returned to tried and true RoC.
Been using for the past 6 years and works great. Leaves skin feeling soft as baby skin. It's not greasy at all goes on skin real nice and smooth. Love it has sunscreen .
"I have been using this for years, I am over 50 .I have very sensitive skin. This absorbs well, with great results and I have never had an adverse effect. Please don't ever change this !!"
Love it
"I bought this item because I was not able to buy my moisturizer which I love. I have been using it since. It is perfect. It is light, moisture feels soothing, airy. Love it that is why I am not looking any further and now interested in other products by Roc. Never heard of it before. I bought it because of sun block advantage."
I switched to this daily moisturizer about 6 months ago from a pricier department store brand and never looking back! Within 4 weeks my face seemed to have 30% fewer fine lines and was plumped and smooth! I just recently added the Roc serum and Eye cream to my routine. Cant wait to see how they work. I've heard the layering of the 3 in a daily routine are transformative to agin skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this product works better than anything I have used before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for many years and have compliments on my skin's appearance.
I have extremely sensitive skin so I need to be careful with facial moisturizers. So many have left me with a bad reaction except this ! I received a bottle of ROC daily moisturizing lotion in one of my monthly subscription boxes and its changed my life ! This lotion is simply amazing and smells so great. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth as well as looking younger .My skin feels and looks firmer plus my dark spots are fading . ROC is FABULOUS !!!
"I have a hard time finding not only something that will not irritate my skin but also feel and look good. I FOUND IT in RoC 5 in 1!!!! I don't usually spend a lot for myself, but I was desperate to find something that did not make me break out or itch. So I tried it.....LOVED IT.... and was able to get my mother to try it. We don't look our ages and would like to keep it that way. THANK YOU!!!!!"
"My skin has improved. I have used four bottles so far and in all of them the pump stops working half way, so you must take the cream out with your fingers, it's messy. I would strongly recommend they do something about the way the pump works.This is a good product but please change container."
"These bad reviews had me skeptical, but my combination skin has left me a mess, oily t-zone, dry every where else, and discoloration too! Obviously some people's skin won't agree with it... that goes for any product!! My skin flairs at everything I've tried until now!! Using it daily going on my 6th week, my skin is evening out, pores smaller, and hydrated where it needs to be without making me oily at all!! Even seems to help even out my combination spots, haven't had any breakout with it. LOVING IT FULLY!"
"My daughter who is very Up on really good products recommended the RoC 5 in 1 series to me. I know there's no magic bullet in this world but this product comes as close as anything will. We are lucky to begin with and have never looked our ages (good genes) but RoC has raised our confidence level considerably. Thank you for a fine product, I'm a believer.Snookie"
"FYI..This is my first time using a product for aging skin. I noticed that my skin was becoming dry and dull, and my neck looked a little...loose. I took a leap and bought the product and couldn't be happier. My skin is glowing! My daughter commented that my complexion looked very soft and smooth. I've noticed that the skin on my neck looks nicer too. I will definitely buy more products and create a new skincare regimen!"
"People younger than fifty years old must be the ones leaving all the super high ratings on this product. One would think a product like this would be designed for those who actually need it the most. Well, I'm over fifty and this cream did nothing for my neck or chest. The cream itself is thick and sticky and all it did was accentuate my fine line and wrinkles making them look worse. I didn't dare put it on my face! My neck and chest still felt and looked dry after almost a month of using this product."
I was excited to try this product as I have done my research and read many positive reviews. My skin unfortunately reacted as some other reviewers on here after a few days of use and became irritated and itchy aging with having an bumpy uneven texture. It almost feels as if I have a slight sunburn. I'm disappointed as I feel like my money has gone to waste. I wish I had a better review. I was so hopeful this would works for me.
"I'm allergic to zinc so my moisture with sunscreens are limited. I decided to try this while I waited for my regular Roc daily moisturizer to arrive. Mistake. I had the same reaction of red, inflamed, burning skin. I stopped using after two days, waited for my face to calm down and tried it again. Immediate burning so I washed it off. This one is not for me. I'm glad Roc hasn't discontinued the regular daily moisturizer."
"I really wanted a good moisturizer that helps with fine lines due to aging. I've been using roC eye cream and wanted to try this. My face became red with hives and itchy. Although I love the roC products in the gold tunes and use them daily, the ones in blue I am a little afraid to try. If you have make up allergies, I do not recommend this. But if you've not had problems with facial creams, I have confidence in roC's products."
"I 've been using this moisturizer for a year, my skin really glows, and added bonus is the sun screen in it. I have very sensitive skin so I was skeptical in trying it. Glad I did, and people can't believe I'm as old as I am. I would definitely recommend it. Susie"
"Ive been using the night and eye retinol creams with no problems and needed a day cream. So I tried the 5 in 1 multi correction. To my dissapointment i was sporting a hot, red, itchy rash on my face and neck for almost 3 days. It finally went away but Ive been left with a dry scaly patch in my neck. So dry it even flaked. To me it also had a stronger Sunscreen smell than other creams Ive tried in the past too."
Wish it had turned out better. Shoppers beware!
This product makes your skin look very silky and smooth. Have been using for almost 2 years now and love it! My skin has a youthful glow now. I am 45 years old and spent a lot of my younger years in the sun without sunscreen and the difference is noticeable to all my friends.
"I excitedly purchased the Multi Correction 5 in 1 Daily Moisturizer after reading a promising endorsement in a favorite magazine. So disappointed when, on day 2, I immediately experienced an painful, itchy, heated rash on applied area. I washed it off but, 24 hours later, the hive-like rash has not gone away. I currently use the ROC Deep Wrinkle Night cream and will continue to do so."
"This would be such an amazing product if it weren't for the HORRIFIC smell. The scent of this cream is its downfall. It's a heavy heavy scent, that gave me a huge headache and made me nauseous! I had to rewash my face after applying this on my face."
"Just super regret buying this, and wish I could return it."
I've been using this for years works beautifully I'm 58 years old and I look 10 years younger can't say enough good things about Roc! I have tried more expensive products and tend to always come back to this one I highly recommend. Wish people would click their age range when reviewing a product makes no sense if we don't know how old you are.
"I had been using Elizabeth Arden for more than 20 years, but Elizabeth Arden changed its products many times and it turns out that the one I was using DOESN'T HAVE PROPER SUN PROTECTION! I should have known after seeing my gigantic black spots... Anyway, what I want to say is that ROC multicorrexion 5 in 1 daily moisturizer IS AMAZING, AND IT IS HALF THE PRIZE! I highly HIGHLY recommend this cream."
"though I haven't used this brand at all, after tryin everything out there up too 1000.00$ night cream, Tonight December 30th 2017I have started my ROC products. I even took a picture of my face and boy oh boy does it need work. I turn 65 in less than 2 weeks. Even though I have been told I don't look like I'm close to 60, and that came from my primary And I will be honest I don't want to look my birth age I want to be my best self at my birth age. After all, this is methods! I have one week to see if this works, here goes"
"I cannot start the day without this product. My skin feels instantly renewed, glowing as soon as I apply it! In the summer I don't even need to wear foundation...a nice summer tan and this moisturizer are all I need! The product truly delivers value for the price paid. I have oily skin, this product is non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and sinks right into my skin like a drink of water for my pores!"
"After becoming concerned about the effects of the outdoors on my skin, I tried the 5 in 1 and began seeing the results very soon thereafter. My skin became radiant but not overly oily and I could feel an evident change in the soft yet firm skin texture. I live in a tropical island and love the outdoors. Now I feel more confident to have a reliable product that I can use without a weighty feel. I'd be getting more items from this product line."
"As with any product (even high end very expensive ones) you take your risks when purchasing - even expensive ones sometimes brake you out. I have acne prone skin and for me this product after two weeks of use (my personal trial period) has done nothing but make my skin look great. Where i live is hot and humid which with some creams increases your chance of getting break outs - not with this one, at least not for me. SUMMARY- i think it's great."
"I received a free sample at a local chain drugstore and have tried this for several days. The fragrance is too noticeable and precludes my purchasing this. However, it does leave a smooth surface on the skin - if it was fragrance free I would consider giving this a try. I have not had any reaction to the ingredients."
"I was really looking forward to trying a Roc product for the first time because I had heard great things. But after the third day of using this product, my skin started to turn red, burn, and itch. I am surprised and disappointed. I would like a refund."
"I love ROC products but this one gave me a raised rash that was red, itchy and burning on my cheeks and forehead. I'm not sure why. I have used all types of products with retinol and vitamin C and never had this reaction. I am disappointed because it sounded so promising and love the SPF 30."
"Hi, I was looking forward to trying RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5 in 1 Daily Moisturizer for a long time. I'm a man and I usually sport facial hair. I was disappointed in this product for two reasons: (1) the product left a white residue in my beard stubble which is very short at the present time and (2) it had a very feminine scent. The residue doesn't go away unless I wipe off the product. I wish I could get my money back. :-( I will add that I've used the other retinol products and I swear by them."
I am 34 yr old female. I love this ROC moisturizer! I have very fine lines under my eyes & a small smile line that have not gone away with this product but it hydrates my skin so well & evens out my skin tone so good! When I run out & use other things I definitely notice a difference in my complection. It makes my skin brighter & more even skin tone. I love it! I have ordered Renova online for my fine lines & I must cont. this product also! Ever since trying it I can't live without it!
I am 34yrs old. I don't get break outs/ acne often. I used this product for 2 weeks and it caused me to break out/acne !!! :-(. I stopped using the product for 1 week and used cleansing products and creams to get rid of the acne. The acne cleared up. I still had faith in the product so I tried it again. AND AGAIN THE ACNE CAME. :-( It was a waste of $$. I would like to know how I can get my $$ back. I will be calling the customer service on Monday . I liked the texture of the lotion but it is too oily.
I am 38 years old and have had trouble with other sunscreen products either being too heavy or too irritating to my skin because of smell or ingredients. I now only exclusively use this as my go to sunscreen. It probably isn't for everybody but for me it works and I would say it is comparable to higher end products that I have used before.
I use there whole line of products. I can't go wrong. You won't either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 55 yrs old. Been using ROC Multi-Correxion 5-1 for a year now. I love it. It has improved my skin, been told I look younger than my age. It did diminish my dark spots on my cheeks. Fine wrinkles have gone, my face feels soft."
I really like this daily moisturizer but unfortunately I will not be buying it again because I do not like the scent. If it was odor-free I would use it every day.
I put this product on this morning and my skin felt really tight I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror and my entire face is beet red like I have a major sunburn I washed my face but it still stings
I tried this product and I loved the way it goes on and feels not to mention the effect it had. It lasted for over 2 months. It my be a little expensive but it was well worth it.
I saw the commercial on tv for this and thought I'd try it. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now along with the ROC Instant Facial Smoother and my skin already looks smoother and firmer! I highly recommend the whole ROC line!!!
"I'm having the same reaction that ""Mrs."" posted. Burning and itching and swelling. It looks and feels like I have a very bad sunburn on my face and neck. I've never reacted to another lotion or sunscreen this way before."
I have used this product for about 1.5 weeks and my skin looks dryer and has a chapped/ruddy feeling to it...not sure if it is just turning over dead skin cells or if I should discontinue use?
"Don't like the odor and face looks greasy. I'm in my early 60s. I had a bad reaction to the moisturizer. My face swelled up like a balloon, it's hot to the touch and itches. Something in the product caused this so if you buy it, know that what happened to me, could happen to you. I know there are positive reviews and mine is negative because I think not all people can handle what is in the product."
Bought this yesterday but had to take it off. This moisturizer has way too much perfume in it and the smell doesn't go away.
"I LOVE all the Roc products. Over the last 5 years, occasionally have tried other products ( some very expensive), but always return to Roc."
"I love Roc, this cream by far does more than anything I have ever used. I always get compliments on how good my skin looks."
I always use Roc products but this is my favourite. My skin looks soft and hydrated. I love this product!!!
I need to know where I can find the 4 zone that you were selling as the 5 in 1 is not good but I loved the old one
Love the RoC brand! Definitely helps with discoloration and fine lines. Been using for years! Great on normal to oily skin
Its lotion. I have no idea if it does anything for my face
"After two days of using ROC Multi Correction Daily Moisturizer, I got a severe burning, itching rash on my face,neck, and chest. I have NEVER experienced this before with any other moisturizer. It took over three weeks to finally heal. The formula needs to be changed."
"my skin is not dry any more , it is so soft and smooth"
I use this product everyday in the morning. It has so many benefits in addition to having SPF!
I��m 65 and I've used this for yrs. I think it works great with everyday use
"Love it. When my previous moisturizer was discontinued, it took me months - years even to find this. I wish I had found it sooner."
good value for the price. It is just as effective as the higher priced department stores moisturizer.
I've been using this product for 2 1/2 years. I've seen a great improvement in uneven skin tone. Thanks.
I love the way it makes my face and neck feel. Absorbs very fast. I don't have wrinkles. I'm just conditioning my skin now to prevent them much as possible. Wish I'd applied Rock to my skin years ago.
"I have only used this product two days. It stinks like men's cheap aftershave, and the stink does not fade during the day. If you have sensitivity to smells, do not buy this product. I am hoping it does not work so that I will not be tempted to buy again. Why do cosmetics manufacturers believe we want smells in our products? That is what perfume is for, thank you."
"This product makes my face feel nice. I have been using it for 2 weeks and see an improvement in the texture. It's no miracle cream, like all other face creams,. I do see a difference and like that I don't have to put on so many different face and neck stuff because this covers 5 problems. Warning, it does have a scent. It is a little strong until you become used to it, but I personally like the scent. I also use the night cream."
"Unfortunately, I didnt find out how sensitive I was to retinol until I used this product. I too broke out in a rash and it really scared me because I had no idea it was from the ROC cream. I want so bad to believe in ROC products, but most of their lotions and creams are made with Retinol. I guess I wont be a good testimony to anymore of your products until you can find a way to make the product not cause rashes."
"The first moisturizer I purchased was the ""4 Zone Daily Moisturizer SPF 30."" It was very rich & made my skin look hydrated. The product that replaced this one ""5 in 1 daily moisturizer"" is a diluted product & the pump doesn't work so I have to pour into my hand. I had just discovered this ROC product & was thrilled. Now I feel I've purchased an inferior product. I'm very disappointed I will have to find another moisturizer. Please bring back the original moisturizer. I love having a moisturizer with SPF 30!"
I am freaking out. My vision is blurred. Has been for the entire day. I applied this in the morning and avoided the eye area. I walked the dog and it must have seeped into my eye by perspiration. I have rinsed with water multiple times and now am considering going to ER. It has been over 8 hours of stinging eye and blurred vision.
I use this every day when I apply my makeup. I consider this product one of the best on the market today. I am 79 years old but I look years younger.
I've seen no visable difference.
I've been using this product for 2yrs. I truly love the results.
the texture is not too greasy and it moisturizes really good.
helps to firm skin as well as protection from sun -- really love it and works for me.
"This moisturizer smells exactly like old suntan lotion from the 80's. I'm sure it works but the smell is strong/overpowering, had to stop using it."
LOVE IT!
The permuny scent is so strong I can't wear it. Please make more unscented products.
