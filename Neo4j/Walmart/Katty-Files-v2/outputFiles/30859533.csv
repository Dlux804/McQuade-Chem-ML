"i use this instant firmx on days that i leave the house. it works very well. you probably need to practidce a few times. i put the size of between 1 or 2 peas in my hand then add a bit of water. if it turns white, you are using too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Works Amazingly
Read some favorable reviews. Was looking for alternative to Plexaderm. Just turned 60. I'm pleased. Minimizes lines. Does leave light white residue after drying. I lightly sponge off. Then apply foundation. I recommend it!
Once I found this product...I won't be without it. I am 71yrs old
I wouldn't go ONE day without this product. I'm 54 and people think I'm 35... no lie! I'm telling you ... this is a MIRACLE in a bottle!
This is an excellent instant firm cream. Remember to shake well before each use. Allow it to dry a complete 10 minutes. Sometimes it takes a few minutes before the tightening begins. I use this regularly and recommend it for all adults.
Works great. Not to much. The price is very good for this kind of product.
Still trying to figure it out...white powder appears even with the smallest amount I try to use.
"Fairly effective at reducing appearance of pores. Ineffective with small face and forehead wrinkles. Additionally, even when used correctly (I applied lightly with brush), there is a lighter film left on the face. So only way to really use product is if you commit to applying makeup after product is on. Also, tried washing product off to see if I could eliminate light film on skin while still retaining tightening effect. Did not seem to work."
Too bad I didn't save the carton packaging as it was already dinged for returning.
Product completely erases fine lines and wrinkles. If you put too much on you will have a white chalky residue.
A little goes a long way. I have used another well known product for skin tightening and this is not only less expensive but is also more effective.
"This product is amazing! The best one on the market. For women over 60 it works so great, many compliments from people, they thought I had Botox!"
I've tried other products with no results. I'm very pleased with this product as the first time user. Truly instant face lift. Reduces most of the wrinkles making them less visible. I would recommend it anyone. Thank you Peter Thomas Roth !!
Ilike that the product really works.! I found it works best for me when mixed with foundation then apply. Try it ladies it gives you different ways to apply to get what's right for you.
