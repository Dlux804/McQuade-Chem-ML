"Bioderma Hydrabio Serum. Very hydrating! Not greasy and absorbs quickly. Light scent, not overpowering. Safe for sensitive skin, does not clog my pores. Locks moisture in skin for a very long time! My skin is soft and healthier even younger! This even makes for a great makeup base!"
Amazing! I have really dry skin and after the first week of using my skin felt amazing. Dry patches were gone! Not only did i use on my face but also on my feet. (And they felt silky smooth)
I recieved this as a prmotional sample. I really like the feel! Its light weight and works well with my makeup. I will buy again
This moisturizing serum is great for days when my skin gets a bit sensitive from weather changes. It feels very lightweight and does not feel like I am using anything at all. Great to substitute functional serums (brightening/anti-aging) during sensitive skin days.
