"I bought this after trying two (more expensive) other skin creams which left my skin covered in acne. After using this for a few dsys the acne went away and it even smoothed out the dark spots left by the acne. At this price point, it is a great buy as i find it just as effective (if not more) as the kiehls product i was using before for $10-$15 more :) using it both as day and night cream on my dry skin. Great product"
"Not only does this moisturizer smell INCREDIBLE, but it is extremely emollient without feeling greasy or heavy. Perfect for day and night!"
"I have been using the Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Moisturizer for a little over 2 weeks now and I love it. It goes on so smoothly and absorbs into your skin and doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky. I can tell a difference in my dark spots, just barely, but I can tell they are lighter. I love the way it feels on my skin."
It's amazing makes my skin so soft
This product is delightful. Creamy. Smooth feeling. Not greasy. Helpful for my skin at my age (82).
"I was never big into moisturizers because I didn't like my skin feeling or looking greasy… but I found that my skin was getting too dry without any. I love that this cream goes on silky smooth and doesn't leave a greasy oil slick on my face! Because of it's light smoothing consistency and the way it glides on my skin, I use it as a moisturizer and foundation primer during the day! (I was already used to the silicones in my primer, so now I can just use this one product instead of two). This adds up to big savings for me."
This cream is the answer for my dry parched skin. It feels so comforting and soft going on and it sinks right in giving my skin a silky feel. I even skip using my skin primer before applying my foundation because it gives my skin a beautiful surface to work on. I use this mainly as a night cream because I like a moisturizer with a SPF to wear during the day.
"I only had a sample of this so obviously I cannot comment on the fading of dark spots. But it is easy to apply and blends well. It made my face feel really soft and smooth. It does contain Aloe Vera and Vitamin E, both of which are good for your skin. It also doesn't have much of a scent, which is good for me. With those ingredients and it being a moisturizer makes it a good product to try."
I have been using Olay products for years and I have not been disappointed. I just started using this particular product (1 year) - and I am very happy with the results. I am a senior citizen (71) and many people have told me that looking at my face they can't believe it.
"This stuff cause me to break out and it leaves white patches on the face. The first 3 days it seems promising, but after that it break me out and not a good moisturizer, because it leaves white flakes on ur face unless you don't mind. And it didn't help me with the black spits on my face. I guess people are different, but if you have acne or one skin, u should run away from this because it will break u out"
"I've been using this product for a few years now. My skin looks 10 years younger than I am, and being a senior, that is greatly appreciated. People comment that I have a glow about me. About the flakiness, I periodically get that also, and have found that it just takes a tiny amount of the product to work it's magic. Love this product!!"
I have tried my different skin care products over the last couple of years and none have made my skin look so healthy looking as the Luminous line. I have tan and red spots on my cheeks for a few years and in the last two months of using the Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream my spots have faded considerably. My skin is firm and glows. I highly recommend it. My only issues is I can only find it in one store in our area.
"I have just tried this product for a week. I have very dry facial skin and I hope when keep using this product it will give me some results. You do not get right away results, so I will have to see if this product claims to do what it is supposed to do. Thanks."
So tried this out. so far so good. It is super smooth. not cakey. using it for about 2 weeks now. glowing? maybe. love it!
"OLay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream is wonderful. It evens out the skin tones, moisturizes, and gives a somewhat youthful glow to my aged skin. Wish it was easier to find in the stores. Love it."
I'm a huge Ulta beauty fan and been buying my face cream from Benefit and all those expensive name brands. This does exactly what they do for the half price. I will never go back to high end face creams
"I was excited to try it to see if it would improve my dark spots. I used it in the morning then applied my makeup, about an hour later, I looked in the mirror and my makeup coverage had become blotchy. I washed my face and applied the lotion again, and I noticed that my makeup was blotchy because the lotion peels off of my skin. I only use it at night now."
DON'T KNOW YET IF SPOTS WILL BE REMOVED BUT IT FEELS GOON ON MY FACE
Nice packaging and delivered on time needed
This is a wonderful product. I have discoloration/melasma on my checks and this product has been wonderful. I noticed a slight difference within the first week. It has been four weeks now and the discoloration/melasma has evened out and lightened considerably. This product also lightens and brightens the area under your eyes. I highly recommend this product.
I love the soft feeling this moisturizer offers. I will be looking forward to lighter dark spots in 8 weeks!
olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream facial moisturizer. This does the same and has the same effects as the store brand products that are larger and cheaper.
"I have used Oil of Olay since my early 20's for moisturizing (now 57) and have always been pleased with the product. I spent a lot of time in the sun and now my fair skin is paying for it. Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream works. It didn't eliminate my age/sun spots, but it did noticibly lighten them. It took about 2 months for results, so you have to be patient."
"Used a sample that came in the Walmart Beauty Box and fell in love with it. I used to have bad acne problems as a teen, and after using so many different products on my skin for years, I now have red skin and it's hard to find a good toner that doesn't irritate. This lotion is awesome, it leaves my skin feeling soft and almost immediately disappears the redness. I must also mention that I have oily skin and that wasn't affected by the use of this product."
"I have dark acne spots on chin and tried this hoping it would lighten & improve their appearance. It blends/absorbs on forehead but turns into a white flakey globby mess on nose, chin & cheeks! I tried again using less but same result. I noticed some reviewers had similar experience while majority had no problem at all. I'm curious as to why (skin type, age, application error?) . Very disappointed & still searching for a product that will help."
I purchased this product last evening. I used it before bed and again this morning. My boss noticed my skin glowing from across the office!! AMAZING! Never before have I had noticeable results in one day!!! Keep up the good work! I am 57 years old and look 37!
this is a really nice face cream. Softens skins and lightens the brown spots.
"It does what it says, it minimizes a lot of the dark spots"
"The best product, my skin feels and looks silk smooth like never before."
"You know what, I guess most of us except results in a few days, this clearly is bot possible, eat right, rest, and be happy, Im thinking the product would be great if I give it a fair chance."
This Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer is simply wonderful. I love how it makes my skin feel after application. So soft and hydrating that it seems to last all day.
I received a sample of this cream in my beauty box from Walmart and I had to go buy it! It makes my face feel amazing. I love how smooth my makeup goes on over top of it. I will be buying this again in the future.
I've noticed this with a few of Olay products. It feels nice and soft at first when you put it on but then starts to dry and clump up into flakes. This is such a cheap moisturizer. I really don't understand how it's selling for so much.
"Olay Regenerist is an incredible tool against winter cold (and drying summer, for that matter). Still, it's particularly difficult to maintain soft, fresh skin in the winter--without Olay Regenerist! I've tried more expensive creams and serums, and keep returning to Olay Regenerist. I think you will, too."
Olay products have been around for years and keep getting better! The luminous did wonders in like three days. I recieved it in a Walmart beauty box so worth it. I will continue to use and very affordable. I also have problematic skin and no problems hear. I highly recommend it!
I had used the skin advisor multiple times and decided when my usual night cream was gone I would purchase this. When I got it I thought it smelled nice. When I first put it on it does feel velvety but only feels like it's workin on the surface of the skin. If I try to rub it in it starts to flake and ball off. After using this my fingers feel sticky like gum. Have not noticed any difference for dark spots.
I am 43 years old and never been a fan of moisturizers. I was using Netrogeon for a while and thought it was finally a moisturizers I actually like as I have combination skin. I tried luminous-tone-perfecting-cream-moisturizer and LOVE IT!!! It makes my skin feel like velvet. And the tone of my skin has improved. I can't stop touching my face. Please continue making this forever.
I've used Olay products for a whole now and I love how well they work. This particular one left my face feeling soft and hide my dark spots as well as my few wrinkles I have. I'm a big fan of this line of products they have available and can't wait to see what else they come up with next.
"No pros, only cons. Left a matte finish. Had the same experience with peeling as other users. Left my skin feeling dry and lonely. Decided to keep it and use it as hand cream, but it even made my cuticles sad. I like the Regenerist microsculpting cream with SPF much better, and that's the one I would recommend."
"I've been using this product for quite a while now and never had any issues, always loved it! It has faded my acne scars quite a bit. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I recently bought a new jar and I too have been having the flakiness issue as other people. I'm not sure if something changed, or if it has to do with other products I'm using (which never was an issue before) It's definitely odd, but I will continue to use it because it works so well for me!"
"I received this sample in my Winter Wal-Mart beauty box. This moisturizer has a whipped consistency, a little goes a long way, feels light on the skin, and left my face looking refreshed and feeling really well moisturized. Definitely will be purchasing this formula into my daily beauty routine. The only negativity I have towards this product is... that the sample wasn't big enough. LOL"
I would recommend it to every women. My daughter has started to use it and loves the way her face feels. We are both have very pale skin. My mother had a very soft skin face up until the day she passed away. She was not a type of person to lay out on a sunny day. Since I live in Florida I have to be more careful and Olay is the best product I have found. I have tried many other Regenerist Products but Olay for my skin is the best
I love all Olay products I received this one in my sample box and I love it also.I am not a spring chicken anymore and when I received this I started using that evening after a couple days I could see the difference in my facial skin tones.I get really dry skin in the winter and seeing a difference that quickly was awesome.
I had some dark patches on my face and was hoping to find something to lighten them. A little bit of this Olay product each day and the dark patches faded away after just a couple of weeks. And it was so much more affordable than many other creams that couldn't have worked any better! The improvement to my skin tone was amazing.
I love this product. It feels so luxurious. I use it everyday and have already bought a replacement when my sample ran out. It is so clean feeling and the smell is light to non existent. The white color is pleasing as well. I use it all over my face neck and décolletage.
"It's hard to rate something from a tiny sample but what I can say about Olay Luminous is that I liked the subtle scent, and that it made my face felt silky smooth after application. I wish the sample had been larger! All I could do was apply the moisturizer on my face once. Didn't have enough to apply it on my neck or decollete, which was disappointing. And I would love to know if it does, in fact, fade age spots..."
"I have always trusted Olay products, and their Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Moisturizer did not disappoint! It went on smoothly, felt great on my skin, and didn't leave a heavy, sticky feeling behind. I will certainly be purchasing this product, and have already recommended to my friends and family."
Thank you Olay!!
"I'm an Olay fan, and this was a nice surprise. Based on the small size I received in my Wal Mart Beauty Box, I cannot rate effectiveness, but I can say that this product goes on smooth, smells nice, and is a fair price compared to other products of this nature in the marketplace."
I usually buy my eye moisturizer at Macy's for about $40 a jar . I don't need to anymore this stuff really works ! I ran out of my usual stuff so I used my sample until I could get more of my regular moisturizer but after using this product I'm sticking with it .
Olay has a way of making products that are as good as department store brands but can easily more of a chance for the average person to buy their products. I like the feel of it on my fingers as I apply it to my face. It has a whipped like feel to me. It is very light when applying. It also seemed to help make my skin feel a little bit better since it is very very dry right now in certain areas. It did however in the oily areas around the nose and forehead feel more oily and left a film .
"I love this product. The texture was so nice, it applied well, didn't require a lot of product to get good coverage, my skin felt lovely after using it and the scent was good. I wish the sample had been larger to see the full results but I bought the product after trying it and therefore have been able to see the long-term results and the results are GREAT!. This is a product well worth using."
"I only had a sample size was enough for couple uses but it was very moisturizing, I have very dry skin and I Usually have to apply moisturizers twice this worked on the 1st try, didnt use it long enough to see much of a difference tho need bigger samples"
I use the whole Olay Regenerist line and have been for about a year now. Women are asking me all the time what products I use. It seems a little pricey at first (if you buy it all) but you really get a lot of product and it lasts a long time. I usually run out of one a month so it does not hurt the bank account too much. It is a great product and it works!
After using Oil of Olay regenerist luminous perfecting cream moisturizer my face felt refreshed. At my age this is the type of product that is perfect to get a head start on slowing down the aging process. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that needs to add extra moisturizer for your face products or just to help with the aging process.
I received a sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer from my Walmart box and I liked it. The smell is nice and my face felt hydrated. It is too early to tell if it helps to clear any blemishes but I do plan on purchasing a full size in the future to see if it will help to get rid of my blemishes.
"Every time I have tried an Olay product I have enjoyed the smooth texture. This product has that Olay consistently smooth texture. It felt good on my face which tends to be very dry. As I sampled it I felt that my face was being nourished without an oily, greasy feel. Olay Luminous has a light fragrance. This was a first time use as a sample."
"The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting cream is a nice face cream. It is light, smooth, and has a pleasant scent. I was able to use it under my makeup with no problems. It did make my skin feel nice and soft. I'd have to use it longer to see if it evens out tone, though. I would use it longer to see how it does, but it is a great moisturizer for everyday use too."
"I really liked this. I already love the Olay brand and this product just ensures I've been right about them all this time. When I used this my skin felt like it had been exfoliated and scrubbed professionally. It went on my face so easily and I could immediately feel how soft my skin was. It had such a clean smell to the lotion and I really like that. This came in my Walmart Beauty Box and I'm glad it did. I wish there was more in the sample, but there was planety to try."
Olay makes very good products the moisture in my skin was very good and lasted it is easy to use and I think it would work on the tone and I have no idea if it will fade age spots or not there was not enough product in my sample to use long enough I do want to think it will tone and fade because Olay's other things work well smell nice and are easy to use
"I really enjoyed this cream because it still moisturizing without being too thick. It was not oily, and didn't make me break out. Another thing I really liked about it was that it was only lightly scented. I think this cream is great for every day use and will help your skin look even and at it's best."
"The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer made my skin feel great without leaving my skin feeling greasy or oily. This product is lightweight, seemed to even my skin tone out, and smells great. I would Definitly use this product again and recommend this to family and friends."
"I got a sample of this in my Walmart Beauty Box and am always glad to try out Olay products. I have to say that I can't evaluate it on it's claim of tone perfecting, since the description states that it will take up to 8 weeks to see results, and this is just a small sample. But I can say that it smells good and feels nice. Light and not greasy feeling on my face."
This was sticky but applied well. It did leave my face smooth and soft. I do not know if it evened out the tone. You would probably have to use it more than was in the sample container. I would have to use this more often to find out. I might purchase this product.
"I absolutely love this product. It feels awesome on my skin. Goes on really smooth. Haven't had the product long enough to see skin tone changes yet. I'm looking forward to skin tone changes, though...not sure how long that takes but I'm willing to wait!"
"I've used Olay products since their original offering of facial moisturizer only. I can always count on the product be gentle for my sensitive skin. Additionally, they have a number of products that are equally effective to some excessively expensive competitive brands. This offering is one of their higher priced products and, personally, I did not see any improvements in my skin from using it so I will not be repurchasing."
"I'm going to go pick up some of this ASAP! My skin felt so soft and smooth after using it. I usually don't use name brand products ( if I can get the same or similar results for less money, why not?) but this product has definitely shown me what I was missing out on."
"This product has a very light scent, that doesn't aggravate my allergies or asthma. It feels nice, when you apply it. I haven't noticed any changes with my dark spots on my face. I keep using it and hoping. I've only been using a few weeks. Maybe with long term, every day use it might have the desired effect."
I love Olay products. Especially Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer. I could see results with in two weeks. The darker spots on my face started to get lighter! The product is easy to use and smells great! I bought the full size product after trying the sample. Thanks Walmart Beauty Box for this great sample.
"This moisturizer should come with a warning label that states, Will cause major glowing to the face and you will be addicted to that glow because you can't go back to looking dull and bland after receiving so many compliments from everyone! Okay, I know a little dramatic but this product is amazing and I will never stop using it. Thank you Olay!"
"The sample was so small I have no idea if this is a good product. I love skincare and enjoy trying new products, but there was not enough of this to get a good idea. Based on the tiny amount in the sample, I didn't feel anything special in the creme that would prompt me to spend the money to try it."
"Well, I'm reviewing a sample so I'm not sure I can really say that it actually worked. I'm in my 40's and have some light expression lines. My skin has always had a natural glow to it because I regularly drink a gallon of water a day. I didn't really see or feel any difference in the 2 days I used this. If anything, my skin was irritated and blotchy."
"I have very oily skin, but I know it is still important to moisturize and I have had the most tough time finding a moisturizer that does it's job without adding to the oil or leaving my face feelings greasy. This one is it!!!! Absorbed well and made my face so soft and smooth feeling! LOVE it- just wish it were cheaper!!"
"I am rarely wowed by a sample, especially a tiny face cream sample, but I was with this. It made my complexion immediately appear smoother but without the shiny/greasy look of other moisturizers. I promptly purchased a full sized jar of the stuff. Actually, I purchased two jars and gave one to a friend who also loved it."
I received a sample of this in my Fall Wal-Mart Beauty Box. I love the scent and how easily it rubs into my skin. It's not too thick and the scent is perfect. I don't absolutley have a need for this type of cream right now but I will be purchasing it in the future!
"Sadly, this cream is much too emollient for my oilier complexion. This stays tacky on my skin for hours then sticks to my pillowcase. I'm sure someone with dry skin would love it so I'm not taking off a star for that. Obviously since I won't be buying it and continuing its use, I wouldn't know how well it would work (or not). But Olay creates some very nice products and I'd be tempted to try the full size if it would work for me."
"I'm 29 and the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer worked beautifully on my minor fine lines and helped to even my overall skin tone. It's step 5 in my 6 step daily skincare routine. It smells nice and you don't need much for a smooth, hydrated feel."
"The size of the sample was very nice. It's been months and I'm still using that sample size. It's small enough that I can keep it next to my laptop with my vitamins I take each morning. I pop the vitamins with a cup of hot tea and then moisturize with Pond's. I love it. It's not greasy and smells great too. You only need a very little to go a long way, which is why my sample container is only half used! I wouldn't purchase anything else!"
"This product claims it will even out your tone after a few uses and I wish I had enough to see that change. But given the amount I had I would say this is a great product and it left my face with a natural glow and softness that I have not seen in a long time. I used this product 2 nights in a row and while I didn't seen my tone change, I did see my skin improve."
"Former sun bunny here (as in baby oil and iodine in my teens and 20's thru sun bathing in my 40's). Noticed dark spots and various sun damage fading rapidly. You won't have to wait (or buy a second jar) before seeing results. Bonus: good moisturizer, absorbs quickly, pleasant, mild fragrance."
I liked this a lot. It wasn't too heavy and didn't sting my eyes when I put it near them like some others do. It also doesn't turn my face red and splotchy like some others do. It moisturized and wasn't sticky feeling. It wasn't as expensive as some of the other brands.
"I received this product in Walmart Beauty Box. It made my skin feel soft and smooth, the sample was not enough to rate the fading of dark spots. It is a good moisturizer. It is not a heavy moisturizer, followed with routine and skin was still soft at the end of the day. This light scent was good for me."
"No! One cannot go wrong with any Olay product. My skin feels so good and looks amazing when I use Olay products. You are never too young to begin a good skin care regime. Using quality products will make your efforts pay off. If I had to choose just one skin care product it would definitely be moisturizer. Beginning in the teens young people should keep their skin hydrated to avoid unnecessary breakouts. Continuing this practice, your skin will thank you!"
"After trying the sample I received in my beauty box, I had to go buy the full size version. I love this. It smells great! Priced at only $25.00 it's well worth it. It makes my skin so soft. I haven't used it long enough to see if it really fades dark spots but I will check back in a month and let everyone know."
I'm a grocery beauty kind of shopper. I don't have much extra money and I wish this could be found cheaper than $20 (with the use of coupons!!) anywhere. This stuff is amazing but sadly I can��t afford it so I have to live with the samples that are few and far between.
"I can't believe I'm reviewing a sample foil pack but hey here it goes. I loved how this made my skin feel, only reason I gave 3 stars is bc I literally had one time use out of how small this foil pack was for me. Can't tell if this did anything for me and since it's so small I will not buy til I get a better sample"
"Olay regenererist luminous tone perfecting cream, leaves my skin so smooth, not greasy, but light feeling & moisturized! I love this stuff! As I age, I find that my skin is losing it's natural, more even skin tone & although I only got a small amount of this, I'm tempted to buy the product, bc I feel my results could only get better! I'd recommend this product!"
Hey evryone well first i gor this as a sample in my Walmart Beauty box. This was my first time trying this and unfortunate to say was not so pleased with it. Left my face feeling dry and flakey. It did smell great but besides that i was not thrilled with this product dont think ill use it again. Sorry.
"Olay Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, Face Moisturizer, was very relaxing. This was applied after a fresh clean and dried face wash. I applied cream before bed, it was very refreshing it was not sticky and absorbed well. I could feel and see a difference in my skin the next morning. My skin was bright, not bloche and red. Still felt clean and was not greasy. Skin felt soft also."
The sample size was only big enough for one application. I usually like to use something for at least a week minimum to be able to properly evaluate the product. It smells pleasant and applied nicely on my skin and absorbed quickly which was nice. But that's about all I can say about this product only getting to use it one time.
"I've never used many products on my face, i have sensitive skin and will break out with red bumps from many produces. This product was very smooth and felt refreshing on my skin and left it glowing and moisturized. I had no problems with irritation. I like this product and will recommend it to my friends. I started using it on the drier areas between my eyes brows and the smile lines of my cheeks then incorporated using it in my daily morning routine."
I received a sample of this product in my first beauty box. It feels so smooth on my skin makes my skin feel like velvet. It even lightened my age spots. I will certainly recommend this to my friends. Since we are getting older we can use all the help we can get to feel younger.
"This moisturizer does what it says! It made my skin evened out and left it super soft, without the heavy greasiness some can leave. A little goes a long ways too. I've spent a good amount of money on more expensive brands and didn't get as much results as I did with this."
I will be hesitant to buy this again as I will only use it at night time now because it does flake off if I put makeup on over it after it's dried it actually makes my makeup look very dry and Flaky very disappointed because for the money I was hoping I could wear it under my makeup I will only use it at night now. I even tried using Less on my skin and it still flaky
"I was very excited to try this product to even up my skin tone since I am a fan of the Oil of Olay Regenerist moisturizer, however after application, I noticed it was flaking off unto my clothing and a white residue on my face. Due to opening the product, I did not want to throw away my money so I have opted to continue using the product at night, but I will not be purchasing again after this product is depleted. It appears this is a common problem with this product for many users."
"I have always loved Oil Of Olay products and this is as well as all the other of their products that I have ever used. I have never been disappointed in any of their products, not ever. They have always seemed to be of high quality ingredients and have never had skin issues from them and seem to work as well if not better than some of their higher end priced competitors. Never ever a disappointment in any of them."
"Olay beauty products are some of the best on the market. Yes, you can go to specialty stores and buy very expensive products that don't perform any better than dependable Olay. It has never let me down. There are many products available to choose from in the Olay line."
"Began noticing dark uneven skin around right eye after I turned 37. Decided to try Olay, my grandmother used this brand my entire life, after 3 weeks i began to notice a lightening of the skin, continued to use it, nights only, and in 7 weeks skin tone is even and looks great. Absolutely works!!"
same as the problem of other people every time i use it ..it has this flaky residue that peels off from my face.. i bought the miracle boost and the luminous tone moisturizer used it together and follow the direction carefully . the flaky residue still there but i like how it feels on the skin. so just use it at night i guess and not during day time unless they can suggest something to prevent this from happening
So as far as moisturizing goes its not the best. I use moisturizers at night before bed and when I use this product I usually wake up with dry skin. However my skin is always incredibly soft and it does even out my skin tone. If you paired this with a regular moisturizer you'd be set!!
"I tried this product out first as a sample in a magazine and loved it! First of all this product does what it says its going to do by hydrating the skin and leaving it soft and smooth; secondly it smells great, and thirdly I have had a lot hits and misses with Olay's skin care products, so I was very pleased when this one came through. Also this product claims to fade the appearance of dark spots and evens the skin tone in about 8 weeks, well I'll have to see about that. I am reviewing this product as a part of a contest!"
And I'm amazed that it delivered results in exactly a 2 week time frame. I wanted to test the strength of it so I applied it only to my under eye dark cirlcles and it worked! Lighter dark cirlcles and those tiny little crystals my concealer look more effective. I'm African american and it's hard to find products that work for me. This stuff is the real deal!
I tried the Luminous Tone product when I couldn't find my regular Micro-sculpting Olay product. I could only use the Luminous Tone product for three days. It has a sticky feel to it and did not have the pleasant smell that I'm used to with Olay products.
"I use more of this product at night and less in the morning. A little goes a long way!! I think anyone who might review it as ""gummy"" might be using too much? I'm in my mid-40's and have combination skin with multiple dark spots. It soothed my dry skin immediately (thank you!) and my skin is finally evening out. I love it and it is worth every penny!"
I was stressed when my skin started breaking out monthly the past 3 months leaving scars and my skin very uneven. I have been using product for almost 2 weeks now and am blow away. I'd say about 80% of my marks and spots have already faded. I can not wait to see my results after 8 weeks. UNREAL! Love it ! Would love to try more of the regenerist line in time .
I've had some dark age spots on my cheek that I tried everything on them. I am a light skinned red head in my 50's and I never should have used tanning beds when I was younger because my skin is paying for it now. The dark spots have faded a lot after using this for a month. I just use it at night. I wouldn't recommend it under make up.
"Deep cleans my body and face,leaves my face feeling fresh and looking young again .making me feel like im young again. It massage my skin making it smooth and soft, this is the best product that i've tried so far and i recemended to everyone..enjoy this product evrytime i step out of the shower"

"The products feels devine, evenly tones the skin and leaves a velvety touch thats good to the feel. When accompanied with other olay facial washes and toners, it gives remarkeble results best facials product i ever used, i gaurd it jelously, cant afford to waste"
This product is very good for your skin. I highly recommend it to anyone who has problems with their skin. My Sister has used this product for years. She is the one who told me to use this product. She's even told Her Daughter and Her Nieces about it as well.
This product is so light yet very moisturizing. My skin looks so much better and brighter. I am almost 36 years old and yet I am told by many people that I look like I'm still in my 20s. People say my skin looks great and ask me what I use all the time. This is also the first product that's not oily and doesn't break my skin out. I highly recommend this product.
Looks and feels luxurious to fingers and face. It goes on smoothly. Gives a fresher look to the face while I experienced the cream soothing the fingers while applying. You can notice a smother complexion and feel plus a slight firming of the skin. Made me feel polished.
"I am a 38 yr old w/dark spots...not cute! I decided to give this a try. I did some research and didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money. I have been using this for a week now and again..""THANK YOU JESUS!"" My dark spots have gotten so much lighter in just one week."
I will start of by saying that i am not sure if this perfects my tone or not but i love the feeling i get when i apply it. It makes me feel pretty and is not greasy. I love the smell and i might just have to switch to olay from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the texture of the cream, how it smells, and feels. It makes my skin look great, even after a long day, and people tell me how I glow now days. Its cleared up my blemishes so well I don't even use coverup anymore, and its done wonders for my self confidence. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this cream for a few days, I noticed a difference in the sun damage of the area just below my neck. My skin is very sensitive area so I used this cream alternately every other night with my regular Regenerist moisturizer. It took a little longer for the sun damage on my face to fade. I spread the remaining cream on my fingertips over the back of my hands and it faded damage there, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My coworkers noticed my skin and said, Winnie, you're glowing! What are you using on your skin? You're not pregnant are you? I said, of course not; that chapter has closed. Well, you look energized and inviting. I told them I started using Luminous tone perfecting cream and it has helped to diminish my dark spots! I gotta a resounding WOW! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best product that I have found to even skin tone on my face. With age and repeated tanning over my 73 years, I had many dark spots on my face, including an embarrassing large spot on my nose. I do not use make up, so they were quite noticeable. After only a couple of weeks using Regenerist Luminous they have disappeared. It is not often that a product actually performs as promised, but this product is fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This perfecting cream is the best I have used yet ! I have tried many products like this but have had no great results. This is a keeper. My skin has been transformed. I use it in the morning and night. Great product and reasonable price. Thank you Olay !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product because I have been usng Oil of Olay for all of my lfe, I am 66 yrs. old, and everyone ask me, what do you use on your skin...it is so pretty! I just say Oil of Olay. But recently, I discovered the luminus cream and, have been using it in concert with the Oil of Olay Regenerist....it has made me look younger and my skin feels soft as a baby's skin! Thank you to the makers of this wonderful product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The affect this product had on my skin was amazing. It took almost two months of regular use, but it gave me this lumious glow that I never thought I would be able to have after my fights with acne as a teenager. The acne left my skin thicker and while not really scarred, it was textured and opaque. This cream really brought out the best in my skin, softening way past anything I had even considered and giving me a 'peaches and cream' complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have just begun using this product and have noticed that my skin is visably brighter. My hope is that with continued used that he will continue to diminish my darkened area on my cheeks and under eye area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product (along with PROX non aging cream) for several years now. I'm 86 years old and I get compliments all the time on my clear skin. I think using these products every day has keep the wrinkles away. Thank you very much for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Took about 3 weeks to start seeing a difference in skin tone and in my skin's smoothness. Really a good value as well. Glad i don't have to pay hundred's of dollars to get the same effect! I will continue to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Olay products since since my teens and now I'm at the end of my 30's. This product is my favorite because it gives my skin a soft and moisture-filled texture while making my skin more evenly-toned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this lotion. I've been using it for about a month now and can notice results already. My skin seems more radiant and healthy. It's a very light lotion which I love so it never leaves a heavy feeling on my face. It works great under my makeup as a primer! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a person with allergies I have used very expensive to moderate (price range) creams and I seem to be allergic to them a fine rash breaks out on my face. With Olay products especially the Luminous line I can use it. It works for me brighten my skin help with the spots on my face and I am not allergic to the product line. Actually ""knock wood"" I am not allergic to any of Olay product lines and I will keep purchasing them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product twice daily. It is so light! Make-up goes on over it smoothly and never streaks. At night, it never feels heavy and messy on my face. My husband never complains about thick cream on my face. Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At my age of 67 I have developed several dark spots on my face. I tried using Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream to diminish the severity of these spots. Much to my amazement and pleasure, these dark areas started to lighten and my skin became much younger looking. I would absolutely recommend this product for any age. It is a miracle cream in a jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and honestly wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised how soft it made my skin feel. In my opinion the smell was my favorite thing about it. I feel like it helped improve the look and feel of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Lots of moisturizers claim to do what this moisturizer really does. Even at my advanced age I could see a difference in the quality of my skin, and other people notice as well. I have tried MANY different moisturizers, and this one is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this cream. It does a great job of rejuvenating my skin by removing the old skin layers and revealing the newer skin underneath. I love the way this cream hydrates as well as exfoliates my skin. I use this in conjunction with the Rejenerist Micro sculpting Cream alternating between the two creams which gives me the best of both worlds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! I have been using it for about 4 months now, and I kid you not, ever since I have received so many compliments on my skin looking younger. People don't believe me when I tell them my age (31), they are shocked because I looked like I'm in my mid 20s. And I attribute this all to Olay!!!"
I like the product as it was very moisturizing. However I feel like it is geared to an older type woman. I think it may be the advertisements on the television that make me think this way. You could also use a little diversity in the marketing. That would help appeal to more people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have breakout prone skin and this moisturizer improved the appearance of my skin over all! It smells good, absorbs quickly with no greasy feel, and did I say no breakout? Absolutely going to purchase this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff works so we'll! I'm 29 and get dark spots from acne and sun damage. When I get them I put this cream over them and they disappear within a few hours! I've had my jar for over a year and I'm surprised at how effective it still is. The only thing I don't like is that it is a little on the heavy side but for what it does I think it's worth dealing with!
It smelled good alright. But I didn't really feel any difference or see anything difference when I put it in my face. Maybe it would have given better results if I used it more over time but the sample was enough for only one use. But I don't know. And I wouldn't go out my way to buy it to find myself disappointed. I think there's other better products out there [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the way the product feels and smells. When applying the cream, it felt like silk going on your face. The smell of the product is good. I tried the sample for a week. I didn't necessarily see any results of the cream in that amount of time. Maybe if I used this product for several weeks then I could visibly see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used olay luminous perfecting cream for about a week twice a day. I wore it under my foundation daytime and applied before bed. I noticed smoother more even skin tone. It leaves a light silky feeling on your skin and smells great too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The smell is great, a lot of creams tend to almost have a chemical smell to them. I have extreme sensitive skin and it was nice not to break out with this toner. It's a great moisturizer and it's fast absorbing. Did leave my skin softer than usual as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I switch up my moisturizer every time I run out. This is because I feel like my skin will get used to a product and then the product will no longer work. My skin LOVED this Olay moisturizer. I'll definitely be buying it when I run out of moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It took me a while to try this product only because I just thought it was just another moisturizer. So wished I would have not waited...I love this product! It's not greasy feeling and it soaked into my skin and left it silky!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I put the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream on right before applying my makeup, and it made my skin glow (in addition to feeling silky soft!). It really helped keep my skin hydrated and saved me from patchy skin and dryness. I would definitely recommend this to those who have trouble finding a day moisturizer that is non-greasy and will actually have your skin looking its best.

Stay tuned, I'll be back with more results after longer use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not quite sure if this product did regenerate anything on my face. It felt nice going on and applied alright, but the sample size wasn't enough to determine if it would work in the long term. Not bad, overall! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As with all Olay products, I loved this sample. It went on clean and light, with no greasy feeling or heaviness, and the scent is absolutely fantastic. Definitely a product in which I would invest [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It makes my face feel so soft and moist. I usually have horrible dry skin this time of year, This works perfectly. The scent is a little strong but fades quickly and doesn't leave my face feeling oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this product. It did not break me out or cause any allergic reaction. It has a pleasant scent and texture. And I loved that it absorbed quite quickly into my skin and how it made my skin fee. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This cream has a nice pleasant smell that's not too strong, and the consistency is good and applies well onto the skin. It doesn't feel too thick or stick at all, my skin still feels like it can breathe, it's just softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loves this product. Must admit that the sample was too small, lol, but hey, I can't complain for being able to try this amazing product for free. Loved it so much as soon as I finished the sample, I went and bought the full size. Love how it not only hydrates my face, but over time it evens out my skin tone as I've had problem areas around my nose and cheeks with redness. My favorite thing about it, is that it's non greasy. My face is looking great and I could t be happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product helps tone the redness down on my cheeks and also moisturizes my dry skin. There isn't any sunscreen in it, which is kinda a bummer. I recieved a sample of this product free for my review. The sample was very small and only used it on my checks for a week. I was unable to see full results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in my mid-30s, and I work outside. My skin is really starting to show signs of aging and I have tried several products that are supposed to protect and help your skin look younger. Many of them are way too thick, like putting on sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the scent of this moisturizer and it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. The 2 downsides for me were: 1) My face was a little shiny after using this product, even several hours after application. 2) I strongly prefer moisturizers with sunscreen (SPF 15+) built in and this did not have that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried a sample, and liked the texture and how the product felt on my skin. I have multiple areas on my face that are bothersome in the summer especially, so I'm willing to try this for a few months to see if this helps balance my skins appearance at all.

"I have dealt with uneven skin and hyperpigmentation for a while, so naturally when I recieve a product that is intended to correct tone, I am excited. This product has a nice scent and goes on pretty, even. Its not caky, it moisturizes the skin. I found that it was a great primer to put on prior to application of my makeup. However I did not notice a significant change in the evenness of my skin. Perhaps it works well for minor tone issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"While Olay's Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream does soften the areas in which it is used, I can't say that it does so more than any other regular face lotion and, as far as it's main purpose, I, personally, didn't see a difference (after a month of use). I give it credit for it's moisturizing properties, but I'm afraid it falls short elsewise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried the tone perfecting cream moisturizer by Olay i thought it was okay. It says to use it over our face and neck morning and at night. I didn't like to use it in the morning..because for some reason my make up would roll up with it..making it look like my face was peeling. So i just used it at night before bed. I did its job though moisturized..but im not sure on the tone part. But i would use it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I do like how this product luminizes your skin and makes your makeup look really nice. I did not like the scent and wasn't fond of the ingredients either. But I think the product does what it claims. Nice and moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the feel of my skin after applying this moisturizer. I definitely want to keep using it to see is the luminous claims are true, but I know it does its job of moisturizing! There is a scent to the product that is hard to explain, slightly chemical, not the typical Olay smell. That doesn't bother me, but I felt it was important to note in a review! Can't wait to grab a full size of this product and keep on using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This product felt nice when it was applied but honestly the sample was too small to tell if it was helping or not. There is absolutely no way to know out of one use if a skin care product is doing anything for you. All I can tell you is it didn't do any harm after I used it. I'm giving it three stars because I have no way of knowing how it actually worked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Which i can say the only thing new I've tried, is the tone perfecting cream. No irritation, no peeling. I haven't broke out. So far so good. I just wish it was just a little bigger size.

"I feel like the results were instant!my face felt great, but unfortunately the product was just too expensive and I couldn't find any information on their animal testing regulations and I won't buy anything I can't be sure was not tested on animals.

"I did like this product quite a bit. When I put it on my face it made my skin feel really soft and silky. It also appreared to help my skin tone on a short term bases, but I will have to wait until I purchase the product to see what the long term effects will be on my skin tone. I received a sample of this product from the pinch me sample site. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm so happy to had the opportunity to try a sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. The scent is not over powering, its a lovely scent, quick absorbing, very creamy, it leaves my skin very silky smooth, absolutely love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a lovely cream. The scent is a little strong but quite pleasant. It absorbed nicely into my skin, leaving my skin soft and smooth. I will continue using this cream to see the long term results. Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good product that I will recommend to family and friends, the only issue I have will all Olay products Is that they retail for such a high price. If they were a little cheaper I may be more inclined to buy on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was excited to try this, as I've just started noticing dark spots & have been thinking about changing up skin-care routine. It actually started to make a little difference I believe. Will be purchasing very soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in the sun alot so I get sunspots alot, I am always looking for something to take care of this issue easily. I love that it is 2 in one, most are just spot treatments and not a moisturizer as well. It feels good on the skin and it does work :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked that the moisturizer wasn't greasy feeling and absorbed into my skin quickly. I noticed a difference in my skin after using the sample but it did take the entire sample to notice the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have had several people tell me they love this line, but I found it to be a bit heavy and greasy. I did not like the residue it felt to leave behind. The scent was okay, but not my favorite either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well, unfortunately I would like to say it works great. But I only tried a sample, which honestly I would need to try a product for a longer period of time - so that I can really see how my skin reacts to the product. So I will be going to purchase this product. Thank you for the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really can't give a good review on the sample size received. I can say I have used Olay eye wrinkle cream in the past and it seemed to help with fine wrinkles. This is a tone perfecting cream though. It does have a nice fragrance- not overpowering. I was very surprised at how well it absorbed into my skin. I also put a little on my hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I struggle with uneven skintone so I'm constantly on the lookout for products which claim to even the tone of my skin. I think after many uses of this product I would see results to this claim, but even the little I've used, I really liked! I thought there was just the right amount of moisture without being too oily. The price is a little more than I would spend on a basic moisturizer, but I would love to use this product in addition to my daily moisturizing cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been searching for a cream that would drench my dry skin and make it seem more youthful. This absolutely did the trick. It was easy to put on not greasy and the after all effects were great. I felt good knowing my skin looked glowing and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't see an immediate difference with this sample but with it being olay moisturizer which is a brand I already use and I never have allergic reactions to I would be willing to buy it later and try it for a longer period of time to see what I really think of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really wanted this to work, especially after reading good reviews, etc... but my first application left me red and blotchy and sore. This is not the case for every individual, and it may work for someone else. My body simply reacted to something within the formula, it happens sometimes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good product, and fits the Olay brand. I wish these products had no scent, since it impacts my ability to use it. And those of us with normally freckled skin might not see results as quickly as others. But it seems to work nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion felt nice and absorbed quickly while providing adequate moisture for my skin. I didn't notice any ""tone perfecting"" qualities, but it also didn't irritate my face. While it smelled nice, I would imagine the fragrance could be irritating to some people with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I adored using olay tone perfecting cream! The scent is intoxicating and its not sticky or difficult to rub into your skin. It practically melts upon contact (in a good way) and my skin felt and looked beautiful! I will surely purchase this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels nice on my skin and didn't leave it feeling super greasy, but I didn't notice any difference in my skin tone/blemishes etc. I'm happy with my current moisturizer which also doesn't correct my blemishes and is less expensive so I'll stick with my current until I find one that works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm glad Olay offers so many options in skincare. Wouldn't it be nice if a brand could (truly) offer ALL of the benefits of each product in simply ONE container? Olay would be the #1 product on market! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this moistureizer at night after I washed my face throughout the week. My face was like an oil slick when I woke up. I did not like the feeling and I had to wash my face again just to get all of the residue off. None of my current moisturizers do this. The scent is really nice, but may not be for those who are sensitive to fragrance. I say this is for people with dry skin. I have combination skin and it did not work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer worked great had my face. Soft and it smelled great to.I will be buying a bigger tube of it soon.It changed. My skin on my face its now sod with no dry spots.. It's a good product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked that Olay Regenerist Luminous did a good job hydrating my skin and my face was somewhat luminous without looking glittery - just a natural glow. Product absorbed quickly and didn't feel greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm a huge advocate of all natural and organic face products and am sad that you have to create a product with so many chemicals... MANY anti-aging products on the market are chemical free and organic. Olay should really look into a line. I did try the sample and thought it worked excellently. Just not too fond of the chemicals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I used this product the first night I was pleasantly surprised about how it tightened my skin...the next morning I did notice that my face felt and appeared a little smoother...I used it again that morning and that night and there was a definite improvement...I will be buying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream felt soft going on and not sticky which is a huge plus. Next morning my sin felt soft. Used sample for 3 more days, and I love the way my skin feels. I have already bought this product! It's a keeper in the sea of products available to me as a consumer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The sample was not sufficient enough to make a thorough review of the product claims, however when applied, the texture of the product was nice and smooth (non greasy). The product had a faint pleasant scent which might be a problem for individuals with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed that OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM felt light and not greasy on my skin, made my skin feel softer. I spend a lot of time outdoors and Olay really helped my skin. Love the product and would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this facial moisturizer. I do feel that my current moisturizer achieves the same level of hydration with more natural ingredients and less heaviness but I can't attest to its long term effects as it was a small sample. It is a good product for my sensitive, combination skin and I'd recommend it to anyone searching for a new, affordable moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The size of the sample was too small to determine the effectiveness of the product long term. However, given the ingredients of the product, I would prefer sticking to my current moisturizer, which is more natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My experience with Olay products has been positive in the past, and the Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was no exception. It has a rich, velvety feel and a light fragrance, so it's a pleasure to use, but best of all, it did improve the general appearance of my skin. I'd definitely use it again, and look forward to seeing the improvements that a full size product has to offer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a loyal user of Dermasilk products, regardless of availability, or pricing. I adore their product, ""Flawless,"" though it has a bit of a distinct smell, mildly unpleasant. This did the same job, just as well, costs similar, but, it's readily available, and smells SO much better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the feeling of it on my face it felt as if I wasn't wearing anything on my face and I felt my skin seemed clearer and glowing in a way. I liked it but I don't know if I'd use it over my other moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is perpetually dry with uneven skin tone. I love that I can get two benefits out of one moisturizer. It certainly saves space in my beauty supplies, and lessens the amount of time I have to spend on my skin care routine. I love the way this feels, and I really love that it lasts.

"I regularly use Olay sensitive skin facial moisturizer as part of my daily skincare routines. I must admit that this product is an improvement, it left my skin feeling like silk and helped with the redness I often deal with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't like the scent of this product. Also didn't like how it made my skin feel. However I did use it a few times. Did not notice any visible changes to my skin. I priced it online seems expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was skeptical thinking yeah sure. But this product works. My facial imperfections (dark spots) have faded and are less noticeable. It has helped even the tones more naturally. I'm off to the store [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This broke me out like crazy! The scent was a bit strong but not too bad and the feel was ok as well. The break outs are why I quit using it and recommended it to my mom hoping it wouldn't cause break outs for her too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's an okay moisturizing cream. I did not see any tone correcting after using up the sample. I was not impressed with the scent either, smelled like grandma's perfume. Also it took awhile to absorb after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Olay product scents. However, I live in the desert currently and need much more moisture than this provided. I'm sure it would be a good product for someone that doesn't need intense amounts of moisture as I do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this luminous tone perfecting cream smooth to apply and light but pleasant in scent. I did not have enough of a sample to make a judgement as to the luminous results it advertises, but I am satisfied by the other aspects of this product and could see myself purchasing this product in the future.

"I used this product and within two days my face glowed. To ensure it was the product and not just my water intake. I discontinued using it for three days and during that time, I could tell the overall tone of my face looked uneven. Once i began to use the product again, within two applications it was smooth and glowed. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to sample this particular moisturizer because it reminds me of my Great Grandmother. She used it every single morning and evening. The sample is small and so I don't know if I would use it instead of what I use now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love this product -- it feels like a dream on my skin. My skin is sensitive and prone to redness (rosacea). I usually use CeraVe facial products because of this sensitivity, but this Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Correcting Cream works just fine with no irritation.

"I've used various types of Olay products and am usually satisfied, There just wasn't enough to know if I actually like this product. Creams usually need more than just one night's worth in order to tell if it is worth my time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product had a wonderful, silky feeling without lingering for hours afterward. I loved using it, bought some more and recommended it to the Ladies Club at my church. Many of the ladies remarked how much better my skin looked! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the feel of this on my skin and felt it went on nice. However i did not notice a difference in my tone or complexion as the product claims. You might have to use it longer though then the sample allows. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream over the course of 3 day. The application was easy and the product was absorbed into my skin, but did not produce a visual change in my appearance. As per the Olay website, this product needs 8 weeks of application to notice changes in dark spots, age spots, etc., I did not have enough product to appropriately evaluate this element of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product did not soak into my skin. As I was rubbing it onto my face it was clumping up/rolling itself into what I would describe as wet paper pieces. I ended up washing it off and using my previous moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took my sample to Las Vegas on a getaway--it was the perfect size for a long weekend, and I wasn't planning to take any makeup. The moisturizer left my skin soft and minimized my pores, so I wasn't as self-conscious without makeup as I otherwise would have been. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The amount that I received wasn't really enough to determine if this product is for me. There was only enough for one day and I didn't see enough of a difference from my regular moisturizer to say I would buy this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to say, this cream was not a bad product at all. I just feel that it didn't do much more than the bargain store brands did. I will definitely give it another try, but there was nothing that really stood out to me that made this product leaps and bounds better than the generic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed a difference in my skin's appearance immediately after using this. I have tried numerous skincare products both inexpensive and expensive. This is a great price considering the quality. I would highly recommend this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have always been an oil of play fan, but this product is over the top. It's wonderful. As soon as tried it, I knew it was for me. It went on so smoothly and my face felt like silk.

"I enjoyed using Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. The cream had a light refreshing scent and left my face looking brighter. I used this product mostly before bed and would wake up with soft, smooth skin. I recieved this product free for review but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is fast absorbing and is a great moisturizer if putting on before applying makeup. I have noticed a huge difference in just a month, especially with even skin tone. I would recommend this product, it is a great two in one (moisturizer, and tone perfecting). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not big on Olay but this went on nicely without being oily. Since it was a sample, I did use it mostly on an area where I did have some"
'spots' and they did lighten considerably compared to where I didn't use it. This would definitely be worth buying compared to other products costing twice as much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm not a huge fan of spending lots of money for skin care so I was happy when I received my trial size in the mail. I started applying it shortly after receiving it and could feel the difference in my skin. A co-worker even made a comment about how nice my skin looked and asked if I was wearing anything on my face. So glad I got a chance to try this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love the creamy feeling of this product. It is lightweight and not too greasy but after a while it seems to rub off when I touch my face. Other than that, I can tell a big different using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the product smelled nice, and went on very silkily, it's difficult to know how effective it is because the sample was soooo small. I would think a company looking for feedback/new customers would give samples with enough in them to use it for a week or so. This sample had barely enough for a single application. Until I actually purchase the product to see how well it works (or doesn't), I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did not notice a difference while using this sample. I guess because it was such a small sample I could not make an informed decision. I purchase less expensive products that show me more results than this product did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay products. Goes on smooth, was nonirritating on my rosacea, smells nice. There wasn't enough product in the sample to tell if it works or not. I would use my regular Olay moisturizer and just apply this to the appropriate spots, but I think it would work better if I had more product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product left my skin feeling smoother but it was not moisturizing enough for my dry/aging skin. Also, i like to use products with SPF included and this doesn't appear to have that. It is a nice product, just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this sample for free in exchange for my honest review. It has a very pleasant smell and it feels like and not heavy or greasy at all. I gotta be honest, I didn't really see a difference in my skin when compared to the moisturizer that I already used but it does make my skin feel nice and I do like the smell so as a moisturizer, it works pretty well. I have a normal skin completion so I don't know how it would affect oily/dry/combination skins. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay develops great facial products. This is the second Olay product now that I have tried, and both leave your face feeling amazing. The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream seems to lighten the dark spots on your face, and also again leaves it well hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is older and has age spots on their face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the Olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream for free to review.I really liked it, it did everything it was intended to do.

"I loved this product. There was enough in the sample to use a few times. I loved the feel, smell of this product. To be honest I really didn't notice anything different than using the traditional Olay Face Moisturizer (which I love and have been using since I was a teenager and I'm almost 50) the only difference noticed was the shimmer in the lotion.

I liked the product and its texture to the touch of my skin. But I think I won't really know a difference till using it a little bit longer. It's kind of expensive so using it on and off . Won't really tell me if its working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Your face will just love the new face creme by olay. Just envision how your face will absorb and soften the fine lines and tighten the face. Loving your face has never been easier!

I was told by a number of people that my skin looked better so I had to honestly credit this product to it. I didn't even wear makeup on those days. I recommend this product because people will see the difference immediately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This facial moisturizer goes on very smoothly and easily. It was absorbed by my skin almost immediately after applying. I never noticed any oily or greasy residue left behind one it was absorbed.

"I really liked the feel of this moisturizer. However, I have extremely sensitive skin so I tend to choose unscented products. The small sample did not irritate my skin, but I'm a little worried that after buying the full size product I may have trouble. There really is no need to add fragrance to skin products.

This olay regenerist sample was awesome. I had used some products from this line in the past but it had been awhile. This cream was very easy to add to my skin care routine and left my skin looking and feeling great. It was easy to apply and smelled and felt great. This is much more affordable and easy to purchase than some of the other moisturizers that I had been using from department stores and I think the result it just as great!

"When i received the sample I was wxcited. I've been looking for a good anti aging product. Unfortunately, with only one sample it's hard to tell the effects of the product. I liked the texture, it was smooth and creamy, but I wish the sample was larger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was applied with ease and has a silky like texture. It was heavy on my skin and didn't feel greasy. The smell was bad at all but the cream itself felt like it contained too much water. It was too thin for my taste, especially since I have really dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I suffer from hyper pigmentation so it takes a while for me to notice any sizable type of changes. But I must say I really do like this product. After using the sample I was able to see a small amount of change in my skin, it was enough to make me decide to purchase the product and continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to say that I do really like Oil of Olay products to start with so I was excited to see what this product would do and I was not disappointed. Some products clog the pores on my face and I will get a mini breakout from them but this one did great. It is smooth going on and it did appear to correct my tones a bit. This along with a B&B cream and it makes a lightweight routine for the hot summer here in Florida. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like Olay Regenerist. The scent isn't overwhelming. It feels good on my skin and isn't oily. I have only tried a sample at this time, so I can't speak to the long term affects. But, if for any reason I am unable to use my current moisturizer, I would definitely be willing to give this a run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

After 8 weeks, it faded the look of my age spots, sun spots and discoloration. Pleasant scent and absorbs fast, not at all greasy. My overall skin tone appears brighter, as well.

"I have tosay I wish the sampler would have provided much more product because wearing and testing out the crea only once and using it the second time only on half of my face because I ran out of the sample, I just cant see how much validity my opinion could bring however, what I will say is tthefeel and lightness of the cream is perfect if you hate feeling like your wearing vaseline on your face, if this sounds like you, ur totally going to love it.

I did love love love how it brightened up my under-eye circles, so that part was a huge bonus - but the overall moisturizer didn't work for me.

"I like the brand and had high hopes for this product, however, I didn't notice a difference with the small sample that I received. I would've liked to have a larger sample to see how it does over time. The look and feel of the cream was good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Some moisturizers go on thick or greasy and stay that way. This product does neither. It feels great right out of the package. And there is no greasy feeling on your skin. It smells great too! I haven't used it long enough to see improvement in my skin, but my pillow thanks you for keeping it clean at night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a good product but I would not purchase as it was a bit too heavy for my skin, I think it is a bit pore-clogging for my skin--I am 34 and my skin is still quite the mixture of oily/dry--depends on the day :( this would probably be good for someone who's skin has aged more than mine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprised at how well this moisturized my face and didn't feel greasy or cause me to break out. I'm not normally and Olay user, but this product has me thinking that I might consider their products in the future. The scent is also nice and pleasant :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There wasn't enough of the sample to try it for the full amount of time necessary to see a change. It suggested 2x daily for 8-weeks to see a change in discoloration of skin spots. I did feel a difference in my skin after I applied it (almost like a tingling). However, I would not use this to replace my current moisturizer. I prefer SPF in mine and this did not have it.

"From the wife: Happy to be introduced to the product. I have heard of the new product and used olay in the past, but did not get a chance to purchase this particular product. Will be using it going forward to complement my existing face wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was impressed with my sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM, it has a light clean feeling on my skin and I do like Olay products as they generally are not overbearing nor do they clog your pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have oily skin but need moisture, especially during the winter. It is hard to find a light weight moisturizer that doesn't make my skin greasy. The OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM worked perfectly. Moisture but no greasy skin an hour later. It make my skin look and feed wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion has the same ease of application as other Olay lotions and with a light scent. I'm not sure if it truely tones the skin, but would need to use for a longer length of time to see any possible results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream left my skin feeling soft and moisturized without feeling greasy. My skin looks really healthy when using it and seems to be a bit more even in tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this moisturizer. It goes on so easily. It doesn't just sit on your face. It absorbs fast and nice. I get migraines so I'm very sensitive to smells. This is very very light. It feels clean on the skin and not greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Was pleased with the sample given, however, I feel it's not enough to truly be able to see results with the amount given. I currently use an Olay lotion, but may consider picking this up when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a facial cream that I truly like, but was pleasantly surprised with this Olay product. I will consider purchasing it in the future depending on price and availability after I run out of my current brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately this product did not work for me. After only 2 applications, My face was red and burning. I have a lot of sun spots and was hoping this product would help with those. Unfortunately, I didn't get to use it long enough to know. My skin is not usually that sensitive to this type of product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall I liked the way the product smelled and felt on my skin. Unfortunately it is priced a little about what I can/want to pay. It is a very good product and I would recommend it to anyone to at least try one time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have really sensitive dry skin and this feels wonderful after application. I tend to switch between two or three different creams depending on the weather and I love how this makes my skin feel. I haven't been using it long enough to notice any change in my overall tone, but it has helped to reduce some redness and a few freckles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is not just a moisturizer! It goes on before your face makeup sort of as a primet ! It smoothed out the uneven tones in your skin so that the makeup glided on more evenly . Gently leaves skin soft wit no sticky feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this moisturizer a lot, it made the fine lines in my face appear to disappear. I'm not sure if it's just temporary or if long term use would actually help diminish these lines but it is easy to apply so I wouldn't mind having to use it everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Maybe the sample was just too small but I saw no luminosity to my skin or moisturizing and did experience excessive drying and the product caking on my skin. Also note that I do use other Olay products with great results; this one not so much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a wonderful facial cream, I only wish it was a bigger sample so that I could really see the effects on my skin. However just the ease of application, scent and the overall way it felt on my face is probably enough to get me to make a purchase. I can only hope that it helps my skin tone as well as it feels on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is your average cream. I am currently using other creams that i an satisfied with and Olay's cream id good, but not good enough to make me want to switch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I Have fallen in love with olay products in general from soaps to body washes and facial cleaners and this is no different I love how my skin responds to olay products brighter firmer clearer and younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love Olay products to begin with so not really surprised that I liked this. Left my face feeling clean and not greasy. I liked how my face looked afterward and would recommend to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. However, the price is the only thing prohibiting me from purchasing this product as I am on a very limited budget. I love how it smoothed out my wrinkles and left my face feeling very soft and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love most of the Olay products I have tried. I used to get into my moms cream when I was little and now I have my own. The sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM felt great going on and I am looking forward to using it to see how the toning effects work over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Granted, I only had a small sample size of this product to make a judgement, but I didn't notice any visual difference in my skin after using. It might be that the effects are more long term, but from my experience, this wasn't anything special. I like the Olay brand, and would use it in a pinch, but it doesn't compare to my regular moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My personal experience was that I saw no marked improvement when I used this product compared to others I already own. Maybe if I had a larger sample to use over a longer period I may be able to make a better decision about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this as a free sample. There was not enough product to leave a full review . The cream is very soft and moisturizers week. I'm not convinced of it ""tone proffecting"" abilities with one application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like how it made my skin feel after putting it on. There was no greasy feeling and it absorbs quickly and completely. I would like to be able to use it daily for two weeks or so and then see if there is a visible difference after daily applications. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As stated, this is a good moisturizer for the price. My skin felt soft after using. I had a light break out, but this happens when I switch products, the sample was not large enough for my skin to adjust. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I suffer from dark spots due to sun exposure. I figured I'd give this sample a chance. I had a small sample, but in the little I used it I did see a change. I currently cannot afford to purchase the fullsize cream, but I would recommend it to someone who wants to help their skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I personally would not spend as much money on a moisturizer as this product cost, the effects of the product on the skin were great. I had enough in the sample to use for 2 days and my skin looked brighter and felt softer. It allowed me to use one less layer of concealer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My problem with some samples is that I feel you need a few uses in order to make an educated review. This lotion was very nice, but is it making a difference on my skin? I couldn't say. This sample was a one time use."
"Anyway, this smelled pleasant and was easy to apply. Overall, I enjoyed it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer. I got to try this and the another Olay product, but the other one works over several weeks and I only got a small amount to sample. This was a better sample size and I was able to use it over the course of several days. I haven't noticed a difference in dark spots, but I'll keep using it until it runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product. I already use Olay so was anxious to try it. I loved how my skin felt after application. It was smooth but not oily. I wish it had an spf one though. That I would definitely purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product left my skin feeling oily and greasy. I used it at night after washing my face, but I cannot imagine trying to use it under make-up. In addition, the moisturizer left my skin dry the next morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Sensitive skin
This product worked well to moisturize my skin for a few days but my sensitive skin proved to be too strong and I ended up breaking out from it. But this product could defiantly be beneficial to people with normal skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think people with sensitive skin would be better off avoiding this product. It left my skin red and patchy after the first use. Once the redness died down it seemed alright. But after a few days use I broke out. The texture of the cream was nice, but I can't report any positive changes in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"For a product with a name as lengthy as ""Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream"" it came a bit short of expectation. It was by no means ""bad"", it's actually quite a nice lotion, but nothing that would justify the title. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just did not find anything about this moisturizer that set it apart from the others. It left my skin soft and I loved the scent. The sample size is too small to see any prolonged use benefit and the cost is too high for me to try that on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"it feels like a mask, but I just love how light and high quality finishing. I have not used Olay products until now, but this sample actually made me wanna buy them! the texture is very good. I have dry skin and I need extra moisture on my skin. this cream was good, but it was little longer time to moisturize and dry out. Overall, this products is good for daily facial routine. I will recommend to try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The tone perfecting cream worked great on my skin without weighing it down. It wasn't oily or greasy. It was the perfect balance of ingredients for my skin and worked perfectly to make it smooth and illuminated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Awesome product! No balling up on my skin like some others stated. Great, floral fragrance which I really like. Feels awesome on the skin. Very smooth and hydrating. My dark spots on my cheek have faded considerably after only 2 weeks - I can't wait to see results at 8 weeks! Overall, I 100% recommend this product. Note: I have combo/oily skin so I only do this moisturizer overnight. Has not broken me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Considering it was only a very small tube I only got one application but with that application I was very impressed with it. It has a very nice scent to it and went on really well. I could feel my skin start to tingle and when that happens I consider the product is really working. I used it at night before I went to bed and it didn't rub off on my pillow. In the morning when I woke up my skin was soft and smooth. I really like it and I am going to buy it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is a Cream made to brighten your complexion and works hard to do that. I found it really made my skin feel tight. My skin is sensitive so it felt tight but my checks were also very itchy. I could really feel the tight texture on my skin though from using the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to try this product from Olay. I have used other products from the Regenerist line and was not disappointed in this one's quality either. Would definitely use this as a daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product did leave my skin moisturized and it felt very smooth in the mornings when I woke up. It did give me a very slight luminous appearance when I applied it but I'm not sure that it lasted through the night. When I tried to rub it in to my skin sometimes it would roll off like it was not really absorbing into my skin but other than that it was a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Olay product felt very nice ... smooth, light and not greasy. The scent is light and I like it. There is not enough of the sample to find out if it actually tones as it states it does. It was simply a nice smelling and feeling moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a nice texture and absorbs well. My skin felt soft after i applied it. I did not notice any brightening of my skin, but the sample was small, so I do not think there were enough usages available to be able to evaluate that claim. My biggest issue was the scent. I prefer non or lightly scented products. This one has a heavy, floral scent that I really disliked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I looked at the ingredients for this product and didn't recognize anything. It caused me to break out and made my skin look worse. I always thought oil of olay was a premium product for the price they charge, but after finally having gotten to try it out I know I won't be seeking it out in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream felt wonderful on my skin... Unfortunately, I was not given enough of the product to make an informed opinion about a product that I was given only enough to put on my face for one time. I enjoyed receiving it, but I won't pretend to give a review for it... I had to give it stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this sample from Pinchme. Also curious about this product. I have never used a luminance tone perfecting product. Didn't really impress me too much. I am quite happy with my current product. Not my thing but glad I sampled this before spending money on it as it is way too pricey for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the sample and I fell in love. The way my skin looked and felt afterward was surprising. I didn't think a tiny little sample size would make a difference but it did. My skin was softer and brighter. I bought the cleanser in addition to the moisturizer today. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Finding a good moisturizer is pretty hard because after applying my face tends to still be dry around the mouth area. This happens even with the more expensive department store brands. I love the results of Olay Regenerists Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would have never paid this amount for a facial cream. I am strictly a dollar store shopper. I have been converted now! I am addicted to this cream now! I put it in the fridge before use and putting it on cold is the best treat to myself and an amazing way to start my day. I highly recommend and will continue to buy this product and try other products from their line in the future!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First, can I just say that the scent of this facial cream is awful - Secondly, my face turned a brand new shade of red after a few seconds and literally burned. On the bright side, the skin on my arms did not react violently, so I was able to use it there. Very soft/moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After trying a sample and hearing such wonderful comments, I went out and bought the full size Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. I use this before my night cream and find it to make my skin look alive - brighter, clearer and very healthy looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product. It was in fact pearly feeling and very smooth on my skin .I definitely saw a difference in my skin .it is a great product for someone like me who is just starting to look into anti aging products. I just turned 30 so this is a whole new area of products I need to look into. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"while i'm not a huge fan of scented facial skincare, i do enjoy the scent of this product. this is a fairly light moisturizer that feels about right for my combo-oily skin. i'm not sure about the toning aspect of this product because the sample size was not large enough to try long enough to notice results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I currently use a different, high-end brand of moisturizer and liked this perfecting cream - just not enough to switch from my normal stuff. However, this is a great alternative and would use if I bought my creams from drug stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay products are always best in quality & performance, this one is as usual just as good. Easy to apply, does give glow after application, lasted fairly well but it is just a sample not full size to know full results. Will try purchase to see how it does work with daily applications.

"I enjoyed using the cream. I used it daily to make sure i was getting the full benefit. I did notice a differene in my skin after a while, however it was not such a major difference that I would go out and buy the product. However it was nice to use while I had it. If I was a bit older I could see myself potentiojally using it. I really liked the texture of the product and it did not leave my skin feeling greasy.

"From the small sample I can say that it seemed to leave my skin feeling less dry and stressed but as for any long term changes I could only guess. I have always liked Olay Products, I have as to date had any problems with any of their products, so yes I will try this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Olay tone perfecting cream did not make much difference for me. I suffered with facial hyperpigmentation during pregnancy and was hoping this cream would help to restore my natural skin tone but I saw no noticeable visual improvement after using the entire sample tube. I would not spend my money buying this product since it didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream was decent. My skin is not terrible, just dry, and uneven toned. This sample may not have been enough to notice a change in skin tone, but I am a fan of Olay products and prices, esp the Regenerist and ProX lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There's a lot of things I look for in products. Aside from the product doing what it claims it does, I look for texture and scent. The texture was great. Not slimy or pastey but I did not like the scent. It smelt like a perfume gone wrong. Honesty is my best policy. Im gunna have to go with no,I will not be going to the store to purchace this any time soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love how it feels when I put it on. It makes my face feel smooth and it smells nice. I'm just not sure I noticed anything different about my facial uneven tone. Maybe if I used it longer. I'm still debating on buying a full size jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Loved the texture of the cream. It's very lightweight and smells amazing. The fragrance of the cream was not overwhelming at all. I have some redness that develops around the edge of my nose and this cream helped tone down the redness. I found the cream very moisturizing and very easy to use. After using the product, my skin have more luminosity and appeared brighter. It's a product that I will continue to purchase at an amazing price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not really sure what the addition of mica is except to say you will have ""luminous"" skin. The marketing for this and push for luminous skin strikes me as odd. The word makes me think of shiny skin, which I want to avoid. I didn't notice any change in my skin with use and the smell was too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I geel like this face cream has been hyped up way more than it should. I feel like its just a plain lotion. My current moisturizer feels much cleaner and fresher. It also has spf in it. Aside from a slight shimmer which im not sure is very healthy for your skin, i saw no benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was lucky enough to be able to try the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. I wish the sample had been a bit larger as the cream itself is high quality. The cream instantly sank into my skin as I blended it in. Never left behind a shiny look for greasy feel. The texture is lightweight and leaves skin incredibly soft and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There is no greasy feel from using this, it leaves my skin soft. Almost like a powder like feeling after i put it on, but not drying like some products can be. I have an issue with breakouts and I have yet to have any issue with that and this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Coming in a decently sized sample, I was pleasantly surprised at how well I enjoyed the feel upon application, the way my skin tone DID improve and I didn't mind the soft floral scent a bit either.

Just beautiful natural skin is all I desire and this product delivers. I highly recommend it for all skin tones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I definitely really like using this cream because it is intensely moisturizing. I use it at night after removing makeup and cleansing my face. I have dark circles and the cream didn't do much for that. I feel like the color of the freckles on my nose is tamed for the next day when I use this cream. The scent is also pleasant.

"I was pleasantly suprised at how great the OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM turned out to be! Growing up I always remembered my grandmother used Oil Of Olay products.

Who would have thought her tried and true is now my tried and true!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love this product. The sample was large enough to get a really good idea of how it works and makes my skin feel and look. I always feel like my skin has mini imperfections in pores.

The dark spots under my eyes and the sides of my nose are gone! I use it every day and it feels so refreshing. Great product I must say.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The package said that it would have a diffrence over night. I don't think that it had a huge impact for one night in my few fine lines nor on my forehead wrinkles. But I did notice a diffrence in tones kin was firmer I think that if used longer then one night it could make a diffrence in my firmness . Can't wai to find out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Out of all the cream samples I have gotten ( and I have gotten a lot ) this is the best cream I have ever used. It goes on very smooth, absorbs very quickly and makes my face feel so soft !! When I get enough money I will be using this cream from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product went on smoothly, nice light scent. My skin was looking a bit dull and I think it did make my skin look brighter but I have not used it long enough to test the long term benefits. Overall, works well and seems like a good product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream and I love it! The scent is very refreshing and the cream goes on nice and smooth with no greasy feeling. It is a great moisturizer also! This is one product I will definitely be buying in the near future. Thank you Bzzagent and Olay for the opportunity to try this great product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love how this product makes my skin feels and looks, I used a little bit once in the morning when I got off and once at night before I went to work for three weeks. My skin looks and feel better my tone is even and the it smell amazing too. It's very light weight so I could wear it under foundation when I wore it. I recommend any women wearing this for great skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

At first I was a little skeptical about trying the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. I found it hard to believe that a cream could do all that it promised. After trying this product I was proved wrong! The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is absolutely amazing! My skin has never felt so soft and looked so clear! Also the smell is SO GOOD!!! I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of dark spots and desires soft skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried this product twice and it broke my face out. It was okay till the next morning my face was in hives. I did not buzz about it because of the bad reaction.

This product is absolutely amazing! It gives your skin that glowing look and it helps to tone and your skin as well. I use this product everyday and I will probably continue using this product for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product for awhile , but have yet to see any noticeable difference . My skin is extremely dry and flaky and this product does well when I combine it with my regular moisturizer , but alone my face does not feel soft . I think this product would work well with normal skin . It's just not for me . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always liked the Oil of Olay products, and this one has done it again! After using for a week, I did notice my complexion evening out and I liked how my foundation looked layered over the Oil of Olay cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was apprehensive about this product initially. I have continued to use this day and night, one of the features I like the most is the smell, it is light, and fresh without smelling like soap or perfume, just a great smell. It is great moisturizer, leaving skin refreshed, not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using this product. It went on smoothly and it was a good moisturizer for my skin, which tends to be dry. The only thing keeping me from buying it is the cost. Thank you for letting me try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free to try from BZZ Agent. I really love this product. I have been using for a few weeks now and notice a significant difference in the dark spots that I have from acne. I use it as directed, twice a day, and I was surprised on how fast it started working. I know some other lightening products take a long time. I did purchase a full size product to continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am very impressed with this cream. It is so moisturizing and it evens out my skin tone. I've noticed that my skin is brighter and more even after about 3-4 weeks of daily use. I love the smell too! I am definitely going to keep using this product and will be purchasing a full sized bottle as soon as I can find it in stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

why buy the expensive creams when this does all and more. I tried a sample and after a few days I saw that my skintone appeared more even which is huge for a skincare addict like me! I never expected this to happen from a drugstore brand and I went and bought the big one right away. I just saw it made another list of best new products and I'm not surprised!

"I always worry when it comes to face creams, will it work, will it make my skin break out, will it dry it out? Those are always the main questions I have. So when I tried this I was not a fan. It didn't seem to moisturize my skin like I hoped and seemed to greasy for my liking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"FIRST off, LOVE the scent! I felt as if it were just lotion at first but then after you rub it in you can feel the intense moisture it has to it if you rub your skin afterwards. Love it, Cant wait to see long term results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was a nice product but I dont neccesarily feel like my skin was ""luminous"" as the product suggests. I guess if it were more of a makeup it would be but it was a light moisturizer and wasn't overly sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am currently using a moisturizer for sensitive skin (no oils, no harsh chemicals) and i only got close to two uses form this package. I think with a product like this, the affects show over time so if you are looking for an instant change, this is not your product. I did not buy this product after my two uses to find out mainly due to price. This product is more expensive than my current moisturizer so i did not feel it was necessary to purchase a jar to test my theory. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using the Olay Tone Perfecter. And that's saying a lot as I rarely use any product on my face. But, this product was different. I loved the way my skin felt after using it - soft and smooth The product itself wasn't too oily, like others I've tried. The consistency was perfect. A small dab goes a long way. This has become a staple within my daily regimen. Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me the opportunity to try another great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I would've never probably bought this product if I hadn't got the opportunity to sample it because I typically just get what I'm used to, and never really have used any Olay products before. I noticed a much better appearance to my skin just from using the sample size! So I can't wait to purchase the full size and see how much better my skin keeps getting.

I have rosacea so tone correcting is something I always look for in my beauty products. I feel that this product was good but could definitely benefit more with some additional ingredients that combat redness reduction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Used the sample and just after 3 days seen such a difference had to run out and buy more; Everyone is telling me how my skin is glowing and how my beautiful my eyes are, has been years since anyone has mentioned my skin or eyes. I feel so alive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love Olay, especially the brightening/luminating line. The tone perfecting cream felt like it tightened my skin and made my pores smaller. My skin really does seem lighter and brighter. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am never disappointed in Olay products and this was no exception. Although its marketed as a tone perfecting cream I felt it minimized fine lines and made me look younger. Will definitely be buying this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the scent of this product. My skin is dry and this did not provide enough moisturizing benefits for me. I found I had to apply my regular moisturizer on top after 20 minutes. This is probably a good product for someone with combo to oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Olay tone perfecting cream was good. It left my skin feeling soft with a pleasant fragrance. I have combination skin so with its light weight it did not provide sufficient moisture to dry areas causing me to need to use additional moisturizer but it did keep my skin feeling and looking less oily and even.

"When I first used the olay, I didn't care for the texture. It was slightly sticky on my skin and I didn't think I would like it. However, after a few minutes the cream absorbed into my skin and it left it with a silky feel. Other than the initial texture, I enjoyed my experience with it. The fragrance was nice and wasn't overpowering as some creams can be. There wasn't enough of the cream to really tell if it made an overall lasting difference in my skin.

"I think this cream works well as a moisturizer but I'm not so sure about correcting my blemishes. I have dark spots under my chin from folliculitis caused by ingrown hairs and have been hoping to find something to lighten that skin. So far, I haven't had great results. My skin feels smoother and I can see some of the exfoliating properties working but nothing to write home about in regards to the hyperpigmentation.

"When I received the sample, I was pleased to see the size was big enough to get a feel for. The smell is ok. Not horrible, but it won't replace your perfume.

"I started using the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream as soon as I received my BzzAgent kit. The first thing that I noticed was the smell. It smelled really good. I love that the formula was not super thick it was a nice lotion texture that didn't leave my face feeling heavy at all. I used it in the morning and at night. And I like how my makeup applied after using it. Depending on the price, I might be purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I likes this cream. The application was creamy and went right into my skin. I was able to put on cover makeup over it with no problems.

"After using this product the first time, my skin broke out but to give this product a fair review, I used it two more times to make sure it was this product causing the breakouts and nothing else. It is this cream that is causing the breakouts and I wasn't crazy about the oily feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product was very well packaged and it smelled amazing. I was optimistic when I put it on after my shower but by the middle of the day my face was much greasiest than it normally is.

"As a person that doesn't really use many facial products, I was more than pleasantly surprised by this product. It has a very light clean scent and did not feel like a mask on my skin.

"This product is thicker then I prefer in a moisturizer, and thus took a little effort to smooth over my skin, so I didn't think I would like how it. I was wrong!

"I liked the scent and texture of the Tone Perfecting Cream, but I don't think I have a huge need for the product at this point in my life.

I have mixed emotions about the perfecting cream. I could not see any tone improvement over the moisturizer I have been using but my face did seem a little softer. I do not like the sticky feel the cream leaves on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great toning cream to use in addition to your daily moisturizer. I found it did not leave my skin feeling super moisturized and had more of a mattifying effect which I liked in conjunction with makeup application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM and absolutely loved it. It goes on so smooth and smells great. It's light and it moisturized my face wonderfully. It was not sticky at all. I will definitely buy the full sized version in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is a good product. It moisturized my face, but I feel like it left my face sticky. It was hard to apply makeup straight onto the face, so I had to mainly use it at night. It did improve my skin's tone, but the stickiness was a turn off. I am sure they have many great products, but I would say this one is just a good one, for me. I would try their other products without hesitation; this one just isn't for me!

I liked the smell and feel of this product. It took about a week to see a difference in my skin tone but there was a slight improvement. I'd like to give it a try for longer to see if it keeps getting better. The only thing missing is an SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really enjoyed the scent of the moisturizer but I didn't notice any change in my skins appearance after using the product.

I think that the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone perfecting Cream didnt work as much as id like for me. It smelled great and it was very creamy but after using it i felt it left a Residue On my face. I have darker marks just from uneven skin tone and i was hoping id see a difference but after a week and a half of using it i didnt see any changes. Im going to continue to use until the trial size runs out just give it time to actually hopefully work. But for now im not too impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Yes I would definitely purchase this product but just by trying the sample it's kind of hard to really determine much of a difference but I do like the feel of my face like the softness but with that said I would buy it to be able to get the full effect!

I know with products like this its hard to sample because the sample was so small and you could only apply once so i didnt see a difference in my face. Tho it smells great i dont think it works well on makes ur face feel funny when your in the sun. So nice but its not for me plus its a tad costly. And would have to go to a retail store to by it in most cases. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've been a huge fan of Olay products since Au was in my 20's, this one is no exception. It glided on my face beautifully and definitely left a luminous glow. Would have left 5 stars if it didn't make my skin greasy after just a few short hours. I think this would be wonderful for people with dryer skin then my own.

I am hoping for the brightening and smoothing effects that the product claims! This will take some time to really know.

"I opened this cream skeptically and thought, ""No way is this going to work."" Carefully I applied the cream to my face and thought, ""What can it hurt?"". The next morning, my face still felt incredibly smooth. The texture, the tone and the touch of my skin were greatly improved. So, if once or twice made that much of a difference, why not stick with it?! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is an awesome cream to use. It has toned my skin and made it feel healthy and looking good all over. I recommend for women of all ages. It is easy to apply and doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy like some do. I like Olay the best. Use it today! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a great product! I currently use a different brand, but I will seriously consider switching when I run out. It felt much more expensive than what many would consider a drugstore brand to be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first thing I noticed about this product was the fragrance. It had a nice clean smell. The texture was a silky smooth type lotion which when applied to my skin left it feeling really moisturized. It was very easy to apply and went on evenly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm not a big face screen person. I've been using loreal for many years now. I do have olay daily moisturizer that I also been using for many years now. I like to stick to the ones I'm used to because I'm afraid of breakouts and alergic reactions. This cream was okay and didn't amaze me to move to continue it or buy one.

"Easy to apply but I did not care for the scent. After applying, if you touch your face, the product crumbles off and leaves little clumps of dried moisturizer all over your face. It's impossible to wear under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wash my face my face everyday and some times twice. After each wash ive been using the sample toner which by the way has a lot. I've been using it for two weeks now. My skin is moisturized and even toned with the use of the Olay regenerate luminous tone perfecter. I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I break out easily, and can't afford to use heavy moisturizers. In fact, I barely need any moisture at all, since I'm so oily. But I want to have some anti-aging benefits, so I've been looking for a good product like this. Doesn't leave me looking like an oil slick afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"But I just don't need it. I have a full skincare regimen, so I am not looking to add or change anything about it. I did like the scent and the feel of the product though. Olay always uses great scents! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Works great. I really needed a good facial moisturizer and this one definitely is just that. This one is made by a reliable well known name brand that is really price comparable to others and really works. It leaves my face feeling softer and keeps it moisturized. It absorbs well and keeps my skin moisturized all day. I apply it at night and in the morning. I really like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the scent and the ease of application. The sample is not enough to tell if it really will fade age spots and discoloration (takes 8 weeks per the literature). It did feel like it hydrates, but cannot see that it provided an ""instant glow""! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pleasant smell, decent texture. It was too hard to tell if the product was better than my current because it was such a small amount in the trial size, but it seems comparable, but at this point I see nothing to indicate the need to switch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product absorbed quickly into my skin, and my skin definitely appeared brighter with a more even tone after several days of use. However, with continued use, it caused me to break out in pimples. I do tend to have acne-prone skin (even at my age!). I would recommend this product to women who are not prone to breakouts.

"I have really sensitive skin, so I used this product with caution. After the first application of this moisturizer, you could really see a difference and my face was waaaaaay less red than before.

"I've never liked any of the creams I've tried, until now! I LOVE this cream!! It feels silky & smooth! Like a satin finish on my skin! It takes very little to cover my face & neck. And it smells wonderful! Not too strong, very light & clean smelling. No chemical smell like others I've tried. I received this in a sample size, 0.24 ounce. I've used it almost a week now, day & night, and still have plenty left! I will definitely be purchasing the full size! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I enjoyed my time with this moisturizer. The product smelled great, so it was easy to use on my skin. My Skin felt soft when O used it aand my skin did have a subtle glow. It's great to use before bed because you wake up with your skin feeling hydrated. The sample did not have the bulky packaging like the full size. The packaging is a bit big for the amount of product that is actually inside. It looks fancy, but it isn't that necessary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

There wasn't enough product in the sample to get me to the second week, much less the eighth week, and I was not impressed enough to buy the product in hopes of achieving the 8 week promise.

I thought it really helped brighten my skin up too, but I'm not really sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I was a bit worried about using this product because I have sensitive skin and I wasn't sure if I would be allergic. I tried a little bit on my skin to test it out. No reaction.

I am super glad that I did get this moisturizer sample. It says it reduced dark spots and evens your skin tone. So after having my first kid.

I love the way it feels on my face and it always feels so good after i use it. I have used it several times and always get a good response from it.

I didn't use enough to see a difference in wrinkles and texture, but the feel of it makes me believe I would use it enough to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smelled lovely. I really enjoyed how it look and felt on my skin. I would consider purchasing this product especially with a coupon offer. It is a little higher price than I typically would spend, but having tried it, I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised by Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. I really like the feel of this product. It is very easy to apply and doesn't feel greasy. Looking forward to incorporating this product into my daily facial regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The texture was ok, but did not like the scent, I usually buy scent free face creams and this one was not moisturizing for me I have dry skin and did nothing, however I do love okay products but this was something I won't be buying [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Began using this under my makeup instead of usual moisturizer. I liked the feel of it- not greasy but made skin feel supple. I also felt like it helped keep foundation looking fresher throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product had a lightweight feel with a fresh pleasant scent, it is lightweight and non greasy. The product penetrates well and gives my skin a deep moisturizer making it look bright and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like Olay products, especially their moisturizers. This is no exception. I'm not one for any sort of reflectives in my moisturizer (you say ""glow,"" I say ""microglitter mess"") and I was a little afraid of that in this product but, if they were part of the ""tone perfecting"" schtick, they were subtle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Because of the nature of the product, and the tiny size of the sample, it is impossible to give an accurate review of it. What I did use, did not cause very much noticeable change. Unfortunately, I believe that a larger sampling would be necessary to notice any differences between this and my current product(s). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just like with the other moisturizers, I don't feel that the sample was enough to see the long-term benefits of the product, and the in-store price is way too high to buy without knowing, for sure, that it would be beneficial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A facial product takes a few weeks to work or to notice a difference. You can't tell with a little packet. I would think that a leading competitor such as Olay would give at least a travel size sample so a potential customer would have a chance see a noticible difference. I use to use Olay for years after 45. I changed to Spa quality face products. I have seen the commercials for this and thought about buying this but after sending such a minimal amount, I think not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Used up a small sample size container of this moisturizer and I'm just not sure it faded any of my darker spots. Maybe with longer use it would be more noticeable but I didn't see a change with the small amount I tested. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I only tried this product 1 time. My chin broke out after I used it instead of my regular moisturizer. I'm not sure if this product does what it claims to do. I didn't have visibly reduced wrinkles after 1 application like the package said. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this is a good product to use to moisttreize your face and it absorbs in a timely manner and is not really very oily like the cheap stuff or even lotion that is more for the body but not for the face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do like how it makes my skin feel, but the tingling feeling it gives my skin and the long list of ingredients are not natural. I've been happy with my Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer lately and will probably stick with that. I was, overall, happy with how it made my skin feel-- a step up from the classic olay beauty fluid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i really do love this i love the smell of it i love the way it makes my skin feels afterwords i love the way my skin look after using it ive been using it for about a week now and it is helping my dark spots in my face go away love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I REALLY LIKED THE SCENT AND THE THICKNESS OF THE LOTION. AND I WAS THRILLED THAT THE SCENT DID NOT CAUSE MY SKIN TO HAVE A NEGATIVE REACTION. I HAVE USED OLAY PRODUCTS IN THE PAST SO I WENT INTO THIS OPEN-MINDED. BUT, SO FAR I HAVE SEEN NO CHANGE IN THE CONDITION OF MY SKIN NOR ANY FADING OF ANY OF MY SUN SPOTS.

"This is a very nice moisturizer, it immediately makes my skin feel smooth. I have oily skin and so I don't like products that make my skin feel oilly. This product has a light feeling all while giving me a true moisturizing feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used several different kinds of facial moisturizer, over the years, and honestly I think that thmajority of them are pretty much the same. I think that this product is pretty much like the others, but I really do like the smellandlittle bit of shine. I sort of wonder about whether or not a person's skin really can change and be seen in just a couple of weeks like the ads say so. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream feels great and absorbs quickly. It didn't irritate my skin. The price seems reasonable compared to the department store brands. I'll have to buy a bigger jar to see if it makes a difference in my skin tone though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream as a moisturizer was great , it is similar to the regenerist in the red jar as far as fee l and consistency . There was not en bough of this cream in the sample to tell if it really does help with spots or not so I cant say either way . If it is as good as Olays other regenerist cream then i am sure the skin would be lightened after more time of use . I would like to try more to see if it in fact does lighten the sun spots or not . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked trying the Tone Perfecting Cream. Good enough size sample to at least try it for a few days. The scent is wonderful. Not too strong and very clean smelling. Went on smooth and blended well on all areas of my face. Would be better if it had some kind of sunscreen protection included in the benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer/toner was definitely not for me I used every last drop that came in my sample but within the first day I started breaking out a lot worse than normal and I didn't notice any difference in the tone of my skin all it did was give me pimples and supposedly block the sun which isn't a big deal to me because I like to be tan lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would recommend this product to someone interested in purchasing a Mosturizer that is not sensitive to certain smells. This may be a great moisturizer with great benefits but it's not one I would purchase for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is easy to put on and feels wonderful on your skin. It is a good product to use daily. There is no filmy or greasy feel. It is a product worth investing in for your facial needs. It is a product that you can easily apply and add to your daily routine. It is a product that is good for your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved the product, ease of use, non greasy, made my face feels smooth and I thought look better.Wish the sample had been a bit bigger. A little pricey to purchase the regular size but all in all a good product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is easy to use, only requires a pea size amount, smells nice, and leave skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I would recommend this product, but aside from being a good moisturizer, I do not find it especially unique or outstanding. Still, it is very good quality overall.

I've tried quite a few moisturizers (I'm a tad over 50) over the years and I must say that this one really makes my skin look so flawless! What a wonderful product...one that I'll be using on a daily basis from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I already use an Oil of Olay product that works extremely well; but this one seems to make my skin brighter, more refreshed in appearance, in addition to helping tone and increase how plump my skin feels, instead of sagging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was hoping this would help with discoloration, but the sample is too small to even give a good review. Best results are in 6-8 weeks. It only a few days, and I saw no change in that amount of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product a lot because it absorbs very well into my skin. I hate feeling greasy and seeing shiny skin. This made my skin moisturized without compromising my sensitive skin. I will definitely buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the Play Regenerest Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. What a great idea to add sparkle to the moisturizer. The cream is light and smooth. It didn't make my skin feel oily like most moisturizer does. I felt so pretty that I didn't even use foundation. I will absolutely be switching to Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LIKED the idea of the free sample .It gave me the chance to try it. I personally dont like to buy something and the product doesnt do what it claims. . Im buying this prouduct olay lumerious toning cream.ISo far it seems to do what it says. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've noticed a smoother healthy glow where I usually have blotchy, freckled discolorations. I try to use at least once a day/night on face and neck area. Although I haven't had any improvement with the fine lines round mouth, lips or eyes. However, I love the scent and feel of my skin after its applied.

"This was a great moisturizer when you don't feel like applying any makeup. Gave my skin a youthful, luminous appearance without the need for makeup. Felt great on my skin, like I wasn't wearing any moisturizer. I would recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used regular okay moisturizing lotion for years but I may switch to this. It's thicker than the regular lotion but it doesn't feel heavy or tacky on your skin. I didn't notice a big difference but there was only a few days worth of cream in the sample. I'm definitely willing to try it out again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My mom uses Olay for many years she has tryed several kinds over the years and always goes back to Olay. She got me started and I love the smell. For a face cream it's easy to apply and smell good. I'm happy with this product and will be on my shelf for everyday use from now on. Thank you mom and thank you Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved this product I've always been a fan of Olay products, I feel they are very affordable and that they actually do what they describe they're going to. I thought this cream was very light feeling, not heavy or greasy. It was smooth to the touch on my skin, which made putting make-up on over it very easy. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I currently love the moisturizer I use. However, this product works really really good. It keeps my skin hydrated. I'd have no problem using this when I need a pick me up or inbetween shipments of the moisturizer I use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I surely enjoyed trying this product as a sample because I most likely wouldn't have bought it as I have never purchased this type of cream! I thought it was very soothing and moisturizing! I really liked the odor of it,too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using this product I broke out with pimples. I have very dry skin and I rarely get pimples. My skin looked worse after one use. Since I broke out with pimples after on use on my face I tried using it on the back of my hand to see if there were any benefits and after a week there were no visual signs of improvement to my skin. The scent of this product is off-putting. It smelled like I had taken a lot of vitamins. My skin did not smell like that before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product. I use another product that I have enjoyed using for the past year. But, I'm going to make the switch this weekend to Olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream. loved it thanks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received a sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM to try and so far I do not understand the benefits of this moisturizer. I have not noticed any difference with this compared to using regular lotion and I'm sure that this moisturizer is much more expensive than a bottle of lotion. I do not think i will be adding this to my selection of skin care products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product had a nice silky feel to it and made my skin feel very soft. As with most of these skin care products, the sample wasn't enough to make a full decision. I think you need at least a weeks worth of the product to see how your skin will react to it. I have very sensitive skin and sometimes it takes a while to see how it will work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first time I applied the product it started to peel off as I applied it. I had to wash it off and apply my other cream. The second time I applied it was a little better. Still haven't seen a change in my skin so I can not make a decision on that. Kinda disappointed in this since I really like Olay brands and use a lot of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I have aged my skin has become an issue.I have tried many skin care produces Some I have disliked ,some have been to oily,others made no change at all to the look of my skin,and others have too much fragrance. This produce has earned my approval.I does everything it said it would.I have become one of your newest customers... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As soon as you apply it feels like your skin is shrinking, yet feels so soft and luxurious. My only complaint is that the sample wasn't larger. I really liked this and will be buying it in addition to my Clinique that I already use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did receive a small sample and i have been using the product for about a week. I was a bit skeptical at first but it has made my skin look a lot more refreshed and even toned. when i first apply it it would make me look a little red but after a few minutes that would go away and it would leave me skin looking very smooth. i love this product very much and plan on buying a full size bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I felt like this product is more suitable for someone much older than I am. I'm still in my 20s and would not personally spen this much for a moisturizer but maybe I am different than most. I have a beauty product budget and would rather spend money for a good foundation and a cheaper moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately, this product caused my face to react in a negative way. My face became very bumpy and itchy. I must have been allergic to one of the ingredients in the cream. It may work for other people but due to my sensitive skin it doesn't work for me at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was very light and smooth to apply to my face. Because the trial size was just that...trial, I did not see any dramatic changes in my skin. But I am sure that over time that this might have had a noticeable change in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is just as wonderful as the micro sculpting cream. I will alternate these two products and make my skin look even better than with only one product at a time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the brand olay. I would purchade it more often if I could afford the product, I know quite a few ppl who use Olay products, and I have used it in the past. However I sell Avon so I choose to stick to that product for now, but thanks for the nice sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been trying out my sample on some dark spots on my cheek. I was not good about using sunscreen when I was younger and am now paying the price. I think that the spots may be getting lighter.

"Let's be serious.. We can't really see results of a product like this, with such a small sample amount. That being said, it did feel nice and smell nice. But I'm more interested in natural products. I'm not thrilled with the ingredients in this product. May recommend though [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin didn't have any issues previous to using this, and it had no issues after! That's important, because I have allergies and sensitivities, and this product didn't trigger any reactions. I'd recommend that you try it and see! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It does the job without being heavy or oily but with such a small sample I wasn't able to use it for the full two weeks to see whether or not it made a difference in evening my skin tone. Overall a good moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been extremely pleased with this product. The cream itself is light and fluffy, and doesn't leave oily residue behind when you use it, like many of the products I've tried in the past. After a month of use, I've noticed a change in my complexion. It has given me a younger look by evening out my complexion and getting rid of dark circles under my eyes. Would highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a very good facial moisturizer. It didn't leave me feeling sticky or with an overly medicinal or chemical smell. I have dry skin and this made a very obvious improvement for me.

I think OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM has a great smell and is very easy to apply. It was absorbed fast and leaves a very nice feeling on the skin.

"I am looking forward to trying a full size bottle of this product. I did see a difference in my face, but I wouldn't say it was dramatic.

"It was great, as with most things Olay. I really likes how it was a smooth feeling cream . It did make my face (even hands) much softer, even if i was lazy and skipped a day or two my face was still soft. Happy with it :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Felt nice on my face and easy to apply. The problem with this product is that it left white streaks on my face when dried, even after being thoroughly rubbed in. Great smell. I didn't see much of a change in my facial tone though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really liked the way this went on and the way it felt on my face but feel as though it may not be the best choice for my skin type. My skin felt clogged up and I couldn't wait to wash it at the end of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a dual sample: This luminous cream and the micro sculpting cream. Both products gave me painful and itchy inflamed patches that became super dry and sandpaper-y a few days after applying. This product smells fantastic and it goes on smooth, but because of the reaction with my sensitive skin, I will not be buying this in the future. If I got to try the sample again, I would give it to someone with more tolerant skin to see if they would have better luck with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! It does not have a strong smell, which makes me happy. My skin feels soft and smooth. It makes my skin feel fantastic overall, and I like it under makeup or on my clean bare face. My skin is very sensitive, and trying new products makes me nervous, but this is very gentle. You can tell this is a great quality product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The whole Olay line is great, so I was glad I got to try a new product from them. I really like the lightweight feel of the luminous moisturizer. It's not quite hydrating enough for my super dry skin though, so I would use it in addition to another cream., [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The sample was pretty small so I only got to try it once. It is my experience that you should try face products for a few weeks before you start to see any improvements. So, I wish I was able to do that. It made my skin soft, but I didn't notice any differences from what i already use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although it's difficult to tell how much of a difference it will make to my skin in the long run (the sample was fairly small) I really liked how the cream felt on my face after the first two applications. I'm a big fan of moisturizers and creams so I feel like I'm a pretty good judge of what will work with my skin, this one definitely will :) I'm looking forward to trying it out next month and gauging some longer term results.

"After washing my face with my Clairsonic and applying this to my face, I like the way it gives my face a nice matte finish. The only thing I don't like is it isn't moisturizing enough for my skin.

I used this sample for a few days. I have oily acne prone skin. Unfortunately this broke me out. Maybe my skin is overly sensitive but this is not for me.

The sample was such a small amount that it does not give you a great chance to see how well their product works.

Overall I thought this moisturizer was good. I have dry skin so I look for products that will keep my skin moisturized throughout the day without the oily feeling. This product did just that. It lasted through most of the day and left my skin feeling healthy without the oily feeling. I would definitely buy this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is great! I have terribly dry skin and this helped with moisture and made my skin glow. I love the way my skin looks and feels when i use this. It has a wonderful light scent. I can definitely tell a difference in my skin even when i am not using the product at that moment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the texture and scent of the product. A little dab went a long way, and it had a pleasing dryness after application.

"This is a great Moisturizer if you use everyday moisturizer. For me, however, I prefer something a little bit cheaper.

I recently got this sample and I normally do not use Olay products as they normally make me break out. I decided to give this a try.

"An absolute treat for my ""mature"" skin. The consistency of the cream is perfect; it's not runny nor is it gloopy or oily feeling. It sank right into my skin and smells wonderful. Even as a ""drugstore"" brand, though, it's a little on the pricey side for me. Maybe my skin needs to ... mature ... a bit more (nooo!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really enjoyed using this facial moisturizer - after just one application it left my skin looking brighter and more even toned.

I have really good skin to begin with so I'm not sure how this product would help me. I'm not sure what needs to be toning on my face. I don't like the name perfecting cream. I infers a standard of beauty that is truly unattainable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It feels really soft and luxurious,I would compare it to top brands I have previously use, but I can not really tell if it helps with dark spots, but it's a really good moisturizer for my oily skin, is not drying but at least I wouldn't shine like crazy during the day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have extremely dry skin and live in a very dry climate. This product is wonderful. My skin feels hydrated and smooth all day.

"I used the little tube I received in the mail. I like the scent of the cream and liked how it felt when I put it on my face. I would put this on at night after showering around bed time. In the morning, my face felt kind of dry so not sure I would buy this product. The cream I use now does not do this. Also, not sure there is enough in the tube to notice a difference. At this time, I don't think I would switch from my current moisturizer to this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was very pleased with the results of this product , the price and the scent. I will and have use again and definitely have told my friends to try it.

I loved how my skin looked after using this cream! Now that I've continued using it has helped make my overall all skin tone on my face better. I don't have dry spots or little red blotchy spots on my cheeks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer is nice. I like the texture and the scent. Usually I do not like my personal care products, especially facial care, to have a scent, but this is light and pleasant. I could really benefit from a product that would really improve skin tone, but I'm not entirely sure that I believe the product can deliver on this. So far I haven't noticed a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This really does brighten your skin, and feels refreshing at the same time. The scent is pleasant and not too heavy. I find that it does alleviate the look of wrinkles, and has an overall brightening effect on skin tone, which in my case means it diminishes blotchy spots. I would recommend!

This product comes from a reputable company but unfortunately for me I did not find it a positive experience. I feel it is greasy and thin which for me doesn't work. Hopefully it is a better experience for others than for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream well I gave it to my cousin and she love the product she love the way it felt question and she says that she is waiting so she can buy more hopefully within 12 months from now [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved this moisturizer. Although I am not sure it improved the tone of my skin, I liked how it felt, the ease of putting it on, and how my skin looked. I used it under my makeup and it was not greasy or oily. Will definitely be purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly I'm the type of person that needs to have facial moisturizers because my face is always dry. I would say this this is a great alternative to the product I use now. When I used it the first thing I noticed was the texture it is very soft and doesn't feel oily. Next it smelled nice I always enjoy a moisturizer with a good smell. Also the product itself did the job, there was no oily feeling or feeling of dryness after I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is aging with several dark spots appearing. I applied Olay Tone Perfecting Cream nightly for a week, specifically the dark areas on my face. The spots are gradually getting lighter and less noticeable. This product works well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this moisturizer. It's pleasantly scented but not overdone so you're not constantly smelling it all day. I've used everything from MAC all the way to moisturizers my dermatologist sells and was well pleased with this overall [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product and would very much consider changing. It was easy to apply the product and requires little to apply to my whole face. I like the fragrance as well. It is not overbearing. It was very smooth and easy to use. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First of all I would like to say that the product smelled amazing. I believe that I did start to see some tone perfecting going on on the areas I applied it to but I'm not sure there is enough in the product sample to see a very big difference. However I believe if I were to purchase the full sized product it would work perfectly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product smells great, and I am sure that some people would love to use this. However, because my skin is super sensitive, it made it really greasy and I broke out. I use an amazing prestige line of facial care and cosmetics. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
One of the things I appreciate about Olay is that I with my sensitive skin I am still able to use their products. I think added to the routine I am currently using this is going to help my skin GLOW! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is a superior quality product that leaves my skin looking consistently the same in all aspects. I HIGHLY recommend OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Sometimes it can be difficult to determine whether a small sample will sufficiently prove a products worth. I got almost a weeks worth of usage with light application, and I was pleasantly surprised that my dark spots did seem to lighten up. If a tiny amount can give a noticeable difference, then what would a normal application over time would do? Definitely will be purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combination skin and I've seen and felt a difference using this olay moisturizer. Ilove the smell and feel. I'd highly recommend it to anyone in search of a moisturizer and it can be purchased at major retailers so it's not hard to find. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the smooth sensation that the cream had when applied on my face. It was supposed to help even the tone of my skin (and I have acne scars that I would like to be less obvious in color), but I didn't notice any change in tone when I used the product. I also wasn't crazy about the strong scent; I prefer unscented products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only tried this for 2 days. It left my face quenched and I love the scent and the way it feels. It is powdery soft and the scent is not overpowering. The sample was only enough for a few days so I am not sure if it is ""working"" but I certainly am not turned off by it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this product to have a very silky feel going on. I didn't notice significant difference to other products I have used, but it seems like a worthwhile cream. I would consider purchasing when in need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There was a film on the surface of my face once the product dried, which rolled off in mi is culex bits when rubbed slightly, sort of like a build up- I would not be able to wear makeup, or even glasses, after using this.

"I loved that you got a small tube of it to try for a week plus. It really helps you get a sense of how the product works instead of those 1x samples. The scent, application, and the appearance of my skin... love love love. I will definitely be purchasing this product soon as I'm done with my current bottle of face moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's really hard to rate a product like this that comes with only enough sample moisturizer for one application. I'm not going to see any noticeable results after one application. If I had a week to use it then I might be able to tell whether it made any sort of difference. It was smooth and smelled nice, so if it had positive reviews from consumers who had used it longer period of time I might purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't like moisturizers that feel greasy when applied. This one goes on smoothly and feels dry to the touch after application. I feel like I could add makeup on over it without feeling weighed down. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"First, I am 27 and struggling with fine lines and aging already. It is the worst. I've tried so many products and wasn't able to find any that fit right with me. I tried both Olay samples and fell in love. My skin looked fresh and I looked like I was glowing. My face was smooth and soft and it was a very light product and didn't leave my skin feeling oily. I will be purchasing more! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Min combination to the Olay regenerist micro sculpting cream, and the regenerist luminous facial oil my face has noticeably gotten a lot healthier and less uneven! This particular product smells wonderful and makes my skin so smooth and soft after application! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this facial moisturizer. I think it had a nice feel, worked well on my skin leaving it feeling smooth and looking healthy.

"Really tiny sample, very hard to tell if it would be a good long term item or not. I don't like to spend a lot of money, I stick to cheaper alternatives. Nothing wrong with it, if it is in your budget, worth a try! Saw a small difference when I used this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product, the scent especially. It is very light and flowery, not at all overpowering . One of the other great thing about it, is that it is not greasy at all. One of the most annoying things about a moisturizer is a greasy product that sits on your face. This moisturizer does not have this issue it goes on smooth and absorbs instantly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very pleased with the Olay Regenerist tone cream. I found it to work as described. It was very easy to apply and had a very nice scent. I do feel that my skin is better toned. I think I would need to use this long term to really see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer feels very nice, however it was too heavy on my skin. I currently use a very lightweight moisturizer. With this moisturizer adding sunscreen to my face felt like I had a ton of gunk caked on my face, I could never use this as a daily moisturizer. I was more oily and broke out a little bit the day after I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always been a fan of Olay and this product just makes me love the product even more as it is one of the best products that I have tried in quite some time that does the job that says that it claims to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wish sample had been a bit bigger but I did have enough to know I loved the smooth feel of the cream and how it went on nicely without having to use too much, even when my skin was dry. Don't know if my tone was perfected but it did make my skin feel nice. I'd use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay products never disappoint me. Having mature skin doesn't mean you have to settle. After using the Luminous Tone Perfecting Creme I found my skin much brighter. I love the shiny look it has, even after applying my foundation. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I can't describe how much I like this facial cream. I noticed an improvement with my fine lines and this was after one usage from the free sample I received through PINCHme (an online free sample site). My face was not sticky, nor left feeling oily after applying. I give this product 5 stars because of the way my face felt and also my fine lines appeared to disappear after one use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This felt good on my face, absorbed easily, and did not leave a greasy feel. I only noticed a small change in the tone of my skin. However, it was enough to make me want to purchase the product to see if using it for longer would bring even more of a change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, when one participates in a product sample of such small amount, it is hard to gauge whether or not the product has much value. After all, it would be through continuous use that most benefits would become apparent. This felt good going on and had a great , mild scent, but I honestly didn't see the benefit of it.

"I am used to a series or a kit for facial care. I have rosacea so my skin in very blotchy at times and I want it to feel clean at the same time. This was gentle on my sensitive skin, didn't irritate. I'm not sure about the price however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product did what I wanted it to, but it seems that the Olay Regenerist (specifically the Luminous line) items seem to have a slightly off/ odd scent about them. That was the only off-putting thing. (I hate to say it this way, but it reminded me of my grandma.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face about 5-7 mins started to break out. I have extremely sensitive skin so maybe that's why. Would I recommend it to someone I would at least tell them about it & wouldn't shy them away from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have Lupus & have been looking for a facial moisturizer that evens out my blotchy skin when I have a flair,but isn't too harsh on my skin.I was very satisfied with this product & results.I had shied away from this line because Olay discontinued an eye cream I used to love-what a mistake ! I am glad I got to sample this 1st,now I am going to use this daily-very natural looking with added benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The way this makes your skin feel is a big seller for me- it wasn't greasy and kept my skin hydrated- I am not sure about the tone correcting yet as I just started using it but I will have to say my skin does look better since I started to use it..

"Basically, I trust the Oil of Olay name; having used it for years and years. I feel fairly certain that this is all it says it is. Oil of Olay has a reputation to uphold. However, this sample couldnt really tell me anything certain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Im glad I had a chance to sample this product! I would have never known how good this stuff was otherwise. It feels good right-away it blends into your pores so smooth and it just feels so good!

I reviewed a sample of this product and I wasn't sure how I would feel about it at first. All I can say is that my skin felt amazing after I applied this cream and continued throughout the day. I definitely will be buying this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a very thick moisturizer. I liked the smell and the texture but since I have oily skin it was a little too much moisture for my face. I used it and had huge pimples within a couple of days in my t zone. I stopped using the product and cleared up then I tried it again with the same result. Maybe my skin is too oily for this. I also didn't notice my skin any more luminous than before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm currently using a prescription grade facial wash/toner/moisturizer regime and have tried this along with my regime. I think that it was easy to use and it didn't feel bad on my skin. I have noticed a difference in my skin since starting the regime so I can't say for sure it the OLAY has anything to do with it or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to sample this product, but I personally wouldn't want to purchase the full size because I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer seems to clog my pores. I love the texture and the feel when I put it on. My skin feels really smooth, but then I realized there is silicone in it, which is a no-no for my skin. I would recommend this as a day moisurizer/primer under your makeup, but I wouldn't use it as a night moisurizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would probably give this product a better try if there was more product to sample and it wasn't priced so high. The sample felt soft on my skin but It wasn't enough to determine if it's worth all the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Olay has always been a great product that I use on a regular basis. This moisturizer face cream is so good. I'm so glad I got to try it on PinchMe or I most likely wouldn't have bought the product.

"I really liked this moisturizer from Olay Regenerist. The cream is really lightweight and fluffy almost like whipped cream on your skin. It's quickly absorbed and doesn't seem to just sit on top of your skin. My skin is combination and it's sometimes hard to find a moisturizer that is light feeling, but still does the job. This one definitely fits the bill. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have some old acne scarred skin and I was surprised how much it has improved with this product. Everything normally breaks me out but this doesn't. My skin absorbs the product well and is velvet soft after application. It is rather thick so I only use it at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this product and felt that it was enhancing my skin's appearance, however, the sample size was small so it was hard to determine if that would be further improved with longer term usage or not.

But finding it in stores, the price is simply too high for me to buy once, let alone regularly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received a very small sample of this product. I can't really make a very informed review about how effective it is based on the small sample size. I can say that it was not greasy feeling and did not have a strong perfumey scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think had a liottle bit more and I used it alittle longer I would have given it more stars. I can tell by what I have that it would have worked well.

"Having normal to oily skin I have to beware of layering too many products on my face before applying my makeup, or else I could end up with an oil slick.

It worked really well with my every day foundation and I liked the way my skin felt after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Absolutely love the smell. I also love that the sample is big enough to use more then once. I've used it a few times and like it. Helps influence me to buy it. It is improving the tone of my skin.

"In terms of moisture, this product was no better or worse than the best that I've used. However that was not the benefit I was interested in. This product was supposed to even out your skin color and skin tone. It promised these changes over the course of one day (yes), one week (yes), and three weeks (yes). It delivered what it promised. My husband noticed by day two! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how this product smelled and felt after being applied. The benefits of this product are better than a regular moisturizer.

I actually have been using Cetaphil for my skin over the past few months. It's very moisturizing. I switched and tried out the sample.

I really like how smooth it made my skin and it didn't leave any sticky or oil feel behind like most other products do. I think it improved my skin tone a lot and I will continue to use this for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is so light, I couldn't even believe it. It moisturizes good and the skin feels great after using it. Actually my skin felt and looked so great, that I thought this would be my favorite cream ever. However, breakouts appeared on my face after 2 or 3 days of using..So, unfortunately, I had to stop using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really surprised at how easily I could apply the cream and it absorbed right into my skin without feeling greasy. It smells very pleasant too. I felt very luxurious after using it and will definitely buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im still using the sample, it smells wonderful on top of the non greasy application and improved skin texture after only one week! I use this twice a day alongside my palmers, and will definately purchase in the future as it brightens my skin and softens perfectly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this product is good, but in the scope that I tried it, I cannot say if it did the job it was supposed to. It made my skin feel soft, but I'm unsure of how it works on tone correction. My skin is only 20 years old, but in the short period I used it, I couldn't tell a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer smells amazing! I have oily skin and this didn't exacerbate it, only kept my skin soft and moisturized. I noticed slight changes in the tone and would probably get better results after using the retail size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moistuizer. It went on well on my face and it made my face feel soft. I was not happy with the price after going to the store to check it out. If the price was lower, I would be happy to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have old dull aging skin. At my age ,to see signs of age reversal, is a miracle. I started using it and immediately feel a smoother skin. Then after two weeks the little age spots started to fade , I had a brighter more youthful glow ! My co worker said there is something different about you... I am hooked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this product makes my skin feel and the scent is wonderful. I can actually see an improvement in my skin and friends have mentioned it as well. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
although i was impressed with the product a packing this size for a sample is hard to tell if i would be happy with purchasing a full size i take my skincare very serious and enjoy daily and nightly routines would recommend at least a 10 day to 2 week sample to get a better idea of the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Luminous it is, nice overall. Would need a few weeks to determine if my spots diminished reads Over 8 weeks its formula with a brightening complex fades the look of dark spots age spots sun spots. I received as a sample and love OLAY products that I will purchase this full size & can see the full effect after 2 months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I think the single-use sample was too small to determine if this product would provide any long term affects, I did feel like my skin/complexion looked a little brighter and smoother. If I can find a good deal for it, I would definitely consider purchasing the full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed the way this product left my skin. It did not feel too oily nor did it leave my skin feeling dry. This has a very nice light scent which I enjoyed and it did not bother my allergies. I will start using this as my daily moisturizer, the price is very comparable to what I was currently paying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist is a line that never lets me down but for me, after application it was love at first sight. I was so delighted with the soft and silky results that I decided to keep it on my regular beauty shopping list in place of my other. Thank you for letting me try it so I'll know I will want to buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great moisturizer but did nothing for my tone,if this was suppose to be a perfecting tone plus moisturizer it did nothing to my complection,it was a pretty good moisturizer but sometimes my face was a little to oily in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have a actually bought this product before and I absolutely loved it! I have issues with my face being blotchy and red. This moistorized my face and made my face glow and also look extremely more even toned! I am beyond satisfied with this product and will be a continuous customer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream has a great smell, one of the things that would get me to purchase this again. Also the cream is light weight and not oily which is nice. I have not seen a difference in my skin as of yet but I would try a full version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the sample for one day because it was a very small sample but I like how easy it was to apply and the scent but I just wish the sample would have been bigger because that would have helped influence me more on whether or not I intend to buy it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This didnt make my skin look as good or moisturized as my current high end moisturizer, but it was still decent. I would say it is the best one available at the drug store. I love the Olay Regenerist line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I was able to claim this sample I was so excited to try this cause it's kinda on the pricy side and being able to try it before I spend the money on it is so nice! It really made my face feel soft and moisturized and without a oily feeling. I would recommend this to everyone for everyday needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is nice - nice feel, nice scent, not too heavy feeling, not too greasy. I wish the sample was a little larger. I would have liked to try this product for a few days - a week, rather than 1 use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this moisturizer. I wish the sample was a little bigger so I could give it an honest try. I have sensitive skin and this did not bother me but I only got about 1.5 applications out of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cream worked very well for me. Helped even out my skin tone after a very short time of using it. With more cream I expect I would see more long lasting benefit. I am going to try it out some more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM. I like the way it felt on my face, and loved the way my face looked afterward. I generally break out when trying new products, but this didn't cause any embarrassing problems. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was very odd to use, the scent was nice but when I first felt it on my hand I noticed right away the almost sandy like texture and ground sparkle base. I applied an ample amount across my freshly cleansed face and did like the shine but the dry cream dulled my skin and made the small amount of makeup I applied afterwards look horrible. I would not recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of the Cream it is Emollient. I cannot say that it has toned my skin as I have not used the product long enough. The only drawback is the fragrance, I would love if the product was fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of this product to try. My face feels so silky and smooth after application! I haven't noticed a difference in my skin tone but I love this product just for the way it makes my skin feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer worker very well, about as well as the similar olay product, the sculpting cream, but I'm not sure what the “tone” property is and how it is different from the other cream. I would not be able to afford using both creams together, so I would probably purchase the other one, but this one works great as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am sold on the Olay Regenerist line of products. I have had such amazing results for the use of them and will contiune to purchase. The Olay Rengerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is another wonderful product. It truly leaves the face smooth, hydrated and toned. Thank you for the chance to sample this before purchase, thumbs up Pinch Me :D [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'll be 56 in July and I need a different moisturizer to help with the changes in my aging skin. Olay Regenerist Luminious Tone Perfecting Cream makes my skin feel hydrated and a little brighter.,,a noticible improvement. Applies easily, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I received a free sample from Pinch Me and Olay in exchange for my honest review. These opinions/experiences are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this moisturizer. It does what it claims and gave my skin a nice glow. It has a nice scent. The consistency is a little thick but that worked for my dry rosacea skin without causing a flare up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My free sample was not enough for me to make an informed decision. If I could have applied a few more times, I would know better. I can say it did not irritate my ultra sensitive skin, that's a plus! I would recommend someone get a larger sample to try for themselves, especially if you're looking for a moisturizer and have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
my skin feels hydrated after a long dry weathered winter. Winter and dry cold winds can do a number on my skin but with application of this product my skin feels better after a few tries. I will definitely look into this product and all other items from this brand in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried the sample and it worked great. I have already recommended it to a few co-workers and a couple of friends. The only reason I have not went out to purchase it yet is because I have recently moved, and haven't yet had the time to purchase it. I will when I get my next pay check because it worked well.

"This moisturizer feels very nice and soft on my skin. I do not know how this will perform with time, but I like it so far. Unfortunately, it is heavily perfumed. I would prefer something non-scented or with a lighter scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Like I said in my other review for these type of face products they need time and a bigger sample to see its full potential . You can't expect immediate results . But I did like the way it felt on my skin & since its a drug store brand I'll probably buy it & test it out longer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always concerned about my skin, I lived in Florida and now Colorado; both high sun exposure states. I just felt this was like any other product. Maybe I did not use it for long enough ... not sure. I am pretty versed in skin care .. I use botox, which may smith wrinkles, but it also dehydrates ... so I'm always looking for new products that can help with moisture and tint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, it felt so good on my skin. I actually seems to be fading the dark spots on my face. I will continue to use this cream and hopefully the product will continue to make my skin better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I starting using the cream in the morning before I apply my Make up. I have issues with uneven and dull skin. I saw results after a couple of weeks. I was using another cream before but was not getting the same results. I will be switching to this cream and the price is even better. It was a win for me.

"The feel of my skin after using this product was absolutely silky soft... The smell was great... It hydrates, yet it made my skin feel tighter.. I would love to experience the whole line of Olay Regenerist products.. I am a beautician.. And I can honestly tell you that the elderly ladies that have been clients of mine, who has the smoothest skin.. When asked what they have used to keep their skin looking almost wrinkle free and so great, every reply has been Oil of Olay.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this cream pretty wel. I like the way it feels and the way it smells. My main problem with these types of samples is that there really isn't enough in the sample for me to tell how well I will like it in the long run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was incredible on my skin. It made my face so soft and healthy looking. As a new mom, it gave me a refreshed and rejuvenated feel. My skin felt more even toned and I didn't look as tired too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial cream is super creamy and nicely, but lightly, scented. It is easy to apply and goes on very smoothly. After rubbing it gently into my skin, there is no gross greasy residue left over, just healthy, soft, smooth skin. Very nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
". I like the way it makes my skin feel. It leaves it feeling fresh, smooth and healthy. It is helping to reduce the discoloration and signs of aging on my skin. It is working nicely on my dark circles below my eyes and is helping to reduce the fine lines. I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Said itbefore and I will say it again, Olay is always a promising and beneficial product. You literally cannot go wrong with any of their moisturizers because they are all protectorate toward the skin, but also very easy to apply and maintain consistently.

"I'm on the fence a little with this product. I loved that it was a tinted perfecting cream, however it didn't give me that moisture nor the perfecting I was expecting. I know things are to make you flawless but it just seemed very light to really help those small imperfections. I would recommend it to anyone in their 20's looking for a light, luminous glow who doesn't yet have the small discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Well prior to experiencing an allergic reaction (i dont blame the company for that). My skin would not absorb this product. It left a film on my skin that would roll off when I would touch my face. Overall not a good experience for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was using a product from a dermatologist that worked REALLY well, but it's too expensive for my budget. Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is about 20% of the cost of that stuff, but it works about 80% as well, so definitely a fair trade-off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the product felt good, it was hard to know how the product would work for me longer term. Like will it make my skin oily or break out with consistent use? There just wasn't enough of the sample to tell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never used drugstore facial products but I was so surprised by the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. It smells great and it goes on so smooth. A little bit goes a long way and it doesn't leave my face greasy and oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is really nice. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin a little brighter. It is tough to say if it corrects my tone just by using the sample. I will need to try this product more long term before I know if I truly like it or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Olay Regenerist Luminous product is a nice product. The product applies smoothly and has a pleasant scent. Luminous does not feel overly greasy and did not cause any facial breakouts. I would consider purchasing this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer was too heavy (greasy) for my skin. I currently use a very light, mild moisturizing creme, so I think my skin just can't handle this blast of emollients! May be good for those with skin that is on the drier side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall the product had a nice feel to it. It was pleasantly scented. It was very easy to apply and was easily absorbed into the skin. I liked it though just not sure I would only use it alone as my other product shows better results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Not sure about this product I didn't see much of an improvement in my skin. I don't know if I give a shot and buy it just to see if time proves it or just call it a wash.

"I was very surprised at how much I loved this product. Being able to try it, with enough for a few days, was a great help.

"The strong fragrance and uneven application of this cream will prevent me from buying it in the future.

"I received a sample of this product in an honest review. I have used it several times and like the feel and texture of this lotion. It may have helped my skin to even out tone, but the results are mild enough that I'm unconvinced that I should switch away from my current moisturizer. Overall, I like it and might recommend it, but I'm unconvinced that it is better than others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love it. It leaves my skin smooth and non-greasy. I actually noticed in a week or use that some ruddiness had evened out. The scent doesn't bother my skin and I have very sensitive skin. My skin also feels smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
AFTER TRYING THIS SAMPLE I BOUGHT SOME AND AFTER 2 MONTHS I NOTICED THAT A SPOT THAT HAD BEEN ON THE FRONT OF MY NOSE FOR 3 YRS WAS GONE BEFORE I PUT ON MY MAKE UP!

"The tone perfecting cream moisturizer was wonderful! I used it under my eyes and around the side of my face. It was very silky smooth and left me feeling pampered.

"I've only used it for two days and I can easily testify to its ease of application, scent and penetration level but I plan on using it for 8 weeks to see if it really does reduce puffiness around the eyes because even though it says it helps the appearance of dark spots and discoloration, I don't have these problems.

I received a free sample from PinchMe and Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. Would it even my tones? I'm not sure. The sample was very small; enough for one application.

"The sample isn't quite big enough to see how it makes your skin look after regular use but I do like how it feels after its dried on the skin.

I tried the cream a few times and read the instructions thoroughly. I have to admit I am not a fan and I really like Olay products. After a few times of using this lotion it constantly left a powdery residue on my face. I did like the softness of the lotion and hope that Olay finds a way to fix the powdery issue.

"As with the sculpting cream I had the great fortune to try out, this cream is a step up from the wonderful Olay daily moisturizer I've used since my 30's. I'm 57 now, and people really can't guess that. My daughter gets peeved when they mistake me for her older sister. This new product, along with the sculpting cream have made subtle improvements to the texture of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream is lightly scented and does not leave a greasy film on the skin. It absorbs well and does provide a slightly luminous appearance to the skin.

"I was very excited to try olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream, and I was not disappointed. It made my skin soft and luminous. It evened out my skin tone, which was really amazing.

I noticed a difference the very first time I used this product. I wilk be purchasing a jar of it this week. My skin felt extremely soft and silky and left no dry spots behind. So happy I got to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am normally a huge fan of Olay products and am quite sure this is a quality product. I just cannot justify spending a fair amount of my money on this product without having a sample that allows me to try and see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the product. It makes my skin feel silky smooth, and it smells SO good. However, my face did break out a little bit. And I would wake up with very oily skin. I'm not sure if my face was breaking out because it was a foreign product and I'd never used it. Eventually the breakout started to fade, right when I was running out of the sample...go figure lol. I would use this product again, just wish it didn't make my skin so oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the smell of this (light--didn't give me a headache like some do), the feel on my skin (again light) and the smooth glow it left me with. It does seem to reflect light so skin doesn't look so dull. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As someone with uneven skin tone that at times can be dull, I like the idea of the product. I was happy with the sample but cannot say how I would feel about using it regularly after such a brief use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Almost feels like a skin smoother. My pores seem to diminish and the smell is unbelievable. I have been happily impressed with Olay products this is the second sample from them that I have bought in full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This Olay regenerist tone perfecting cream was alright it just didn't suit my needs. I have scars on my face and tone perfecting creams do not work on that I have tried several. The scent of this product was heavy in a way that I did not like. The feel of this product was soft and when applied to skin felt lovely however I did not like it after all day my skin was still dry at the end. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely adore Olay products. They have been around forever and a day and it's obvious why. This moisturizer leaves my face silky smooth and ""luminous"", exactly as it states with its name. As a woman in my early 40's, it is so critical to start using these products, if you haven't already. I found myself squeezing every last drop out of the package and hoping for ""just a little but more"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think Oil of Olay products are great. They help keep my skin feeling soft and make me look younger. I get plenty of comments about how great my skin looks. I tell everyone that it's thanks to Oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm quite young so I feel that this product is not necessary at my current phase of life. However I did love the scent and the way my skin felt after using it. Super soft and light. Almost airy. Will look into it again when I seem more concerned with anti aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This facial moisturizer is light and had a nice scent. I would highly recommend this product to friends and family. It is a bit pricey but we'll worth every penny. If your in the market to replace your facial moisturizer look no more and pick up this little gem. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the product. I loved the way it just sinks in my skin so quickly and makes it so soft. Non-greasy and easily spreads on skin. liked the scent of the cream but I am fan of the result just after a week. My skin feels so much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This went on so easy and I really like the way it felt. I could see myself using this every day for my face procedure. I always look forward to putting it on because it feels so comfortable thank you so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked that this product did not have a strong fragrance, was not greasy, and went on smooth. My skin is very dry and does have red areas. I didn't see any improvement with my tone or my skin in general. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First to be fair, I did not receive a large enough sample to really see if it would make a difference in my skin. It felt good on, but I want the product to continue to improve my skin & I do not know if it will or not. So for the moment I will stick with my current moisturizer...which is also made by Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer because it is very light, It also makes your face feel very smooth. Sometimes the scents of moisturizers are bothersome to me but this particular one, the scent is very fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin and not able to use many products on my face. This however works great! I can wear it on my face and it makes you feel like you have not put anything on, plus after using your skin looks healthier! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone looking to acquire a nice even tone to their facial skin. The application leaves the skin looking so smooth & even toned it goes beyond what the package advertisement claims it will do. I purchased some the day after I received the sample. This product is a big 5 stars for Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To be entirely honest, I do not see the benefit for use of this product. Perhaps it is meant for a different skin type, I have oily skin with little to no acne and did not see any difference. I doubt I would buy it, but I doubt I would use it again either. I don't want to leave a negative review as this product just did not benefit me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was not extremely impressed with this product. I mean it is ok and does moisturize but i am not sure of luminosity or perfecting aspects to it. It does has a pleasant smell and luxurious feel to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did like this product as it the scent was nice and the product went on smoothly and not greasy feeling and it absorbed into my skin nicely. I wish the samples were a little bigger so I could give it at least a weeks time to use the product to really see the benefits of using the moisturizing cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing because it smell so good,it is not grease, I love the way in blends in on my skin,can be used at night and in the day time ,also its priced at a reasonable price, it moisture izes my face ,it s over all a great product for all ladys young and middle-aged, and old ."
"Thank you for the product sample. I was able to see a difference within a few days of using this product. My skin is supple, hydrated, and feels like it did when I was in my 20's. Happy to have tried this, and replace what had not been working for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The only reason I gave this product a 4 star rating instead of 5 star rating is because I didn't have enough to try for a whole week. Love the texture and compared to most facial moisturizer it is not so thin that it runs before you can apply it and made my face feel like a silk blanket. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have found that the ingredients in the Olay products don't agree with my skin or interact with my other skincare or makeup products. My skin gets inflammed and swollen. No redness but my skin looks and feels bumpy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I didn't notice a huge difference in my skin appearance after using it as compared to my regular moisturizer, the feel was drastically different. It wasn't as oily feeling and felt like I hadn't out anything on my skin at all, yet my skin was soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product felt great after application. It even improved the appearance of my skin. I would not recommend this product if you have oily skin. I was a grease ball after about an hour. If you have dry skin and are looking to improve the appearance of your skin this product is for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't know how it does it but just a little tiny bit of this product spread over my face helps reduce the redness and uneven-ness of my skin. I mean I don't have anything too bad or noticeable, it's just sometimes I'd like to actually have an even skin tone and this stuff really helps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the oil of olay products are great i have always used them especially the moisturizer and was not using this particular product but I will be purchasing it soon once I use up what I already have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The scent is honestly my favorite part. It smells delectable. While the creme smooths on nicely i feel that I would have to use a lot of it to get the same hydration i get with my current moisturizer (Coconut oil). I would consider buying this to add to my current one because i love the smell so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was able to get a few uses out of this sample and I liked what I was seeing, but I need to use a product for at least a couple weeks to really tell if there are benefits or a product works as it claims to. But this moisturizer seems very nice. It's light and not greasy. My skin looked nice after applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I t made my skin feel younger and so soft. Even though I have only tried it a few times, I really liked how it made my skin feel. I do not detect a heavy perfume-like scent when I first smell it. It has a nice fragrant smell, like freshly washed and sun-kissed clothes that have dried in the back yard. I absolutely enjoyed this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was easy to apply and smelled pleasant. It did not make me break out. It might be something I use in the future, but for now, I don't really use a daily moisturizer as I have very greasy skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am looking for a product that will deal with the sagging I'm beginning to experience. Unfortunately, this one is not for me - when I tried it, my face began to itch and burn. I immediately rinsed and have not tried it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture is nice and I liked the way it felt on my skin. Do I have amazing results? Honestly, I don't know. A one or two day sample is not enough for me to see results. Would I try this moisturizer out to see if there was results? Sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not like this product. It claims to be a moisturizer, but did absolutely nothing for my dry skin. It felt more like a primer than a moisturizer. It sort of just sat on top of my skin and left a flaky film on my face. It did feel really nice when I applied it and it has a lovely scent but I would not recommend this moisturizer to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I initially liked how this product felt on my skin and it didn't leave my face greasy or shiny like some moisturizers can do. However, after a couple days of using it my face broke out. I returned to my normal moisturizer and my skin cleared up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Used to use a store brand but will be buying this soon. I love how the product smells, how light weight it is, how smoothly it goes on and how it really improved my skin tone. No oily skin with this, love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 54 yrs old, this product cannot even my skin tone. I have enough of a time just trying it keep it moisturized. I wear make-up over this product & you cannot tell a difference. Maybe I am too old? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed using this sample. I was very pleased with how it felt going on and how my skin looked the following morning. I noticed a softening of my lines and an overall brightness I haven't seen in a while*!* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin lately has been a bit uneven lately and I can tell just by two applications that it has helped my skin. I am normally highly allergic to Olay, but I actually had no reactions and wasn't as oily like I'm used to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Smelled great, liked the feel of it when applying , not greasy . It asorbed quickly into the skin and left a satin like feeling to my face. I would recommend this to my friends which I already have. I use other Olay products and this one is up to their usual standards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this product once I received it and I can say that it has been great. I absolutely love the way it smells. I love how it leaves my skin soft after I use it and my skin no longer feels dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how this product felt on my skin and the smell was nice however I didn't notice much change in my skin in fact, I started to break out a week after using it. Probably a great product but I have very sensitive skin and it just didn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Moisturizer had a pleasant scent and felt so good when I applied to my skin. After using for serveral days, I could tell a difference in my skin. It felt softer and smoother. I have some wrinkles around my eyes and mouth and am looking forward to this cream working on those problem areas. Love the feel of it on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like the feel and the scent of this cream. I love how my skin feels after having using it for several days. I didn't realize that there were other products (like steps 1,2, and 3) to use with this cream. I am excited to find out more about these products as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've noticed a smoother healthy glow where I usually have discolorations. I try to use at least once a day/night on face and neck area. Although I haven't had any improvement with the fine lines Leaves residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this moisturizer. It wasn't greasy and didn't leave a film on my skin. My make up looked great with this as my first layer. I am very picky about my skin products so it was nice to find one that's great and affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin can be very picky at times over what products I can use. Sometimes a product that is touted for being amazing will not work our or will cause itching. With this product, I had no negative issues at all. The sample was small, so I can't give an in-depth review, but I can say that what I did have didn't feel greasy, went on smoothly, and moisturized well. I received this as a free sample for review from Pinchme [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This amazing facial moisturizer works to erase dark spots, age spots and discoloration within 8 weeks of using it twice a day. It's a very fast absorbing moisturizer and makes your skin feel really good! I love that my age spots are fading right before my eyes. I will be adding this product to my daily facial moisturizing routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After applying the moisturizer, shortly after I experienced pilling. Where you rub your face and you come away with product in your hands and it's all balled up and gross feeling. I do not like that. Otherwise it was an okay product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked how it felt putting it on, not too heavy. The only thing I didn't like was that it did not have any sunscreen included. I am a busy mom with four kids and I tend to forget to take care of myself. If I don't have to worry about my face outside and just my kids, it is that much easier for me.

"By far this is the best facial moisturizing cream I have used in quite a long time. The product goes on easily and smoothly, isn't greasy and feels wonderful. I put make up on over top with no problem and no ""off"" coloring [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer felt really nice when applying it to the skin. Almost like like softened butter without being greasy. I did not really notice a difference in my complexion after continued use however, I have a fairly even skin tone to begin. Overall, this a nice moisturizer witha pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample and was very impressed not only with the product but the end result of my skin. It made my skin feel youthful and had a brightness to it that I have lost over the years. Will most definitely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM. I tend to like and use Olay products. I was very impressed with the ease of use, scent, and working power of this sample. I noticed a difference within a few days and I can't wait to purcahse more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first thing I notice is the smell is really clean and nice. It goes on smooth and dries quickly not leaving your skin oily or feeling like layers. After a few days the dark tone under my cheeks does look lighter. I currently use regular Olay but am definitely consider switching. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've mentioned before that my mom is a longtime Olay user, so I've always thought of it in a very positive light but I just wasn't super impressed with this product. It doesn't seem any better than any other creams I buy, which I would expect from Olay. The name gives you the impression it'll give you radiant light skin but it's not really anything special. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sadly, I experienced a negative reaction to this moisturizer. My face broke out and became quite red within a few hours of application. But I'm almost glad that it happened with a free sample and not something that I'd payed for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Again with this moisturizer, it was a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin so I would not use it personally but the ingredients and product seem like they are good quality for someone with less sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using my free sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfexting Cream on my face almost every morning for the past 18 days (15 total uses) and taking a photo of myself every time. Honestly I like the product, it feels great and smells great, but unfortunately any claim that it affects your skin tone did not apply to me. I have had a lot of acne during my trial time as well but I don't know for sure if the cream played any part in that, it certainly didn't seem to help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this everything day since I received it and must say I love it! It goes on so smooth and smells great. It has made my skin feel softer ,smooth and the darker patches on my face seem lighter. I will be buying this the next time I go out for face cream!

While i can appreciate how easily available this product is I didn't really think it made much of a difference. May just be that the re wasnt enough to see any results but i just wasnt impressed. Enough to buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM, I can really see a difference with the overall health of my skin. Using the product has definitely made my skin tone look more even and it has brightened up my face overall. I'm really pleased with the results of this product.

This is hard to review due to the sample being so limited it's no easy to say how great the product is since you can't use the product for a reasonable amount of time to see a difference to give a honest answer can't be given the sample should have been bigger.

After using Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream my skin feels and looks smoother and younger. I like the way it makes my skin feel. I especially like that I can run down to the store and buy it so easily without having to go to the mall. It's a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It takes time for you to see a difference in whether this moisturizer actually helps your skin, so I would need to be able to try it for a few weeks to know if it actually does. But the feel of the product is nice, and smooth. I don't mind the smell either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have purchased multiple Olay products and I always love them. My mother and I have both used this product and bought it after our sample ran out. I love that is is not greasy on the skin and my skin always feels soft afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! I was hooked after the first try. My skin felt silky smooth and not oily. I really don't like creams with scents, but Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is very subtle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the initial feel and look of my skin after I use this but using it for several days seem to dry out my combo type skin, or at least not really do anything in the way of moisturizing . Sad because like I said the look of it on my skin and the smell is pretty good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It did what what it was suppose to do. I like Olay products, just not the strong smell. Maybe it's just me, but they seem to have a strong perfume smell that last to long, just my opinion. It was easy to apply. I received a free sample from #Pinchme [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Got about a week and a half out of the sample and it is hydrating to my skin and I do notice a few small dark spots have lightened up and my entire face is more evenly toned and very silky. Smells fabulous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the texture of this cream, it goes on so well and doesn't feel to heavy. A little bit goes a long way. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and have noticed a nicer looking on my face.

Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is the bomb! I received my free sample and loved the feeling & had heard how well it worked. I bought it and within 3-4 weeks could see the changes in my skin tone and fading of age/sun spots. I recommend this product to all women! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've received a sample of this product for my honest opinion. I had a few dark spots in my face due to acne so I decided to try this product to see if there would be any change and it pleasently surprised me. I wasn't expecting to see the improvement just in a couple of weeks, my dark spots started to fade and my skin started to get an even skin tone. Great product and is worth to give it a try!

I will admit that if I find a great deal on moisturizer that I will buy it regardless of brand. That being said I do have my favorites. This ranks right up there with my top two brands! The one-up that this play product has over the other two was how light it felt in my skin. It went on so smooth too! Will definitely be watching for this product to go on sale! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I forgot to look at the packaging and so had no idea what this product claimed to do. I still don't know what it CLAIMS to do but I'll tell you what it DID do. It moisturized my face, and that moisturized feeling lasted all day. It also made my face appear BRIGHTER somehow. I can't explain it but it sort of made it look as if I were standing in better lighting... everywhere, even that public restroom with the ghastly fluorescent lights! I just loved this product!

"I received a sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM to try but my opinions are my own. The cream has a nice feel to it without being oily, it seems to hydrate my skin as well as leaving it with a nice smooth texture. It's not heavily scented which I like. This product is easy to apply and can be used under makeup in the morning and at night. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always a little hesitant trying new products on my face. My skin tends to be a bit sensitive and if something doesn't work, the consequences are not fun.

"After using this product for about a week, I began to notice my skin felt softer and had a healthy glow to it. I don't have dark spots so I can't speak for the product fading those but I would buy this just for the other benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I LIKE HOW THIS FEELS ON MY FACE. I like the smell of the product and how effective it works. It doesn't feel greasy like some lotions.

I told them I received a free sample from pinch me and That I love this product that I have already went out and bought some more. TY [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the feel of this product but I wish that Olay would stop using such strong fragrance in their products. I would not buy this because I seemed to have a little bit of an allergic reaction to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Holy stink-fest Batman! I did not like the scent of this product AT ALL. The texture was nice and I guess the product did its job moisturizing but I was so overwhelmed by the sheer smell of it that I had a really hard time not washing my face after application. It smells like heavy makeup compressed powders of the 90s when as a youth I would plaster power all over my face, sigh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM feels very silky smooth. It takes just a tiny bit to cover my face and neck. It also has a very light and clean smell without a chemical smell . Only con is that is leaves a white residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wanted to love this product, but it just didn't work for my skin. I love the scent and the textur, but after just a few days my face began to break out. I decided to keep going with it just in case it was something else, but I was still using it as of last night and my face has more acne than I've seen in years. I'm discontinueing use today.

I love the scent of the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. It so smooth and gentle to my skin and my skin is sensitive. I was using the elf moisturizer it felt oily and just laid over my skin but with this one you can actually feel it working so great on my skin. Highly recommended it to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent is nice, seems a bit thin for a moisturizer. I think I would need a slightly larger testing sample to review completely, but it's ok. I feel like it might be ok as an addition to my current Olay moisturizer, but not a complete replacement due to the thin consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually passed this product along to an older friend of mine who was talking about wanting to try a new product for her face. Apparently she loved it so much she went straight out and bought a full size bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Though I feel this product may have potential, I feel my sample was too little to notice any difference. I would love to sample something more than a tiny packet, maybe something that would give use over a week or longer to truly see results that would make me want to spend on this product.

It is difficult to leave in adequate review because the sample I received was so small and such a minimal amount that it was barely enough for one sampling. In order to get a true opinion of a product it is necessary to send an adequate sampling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This olay is a nice moisturizer and leaves your skin feeling nice. I myself cannot afford to purchase this moisturizer though and neither could my friends and family so I would not recommend to someone I know. However it is not because it is not a good product.

I was skeptical at first about this but..i have say after trying it. I may be sold ! This product has an amazing smell and has a very nice feel as i applied it.

"I sadly didn't get to see too much of a difference in my skin with the sample but I still liked the feel of the product on my skin, it made it feel soft and refreshed.

I absolutely love Olay!! The smell of all the products including this one is amazing. My skin feels very soft and hydrated. It appears to have a more youthful appearance.

"This was a nice, creamy, thick moisturizer. However, I have dry, sensitive skin that sometimes doesn't react well to new skin products, and this was one of those times. I'm sure it is nice for other people, but it caused me to break out and just wasn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the scent of this product. Sadly this just wasn't for me. I really disliked how the moisturizer dried on my skin leaving streaks of white after blending it thoroughly.

I got a sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PREFECTING CREAM FROM PINCH ME. I LOVE this product now I know what all the talk is about.my skin is alot toner. I will be telling my friends about this GREAT product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The feel of the facial moisturizer is such a wonderful feeling that you feel like your pampering yourself and it gives you a glow that makes you feel just as wonderful. I am recommending this product to a lot of people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's that time of the year when the need to tone up the features are in season and since the sample was a bit lacking I went ahead and took a chance and purchased the product and i'm happy with it especially for what I had to pay but my face is happy so my pockets will forgive Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this Olay luminous tone perfecting cream! My skin tone has never looked this great! My skin is no longer dry. I highly recommend this product if you are searching for a great moisturizer with extra benefits! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to be honest, I wasn't quite keen on trying new skin products at first. My skin is so sensitive, so I typically just stick to the same old products. I actually loved this cream and I was so relived that my skin seemed to like it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the Olay Luminous Regenerist cream. It was silky smooth, easy to apply, and it smelled fantastic. It gave me a pick-me-up in the middle of my morning routine of getting ready for work. I bought it after I ran out of the sample, and it still makes me happy. The price, though, not so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has a smooth texture and silky feel. It glided across my skin. It felt far better almost instantly, as my face is quite dry. I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin who has a never liked feeling that their moisturizer has to be ""rubbed"" on rather than just slid on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I first tried it I thought well I'm going to have to rate this in less than 2 weeks which won't give accurate results but from the moment I tried it on my skin was feeling so moisturized. The scent is great! My skin looked much brighter and radiant immediately after I tried it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always skeptical of products that promise to correct something on my skin. It seems things should work from the inside out not from the outside in. BUT, this product was very helpful in helping with the evening out of my overall skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the texture of the cream. It felt good on my skin. I am hoping it will lighten my brown spots soon. In the meantime it is very nice. The package is nice. The price is comparative to other skin lotions I have purchased recently and it is readily availible at my local pharmacy, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first put it on I liked the scent and feel, but the second night I used it I realized it went on heavy and kind of goopy and the skin around my eye area began to peel a bit. Must be something in the formula that doesn't agree with my skin. I love so many Olay products so I was a bit disappointed in this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited to be able to try this Olais regenerist luminous tone perfecting creme. Texture was smooth and creamy not drying sticky like most toning creams. It had a fresh scent. I already have recommend this product other people [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surprised how nice it felt on my face and neck. Went on smooth, made my skin feel soft. Gave me an overall younger looking skin with a touch of luminosity. Really liked it, was unbelieving at first but now I know better. It's also much better to receive a larger product sample other than the smear a lot of products give. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It turns out that I'm quite allergic to this (ultra sensitive skin, so if you are the same, be careful), BUT my aunt is in love with it! She says that within a week, she definitely saw an improvement in the texture of her skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I WAS NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE OLAY LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM. IT JUST DIDN'T IMPROVE MY SKIN AS I WAS EXPECTING IT TO. DIDN'T LIKE THE SCENT OR FEEL OF THE CREAM, COULDN'T WAIT TO WASH IT OFF. NOT A FAN OF OLAY ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am an Olay user on a regular basis but I was skeptical of trying this product and how effective it would really be. I was shocked that after the first 2-3 uses I noticed a change in my skin. It was a more even tone and brighter and smoother. I would definitely continue to purchase this product and highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed sampling this face cream. I was amazed how well this product worked. the appearance of my skin was more supple after every use. I would recommend this to anyone who would love to look & feel younger. the price of this product & the price is amazing as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was easy to use and didn't make my skin feel all greasy like the majority of other products I have used in the past. It also made my skin feel and look visibly different after a couple of applications. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was very thick in consistency and smelled great! I found that it went on very nice but it would start to rub off and left my skin worse than before I put it on. It didn't sit well if I were sweating or if I had to touch my face it would start to rub off. I don't wear foundation so I can't blame it on anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way that the cream feels on my skin it feels like satin and the scent is nice and clean. The cream left my skin feeling soft and moisturized and I did not have to add anything extra. I like it and I will buy this to replace my regular moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm not really sure what to say about this product I know it's sparkly and has a bunch of chemicals I can't pronounce and I honestly didn't notice a difference in my face appearance with the little bit I received [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think I'm going to switch to using this product! I normally have to choose what will work for my sensitive skin and horrible allergy to perfumes. This does have a light perfume but it dissipates quickly and somehow does not affect my ability to breathe! Of course this does what it is meant to as well- my skin feels great and I believe it looks better as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love olay facial moisturizer with SPF. I have tried many otherbrands and always go back to play.The sample of perfecting cream was even better. I may buy only the perfecting cream, now I that I am almost 40, and will continue to use the facial mosturizer only when going outside. Unless this is also offered with SPF [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"0lay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Made my skin softer,smoother younger looking with less wrinkles.Made my skin feel like a newborn baby soft. My skin looked brighter after using your product. My skin had a nice scent after using your product.My deep wrinkle on my forehead disappeared after using your wonderful product.

"I really enjoyed how Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream made my skin feel! It was so soft and supple, it didn't make me break out because it wasn't oily or heavy feeling, and it smells amazing! I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM worked fairly well but not well enough for me to consider switching to it from my regular. It didn't moisturize well enough, though I do have extremely dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As an Olay customer already I was excited to try this sample. I feel as though this product transcends the one I am currently using which I was happy with before I was introduced to better...Happy Olay customer!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I rarely use anything on my face due to skin and fragrance sensitivity. I tried a little on the back of my hand first. With no reactions I continued to apply to my neck and face. It is awesome and I have already went out and purchased product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I love the way my skin feels after I use this product. Olay has a great reputation with the brand name. It is a brands that is widely recongnized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I can't make any claims about the luminous part since I haven't used it long enough, I do find this to be a very nice feeling, lightweight moisturizer. It gives a nice amount of moisture without any greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've enjoyed okay products for years do in a bit biased! Products work well at reasonable prices. Wish I could sample this further to gush how great the product is. Not sure if I will buy this or not. I did like how my skin felt after using the sample - but I'd like to try it a few more days before I buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an excellent product for most I am sure. It just contains something I am allergic to, so it caused some irritation. My mother used the remainder of the product and loved it, so I can't complain too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer felt great when I put it on. It feels very luxurious and moisturizing. However, I have acne prone skin (adult acne is horrible!), and I need see s bit of an increase in outbreaks while I used this. I think this would be an excellent product for someone with dry skin and no acne issues. If you have any acne issues though it might not be the best product for you.

Thank you for offering me the opportunity to sample this product. The cream has a very light and pleasant scent. When applied it goes on smooth and hydrates quickly. I like the overall result from this Olay product and will purchase very soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall I really liked this lotion because it didn't feel greasy and it left my skin feeling smooth. Because it was just a sample size, it's hard to say that I saw immediate results in terms of toning and evening out, but I do like the Olay brand and would definitely try this for a longer time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't even begin to tell you how much I LOVE this moisturizer! Even though it is scented, it is subtle, and it did not make my face red as some do. My favorite part? It makes my face feel super soft, and not greasy like other moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am blessed with normally very good skin, but I'm getting older all the time so I've started investigating products like this. This one isn't over oily, and rubs in well. I don't know if over time it would make a substantial impact, but it feels good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Regenerist Lumious Tone Perfecting Cream is amazing. I love the overall appearance and feel of my skin after using this product. It makes my face look so fresh and young again. If you haven't used this product you need to try it because you will be hooked Plus it has a great price as well. So don't wait go buy yours and feel so fresh and smooth while looking young with a shine!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay I think is the best beauty skin brand out there they have been able to stay relevant and new over the years, I can remember my mother using these products they are so great. I really liked getting to use the skin cream. It smelled so good I wanted to use it all over instead of just on my face. Worked really great, I have some sun spots that I am really self conscious about and it has helped with those so I am very happy with the product overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a wonderful texture and feel on the skin however does not work well under make-up. It rolls and pills up making foundation unflattering, I had to wash my face and reapply. As far as dark spots I only have one but it is the size of a dime. After repeated application to just the dark spot I have seen no change in color at the application site. Final judgement nice moisturizer but many more out there that work better and are a lot cheaper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I only got to use this one because one application was all that was in the sample, it really did feel great on my skin and I think with continued use, I would see a marked improvement in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised with the effects of the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. It was easy to apply under my makeup and did not leave any residue on my face as some other creams do. It felt very silky going on and definitely made my skin look and feel softer. After using it for three days, my skin started to glow! I will definitely continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is easy to use. This product makes you skin feel very smoothe as well as feeling refreshing after the application. The sample was not enough of the product to notice a difference in skin appearence however. Overall it is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tryed Olay products before, and like them for one reason or another. But another product would come out and I would try it, so among all the products I've used after awhile I can't tell one from another. I 've always had good skin, very fortunate, but now at 62 I am dead serious about my skin and I am very impressed with this product, will use again along with some of the other Olay products.

I'm loving this new Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. My skin tone has changed in the last few months along with my skin looking not so young anymore.

"I received a single serve sample to try out. While this wasn't enough to formulate enough of an opinion to say oh this totally works, or anything, I will say that from the one serving i was able to use my skin felt great and soft. Did i notice a change in tone? No, not from just one try, but i am excited to purchase the product to try it out longer than one day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the product. I thought the packaging looked modern and attractive. I also loved the scent which I could smell it throughout the day. I also liked that it was smooth but didn't leave my skin shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Tone Perfecting cream didn't knock my socks off. I expected it to help even my skin tone and it really didn't do that. Perhaps over prolonged use, but the sample was too small to really see the result I thought I should get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this product, it goes on smooth and feels velvety. I started noticing a difference after two days. My skin was smoother and my pores even looked smaller. A little goes a long way, so it will def last a while. Overall, I was very impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I need more than just a tiny little one time packet to see if a product works or not. I hate these types of samples. NO one can come to a real conclusion. It takes time to get into the skin to see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this Oil of Olay tone perfecting cream and love how it goes on so smooth and makes my face feel like silk afterwards. I will definitely make this part of my skin care routine, along with the Oil of Olay micro-sculpting cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only used this product for a few days (I used the small sample sent) I liked it while I used it, I did not see an amazing difference in my skin but I think with time I would see positive results. This product worked well under makeup, it went on smooth and was not greasy, it absorbed very well into my skin and had a pleasant scent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Which came first the chicken or the egg? When does one start using anti aging products? These are the questions that keep me up at night. Because it's effects are not instant it's hard to convince my 20 something self to purchase these items. I had no issues with the product but do not foresee myself purchasing it anytime soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Now this was the perfect sample size to properly test the benefits of the the cream. It lasted me almost 2 weeks and in that time i did notice a difference to my tone and luminence of skin. It was no longer dull looking. The packaging was great, the smell, texture and ease of application was as well. Great product. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this olay tone perfecting cream sent to me by pinchme was in the cutest little tube, i prefer these larger type samples with more than one application. The product met my expectations it is just a little pricey for my budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of this product and I enjoyed that it didn't feel heavy on my face however there was not enough of the product to cover my entire face thoroughly and k cannot make any further decisions based on it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the product, I used it once and the next day I could really notice the difference in my skin. I normally use a cheaper moisturizer, so if I had a little extra money I would buy this product. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Used this as a sample, so aside from the feel it's not as if it immediately transformed my skin. I have dark spots and would love to have something that helps to even out my skin tone, but since there wasn't enough sample to try over the longterm its difficult to say if it does what it's supposed to.

I used the Olay Regenerist Luminous Cream in addition to the sculpting cream. It was very easy to apply and went on smooth and evenly. It made my skin feel smooth and soft. I loved the Olay products especially for my more mature skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product it's easy to apply and leaves a smooth feel to your skin without the stickiness. After using this product for about a week I noticed that my face felt softer and loooked flawless. I received this product for free for my honest review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
There was not enough product in the sample I received to tell if it would help even my skin tone. However it is a good moisturizer. It is just a bit too heave for me to use in the summer when my skin is oiler. I'll try it again in the fall/winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the tone perfecting cream. It went on easily, it smells great and it does not leave my skin feeling oily. I use it everyday (for about 2 weeks now) and I have noticed the difference on my skin. All you need to do is apply a small amount everyday and in a couple of days you will see the difference too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the sample I received so much, I already went out and bought a full-size product so I won't run out. I probably would not have tried this product just by seeing it on the shelves. Thanks for the opportunity to try it. The sample size was appropriate for sampling and was enough for a few days. That's what's needed anyway to fully see how a product works. Made my face smoother and decreased pore size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"IIet my boyfriend try this sample and he absolutely loved it, he literally used it everyday until it was gone. The smell of it was delightful and he has dark spots on his face so you could actually see where it toned out his skin, he'll be purchasing some. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was able to notice a slight difference in my skin tone after I applied this sample but would like to have had more of the sample to test more than once as sometimes my face is more red today than yesterday. Unfortunately this leaves me tilting towards positive results but not certain and this product is too expensive to run out and buy when I am still unsure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is the best moisturizer I have found for my skin. Not to oily or to dry. Just right. I have recommend this to my friends , whom I may say are in there 50`s. It is hard finding something that does over do or dry our skin out. Thanks for the sample before buying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical about yet another face product but after trying this the dark circles under my eyes were less visible. The scent of this product is really nice. It's also not a greasy product nor does it make my skin break out which a lot of other harsh products do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed sampling this product. I don't have major age spots or tone differences, so I cannot speak to how well it helped these conditions. I did notice a little extra glow in my skin appearance. The product had a nice smell, and went on smoothly. It did feel a little tacky after application though. I wasn't sure in what order to apply this with my regular skin care routine. I ended up using it under my moisturizer with sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I definitely need this type of product but frequently have issues with products because my skin is super sensitive. Being able to try before I buy is extremely useful to me. I definitely like this because I wasn't itchy or blotchy and it felt really great on my skin. A definite recommendation from me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Sample was too small to really even give enough coverage for any positive review. Smell was nice but felt a little tacky on skin after a while. This would be something I would be willing to tolerate at bedtime if I was sure the product would produce wonderful results because it is pricey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a very low-maintenance cosmetic user, so I look for multi-purpose solutions. If you don't mind (or even enjoy) having lots of different moisturizing options, this would be a decent addition. If, however, you're like me and want something that provides moisturizing and SPF before adding any other features, this wouldn't be the way to go. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the texture of the product and how it feels when I apply it. Obviously, I haven't seen long term results, but I would be very interested to try it long enough to see the real effects. It feels like a quality product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did like this product, it absorbed fairly easily. I did notice it took a while to completely dry, which adds a few minutes to my morning routine, then applying primer, etc. It felt good once it dried. I do have pretty dry skin though, so I probably used a bit more than average. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face felt moisturized when I first used it but it seemed like it disappeared within 30 minutes. I received a small sample so I really couldn't give a honest opinion of how it would be over a long time use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I told my husband to take a good look at the wrinkles under my eyes ( not bad ) but they are there -- then used the cream before bed but after I washed my face. The next evening we both looked and I could actually see a slight but noticeable difference. Amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. My skin has an even tone, soft and well moisturized. The scent is nice and I really love Olay and that the product did as promised. I highly recommend this product. I am 47 yrs old and want to keep great line free, wrinkle free skin and with Olay I feel that can help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion feels great going on the skin, moisturizing enough without feeling heavy. The sample I received was not large enough to use long enough to see if the promised benefits occurred, but I liked the feel of it enough to purchase and try it out for longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the soft and creamy feeling of the moisturizer. It wasn't too creamy or greasy and it sunk into my skin nicely. The sample given had about 3-4 uses so I can't say much about the tone perfecting aspect of the lotion. Most people say products take at least 3-4 months to notice a difference in tone correction so I wouldn't be able to say anything about that. I also liked that the moisturizer had no shimmer so I can use it during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am not a huge fan of my skin. As soon as I hit 28, I felt like my skin was starting to look older than it should. I really like the way this moisturizer feels on my skin, how easily it glides and how little product is required for a full face application. I always wear makeup, but I almost felt that I could go with a BB cream or lighter makeup than my usual full coverage, 20 minute make up routine. This one is a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was nice, I especially liked the scent and it did seem to improve my complexion some, but it was not a rich enough moisturizer for my skin. By mid day my skin would be dry and flaky. Also I'm not comfortable with using the ingredients in this long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to be sensitive to ""regenerist"" products, and this was no different. That said, it smelled and felt nice. If the price was right and I didn't have such sensitive skin, I would certainly buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I had a little bit of patchy colored skin after pregnancy that wouldn't quite go away on its own so I tried this and it significantly got better in a couple of days of using. Works great in my opinion for fixing patchy colored skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the way this moisturizer makes me face look and feel. I saw a difference with just one application. My skin is so much smoother and feels so much younger! Already replaced my old moisturizer with this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I liked the smooth application of this moisturizer. The scent was light and not overpowering which I also liked. I am not sure if it improves the appearance of dark spots yet as I am not finished with my sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love the Olay line and this is another winner. The cream is not heavy, but not so light that you feel like you're getting cheated. It melts into your skin and isn't greasy at all. The sample isn't enough to see any difference, but I will buy the full size based on what I've experienced so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product was nice, but I use a different Olay facial moisturizer that I like better. I'm not sure what the benefits of this product were, but I don't think it is for me. It felt nice going on, the scent was neutral, but I did not feel like it was hydrating my skin and maybe that was the issue. I think if I used this one and then my regular moisturizer that may have worked, but I'll stick with my other Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Olay line of products. I'd never tried this particular product, though. It's hard to give an opinion on such a small sample. How can you tell if it really works? But I liked the scent and texture of the product. If a larger sample were given so that you could actually see/feel some difference it would be better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Okay on and off for years, but hadn't tried anything from their latest Regenerist line other than the serum. I am very pleased with how well this hydrated the dry spots I have but it didn't make the T-zone extra shiny or oily. I could do with less fragrance in the product, though. After sampling this creme and seeing how well it did, I am very open to trying the other Olay products in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the way my face looked after applying the cream. I was also very happy my skin had no reaction. I like this product but I have too many outbreaks to use this instead of my Doctor's prescribed medication. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel like this product could be a good one but when it comes to face stuff I feel like I need at least a week or 2 weeks worth to see how my face reacts to this.

Otherwise I cant really say i didnt like it, but I dont know if I love it yet either :/ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The product went on smoothly and with ease. It felt very silky and my face felt very soft after use. However, I can't say anything else about it because I would have to use it for at least a week or two to give it a fair rating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Also had to use the coupon to buy the product so my third sister could review it. She's 40 and was actually impressed that her skin looks brighter and some age spots looked like they just faded away.

I was very happy with this product. I applied it at night and when i woke up the next morning my skin felt amazing. My skin felt very soft and hydrated and it was also very toned and firm feeling.

I believe I would have to purchase the regular size product to get the full effect of the benefits of this product. . It was supposed to illuminated my skin but did not get that effect but think it's because it takes some time to do it and my sample was too small to get the full effect of the product.

"An amazing product! One which I will be purchasing from this time forward. This was my first experience with a perfecting cream. I am so glad that I was able to choose Olay as the product which would improve my facial appearance. Olay is a brand/name that I have the fullest of confidence in. Again, a truly awesome, refreshing experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product, but will probably use it as just a night time moisturizer instead of day since I did not see any SPF included. It felt light on my skin, but I do have dry skin, and felt that the product did not moisturize my face as well as other brands I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've heard great news about Oil of Olay products. I remember my mom using Oil of Olay. Now that I'm at that age, I'm glad I had the opportunity to sample this product. I currently use a moisturizer that produces the same results. Unfortunately, I'm paying quite a bit more than I would if I used Oil of Olay products. Maybe it's time to change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i would need a larger sample to really tell how well this product works. i did check out the price at the store. It cost quite a bit more than what I use. I just was not that impressed enough to change [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this moisturizer. It works extremely well and made me feel soft and supple. I will buy this when I finish up my current moisturizer. I have actually told my best friend ""hey look at my face, FEEL it!"" Can't wait to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This tone perfecting cream is a really nice product - for somebody who has sensitive skin, it is totally appropriate. It was a pretty small sample so I can't say what affect it would have it I could use it consistently. But it didn't cause any irritation at all, and that's what I truly appreciate! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed this cream on my skin a lot! I love how it smells great and how it is gentle on my skin. I already recommended it to my friends and family young and old and most of them already purchase it! Once you used it you will feel refresh. Most of all it is smooth and not greasy like other brands. I love this product and will definitely purchase more again!;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have hyperpigmentation around my face so I found this moisturizer to help with it. Part of my pigmentation is due to a disease, but I did notice a difference in that it softened the appearance of the discolorations on my face. I do tend to get a little oily with moisturizers so I use this sparingly and as my only moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the product felt nice and smelled good but I am not sure I say any results from the small amount i received. So since I have such sensitive skin I am apprehensive to buy it... to actually try it... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the way the product felt when I applied it. Unfortunately it was just what it is....a sample. While I enjoyed the way it felt, and preferred the smell over others in the same line....I didn't have enough time / sample to give an honest opinion as to the claims made regarding the benefits of using said product. I do appreciate the opportunity given to try the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to rotate most of my facial products every few days, in order to keep them effective of to fight specific problems. As products move in and out of production, I look for other alternatives. This one is a good addition to my arsenal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM worked very well with my skin type. Easy to apply and non-greasy. I definitely see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin. I will definitely continue to purchase and apply OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM as part of my skin treatment regimen on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Has a pleasant scent. Its on the thicker side which makes for a great night time cream. Very moisturizing. I put it on the first night and woke up to a pleasant surprise. My skin was wonderfully moisturized. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the smell of this product. However, I didn't noticed it evening out my skin tone as it claimed. While I liked the smooth feel of the product, it wasn't quite rich enough to moisturize my dry areas on my face, and I had to supplement those with my regular moisturizer. For normal skin, this would be a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love anything that claims to be tone perfecting. I wouldn't say you see any change within two weeks but it could definitely help someone with redness and discoloration. I don't recommend it for dark circles though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The smell of this product is amazing. I literally spent a minute just smelling it I loved it. It was a pretty good moisturizer it felt nice on the skin and did moisturize well, but it was just as good at my other moisturizer which does not cost as much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The sample was a nice size that lasted about a week, so I was able to decide whether I liked it. It has a nice scent, is lightweight and has made my skin look much nicer. I will definitely keep using this product, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As I get older, I have grown sensitive to scents. I just can't put something with even the slightest perfume smell on my face. I tried this on my hand and it has a nice feel, but I will instantly get a headache if I put this on my face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to like this product but just couldn't. For whatever reason, it made me break out in pimples. It didn't moisturize my skin at all. And pilled up really badly no matter how much or little I used or even when I exfoliated beforehand. I tried to work through the breakouts to give the entire sample a try and see if it helped correct my skin tone but it just did nothing for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not like this product. It irritated my skin and, and althought the scent was mild, I didnt like smelling a fragrance on my skin before I went to bed. I would prefer something that was fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Oil of Olay Tone Perfecting Cream has been an eye opener for me. As I've aged, and gotten more sun - my skin has gotten a bit uneven. Nothing I can't fix without some foundation. But my goal is to use this product so I don't have to use foundation. Especially in the summertime. The sample lasted me about 4-5 applications, and I loved using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay regenerist luminous tone perfect cream is the best facial cream I have used. It had a very nice scent, went on smoothly and a little went a long way. I noticed quite a difference in my skin after using a few days and even the better half noticed a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in my early 20s so I still have some problems with overly oily skin. I get dry patches in certain areas on my face though, and this made the perfect all over moisturizer. Most moisturizers are too heavy for me, but this was the perfect level of moisture, almost more like a serum. I liked the scent too--fresh and not floral! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can't tell if it would be better they what I use because the sample was so small. If they want you to be able to really tell much about the product then they need to make the sample bigger. Big enough sample so you can use it a few times so you can see if it's better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the sample and after I used it for two days I was amazed how much smoother my skin felt. I have sensitive skin and my nose has quite a few issues but this product didn't cause any discomfort. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had good results with this cream. It does exactly what the name implies - makes my skin look luminous. The only thing I didn't like about the sample was that the fragrance was a bit strong. I prefer fragrance-free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I us Olay all the time & I really liked the smell of the Tone Perfecting cream as well as the feel on my skin. I noticed a change in my Tone within 3 days of using it. I will definitely purchase in the near future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the feel of this moristurizing cream on my face. It felt like velvet. I had to go out and buy some as the sample wasn't enough to tell if it was working on my face or not.It seems as if my fine lines are diminishing somewhat. Happy with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this product in theory, but was slightly turned off by the strong scent of it. I used it for 2 weeks and did notice a minor difference in my dark spots, though, which is great! If only the scent wasn't so overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very impressed with the amount of the sample I received, so I was able to use the moisturizer for a few days. It smelled fantastic, and was thick, but gentle enough not to irritate my very sensitive skin. I have always been a fan of Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like Olay products and this one was fine for me too. It is hard to see how it really affects your skin with a small sample, but it did let me see how it feels and make sure I didn't have a reaction to it. I would try the full-size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would definitely recommend Olay products to anyone that may be on the fence regarding effectiveness. I have never been disappointed in any of Olay products that I have used. I noticed that within a week the tone of my skin was greatly improved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a awesome product. I can see a huge difference in my skin it feels brand new its tight and firm. Everyone I know should try this product they will not be disappointed it works well with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best play moisturizer I have tried. The feel of it is so silky and smooth. I like the scent of it also, not overpowering, but pleasant. It makes my skin so soft and I do think the tone has evened out some after using on lonely for a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Trying a product is the best way to really know how you feel about it. Based on my use of the free sample, my feeling is that this is a great product. The sample was small, so needs further use to be sure it is best for me, but I will purchase it (if not super expensive) and see if it is worth purchasing again. I think it will be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the sample I received for about 2 weeks and I can definitely say that I have seen a difference in my skin's appearance. My skin looks more luminous since using Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Creme. I love the texture, and I love how soft my skin felt after the first use. A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is hard to tell if a sample that small amount really does what it says it will do. It was easy to apply and felt good. But I would need to use for about a week to see if it is any better then my currant [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just tried this lotion out today and it was so smooth and creamy! I loved the way it felt on my face! I put it on and it absorbed in no time! My other moisturizer leaves my face shiny towards the end of the day and this one did not! It brightened my skin and made it look great! I would probably use this with my current moisturizer because I want a moisturizer with an SPF for during the day but I would love to use this too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting cream was better than I expected it to be. Because I have sensitive skin, I was a little leery about using this product. There was no need to worry. I had no reaction, and it made my skin feeling great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this Olay product with an open mind not really expecting much since it's like a tablespoon with of product. I can't review really write a review based on something I only can use for a few days as you won't see results for at least a weeks time. I liked the smell, it was light and pleasant, it was non greasy and went on smoothly. I will be buying it to try it fully and see if it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the light sent of this product and the non greasy feel over all . I have some what sensitive skin and this product didn't break me out or cause irritation . If your looking for a good quality product without the big price tag this is definitely worth trying . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Honestly the provided sample would have to be significantly larger and last longer for an accurate analysis. While I had no issues, neither did I notice a difference. I would try the product again with a larger sample. The feel and texture etc is great. I had no issues with it on my combination skin that is in need of moisture. My only issues was the sample size to determine any noticeable improvements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This isn't bad but it's a little pricey for my budget. It felt a little oily to me at first. It was a really small sample I think a better sample would be a little bit more to try out. It may be the price was better in the sample is better I might actually be able to use it every day but it's too pricey for an every day face cream so I won't be getting [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have really bad combination skin and redness. So when I used a moisturizer I had to apply at night cause they made my skin greasy. Then it all changed when I tried this sample. Not only did it work, it helped get my combination skin under control. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer makes my skin feel smooth. It works perfectly as a primer. It smells great and doesn't irritate my oily skin. This moisturizer actually hydrates my skin but, I am not a fan of the jar packaging. The product was easy to spread and doesn't leave any white residue.

"OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is a very nice product. I found that on my skin, the product did not maintain an even layer of moisture. I noticed that my skin would drink in the cream and feel like another layer was needed. It was not a product that worked for me but perhaps work well for another person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was a good product to use. I did notice some of the dark spots on my skin going away.

"The sample size was so tiny that I didn't get to use it but one time. That's really not enough to tell if I truly like it. Since I haven't been to a store that carries it, I have not had an opportunity to get a bigger size and give it a good try. It was easy to apply and my face did not feel greasy or weighted down.

"My first impression of using this product for the first time, I thought it was a little to dry for my skin, but after applying and wearing it all day, my skin did not feel dry or flaky looking. Matter of fact my skin was smooth looking, After day 5 of using this product, I actually got compliments on my skin, I was told it looked healthy and smooth.

I liked olay luminous product. I didn't have enough of the product sample to notice a dramatic difference in my skin after using it just a fee times. But I did like the way the product made my skin feel. It left my face feeling soft and I did notice a subtle difference in the tone of my skin. I think I will definitely buy this product to give it a fair try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really love Olay products. I've tried several different ones and like them all. Leaves my skin soft and takes care of dry patches. Will be buying this in the near future. Just wish I could find something for the puffiness under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The feel of my skin after I put this on is so nice. Now it did start to even out my skin tone a bit. I have red blotches on my cheeks and forhead, so that didn't really go away, but as for my dull skin , This moisturizer worked ok [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the way this felt on my skin . It went n smoothly and easily . My current one seemed as if it was clogging my pores and causing itching and skin flare ups .

I have always loved Olay products but I REALLY love Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! My skin feels so soft. And it looks so radiant.

I was really impressed with the sample I received of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream.

"With any skincare product, it takes more than a few applications to see results and I would expect the same to be true of this product.

This moisturizer was too good to be true. I loved how my skin felt and its youthful appearance. My friends and family noticed that I was looking a bit younger. The tone of my skin improved and it faded some sun spots that I had for years. Even used it o my hands to lighten the age spots. no longer use my old moisturizer as thisd one was much better and less expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream went on smoothly. It's hard to say how the results are because of the tiny size of the sample. These products take time to see any actual difference in your skin.

"I LOVE this cream!! It helps my skin feel smooth! It takes very little to cover my face & neck. And one thing I truly love is it smells wonderful! Not too strong, very light & clean smelling. No chemical smell like others I've tried. I've used it almost a week now, day & night, and still have plenty left! I will definitely purchased the full size!

"After using this product for a week I can see some minor improvement in my skin. Some dark spots/freckles have lightened, however, it didn't make my skin all that luminous. With my dry skin I couldn't use the product by itself - but had to use it in conjunction with a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin definitely felt and looked luminous. I used this at night and in the morning for 3 days and I felt like my skin looked brighter and softer. I am actually going to purchase this for a few ladies for Mother's Day and I am picking one up for myself as well. I'm interested in seeing how it does over time but I love it so far.

"The tube I was given was far too small to make an informed decision, even using less than recommended. Furthermore they recommend using morning and night but this product doesn't have any spf, critical for a morning moisturizer. Funny that an anti-aging product would recommend that. I did find the scent pleasant and it did not irritate my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product, as with a little age, blotchy patches occur, and the moisturizer had just enough tint to actually cover and blend in my skin tone evenly enough, I used it as a coverage, more than moisturizer. The scent is light and pleasant. I have told my family about using and purchased it for myself and for my 18 year old niece. Never too young to moisturize!!! Thanks for the sample. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't get to use very much of this, as the sample size was very small, but the moisturizer felt very nice on my skin, had a nice scent, and left my skin looking soft and healthy.

"I have tried various skin creams, but I think this Olay product is the best so far. True proof that you don't have to spend a ton to get a good skin care product.

I'm a big fan of Oil of Olay products. I was excite to try this product when it came up in my sample box. It smells great and leaves your skin feeling soft. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is hard to tell whether I would use instead of Olay Total Effects as it was such a small sample. My skin is sensitive and new creams have a tendency to break my face out after a couple of weeks so I am leary of change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It smelled very good to me and refreshing. while applying it went on so smoothing and not messy. the nest morning my face still felt so smooth just like it did the night before after I applied.

I am a loyal Olay customer already! I've received and sampled other much more expensive brands and am not as impressed as I am with the Olay sample! Just a few drops on the finger tips smooths all over my face! I still have some left in the tube! I don't wear a lot of make up at all and never wear foundation. Just the other day I had a friend tell me the skin on my face truly belied my age! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved a small sample and it was enough! I love the feel of my skin after using, haven't used it long enough yet to know if it will help with wrinkles.

I have very sensitive skin so I am always hesitant about trying new products but I really enjoyed this one! I used it in place of my current daily moisturizer and it left my skin very soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The feel of the moisturizer was nice along with the scent. It is hard to tell how well it works due to the size of the sample. I stretched it out over 3 days which is to short of a time to tell whether it really lives up to its claims. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really happy with this. It felt really nice on my skin and wasn't oily or greasy-feeling. It was smooth and moisturized very well. I didn't notice any immediate kind of change, but most things you need to use for a couple weeks to see anything truly noticeable. I'll probably get it full-sized at least once to see what kind of difference it makes. I currently already use an Olay product, so I would feel safe switching to it if I like how it looks after a couple weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

When I opened my sample I immediately didn't like the smell. Ignoring that I put some one my finger. It has a thin milky consistence that when rubbed between my fingers felt drying. I didn't put it on my face since I have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the feel of the lotion. It went on easily and didn't leave an oily feel. You only had to use a little bit to cover your face and neck. I think my skin was softer and smoother after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try this product because I am always on the hunt for new skin products. I liked the feel of the product on my skin, but I didn't notice any drastic difference between this and my other products. I wouldn't go and buy this right now for my personal use, but maybe in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The olay luminous perfecting cream was great. It felt light and airy on my skin opposed to the greasy feeling some lotions leave behind. And the smell wasnt overwhelming as opposed to other creams. I liked it very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is better than the current cream I'm using. It leaves my face softer the next day so I will definitely be purchasing this cream. I like that it is also not very strong smelling so it does not affect my sleep at night as I'm very sensitive to smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay never ceases to amaze me. They typically never have a product I don't like and this was no exception. This moisturizer was really nice on my skin and didn't break me out at all. It went on smoothly and I can't wait to purchase this again to replace my current moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
KiM recently started using miscreant after receiving a sample and started noticing great improvements on my skin. After 2 weeks of usage have noticed it has dramatically brightened it fading dark spots. Has a very nice light scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm in my 30s and I've noticed my skin texture has become uneven. I noticed using this product within a week my skin started to glow and become even in texture. It felt light and didn't feel like I had anything on my skin. I would recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The tony sample I got to test it out was so tiny i think it was dried up in the tube because nothing came out! I really wanted to sample this product to.. I've been watching it every time I go into the store! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product and the way it made my skin look & feel. I just wish the sample would have been a lil bigger because you really don't get enough to see a big difference. It did interest me enough that I would buy this product & use in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love Olay skincare. This is the perfect addition to my regimen as I have always had a few spots on my face that needed attention. It is moisturizing and definitely faded some spots with the use of everyday application. A huge benefit is that it is lightweight and has a very nice scent. I would suggest this product to those that may need special attention to fading discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Personally I couldn't use this product I had an allergic reaction my face felt like it burned after using but I also have sensitive skin. But don't let my opinion stop you from sampling and possibly loving this item [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had been using the cheap olay daily face cream moisturizer and I don't like it. This stuff is a world of difference! I have dry skin and I use the olay regenerist cream cleanser and regenerist pore scrub then put this moisturizer on and my face looks glowy! Had a nice light scent too not over powering! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the Olay REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM. I liked the smell of the product and I loved the feel of the product which seemed to feel kind of silky. The product went on smoothly and did not seem greasy at all. And the product seemed clean feeling while on. The product seemed to make my face seem more softer and smother too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think partly the sample sizes are so small you can't get a real idea of the use of the product a few times. It's not bad, not great. Just couldn't use it enough to really know and thus I'll stick with what I already buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product, really liked how it made my skin look and feel after using it and look forward to using it and seeing its effects after more lengthy use. Have already bought more, thanks for letting me try this awesome product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like and use Olay products and the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream to work well. I liked the feel of the moisturizer on my skin and the light scent. However, I prefer my moisturizer to have a SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way my face looks after using this Olay product. It made my skin look so much younger and less wrinkles. The best part is that it is not heavy and you do not feel it at all. The skin looks natural. That is the look I love [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Product was smooth in application and did not have a heavy scent. My face did not break out with the initial sample but typically I need to use something for about a week before I can tell if I have breakouts. The sample did not last a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would tell everyone I know to buy this product. I have used olay products for years. I have never any allergic reactions with Olay products. I had some allergic reactions in the past with other company facial cream products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was quiet the little adventure with the product that I use and I definitely enjoyed the texture in the sense that all those good things that came with the package and I think it would be a great addition to our household [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought this product was alright, I just dont understand what i really need it for. I would purchase other olay products before this just because I feel like this isn't necessary but could be very nice for someone who wants a glow. I let My mom try it and she loves it, so I guess it just depends on what your looking for. Overall it was nice to try and I would still recommend it, especially to my older friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin had a brightness and even tone with this cream. I would have to use it for linger to see if it makes a big difference in the long run. It is easy to apply, not being heavy, but definitely full of moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was received as a sample from Pinch Me in order to review the product. The sample was small and didn't allow me to fully understand or benefit from its use. I did like the look and feel of the product as well as the scent. It was easy to apply. However, I wasn't able to determine whether or not using the cream would be beneficial. I assume it would be because I feel Olay does product some good products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the feel of this product and liked the packaging. However, I did not really notice that the product met the claims that were made about it. I couldn't really tell any difference in the brightening/ etc of my skin w/ it's use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product felt really great on my skin BUT I could not put my make up on over it. It caused my make up to cake up, roll off and look horrible. I have to have moisturizer under my make up, this will not work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just loved everything about Olay Regenerist Luminous. The easy way it glided over my skin, how smooth and soft it made my skin feel, the way it made my skin look smoother, and the scent was absolutely marvelous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the tone perfecting cream! It smelled amazing and felt amazing too! It made my face feel great and I'm already noticing a difference in my appearance. Would highly recommend to others! A new fav! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a small sample size of this product. It has a very silky feel to it. It also has a fresh smell, like a fresh garden smell or fresh laundry, it is hard to describe. But I like the smell, it is not heavy it is light. I might buy it, it is hard to tell when the package is so small. It seems to be something I might like to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for almost a week. The scent is nice and not overpowering. The feel of it is similar to my current moisturizer and nothing outstanding. I feel that longer usage is the only way to determine the benefit of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought this moisturizer was okay. It had a nice smell and consistency, and went on nicely.The sample I received, however; was very small and only enough for a two day usage. Because of this I couldn't make a decision as to whether or not the product really does tone and perfect the skin as it claims. Typically it takes at least 7 to 14 days to notice any effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I instantly feel it working to moisturize my skin. I get a very smooth feeling when applied to my face without a greasy or oily feel. It takes effect immediately. It is a good moisturizer for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this works. My regular moisturizer my face so-so. This cream moisturizers my face in the areas that need it and does not over do it on the areas that don't need to be. It's awesome in that way. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this product, it worked well as a base before putting on makeup. However, it seems like there are so many variations of face creams, it is hard to know which one is the right one for my skin tone/ age /needs. Especially since i dont wear a lot of makeup in general. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't see a difference with wrinkles but my skin was smoother and I noticed that the texture was smoother than it normally is. It took from the same about three times using the product for me to see the difference so you don't need a lot to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"No more dry skin, the best moisturizer I've ever tried, and it's perfect for my Asian skin tone, it feels great on my skin, so soft and it reduces the appearance of age related dark spots, my face and neck looks a lot younger, I would definitely keep on using this product and I would even recommend it to my older sisters and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my sample in my pinchme box and started using it right away. Love the way it makes my skin feel and look. Also let my oldest daughter try this one and as with the other she loved it. This time when she went out and purchased she only got one so I went and bought mine myself. Love this product so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have pretty sensitive skin and trying this I didn't have an adverse reaction, which was a plus but the sample size was to small so I would like to try it for a longer period to see if it really is worth it. But I did like what I had. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have blemishes on my cheeks,I was unsure if any product would help me. I tried my free sample and with the first application noticed a difference. And a little goes along way as well which is very nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this to be a nice little moisturizer. I use a different product that is substantially cheaper and I like it extremely well. If that product wasn't available any more I would purchase this, providing the price was right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Upon the first application I really liked it. The scent is great and I did noticed a difference in my complexion however, after some time I noticed it never fully absorbed and when I'd rub my face it would flake off. After that I was definitely turned off by it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved using this product. I liked the way it felt on my skin, it wasn't greasy or heavy. After using I did notice a change in the appearance of the toning in my skin, I want even toned skin and this is great for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't typically moisturize my skin on a daily basis, but the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream made my skin look nourished. My pores were small and I looked healthier than I typically do. What a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i felt that OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is a decent moisturizer. I normally purchase skin care products from a dr's office. i will pay a little more to get more intense ingredients. this product is good for an everyday use for people that cant really afford the more expensive medical grade moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the sample and didn't expect much to happen. I have rosacea and haven't found any skin care items that really helped at all, but I actually noticed a difference after a few days even of using this. I'm debating on purchasing it to use regularly, just concerned about the price. I'm not sure how much it is but I'm fairly certain its a little pricier than my current moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The tone perfecting moisturizer had a nice scent to it. It smelled nice and fresh. The cream wasn't too thick which meant that it almost felt like it disappeared on my face. So I had to put extra just to get more moisture on my skin. I wasn't convinced to buy the product as of now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally do not use facial moisturizers or wrinkle creams, however I did try this sample. It did leave my skin feeling and looking softer, however there was not enough of a sample to see any noticeable long term differences. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product got me looking for another Olay products of which I have purchased two and I am very pleased with the two products I have purchased. Thanks for the sample. I have been wondering about Olay for years and just never got around to purchasing it. Now I am a steady customer:)! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I have seen Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting cream on television commercials recently and was glad when I got the opportunity to give it a try through Pinch Me. This product has taken away the red areas that I typically have right around my nose as well as help to give a good level of moisture to my skin without leaving a greasy feeling afterward! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this product but the sample was small so I believe a person would have to use it for a couple of weeks in order to notice a significant difference in skin tone. However, I did notice subtle differences after using the sample so it will be interesting to see what develops after longer use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's fine, but like the Olay Regenerist in the red jar better. My face has not ""brightened"" any more than when I was using the Olay in the red jar. My brown spots have not faded. It does work nicely to moisturize, but I prefer the unscented in the red jar and will go back to that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the sample but it was simple too small to see any difference or to truly feel any difference. I have recommended it to others who are thinking about a new facial moisturizer. I am not sure that I would ever purchase it myself though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the feel of this moisturizer, it works well and it not greasy/does not leave an oily residue. I wish the sample was larger so I could see if it works to perfect skin tone. Because the sample is small I can only judge it as a moisturizer and not a skin tone perfecter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay is already a great product and a trusted brand. The Olay Regenerest luminous tone perfecting cream is very light weight and a soft fragrance. Feels super soft upon application. Makes skin feel healthy and younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is a great part of your daily morning or bedtime routine. It is never to soon or to late to start a good facial and neck routine.

"Olay's creams have always been highly rated, and I've been told that Olay finally decided to remove parabens last summer from the formulation, which I hope is true as this stuff works and is easy to find and well-priced. Now wish it would remove the artificial fragrance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My wife used this and loved it. I will have to try it once we buy some which she has already been on me about getting it the next time we're at the store. She applied it before bed & I could see the difference in her face the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"the lotion feel great going on, and smells wonderful. Not overpowering. It moisturizes my skin when it feels dry. My only question is in regarding to the ""tone-correcting"" nature of the product. I have only been using it for a short time, but haven't noticed any tone correction happening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always loved olay products. My mom and aunts all use them so naturally, I use them too. I normally use the old school original formula that I was introduced to in college. Now that I'm older, I like to branch out and try different things. But oh, am I glad to come back to where it all started because I'm so happy with how my skin looks and feels not to mention great smelling too! Reminds me of my childhood growing up with the women in my family. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the sample for the 2 weeks it said it would take to see a visible difference and let me tell you, I am a believer! My face is smoother, it has fewer visible lines and brown spots and I've even been complemented that I look younger! SOLD!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the feel and scent of this product. My face felt just as smooth as my current moisturizer, but this product's scent is much more pleasant.I have not priced it out, and am a little leary - their products are pricey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Fine product. I do not know that I could tell a difference in my skin tone after using the sample but it moisturized well. I will probably stick with my current moisturizer (Mary Kay) but would consider purchasing it if I needed something immediately since I cannot purchase Mary Kay in the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I couldn't tell from the small sample whether it really will correct the tone of my skin, but the FEEL of the lotion was perfect. It was moisturizing but actually felt more like a primer than any lotion I've ever used. It helped my makeup go on very nicely. Loved the smell, not greasy at all - just made for a very nice, even, moisturized face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this moisturizer to be pretty average. I noticed no miraculous results after using the tiny sample, but perhaps with continued use I would see a difference. I just wasn't impressed enough by the product to purchase it and continue trying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always like Olay products. The Luminous product was equally as good as the other Olay products I have used such as the regenerist. I appreciate the sample because there are so many different Olay products and I can't buy them all so I tend to stick with one type rather than trying different ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream felt great upon application. I could see the difference in the way my skin looked and felt upon first use. My skin is sensitive and there was no irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I like Oil of Olay products anyway, but this was my first time trying this particular one. First let me say they actually gave me enough to use for a week or more. This is a great way to truly sample a product! The first time I put it on my face it immediately felt good. I can't explain really.....just trust me! This is an awesome product and my skin looks so much nicer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Usually my moisturizer and toner is cocoa butter. But I decided to give Olay a try and boy is it great. You can feel the difference in your skin in just a matter of days, it was soft and had a nice healthy glow. The only downfall is the price, but you truly don't use much, so your jar should go a long way if you're light with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this moisturizer to be pleasantly scented and easy to apply. However, I have very dry skin and need a more intense product. For those with less dry skin, I would think this product would work quite well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM was just OK in my opinion. I like my current brand so any other brand is going to have to blow me away to get me to switch things up, this just didn't do that.

"I love the OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM that I received as a sample. Love it so much I went out and bought it! It has made my pores look smaller, and also I have a natural glow that I hadn't noticed in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was very light weight and soft feeling going on. It disappeared instantly and left my face feeling soft and clean. I wore it with and without makeup and loved it both ways. I haven't used it long enough to see a definite difference but so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great. I had A great experience it evened my skin tone and didn't feel greasy when applied. The aroma wasn't overpowering. And I felt it reduced the appearance of lines and wrinkles . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"One of the problems with moisturizers is that you can only really feel how a particular product affects you after a week or two of use. This product was nice, and it felt light and clean on my skin. I like it better than my daytime moisturizer but I still prefer my old nighttime one to this. I am still unsure of the 'tone perfecting' claim but as with all Olay products you feel as though it is a quality product that feels good on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the consistency of the product but after the very first day of using it I had two negative comments on my skin. One person who I see every day noticed the scar on my face for the first time. My husband then told me that my face looked shiny. Those were not very good comments right out of the gate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this product. It was a single use foil packet which made it hard to tell how well I would like this for everyday use. It didn't have any qualities that immediately turned me off to it but it wasn't enough to really make an informed decision about whether or not it would be suited to every day use. It's just hard to tell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love this face cream! The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming even to my somewhat sensitive skin, and I love how my skin feels after I use it. My skin isn't oily and I feel that my makeup goes on smoother. I haven't used it long enough yet to see any fading of dark spots as promised, but I would definitely keep using it and purchase more after my sample runs out.

"The cream doesn't have too strong a scent, and it does feel pretty good on skin. I did experience some irritation after using it a couple times, though I have very sensitive skin, so it could be different for different people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product goes on really nicely! It feels moisturizing and absorbs quickly with no residual oiliness left behind. My skin feel softer and my freckles look lighter. I'm also using other products so I can't say if this is because of this product itself. Am considering purchasing after my current moisturizer runs out. I do prefer pump bottles to jars in general because it feels more hygienic, though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the free sample of OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM that I received from PinchMe. It wads easy to us and left my skin feeling soft and there was no greasy feeling. I feel my skin looked better after using the product. This is another great product from Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used to wear regular cream but as I got older I could not wear any kind of cream. I like walking as my regular routine every day and the Sun has damaged my face that I started to get Dark spots on my face. By using Olay product is going to make my face healthy looking again. Thank You Olay for your products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never used a tone perfecting cream so this was a first for me. I've used Olay products all my life so I wasn't surprised that this felt great going on. And Olay is so great about not having overpowering scents. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"On day one that I tried it I was really in love! It was so creamy and the scent was very neutral and not to strong, but after just one day of just one day of using the product I started to get a bumpy rash all over my face. It was probably just a reaction to something in the moisturizer, but I would not buy again knowing how my face reacted! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have rosacea and psoriasis on my face and most facial creams just increase the redness. On day one i felt my skin softer and by day 7 the redness dereased and everyone complimented the natural shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a great product to use instead of my usual. I loved how it felt and how it was so easy to wash off when need be. There's some products out there that are so oily on application and glad this wasn't one of them. I hate that feeling and tend to be selective with my choices because of it. The scent was great too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thoroughly appreciated trying the sample. Actually I would purchase it after I have used up my usual olay moisturizer. Not only did this provide some color tone but also was an excellent moisurizing product. I am an avid Olay product user and I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this the first time I used it. I love the way it feels on my skin as well as how my skin feels after. I bought it as soon as my sample ran out. I have had quite a few compliments on how great my skin looks...Yes, keep them coming! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of this moisturizer! It has a nice scent, goes on smoothly, a little goes a long way!

I can't believe how amazing this product is! In only days I really notice the difference. I counted my wrinkles and wore the cream for 3 days then counted them again and really saw a differenc!!!! It's expensive but totally worth it!!! I love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This make my skin feel SO soft. as soon as I put it on, it sinks in and doesn't leave a sticky residue like some face moisturizers do. And my skin doesn't look more even and bright after using. This doesn't have a strong smell and the sample has lasted me quite a bit! Definitely going to purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am sold! I put this on once and it feels smooth and creamy and smells heavenly! It also smoothed out my skin tone from day one and ads a little shimmer when I decide to go without makeup for a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is a decent product. It is much better than the eye cream which I don't like at all because of the odd silver color. This product gives nice moisturization, other than that I didn't notice any benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'd say that it would be nice to have a larger sample than just a packet. There's no way to see long term results of a product otherwise. Although I did like the feel of it and there was a pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
You know the feeling...you get stuck in the rut of buying the same old product over and over again because it's what you know. You don't know what you might be missing out on. That was my experience after trying Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. This product just works better than my old cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The sample was kind of small, so it was hard to even feel how good it was! I thought it would be larger since the sneak peak video showed the little 15ml sample jars, but it wasn't. I didn't notice much of a difference in my skin, but thankfully it didn't make me break out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, the name says it all. When I put it on it helps to even out my skin tone and it also helps to fill the tiny wrinkles which was an added benefit. It absolutely does what it says and goes on very smooth and feels great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It hard to hide a one time sample for affectivness other than the feel on skin and the smell. I want to know if it really works. I love oil of Olay and will definitely try the product and go from there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A sample is too small to know if this is a product you will love or not. However, It smelled nice and I liked the sample I tried. I would consider purchasing when my current product runs out as I like this brand overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this moisturizer. It was easy to apply and was creamy and absorbed quickly. I only had enough for one application but it seemed that my skin was a little brighter after I used it. I'd like to buy this and give it a month and see what it does for my skin. Definitely worth trying! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am satisfied with my current facial moisturizer and yet still exploring other options, and also was fortunate to get to sample this one. I have very sensitive skin and protective over what I put on my face. I have not really been using it, so my opinion on this product is neutral. I still would recommend this product to a friend because different things work differently on everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed using the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. As I get older something like this is definitely a great addition to my face routine. I found that the product helped even out my skin tone and left me looking refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There was not enough of the sample to be able to say one way or the other or the other about its benefits. I can say that it is heavily scented and that may bother some. I however, found the scent lovely. I can also say the feel of this product is very nice. It's very soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is very sensitive and can be red and blotchy. This cream did not really help that at all. I expected it to help even out my skin tone, but instead it just barely changed it. My current product from clinique is still my preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually don't buy Oil of Olay anti-aging products simply because of the price. If this turns out to not be too expensive I'll purchase it because it feels really good on your skin (Light and not greasy) and it smells good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this moisturizer. The texture is nice and thick. It feels super creamy and soft when applying. It has a slight, fresh scent to it as most Olay products have. It absorbs quickly into your skin, so you can move on with your beauty routine. The scent disappears once absorbed. I would recommend this if you have normal to dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did not think this product would wow me but it did! My skin looked great after one use. Okay products are expensive in my eyes but the product is so awesome it is worth the high price unlike some of their other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! I generally wear shear coverage makeup so I tend to look for moisturizers that will give my skin a great natural looking glow. Not only does this product do this but it also evens out my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If i didn't have crazy skin that breaks out from anything that touches my face. The scent is delicate and not overpowering. I noticed an immediate difference in the ""brightness"" of my face after one application. Unfortunately i cannot continue because it broke my face out. Almost every product does though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a trusted brand all the way around. I really like this moisturizer bc I have seen the improvements, it smells great, its easy to apply and it does not irritate or break out my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was so soft putting it on my skin, I have dry skin and it actually kind of helped that. It made my skin feel instantly soft. I bought like 4 things of it, so I could stock up before everyone starts buying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that it helps to whiten my skin and gives a glow after each uses. Since i am already on my 30's i needed a skin care that can work and address different aging problems especially on my face, i definitely love this Olay skin care and it helps minimize dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i have a place under each eye that gets really dry and can scab up if i don't treat it every night and morning i use a special liquid soap and also have to use cream afterward but i still get the feel of the scab on my skin you just can't see it. I used this the first night and when i woke up it was very soft and i couldn't feel the scab so now i can wash my face and apply the olay cream and not be picking at my face all the day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm glad I got to try this product because it's one I'm going to buy now. It's about time I start taking care of my skin and this cream made me glow and felt wonderful. I have already told some girlfriends about it too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
it is really nice i like how my face looked after a few days of just using it. i am sure the longer it is used the more perfect the skin tone will be. i also like how it felt after i had placed it on my face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how it made my skin so smooth. And I loved the scent that went right along with it. It made my face feel deeply moisturized. My skin felt young again, instead of dry. I even have my mother using this product and she loves it so much that she threw out the products she use to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, there was just not enough product for me to thoroughly sample. I did like the scent, texture and the way it felt on my skin. I would really like to try a larger quantity sample, so that I could test it more thoroughly. Without having enough product to test thoroughly, at this time, I cannot recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sometimes you get these dinky one time use trials and honestly you cant tell with just one use. I have gotten 10 or so applications so far and still have some left. I like the way my face doesnt feel greasy after application. As far as tone perfecting, im still undecided [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Day three of use, not entirely sure what I am looking for thats different in my face but I can say the product smells great and my face feels great. Cream is light and moisturizes well, I have dry skin so that's always a challenge for me. This product does not have spf [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product went on smoothly and my absorbed quickly into my skin. It gave my skin a nice youthful glow, without making it shiny. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day without getting super oily (which it is prone to doing with other moisturizers). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This sample was a good size to really get a feel for what it can do. I felt like it did a good job of moisturizing and firming but I am hesitant to buy it since it doesn't claim oil-free and I couldn't find any information online to see if it won't clog pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I think of Oil of Olay I expect a better quality of skin care but this was a swing in miss. It did nothing to fix my tone in certian parts of facail area. I would say though that it was sweet scented and easy to apply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I actually like this product but it was a little too greasy for my oily skin. And greasy isn't a good way to describe this at all because it does not have a greasy feel to it at all. Like I said, it's just a little too much 'moisturizing' for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only have the sample to try so I do think that was enough of the product for me to get a really good idea of what I think about it. It seemed to work a little but I didn't have enough to see results at least for a week. Stuff like this you need samples that will last 30 days to really get a feel for the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this the first day I received my box and loved it immediately! I haven't ever tried many Olay products but this one was great! It didn't leave a greasy feel afterwards and made my skin feel refreshed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received my sample of Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream. Pleasant smell and felt nice on my face. However, I really didn't notice a difference. The sample was small...so, maybe It was too soon to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed the way my skin felt after applying the cream. It was non-greasy, and my skin felt hydrated all day. Not sure it really changed the tone of my skin after a short trial but it did work great as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was an Oil of Olay long time customer, since I was 10 yrs old, I am 42 yrs old now and to be honest with economy being hard I stopped but I am sooo glad I started Olay again. It goes on non greasy, clean and results are amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It smells so much like a hair conditioner that I actually started to check the package to see it was indeed intended for face. Smooth application and face feels nice and soft after however I didn't see any tone perfecting and the smell is weird for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great product. I felt as though it didn't leave my face oily like some products usually do. I have very very sensitive skin and I had absolutely no problems with this product I have no break out or anything. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is very nice. It smells good and when it is applied it is not greasy feeling. I would prefer to have sunscreen in my daily moisturizer. I also have very sensitive skin and use a product that has very few ingredients which this differs from. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It'd be really much more positive and definitive of a review if I had a larger than one use sample to go off of. I've heard good things and it doesn't smell or feel bad, bad but I have no basis for actual results. True reaction is TBD [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the product felt silky and smooth on my fingertips, the cream felt much too thick on my face. I prefer something more lightweight as a moisturizer, as I don't believe this Olay cream completely absorbed. Pros: velvety scent, very moisturizing Cons: too thick, doesn't feel fully absorbed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not care for the texture or consistency of this product. It is not something I would seek out to purchase. It may be that some people like a thicker consistency in their face lotion, however, I did not care for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product left my face and skin feeling amazing and it helped with the odd tones of my skin. I did not use the product all over, i only used on one part of my face due to the small amount in the sample but it seems as tho it will work well when i buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It smells really nice and seemed to really help moisturize my face. The sample size was also big enough for me to get several uses out of, which I really like since it gives me time to see if it actually makes a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It Smells AMAZING!! I Have Very Oily Skin, So I Am Not Sure If This Is The Right Product For Me, Although I Do Want Even Skin! I Put This On At Night Before Bed, And The Smell Is SO Good! I Am Very Sensitive To Smells, And This Didn't Bother Me One Bit. In Fact, I Think It Helped. I Enjoyed It Very Much!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this moisturizer for a daytime cream. It went on smooth, left my skin with a nice glow and even looked nice underneath my liquid foundation. I will definitely purchase this for my new daytime skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I've started using this product several weeks ago I've noticed a smoother healthy glow where I usually have blotchy, freckles discolorations. I try to use at least once a day/night on face and neck area. Although I haven't had any improvement with the fine lines around mouth, lips or eyes. Also if I rub my face the cream residues seem to roll up into a ball which can be icky. And I use without makeup. I also reapply if i perspire heavily.

"I received a sample from pinchme and i really wanted to try this olay regenerist luminous toning cream, i tried it and it made my skin feel soft, love the smell, its light, not as thick as i expected but very moisturizing, as for fading dark spots it didn't last long enough for me to see that results but i can definitely see a difference in my skin tone, I've recommend this product to my family and friends and i will purchase.

"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream really delivers on its promise. I saw marked improvement in my skin tone after less than a week of use. It feels luxurious and leaves my skin feeling hydrated, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not use too much of this product to see if it would correct the tone of facial skin. This is because my skin would itch after application and would last up to an hour. This gets very annoying and I did not wear it out of the house so it was not caused by sun exposure. I would not say that I had a full blown allergic reaction to it, just that I am sensitive to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was pleasantly surprised with this lightweight product. Since I have dry skin, I used this over my regular daytime moisturizer. It went on very smoothly and did add a nice subtle glow. Perfect for highlighting cheeks for a healthy look. Really like it very much but not sure how well it will do once the real heat and humidity of North Carolina comes with the Summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The olay tone perfecting cream, did just what it claims to do. It was super nice on my skin and I don't know if it was in my head or if it really did work, but it made my skin appear better. I applied this overnight and my skin felt so much better the next morning. It was visible change. I really recommend this to anyone and everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product was not only a wonderful smelling product, it also was a smooth application, which I appreciated. I would definitely try this again seeing as my skin did feel more hydrated and generally brighter and happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This cream smells so good! Clean and fruity, and it almost feels like a primer when you smooth it on. I didn't notice any 'luminous' results, but overall it was a good moisturizer, didn't make me break out, and smelled good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
All of this product I've been having my eye on it and I'm so glad that I was able to sample it I went out and bought the full size I'm loving the luminosity it gives me and its evening my skin tone fading dark spots [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product felt nice. I wasn't left with a sticky or oily feeling on my face like some products can leave. Unfortunately, however, there wasn't much to the sample. :( Enofor for application only. These types of productsneed at least 3 days (or more) worth to see any results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like the sculpting cream, I wanted to love this but it never seemed to soak into my skin. Even after an hour, the product was balling up on my skin and leaving chunks on my face. It did give a luminous glow to my skin, but I don't see how I would ever be able to apply make-up over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used some moisturizers that end up in my eyes at some point during the day and cause major eye watering. This happens even if I don't put the moisturizer on or around my eyes. I used this moisturizer very near my eyes and never had an irritation problem. I do wish there was some SPF in it though. I don't frequently wear make-up and appreciate all in one products.

The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was great. It felt silky smooth on my face. Very light and airy and the best part is that it didn't leave my face feeling greasy or sticky.

"I'm not usually a fan of moisturizers or cream for my face because my skin is naturally oily and adding to the oil results in breakouts. However, this cream did not cause excess oil and even made my face feel super smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product makes me feel younger! It leaves my skin soft and glowing. Excellent product. I use many of the Olay Regenerist products and I have found that they do to your skin exactly what they state they will do. They cost more, but with the results I get, it's well worth it!

I really enjoyed the opportunity to try this product. I've been dealing with patches of dry skin and this seemed to do a good job of hydrating it. It definitely softened as well making makeup application look more smooth and finished than before. This isn't something I would normally use though as I am becoming more ingredient conscience.

After applying this product for about 4 days i loved how moisturized my skin felt. I applied it to my entire face and immediately felt a cooling sensation. After about 4 hours i still felt my face moisturized and smooth. The smell of the product wasn't bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This fast-absorbing moisturizer really does hydrate one's skin. I have been using this cream for 1 month now and I am totally satisfied with the results. i just love it!, fades the look of dark spots, age spots, sun spots and discoloration. My skin is a lot more evenly tonedbrighter looking, and the dark circles under my eyes are lightening so im in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always use moisturizer, morning and night, and this product is extremely nice! I always have an issue with shine/oil residue with every product I've used. I switched my usual product for this one and this product kept my face hydrated with No oiliness or shine! I have already bought more, even though I am not out of the sample! Love it, due to the fact that is works so well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was a very small package it felt very nice and face is more surprised it made my face for me so if I put it right under my make up and if that well last that moisture all day I woke strongly recommend this and use it I face bus more stir the next day and still felt soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved that it didn't take much product to moisterize my entire face making my money stretch further. My face felt clean and radiant with this cream but not greasy (and I have oily skin). I really like it and depending on price may purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used Olay products for years & am eager to give this one a try. According to the directions, full results are seen in 8 weeks. I plan to purchase, so that I can use it for the recommended time frame. So far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked how soft and smooth this lotion made my skin feel. In the short time that I have been sampling the lotion I can already see some of my sun spots fading. I will be buying more of this when my sample is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Wish I had a bigger sample to truly see what the turnout would be because it is advertised that it takes 8 weeks to see results. I can say that that this Olay Tone Perfecting Cream has a smooth texture and left my skin feeling refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really loved this cream. What I like was that they sent me a deluxe size so it allowed me to try it out a few days and to see results. I would total purache it. I love the way it smells and how it made my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved the smell, nice and springy. After only a few uses, my face started to glow. I currently use Oil Of Olay Age Refining cream & total 7 face wash. After using this cream, I did purchase the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Face wash (not the lotion, as I have a ton of the age refining left). I think I will alternate between the two Face washes & lotions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM does what it implies. it evens out the tone of the skin with visible clarity in a few uses. The cells of the skin appears to come alive and the skin the smooth and hydrated. The face is left feeling drenched in pure ingredient and supple to the touch. I would use this everyday [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started to use this toner and noticed during day 1 that my face was a bit brighter, small glow. It wasn't sticky or tacky. It went on smoothly and wasn't greasy. Will use this along with my daytime routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a spring chicken anymore (guys do worry about this too!) and I've been looking for good products, by brands I know and trust, and this seems like a good one. I'd have to use more than once to expect visibly results, but this felt good on my skin, no irritation or reaction and left my skin feeling good, so I want to give it a shot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the product for a week now and while I do like the scent of it and how it feels on my skin( not super oily) I am not sure if I notice a difference between what I normally use a different olay product and this. I am going to continue to use for a few weeks because this is also a bad week for my skin due to hormones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always been a big fan of olay products. I have used them since i was in my teens/ I first sampled this moisturizer in the area around my eyes since this area needs it most. It glides on very nicely and you can feel it soaking in, it does not just lay on top of skin, it really soaks in. i could see moisture repair immediately. very happy with this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am a big fan of Olay products; however I'm not a fan of this product. I used this product for two weeks and did not notice even the smallest difference. I agree that maybe using the product for an extended period of time may produce results but I'm going to stick with my other Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream was surprising at first. It went on smoothly and wasn't oily on my skin at all. I did start to see slight improvements to my skin while using it, but since I was trying a sample there wasn't really enough to test the products long term claims. My only problem with this product, is that if I rubbed my face not long after I applied, it would crumble up weirdly which doesn't make it a good daily moisturizer for me to use under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is fantastic, it makes my skin look and feel younger and I didn't even know that was possible at my age (I'm 27). I don't usually have wrinkles unless I scrunch my forehead, but this even hid those a little bit! If I didn't already love my current skin regimen, I would be using this product.

"I was really pleased with this sample size as I was able to get quite a few uses out of it, which made it easier to tell if I could see a difference in my skin. I have noticed that my skin looks more evenly toned and doesn't feel as dry as it's been. I was also pleased to see how far a small amount could go, which is great when thinking about price!

I received a sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream from #PinchmeSampleTuesday and used it immediately. I am very pleased that the glow factor is not pearly but healthly- radiant.

"I did not like the scent of the product, I would prefer an unscented version. It made my face break out right away the first few days I used it. If you don't mind the fragrance it would be an OK product. I did like the feel of the moisturizer, very light and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pros: Lightweight; Easy To Use; Non-greasy I use the product every morning on my face. Have not been using it long enough yet to see if I notice a difference, but it feels really nice and does not make my skin feel greasy at the end of the day which I like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product a few times, but on the packaging it says it can take up to 5 weeks I think to see a big difference and there isn't enough product to use it for that long. I've been breaking out, but I don't know if it's due to the product or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Olay Luminous cream is rich and goes on easily. But I wasn't sure if it was a pre-moisturizer or in place of a moisturizer. During the day I need to use a SPF product and I'm not sure it was enough for a night cream by itself. I was unsure where it fit into my daily regimen.

"I was fascinated with how smooth this moisturizer wen unto the skin! And the smell was nostalgic. My mom and her friends said that Olay always tends to have a signature smell that women will always remember after using their cold creams for decades. I loved it, and want to see if it is actually moisturizing my face. If so, I will definitely buy the product. Please send more samples! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream leaves your skin feeling silky and smooth giving your skin a healthy glow! I usually have such dry skin, and I just LOVED this moisturizing cream! A little bit goes a LONG way which is always a bonus! Give it a week or two and you will totally see a difference in your skin! My mom says it is her WONDER CREAM, and after trying it myself I have to agree it works wonders! I received a sample of this product for an honest and unbiased review.

"I wish I would have received a larger sample to try it for a longer period of time. I like the scent and feel of Olay regenerest luminous tone perfecting cream. I think the product could be wonderful, but my sample was not large enough for me to decide if I will replace my current product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like this product, it has a non greasy feel to it, which I appreciate. I believe the sample size does not allow a fair review. A product such as this needs more time to really rate, than just a few applications. I am very interested in continuing this moisturizer, since I do like the way it makes my skin feel. However, with a high price, I most likely would not purchase it, once next to a more affordable product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My beautiful mother- in-love just revealed her secret after all these years! She gave me a bottle of Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin she had in her medicine cabinet. I didn't know if this product worked well on African American skin.I can't wait to try more products, I have dark circles around my eyes and I'm looking for a good skin toner to use. My daughters are 19 and 23 and I will encourage them to start using Olay from now as well"

I decided to try it because I have serious problems with my skin, I just have 2 weeks trying. The only thing that displeased me a little is that it doesn't have sunscreen filter and you have to use another product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product, I started using this about 3 weeks ago. I concentrated on this one dark spot I had on my cheek. It feels good, spreads well, and smells great!

I have recommended this product to 2 other people and I plan on purchasing it soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought this tone perfecting cream sample was of a decent size. I was able to get about 3 uses out of the packet. This was unfortunately not enough to determine if there was any significant effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent was a little bit overpowering, I enjoyed it but it lingered and for me, I don't look to have people notice the scent of the face cream I'm wearing, is rather have them smell my cologne or perfume. With so many products for hair that smell differently, having a face product that also has a scent is superfluous. I would rather have the focus for the product be on moisturizing and improving my skin and let the fragrance part be left to the perfume companies.

"I was a bit skeptical that this would be yhe answer to evening my skin tone. After2 weeks of use, my skin is noticeably clearer.

"I know I do!! So as I turned #FiftyandFabulous I was determined to try new products. So I grabbed at the chance to try this one. I mean who doesn't know/hasn't heard of the Olay Skincare Line. Only if you've been living under a rock. Ok that's a bit dramatic but you get my point. At the first application, I noticed a change...yes I really did. My skin just looked better and younger. So glad I got this one.Give it a try, I know you will like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was a great luxury feeling when I tried my sample. It absorb into my skin quickly and did not leave it feeling greasy or sticky. After just a few uses I could already see a difference in the appearance of my skin. I will defiantly be purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is another great skin care product from Olay. It really did give a ""luminous"" look to my skin after one use. My skin looked glowing and fresh. I look forward to seeing what long term use of this product will do for my skin. I am hoping it will help with my dark spots over an extended period of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this sample. I love facial moisturizers and I got through a lot because I put it on under makeup every day and I use it at night. This made my skin smooth and even before makeup applications. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"You could tell this was an Oil of Olay product because of the scent. This product did not cause my oily skin to break out. I wish the product included a sunscreen product. If it did, I would use this instead of my current product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the Olay moisturizer a lot. I have to say that the fact it absorbs so fast is great. I also love that there is no greasy feel to this product and a little goes along way. Which always makes my pockets happy. LOL [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Well the Olay REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM was okay. The smell was nice it did make my face feel soft. But the sample wasn't big enough for me to use more then once so I can't really tell if this will tone my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My left shoulder is completely uneven due to a sun and age combo. After JUST three uses, I noticed it lightening up and evening out!!! I've been using R&F reverse and it doesn't work as well as this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pro: Felt great going on my skin! Absorbed well. Cons: not enough of a sample to see any any difference. I need to know my purchase will be worthwhile and the same Amt did not give the product time to do its work. This was a fail BC I don't know enough to honestly tell my friends to purchase it, let line purchase it myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream and it felt kind of gross on my face after a few seconds it felt a little better but I would not use all the time because of the way it feels on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer really smells good and makes my skin feel wonderful. Besides being very refreshing it makes my face feel alive and softened. I highly recommend this product and I won't hesitate to buy the full size version. It is another quality Olay product that is also affordable skin care for most people.

"I tried the cream as directed, I say it was a subtle noticeable change and I did like the feel of the product. However I did not use the product long enough to notice dramatic changes. I definitely like the smoothing effect it gave to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. I only had a sample, but I intend to buy more. It really makes your skin feel soft and smooth. I also like the scent is light and not overpowering. It goes on easily and not oily. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"it may just be me and my facial type. i do have dry sensitive skin. this applied just fine but when i woke up the next day i was covered in red spots and developed a facial texture (small tiny bumps) all over my face where i had applied the product. this is a dangerous product for me, but again this was a personal experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had a really dry elbow and decided to take this opportunity to see how it worked in an extreme situation. Unlike a lot of other moisturizers there was no leftover oily residue and it was absorbed very quickly. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's not a bad moisturizer. I am not too sure about the ingredients because I like natural, organic and non-chemical ingredients. Also I buy cruelty free products, which I am not sure if Olay tests on animals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always stayed away from face creams due to bad experiences. My skin was amazing! I was truly blown away! Thank you for sending me a sample. I'm definatel buying and telling all my friends to try as well because they will never go back to their old products again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have normal to oily skin and have had acne my whole life. With that said I have a lot of scarring and discoloration on my face. So i was nervous when i smelt this product and it smelt so amazing. But it works. My skin felt amazing and looks so much better. Its not entirely even and it didnt take away my scares but it looks good, feels good and smells spectacular. It wasnt oily and made me feel good about using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was not all that great, I feel like there is a better product out there it can probably be because there is a brand I have used for years that I trust, and this product is fairly new and I did not see anything different. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wanted to try this moisturizer due to hearing great things about niacinamide. Didn't notice any change with sample use, although needed more time to make a fair judgement. Wasn't moisturizing enough for my dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the tone perfecting cream on my face it felt softer and the redness on my nose and cheeks was barely noticeable! I will definitely be purchasing this product as part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product with another Oil of Olay product and I am currently using both together. I see a big improvement around my mouth and jawline. I will purchase both products and continue using both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream does not leave my skin feeling as soft & smooth as other creams I have tried or used. Also, I doubt there is enough in the sample to last two weeks. If some of my age spots have become lighter by the end of the use of my sample, I might consider buying it. But based on the feel of my skin after use, I am not enthused about purchasing this. :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that there was enough of a sample to use for a week. You need at least that amount of time to really be able to judge how well it works. I like the feel and texture and it seemed like it made my skin look more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Every night I apply facial cream to my face and I was interested in trying this cream to see how it evens out my skin tone. My skin tone gets blotchy every now and then so I am always looking for a cream that helps. This sample size was enough for me to become interested in this product. It has a nice scent and the cream gives my skin a nice glow after putting it on. I will be buying more to see if it does in fact help in the long run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Has a slight floral scent and a little goes a long way! Very light feeling. Because of some brown sun spots on my face, I intend to stay the distance! It'll have a permanent spot in my nightly skincare routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do not normally use face moisturizer I put this on and it instantly didn't feel like I had anything on my face but my face felt smoother, softer, fresher. I will highly recommend this and I will go out and buy more. I wanted to say silk....but silk leaves me cold...this was very comfortable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer. It glides on and absorbs well and left my skin soft, hydrated, and with a velvety, almost matte finish, like a primer. I used it as a primer for that reason. I also liked the light, orange blossom scent. I would definitely buy it if it wasn't out of my price range. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I put it on and it seemed fine but then a few moments later it made all my dead skin on my face start to peel off. I don't know if this was because I used a different moisturizer right before but I exfoliate my skin everyday and it still peeled a lot of skin off. It wasn't painful or anything just strange. I am not sure if this is supposed to happen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was the most incredible moisturizer ever. It left your face feeling like a cloud was meditating over your face and it made your face feel soft as silk. I recommend using the moisturizer after your daily cleanse for best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was really glad that I got to try this product out. I haven't been able to tell much of how it is working quite yet but am going to purchase it and keep using. It felt good on my skin and was not greasy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm surprised on how well this product works!! I literally saw a difference after the first use and that almost never happens for me! I love the texture and how light it feels on my face, I've already suggested my family and friends to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited to try this product because I've been looking for a nice illuminating cream. This definitely brightened up my face. It was very lightweight on my skin so I didn't even feel like I was wearing anything. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a good moisturizer with a light scent. The scent is pleasant but I tend to avoid scents in facial lotions. That's just a preference. I haven't used long enough to say if it does as it claims. I do however like how light it is. My skin doesn't feel greasy after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely sensitive skin and tend to break out from any product that isn't intended for sensitive skin. I loved the smell of this product and how smooth it felt on my skin. It was not oily or greasy at all but felt very nourishing. I am disappointed that it did make my skin breakout because I really liked it. I would still recommend it for anyone who does not have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Break out when my daughter put this on her face the next day she had a breakout. Not sure if it was a allergic reaction to the product or if it was something else to the product. So my daughter would not use this at all since you broke out from it. She said that it did cover nicely [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To be honest, I didn't expect much for this product. I personally have had sensitivity issues to some Olay products, but this sample gave me no issues. It almost has a primer effect on my skin because it leaves it super smooth--so I love using this before putting on makeup. I pair this with a moisturizer that has spf in it, but other than that, I do intend to purchase this product soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have done a half and half test of this product against my normal moisturizer. I have applied this to the right side of my face and my other moisturizer on the left, after only 4 days there is a noticeable difference in the tone of my skin on the right. I have a lot of redness in my face and this has been greatly diminished. I prefer products with no scent, but the scent of this product is pretty mild. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this was a good moisturizer. I would have liked it better if it had sunscreen in it. I also thought the luminizing part was a bit of a fallacy, because it made my hands look pearly after use. But, it had a nice texture and moisturized well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As soon as I opened the tube I noticed a great smell as with all of Olay products. The cream was was thin and it felt oily. I did not see any changes in my dark spots for the week that I used it. Maybe if there were more amount of the product provided there could have been a better chance for the product to work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product. It has a nice smell to it and feels nice when applied to the face. I ended up purchasing two Olay Creams because I was so happy with both products and couldn't decide which I like better. This product has a nice price and seems to make my face brighten up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I currently use an Olay moisturizer. Not this one, but this one is ok. I have not noticed any added benefit that this one offers that the other does not. I like it but I am not going to switch because of something special. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pleasantly surprised with this product.. very thin and smooth application and it left my skin feeling fresh and not oily like all other facial moisturizers and regular lotions do. The scent is very appealing too. As far as immediate visual changes, I didn't see any but I will be continuing use to see if the dark spots I gained from my pregnancy will disappear with the help of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay products in the past and this one did not disappoint me. It was smooth, easy to use, and my skin feel and looked moist and radiant. I would definitely consider purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved this product !!!! Scent, feel of it o my face and how my face felt after it had absorbed into the skin. Really worked well for me and I have a tendency to have some dry skin due to allergy meds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING Cream lived up to its claim. I have noticed lines and wrinkles seem improved. Only using for less than a week, it seems to make a difference. I am anxious to see how it is over a longer period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This sample was a good size with more than a few days of use. It was light non greasy. I didn't notice any difference in my skin, but it was a big enough sample to make me want to buy the full size to give it an honest try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was too small!!! I wanted a lot more of the product..I enjoyed it that much. My face felt so nice and smooth after using the Olay; Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. I will definitely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Absolutely loved his face cream. I like the light pink shade I love the smell and I love how it made my skin look just after one application. I like how moisturizing it was and would definitely purchase [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did not know if this product actually works or not. I had an allergic reaction to this product. My face ended up extremely itchy, my skin felted stretched and dried out. I ended up washing the product off within 5 minutes of putting it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was not for me. It was too little of a sample to even see a difference in my skin. I would like to see about a months worth of using it to see if any thing is different or not. As of now however , I will not be purchasing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This tone perfecting cream had a lovely smell, and I really enjoyed the feel of it. Once you smooth it in, it doesn't leave behind a greasy residue. I'm not sure about the ""tone perfecting"" claims, as I didn't notice a change in tone, but it did seem to do a good job moisturizing. I do wish that the chemicals and additives list was shorter and more natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for about 4 days now. I have noticed a difference in my skin texture and radiance. I don't think I have used it long enough to see any really huge changes. I LOVE the smell. I will purchase this product to see if my skin continues to improve. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product had a very strong scent. It was not particularly moisturizing and I had to still apply my regular face cream. Reading the list of ingredients there aren't many active ingredients other than niacinamide. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Skin care has always been a sensitive subject for me. I normally do not put much product on my skin aside from moisturizer as I normally would break out. But I tried this sample and was pleased that i didn't break out. The application went on smooth. I am sad I didn't have more to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream moisturizes well. It is very silky and smooth and not greasy. It has a light scent that is clean and not too powerful. I would definitely purchase this product in the future. Seems to help with lightening freckles or age spots, just slightly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin, uneven skin tone and acne scars. It didn't give me a bad reaction and it felt light as I applied it to my face. The smell is great and it did brighten my skin a but more. It didn't lighten my acne scars but it felt smooth when I apply it at night and wake up the next morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Using Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream makes my skin feel silky, and I did start to notice a difference in the appearance after about 5 days of application. I live in a very dry climate and still feel the need for some additional moisturizing, but I am planning to continue for a few more weeks to see if my skin continues to have a better tone and hide a few of those fine wrinkles!

I loved that the sample size allowed me to really get a deal for this product. This left my skin looking and feeling clean and healthy. No greasy residue. Not a fan of the scent otherwise I really like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Both words describe not only the texture of the cream but also the way my face felt after using it. I immediately told a few of my closest friends about the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream and I know of at least one or two who have already gotten their own bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This seemed like a good product in terns of texture and feel, but I could not get past the scent. It really bothered me, to the point that I needed to wash it off. If they could make this scent-free, it would be great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I have tried a couple of products from OLAY and They are all great but this one smells amazing, feels great and leaves your skin feeling firm and soft. when you touch your skin after applying this your can actually feel the difference. I think it works great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this moisturizer very much , the ""luminous"" quality it has to it that it gives your skin is favorable. it feels good on as well. The only small negative is it is very heavily fragranced for my liking and since you are putting it on your face, there is no getting away from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer left my face feeling so soft and smooth. I love that it didn't feel heavy or greasy. I didn't notice much difference as to toning my skin, but the sample wasn't enough for a longer term trial. I am definitely going to purchase this to see the long term effects. My skin felt rejuvenated after using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The feeling of this moisturizer is so smooth. I noticed a difference in the skin tone of my face and neck after 3 applications. I will use this product faithfully lol. Is there body moisturizer in this exact product? I hope so! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I appreciate the sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Correcting Cream, but there was not enough sample product sent to me for me to give you an honest review of the product. I did not see any difference in my skin tone (or anything) by using the very small amount of product sample I received. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although my face takes some time to show significant changes to my skin when trying a new product, one thing I knew instantly is my face would feel like silk after applying! Only time would tell if the added skin benefits it boasts will be present :) good so far... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion feels nice; it's not too thick or thin. It smells like a lotion from a hotel room. It's nice that you can use it day and night but I'd rather have an SPF day cream and a more heavy-duty night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Most moisturizers are heavy, thick creams that you feel on your face for the rest of the day and immediately feel like you need to wash your face. With this product, you don't! It goes on nicely and dries quickly and leaves a pleasant smell instead of the normal medical smells the other moisturizers leave. I was very impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has a nice fragrance and feel when applying to my face. I would have given this product more stars if there would have been a few more applications to see if it preformed as advertised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have terrible combination skin: dry and oily all at the same time. It's also sensitive to products. Olay Regenerist moisturized my skin without making it breakout into pimples or a rash, and that is very difficult to do. All in all, a very nice moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This ""perfecting cream"" does the opposite of perfecting! I saw no difference after applying it on for a couple of days and what's more--I broke out with pimples!!! Terrible product. The only positive thing about it was the smoothness right after being applied. But I would never purchase it if it broke me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer left my skin with a nice dewy look. The cream is not too light and not too heavy and absorbs relatively fast. I am planning on using this moisturizer in addition to my regular moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since there was enough sample to try over multiple days, I used it everyday. My skin did feel smooth right after application but not long after I started to get a little itchy. Also, it didn't absorb into the skin well - the way it dried made my skin look flakey [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using an expensive moisturizer for years, so I doubted that I would enjoy changing. However, I have changed my mind! As a 35 year old women, I have struggled with finding a product that would provide moisture without causing me to breakout. This product has been AMAZING!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have huge pores and I am really skeptical that any moisturizer helps with pore size. I tried this anyways. I didn't like the scent of it. I didn't like the feel of it. I just didn't like the product at all. It just wasn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how it feels and it tack on time at all I just got it 6 days a go and I have been using it every day am all most if it so yes I will be going to the store to by this better the one I have been using am trying to find the right one to use this will be the 15th one I have tried and it has work so much better thank you for letting me try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a nice product unfortuently i have sensitive skin and it made my face red and tender. But the ease of applying it and how my face felt before it started drying is nice.

It smells great, rubs in quickly, and leaves your face feeling so fresh and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product and will most likely buy it as soon as my old product is gone. It is a little expensive but well worth it. It made my skin feel great and wasn't to heavy. Wished the sample was bigger thought [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use Olay Pro X and regenerate products fairly regularly. The luminizing tone perfecting cream had a very light texture. Hard to tell a tone difference without tracking 4 weeks of usage. I like the heavier consistency of the wrinkly prevention formula better for my dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Lately I have been noticing some wrinkles so I thought this is the perfect time to try this product. About a week after using the product I noticed my skin looked different more radiant and looked a lot tighter [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream! I bought it right after I finished all of the little sample tube. It was quite small but it did the trick because I bought it immediately! The cream smells great and feels like velvet! However, I couldn't really tell whether it made a difference on my skin tone until I purchased a larger jar. The Tone Perfecting Cream is definitely on it's way to perfecting the tone of my skin! Love it, love it, love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it was a good moisturizer I haven't been able to see how it fully works because they say if you wait 8 weeks dark marks and uneven skin tone will basically lighten up. But the smell is good and it is super silly and easy to apply it doesn't feel to greasy or anything it soaks into your skin good there isn't any residue I recommend but it depend on your skin type but it's a good chance to see how you like it before you purchase the big one [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 26 but I am a mom of two, work full time and go to school so I am constantly on the go. My skincare routine has never been the same since.

"I really loved this cream. It was so creamy and it smelled good. My skin felt soft and didn't itch. I used this daily, twice a day.

I normally have redness on my skin and I'm combination skin. For me facial products can be challenging to find to fit my needs. This moisturizer does a great job at lessening the redness and improving the overall appearance of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have normal skin and I am usually not sensitive to products but with this product my skin became itchy. I noticed small bumps all over my face and I rarely break out and never have all over my face. I would recommend testing this in a small area before you apply it to your whole face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did notice a difference in my skin tone, it wasn't different shades anymore. The only thing i didn't like was that i felt kind of oily. I have combination skin and in some areas it felt really gross but it did do what it was supposed to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of this product it is light, not oily. I have fair skin that tend to get dry red patches, this product helped relieve that tight, feeling.

This is a smooth cream that leaves the skin feeling hydrated but I don't feel that there is anything spectacular enough that I would give up my current routine. I didn't use it long enough to see a noticeable difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay regenerest tone perfecting cream has a nice smooth feel to it going on. It does not leave a greasy feel on the skin. My skin felt very soft after application. Seems like a nice face cream.

"I'm 25 and I'm currently using Proactive in my face due to acne, but I do not like that my face seems to oily after I apply it on my face. On the contrary when a try this moisturizer, my face feels and looks great. No more oily face! And the best of all it's that it feels soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product, it absorbed into my skin quickly and left me feeling moisturized rather than greasy. I've used it a few days in a row and started to notice a difference in my skins feel and appearance. I will be buying the full size bottle soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked how the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was easy to apply. When I shop for facial products the application process is what I look for the most. If it's easy for me to apply, then I would more than likely buy it. The only thing I did not like about this product was the small sample size. I know that it's a sample. However, I really was only able to use it for about 2 days before the product was gone, which is not enough time to see if the product would work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been trying to find a toner/primer type of facial lotion for awhile. I love the shear feel of this lotion and how my skin looks afterwards. It hasn't irritated my skin in any way, which has been more sensitive due to my current pregnancy. Once I'm through with my sample I plan to see if it will be an affordable item to purchase, so I can keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is a miracle! I have a little redness across my face, sort of in a butterfly shape across my nose and cheeks. After using this product in the morning and night after cleansing my face, the redness is almost all gone. I have never seen results like this! The product is lightweight and not greasy at all. The smell is great and the product is perfect for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed using this face cream because of the lovely scent and the cool feeling as it went on. I didn't have enough in the sample use it long enough to see if it really did what it claimed to the skin, but it did seem to moisturize well. I don't think my face skin has aged enough to feel like I really needed the anti-aging benefits it claimed, but I may consider using it again as a moisturizer since I loved the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't have ""instant results"" with this product which is just fine because most things don't work that way! However, I think if I used it consistently I would have noticed a difference. The smell isn't to strong and its not terribly greasy. I like this product and would purchase it if I needed it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product is probably fine but I had a bad reaction to it. I have never had this problem with a moisturizer in the past so I was very surprised. I would probably still recommend it to friends, just because I can't use it doesn't mean it wouldn't work for them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't have anything negative to say about the product but I can't honestly give a recommendation at this point either. It goes on light and it keeps my face moisturized through the day. I've always trusted the Oil of Olay brand so I really have no complaints. Nothing to rave about either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wasn't sure about this product at first, but after the first night of usage, I was hooked! This left my face feeling super soft the next morning - even more than other similar products. GREAT PRODUCT!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love receiving samples but products like this that takes time to work seems like such a waste of money for the company. I cannot say whether it is a good or bad product. It did feel fantastic on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
well my wife tried this product buy did not say too much about it. she did say there wasn't enough in the sample to see if it was worth buying. It would help to have a sample with enough in it to give an accurate review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is just what I needed. I have a few dark spots in my face that I am extremely self conscious about. This cream is so smooth and doesn't feel heavy on my face. I love that with continuous use my face feels smoother, healthy, and the spots seem to be blending in to my skin better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could tell a difference in how my skin looked after my first day of usage. I didnt't have dry spots nor overly oily areas. Felt this brightened my skin but it could be my anticipation. Overall, I plan to continue use and then evaluate results over time. Right now I am satisfied with this product and will look for it in store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product isn't as smooth as my current moisturizer, which is oil free. The product does have a slightly oily feel to it. It didn't spread across my face as well and I didn't feel very moisturized in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product and after a few days purchased a different, but very similar product from Oil of Olay. This moisturizer feels light and nongreasy. The only reason I didn't purchase this exact product is a prefer SPF in my moisturizer (I bought this product, but the one that has SPF.) I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this sample. It gave me the opportunity to test it and see how well it worked on my skin. After using it my face seemed less dry the rest of the day compared to other creams I have used. It has a light scent that isn't overpowering. Definitely buying in the future.

"I actually like the Olay Regenerist Luminous cream. I only use this at Night because I use a sunscreen cream along with a primer and it would've been too much. Well after cleansing my face at night I applied the cream and it sank right in, not leaving me a greasy residue. It moisturized my skin while not being too slick. I am hoping to get rid of these hyperpigmented marks on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Love it! I'm 40 years old with some brown spots and have dry spots on my face. This cream evened out my skin and left a glow to my skin. I loved how it felt on my skin and how it looked under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I do not use to much facial moisturize and Iwas happy to try something new. This product is easy to put on and it felt good on my face. I can also see my face looking better. Thank you for letting me try this sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Hello! I'm so excited every time I received my buzz package.So I'm reviewing the tone perfecting cream; I would have to say the smell is good and it wouldn't give you a headache. It matches every well with my skin tone and every light and airy, it's like you don't have anything on your face. This product to me will to perfect to use before putting on makeup it's that light on the face. The only thing I don't like is that it said moisturizer and my skin still feel dry .

"I only used this product for my face and hands, in addition to sunscreen or other lotion. Overall, it seemed to work better than my other brand of lotion as it leaves skin feeling fresh and powdered almost, like a cool feeling. I enjoyed that, as the other lotions leave my skin feeling oily or wet for whatever reason. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I will start by saying this olay makes good products .but this one I'm going to say is no .i have very dry skin and after using this it made my skin even more dry .it says it's a moisturizer but I for me I find myself using a different moisturizer after I didn't already use this one .

I really like the over all feel and scent of this product and even though it was a small tube I appreciate the fact that there was enough there to last a little over a week!. So another good point is a little goes a long way!. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I typically like to give a product a week to work before I make an informed decision, however there was only enough for 2 applications. And after 2 nights, i really don't feel like it effected my skin THAT much but it also didn't cause me to break out, which is a plus. I would recommend it to someone with sensitive skin.

I tried the Olay Regenerist luminous Tone perfecting cream. I really love it! The scent is light and and it goes on smoothly. I've been using it in the morning and night.

I wanted to like this and for the first few days I did. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave my face feeling oily. Sadly it started drying out my face leaving dry patches . So I had to stop using it . I also loved how it wasn't highly scented [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I already purchase Olay moisturizers for daytime and nighttime use, but after sampling the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, I will be replacing my daily moisturizer for sure! After trying the cream this morning before my makeup regime, my skin was left feeling silky soft, and my blemishes were smoothed and moisturized, diminishing their overall appearance. I highly recommend and love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I liked how this went on my face, very smoothly. Also the scent was quite pleasant. I like having a choice of whether or not to have sunscreen in a facial lotion, so it can be worn at night and not have that sun-screen scent to it. I really liked that this didn't have sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer was nice. It wasn't greasy and didn't smell bad. It absorbed well and quickly. I would have liked to have a bigger sample to use over the course of a few days do decide if I really liked it or not. I don't know if I will be purchasing it. I didn't think it was any better nor worse than what I currently use. I will make that decision after I have finished my current product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I sampled this product through PinchMe, and I must say that I am in love! I use this cream every night when I get out of the shower.

"While there was more in this sample than the other Olay sample that I got with this same box, there isn't enough to even last the 2nd week that the coupon card mentioned for results. What I had tried seemed like it would have went well had there been more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since the ad for this mentions 8 weeks to see results on dark spots, I can't tell from the amount I have which won't last that long. As a moisturizer, it's too sticky and I don't like the fell and can't wear makeup over it Many other Olay products are better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got to try this product and was surprised with the results. It was very smooth and non oily which helped with my oily skin. I finished my sample and can feel the difference already. Loved the product and can't wait to buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I do have sun spots and age spots so I was excited to try this product. I've been using sparing in hope to results - it's been a little over a week and I still see my spots...the ingredients make me wonder how great this is for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Once again a winning product from Olay! This cream made my face absolutely glow without the grease and that coated feeling other creams seem to have. the scent of this product was very nice and subtle unlike most. Another winner!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this and love that it leaves my skin feeling super moisutized and it smells great. I haven't noticed any difference in my tone but I have not been using it long enough to see any results I believe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizer. It goes on so smooth and doesn't flake when I apply makeup over it. My skin was softer after one use and after a week my skin looked healthier. I can't wait to see the results in a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product sample was in a generous enough size that I was able to use it for several days. It did seem to lessen the look of my freckles and the scent and feel on the skin were nice as well. If it had spf I would probably replace my current moisturizer with this tone correcting cream. Since I am very fair and spend a large amount of time outdoors the lack of sun protection would be a concern for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed getting to try this sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! It is very moisturizing, brightening, and also smells nice.

"As with the other Olay moisturizer that I tested, this one was a little too greasy and didn't absorb into my skin very well, However, with that being said, I really like how the product worked overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never really paid much attention to my facial moisturizer, until i tried this, my face was not oily, or dry. It felt cleaner, and I did not have to add cream to my face throughout the day like I would normally do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I truly enjoyed what I sampled of this product. The formula feels very nice, absorbs into the skin within moments without leaving any sort of greasy feeling, all with almost no scent at all. If anything, I only wish the sample were a bit bigger to be able to review the product for it's full array of capabilities - I would love to see if it can truly help in perfecting the tone of my skin.

"I absolutely love this olay cream! I spent an entire day in the sun with no sunscreen and got burned badly. I've been using this cream since and it's kept me from peeling.

"I'm generally skeptic about skin product claims, but the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream really delivers! After the first application it exfoliated my skin revealing new, polished and brighter skin. I will keep using this to help correct my acne scars and overall tone.

First time trying this product and I loved it. It worked amazing under my makeup as well! I was out the whole day in a extreme sunny day and it was on all day and didn't make me shinny. Will be purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I very much enjoy the feeling and smell of the lotion. It is a very mild scent, but lovely. The product goes on smoothly and easily absorbs without feeling greasy. I can't comment on the tone perfecting aspect of the product due to a fairly small sample size, but I would be willing to buy a larger amount to give it a try.

I have a little uneveness on my skin and thought this would help. I have been using for almost two weeks and haven't seen a difference. I didn't think that it moisturized well either.

"I like the Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream. It has a silky feel to it. It did not leave my skin greasy looking, but gave me a nice natural glow. The only thing that I didn't care for was the smell. I found it to be a bit heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this facial cream for a week and a half now. This product is so much better than my facial cream that I was using. I love the silky smooth feel of my skin after it is applied. I only have a little bit of my sample left and i will be purchasing some of this cream to replace my old stuff before my sample runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The texture of this product is unbelievable, I can't really describe how silky soft it felt on my face and fingertips. I can't say I noticed a big difference I need the way in made my skin look as compared to my usual moisturizer, but I'd buy it again just for the unique feeling! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There wasn't enough of this for me to really see if the results are as they are said to be, but the sample was nice nonetheless. It is something that I think I would benefit from after long term use, as I have seen good results from other Olay products that I use. I may purchase just to see how it works after about a month of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this stuff the first day I put it on I was a little skeptical on how it would react to my face since it's a little sensitive. It was the complete opposite my face felt so soft throughout the day with no breakouts or oil skin. The smell of the Olay tone perfection cream is great and glad it wade by a dull scent. I couldn't wait to apply it over again and purchase a full size product once the trial was out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product has a great scent it is a little on the stronger side for a moisturizer scent but it's a lovely scent none the less.

I have very dry skin with the change of seasons and the Olay Tone Perfecting cream gave me just the right amount of moisture without leaving my face oily or shiny. I would definitely recommend this product as an everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product is amazing! It feels like you just applied liquid silk on your face. It shrinks your pores and gives you this wonderful toned and dewy look. Great for no makeup days. It has this fresh out of the shower smell that's infused with a floral sent and just a dash of sweetness. Pure bliss in a tube! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The product was ok but not worth the price to me. May be because the same is not all that much so it us hard to determine if it worked for me. I do have sensitive skin and I did not notice any irratate on from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin was bright and had this lovely quality about it until I noticed the moisturizer clumping up and leaving small white balls all over my face. Then, as I washed it off later I found that my skin had broken out very severely from this product (and yes, I know it was this because I didn't wear makeup that day). Severely disappointed first with the clumpy texture of the product on the skin as well as it's breakout inducing formula. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was truly amazed at my results after just one day... I have combination/dry skin.. I generally don't wear make-up.. the skin around my cheeks, nose and neck can get extremely dry and rough feeling.. even after using my normal moisturizer those areas felt rough.. The first thing I noticed the next day was a softness on my cheeks I hadn't felt in quite a while.. That in itself got this product my vote... I plan to continue using and hope for even better results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream is AWESOME. i LOVED IT, I'm not big on face cream unless it's a mositurizer! But Olay I think just made me a FAN!

I really loved the Olay tone perfecting cream. Everything about it was better than expected. Smell was amazing. The cream went on very light and smooth like you weren't even wearing anything.

"I'll be honest, at first, I wasn't really sure I would see any changes / benefits to using this sculpting and toning lotion... I just wasn't sure there would be enough, but to my surprise and delight, after a few days I noticed a small difference. My skin seemed a bit tighter and smoother. I was impressed.... it's not often you find a product that can start making changes that quickly! Overall, I think it's a pretty good product that holds true to the toning agent that the labels boast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received two samples of different Olay products. I had never considered looking at Olay products because my Grandmother used the original pink Oil of Olay most of her life. I looked at Olay as being products for older women. I am changing my mind. Just from the samples my skin looks and feels better. As soon as I finish the jar of my current product I am replacing it with Olay. Thanks for the samples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like this product even though its a little pricey for a drugstore brand.

Definitely would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm so happy with the results my face look clear soft and my black spots have stratd to feed away . The moisturizer help me by give me the gol I need and I love the fact it not to oily just enough scent . Thank you for allowing me to sample it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has a strong fragrance, which is pleasant, but I prefer unscented facial creams. It has a nice feel on the skin and absorbs quickly. After using only a sample I cannot say if it truly perfects your skin tone or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"An excellent moisturizer for everyday use. No product will reverse the affects of aging but this cream does make your skin look and feel so much better after using it. The cost is moderate, but affordable, and well worth the investment. The younger you are, when you first start using it, will keep your skin looking years younger as you age.

After the first application of Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream my skin looked considerably more healthy and bright. After a week of applying to my face my skin looked softer and smoother I would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I tried the olay tone perfecting cream and I must say it had made my face feel wonderful at least. Unlike other creams that leave my face dry. I haven't seen a change in my skin tone but it's only been 3 days. I'll give it more time and see how it all works out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have only used the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream for a few days now, but even after the first application I could notice a positive difference in my skin tone. The product is lightweight and is not oily. It goes on very smooth and gives my skin a nice glow instantly. It also has a pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't had enough of an experience with this product to be able to say that it's as good as it claims to be or that it can in fact correct your facial tones but it is definitely something that in the future I will give it a real chance and buy the product. I don't think the amount that were given is enough to make a fair assessment but I did like it somewhat better than my regular moisturizer, so perhaps I'll be more pleased when I have a generous amount to work with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received enough of this product to use it twice a day, sparingly, for about 2 weeks. It absorbed nicely into my skin, but I did not see any noticeable change in my crow's feet or forehead lines, nor the deeper lines around my mouth. It's a nice moisturizer, but so is the Olay I've been using at a much more reasonable price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't personally use this because I thought it would be better suited for my mom. She has dark spots from too much sun exposure and I knew it would be better for her. She used it and she loved it. She liked how it wasn't oily on her skin and it really did start to make a difference of her spots. She said she's going to buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's was ok not oily it hydrated but I believe a sample is not enough to know if it's good or not because it doesn't have enough for it to have an impact. And because I don't really need it I won't be buying but when I do I might. I have no allergic reaction to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the Olay Regenerist!! This moisturizer is one of the best products i have chose to use in a few years now. The way it makes my skin so soft n glowing is just absolutely refreshing and beautiful! I never new such a simple cream could produce something so positive in my life. I love looking at my glowing skin after the simple application... Thank you Olay and Pinch Me for the introduction to this fabulous product! ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was interested in trying this because I have used Olay products on the past and been pleased with the results. This was a one time use sample which is good to see if the scent or texture will work for me but without being able to try the product for at least 7 days I am unable to determine if I would want to purchase a full size.

"It really works well lightening brown spots. I have tried so many others. But, about a month later I realized my brown spots have been reduce by 80% in color and intensity. I love this cream. It's very light weight but hydrates perfectly. I recommend it this cream and the night cream from this line to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With claims such as tone perfecting,I would have to test out a product for a while to give a more reliable review but overall this product is great.Moisturizes my skin.Will be willing to check out this product line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't really like this product at all for mainly two reasons 1. It made the skin on my face feel extremely dry and I had to go over it with another moisturizer 2. It made my skin break out and that is quite unusual for me because inhale very clear skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The sample was good and I think it has potential to be a replacement for my current brand, but I think if the sample was a bit bigger, it would have been more helpful to determine the benefits. I think you need a couple weeks worth the be able to actually see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had no idea how to feel about this product until I tried it. I must say that it definitely makes the tone of my skin a lot more even! Also, the smell is amazing! I wear this after my toner and under my makeup and it definitely makes my BB cream application look WAY more even! Definitely would recommend this product!

"This is a great feeling moisturizer! It doesn't feel greasy or heavy, just a nice smooth cream, the scent is light and refreshing almost fruity smelling. The product goes along way. The product sample was only .24 oz and has lasted over a week with twice daily use. My skin was patchy with dryness and this has evened it out, leaving it soft an smooth.

I think this is a great product. I have been using this product for three days now. My face always feels dry. After using this product my face is smooth and my skin is extra soft. It's a very light cream doesn't make your face feel greasy. Has a nice smell to it as well.

"The product was easy to apply but it was such a small amount to sample that I couldn't really see any results and not being able to really notice a difference makes me feel the product doesn't work as great. Also, in the commercial it says I believe, that it takes a week to see results and I didn't have enough to even last me till then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Since being diagnosed with cancer, I have random allergies to lots of skin care products, even ""natural"" soaps. This product was one of them, but I do have to say that it was an excellent moisturizer. I liked the feel of my skin after use. The lotion has a nice, silky texture and appealing scent. I would recommend it to anyone needing a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I highly recommend OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM. I was looking for a product that would truly help my dull complexion and this is it. I use my regular moisturizer and then apply a small amount of this cream. The results are immediate; skin tone is uniform and skin glows. Moreover, it does not affect my sensitive skin. I will definitely buy this product. Just what I was looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After about a week of applying this product religiously, I did not see any visible improvement. The packaging and fragrance of the product was appealing. The moisturizer did not make my skin feel greasy which is a plus! I can't speak about long term use of the product, however, my short time using it provided no visible improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Would have given it 5 stars if it werent for the scent. Its not a bad scent, I just can't handle certain scents due to allergies. That being said, I believe with continued use the results would show more. Instant results and long term results..good combo [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was an impressive surprise to me. I have only used the expensive face serums and moisturizers recently and this one almost left my face feeling as nice as the expensive ones. My face felt supple and soft and no shine or stickiness to it after moisturizing. It's almost as if it absorbed right in to my skin immediately, which is what I want in a moisturizer on my face.

"""I received a sample of this product for free for my honest feedback,all opinions are 100% my own,through the PINCHME.COM"" I was using my sample at night and noticed my skin was becoming a bit toner in r the areas where it is a bit uneven,I love how it is light weight on the skin with no over scent,east to apply as well as to wash in the AM:) I am going to conyinue with this product:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I was actually surprised that I would like this moisturizer than my normal moisturizer. I thought I would never find a better face cream them my usual brand. But I honestly like this cream better. So guess who'd going down to get this. Me!!! It made my face look bright and happy. My face is always super dry. This really restored the moisture back in my skin.

"This moisturizer was pretty good! It applied very smoothly and easily, however, after it absorbed into the skin it left a lot of weird flakes on my skin. If I rubbed my skin, the product would come off in flakes. Super weird. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"2 days after using this product I broke out like crazy, I know it was this product that caused it because there was only enough product in the sample to cover half my face, which is the half that broke out, I will never purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its not often that I find a moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy and greasy but is able to hydrate my skin adequately, but Olay definitely does the job. Its great for using before bed, however, I wouldn't recommend wearing it under your make up (at least not immediately after application) because it did make my foundation go on as smooth as it usually does.

I tried Olay Regenerist hoping to see a noticeable difference in my skin. I did see a difference: A difference that I didn't like. My skin ended up getting dry and flaky. But everybody's skin is different. Maybe the product works better for people who don't have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I received the product I was very excited yet hesitant and the same time... All the things it promised sound great but as a African American I know it usually isn't true. But, it proved me wrong when I noticed a difference after only TWO days. My skin was less dry and some of my unevenness was either gone or smaller. This is definitely a product I will be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I would highly recommend this product and definitely will be purchasing this product soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I generally liked this product. It went on smoothly and stayed well under my makeup. However, there was nothing particularly special about it. I don't feel it created any particular luminosity. I would buy it as a nice medium weight moisturizer, but wouldn't extoll the virtues of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"While the sample was a little small so I could not determine how lasting this will be, what I experienced was good. The product goes on nicely and feels great on the skin. I would recommend purchasing this because it does not make the skin oily, but truly does make a positive, noticeable difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say that the product was moisturizing. The texture was great. I couldn't, however tell you anything further because the overwhelming scent set off my asthma. I waited for a half hour hoping the scent would dissipate but it remained so strong that I had to go and wash it off. I'm fine with a mild scent in products. But it was very strong and to have it in a product that is used on my face literally right under and around my nose and the rest of my face it was just too much.

"I'm already a fan of Olay products, and this product is no exception. The moment I un-packaged my sample, I could feel the luxury of purchasing this item - it screams OLAY!

I love the smell and texture of the product... Unfortunately there was not nearly enough in the sample to test its claims which I find very bothersome especially in an anti aging product but my biggest issue is it pills. I HATE when a product pills.... It's like peeling money off of your face .... Not only do u waste product but u waste time applying it and money.... Really disappointed.

This product is really nice. I love the smell and feel of it. My face feels smoother but I don't think I have enough in the sample to really notice a big change in the look of my skin but maybe if I continue to use it. The down fall is the price.

when I first received the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream I was a little skeptical to use it because I tried a lot of toners and they didn't work but when I used this cream I saw a difference already in the tone so I went the next day and I use my coupon the I also received and got a bottle of it and I use it every day since thank you for letting me try this product I am excited to try many many more of olay products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like the smooth feel that this left on my skin. The cream did not dry out and made my skin feel great all day and all night. I applied in the morning after my shower and in the evening before bed.

This Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream is really good and feels really soft and silky on my skin. Wish to use it longer to write a better review .

This moisturizer cream worked pretty well. I was really happy with the size of the sample because it has allowed me to try it for several days. It goes on easily on my skin and gives it a great feel with out being too oily. It also worked well as a make up base and had a nice smell. I have noticed improvementS with the dryness of my skin. I haven't really noticed a different in my tone. I just wish that the ingredients were natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product makes a lot of claims, however, the sample size is not enough to determine whether or not it can live up to its promises. I enjoyed the texture and the light scent. I think it is perfect for spring/summer, as it is very light and not greasy. It does not have any spf, and after applying it, my dry skin was still a tad bit dry. I think it is more of a luminizer or face perfector, for me, it could not replace my day time moisturizer, but I still enjoyed using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would recommend this product to women with specific skin tone problems. It goes on smooth and easy without a strong scent (plus points for that!) i didnt really see any difference with the small sample i got( better to get a 10 day sample to get a better result). I dont really have a skin tone problem but recommend olay skin care products because i use other onea and they are just as good or better then high end brands.

I was really surprised that I liked this product since I have somewhat sensitive skin. I loved the way it feels going on-almost like a primer to my foundation.

This sample size was a little bit larger, so I was able to use quite a few applications, but either I didn't use enough, in which case the sample size was too small to give any results, or it didn't work, period. I would give it 0 stars if the rating system allowed that, and I'm especially glad that I didn't have to spend any money on this stuff because it was just an absolute waste for me.

"I have been an Olay consumer for about 5years now. I have always been pleased by Olay quality. The luminous felt good when applying and gave my face a nice matte glow.I have oily acne prone skin which is a decent moisturizer but it doesn't prevent lines, wrinkles and crows feet. I washed my face like normal, it burned a little when I applied it to a pimple. But overall I have only positive reactions for oil of Olay reginerist luminous.

Ive used Olay before but it was the other type of cream and this is my first using the Luminous cream which i got as a free sample.

I love the scent and it is a light coverage that is really pleasant. It is not oily or heavy in any way but makes your skin feel soft and refreshing. It does feel like it tones and firms but not in an overpowering way. My daughter mentioned how good it smells when she hugged me so definitely impressed with the scent.

This is only my first time using it so I am not sure how well it works, but, based on Olay's reputation, I can imagine it will be a great product and I'll need to buy more.

I was really excited to try this because I have an uneven skin tone. I put it on at night and liked that it smelled nice. I woke up in the morning and my face felt soft and smooth. Later in the day I noticed I was breaking out in areas I never have before so I did not try it again after that for fear of breaking out more. But it seems like a great product that makes your skin feel great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product could potentially benefit someone that required tone correcting cream, however due to my personal hormonal skin problems I didn't see a difference and the sample size was enough to last about a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way it goes on my face it is non greasey I like the way it goes into my skin it feels like I haven't anything on my face I like that my skin just drinks it in it feels smooth afterwards it us light weight [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so in love with this free sample I got from bzzagent! The product is smooth and creamy. It's not oily or greasy at all, my sometimes acne prone skin sucks it up so quickly but has not caused any breakouts. I have been using it for about a week and notice that my skin tone is more even. I wash my face and apply the product once my face is dry and then apply foundation! #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"My current moisturizer has sunblock, I don't know if this one does but I would use this one for night because it smell s great and I would wake up with a glow. I feels nice on my skin and doesn't clog my pores or make me oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This cream was nice and lasts a long time but it made my skin peel.. I'm not sure if my skin was just dry or if the oroduct is supposed to do that. It goes on better after you exfoliate.. Still would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I liked my old cream but I Love Olay Tone Cream. I have already changed for the new. It feels great on my skin and very refreshing on my skin and thats very important to me. I have already talked to my friends about Olay Regenerist and recommended it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Oh my gosh!!! This olay tone perfecting cream moisturizer is fanastic. I opened the lid it has a wonderful fragrance. I applied it to my cheejs it felt like satin on my face. It felt refreshing clean and made my wrinkles around my eyes less noticeable. I will be purchasing this as a routine virtual before i go to bed or applied under my make up. Thank You for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The sample I received came in a small tube and was enough for 4-5 applications. I like the fact that this product moisturizes but does not make my face look shiny or greasy. This is important to me because I have oily skin and I have this issue with a lot of other brands of moisturizers. overall I think this would make a great morning moisturizer especially if the added an SPF!

I think that the Olay Tone Perfector is a great product. The smell is very fresh and it absorbs into skin very nicely. It reminds me of a primer. Pores appear dimished and makeup goes on flawlessly over it. No oily residue! If the price is right I will definitely buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The Olay Perfecting Cream is amazing. If you looking for a correcting cream that isn't greasy or thick on the face, Olay Perfecting Cream is the one, I don't normally moisturize my face when I'm done washing it, because I have oily skin, but this cream made me reconsider it. I love the consistency and texture, when applied correctly. This product deserves a round of applause!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think this product is good but not great. It did make my face skin feel very nice but I did not think it was that much better then the Olay product I now use. Went to see how much it was & I know I would not pay the price for this product. Like I said it is good but not great so the price is not worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I diffidently have really dark under-eye so I've been using this product for that. The best part about this product is that its not greasy at all like other face creams and not only does it smooths skin it also tones the face. All I have to say is that I'll be buying more from this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really can not give a good review of this product, The sample was too small and did not even have enough to cover my entire face and neck. I CAN say that I liked the way the section of my face that received the application felt afterward. It had a very light and pleasant smell.I don't need this product so would not buy it for that reason, and can not recommend it because I don't know if it works or not [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this! And I didn't expect to. I usually don't use products like this but I did for the sake of this review. I am so happy I did! It has cleared up some dark patches and left my skin looking flawless. It is lightweight and doesn't require a lot of application. I will definitely buy this again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

These past few months I've been battling dry, flaky skin, but when I used the tone perfecting cream, my skin was evenly moisturized and supple.

I still love Loreal, but I think I will start switching back and forth between the two now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how it leaves my skin feeling soft and silky without being greasy or heavy. I was surprised how well it moisturized while feeling so light and airy. I usually don't use facial products that have dyes or fragrances but this cream has a light floral scent that didn't irritate my sensitive, acne prone skin.

I felt that this cream made my whole skin smoother and just evened out my skin tone with my dark circles The smell is so wonderful and everything about this product was great I will be purchasing with the coupon and for some reason I feel like it helped remove some of my stubborn acne I don't have a lot but just a few little bumps [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only used this product for a few days but already I think the skin under my eyes is lightening and toning up. The fine lines around my eyes seem to be diminishing too. I will definitely be buying this to try it for a longer period of time. The only negative comments would be that it is scented although it's a light, pleasant scent. It also doesn't heavily moisturizer and it doesn't have an spf so I might still add my normal moisturizer over it and use it more like a serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok.. I LOVED this product... Amazing.. I loved how it made my skin feel after just the trial sample.. I went out the next day after work and bought it.. I normally if very wary of trying new things on my face due to allergic reactions, BUT this was amazing, it left my faceso soft and supple.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My experience with this cream was pleasant. I liked the silky and smooth feeling it gave my skin. I used it on my neck and face.It made my skin glow ! I highly recommend it to anyone who has really dry skin. I couldn't see the effects of the toning components but I only had a small sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great moisturizer! I tend to have sensative skin and this product did not cause any issues. The initial scent of the product is very appealing. The cream itself is on the thicker side and applies easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I absolutely love this Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. I washed my face with just warm water and let it air dry. Once my face was dry I used the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream and it made my skin so soft and smooth! I wish the sample was a little bigger though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Okay does it a again. I mean I love there products especially with my sensitive skin. This cream felt and smelled great going on my skin but after a couple hours my skin looked great. More evenly toned skin. And my face appeared to look younger or luminous as they state lol. I was so impressed I actually went to buy it. I swear to you this is a must have. Thanks Olay and PinchMe for the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff rocks! I have pretty difficult skin so to find a tone perfecting cream that actually helps has been beyond amazing. I'm actually looking my age (23) and not 10 - 15 years older! I'll definitely be making this a part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this product is great because it's for anyone who wants to look younger. I usually don't know what to apply to my face after washing it so I use lotion.

"I do have high expectations of Olay products I will admit. But I didn't see a noticeable difference in luminosity, which is what the name of the product made me expect.

I believe the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer really did improve the appearance of my face. It absorbed quickly and felt light weight.

"I will say I love how it feels on your face & it smells good. I actually use this whole line-- minus this sample. I just chose the oil instead to go with moisturizer. I like this line but honestly I cannot tell a difference w the 8 weeks of use. It keeps my face moisturized properly, but that's about it. If I didn't use this Olay line I don't think I could even review it since there is maybe enough for two or three applications... No one would see a difference without at least 7 days.

"I will be replacing my current moisturizer with this. After my first time using it my face felt so much softer. After a week i noticed a more even skin tone. I love using Olay because of the amazing smell of all their products! My favorite thing is to use this 5 minutes before applying my makeup. My makeup goes on easier, lasts longer and looks great on my hydrated face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like the Olay tone perfecting cream. I have been using it along with my Olay regenerist sculpting cream and I think I'm noticing a slight difference.

"Overall I liked the cream. It had a nice scent and absorbed into my skin fairly quickly. However, it has no sunscreen, so I wouldn't use it for day and after trying one day decided to use it as a night cream instead. My skin felt smooth and not greasy the next morning. I didn't really notice any brightening as it was supposed to, but I don't mind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this tone perfecting cream. I feel like it moisturizes my face without being too oily.

"First, I'd like to thank Pinchme.com and Olay for the free sample of Olay tone perfecting cream. The product smelled amazing, not too strong and over powering and not too light which was amazing as I'm not a fan of strong scents. The feel of the product was great as well it wasn't runny or greasy. Also, I have really sensitive skin and this product did not make me breakout, rash out and/ or itch which was also amazing.

"I did not like this product at all. I just did not like the smell, I couldn't stand it and had to wash my face to rid of the smell. It was also greasy on my skin and it felt weighed down, I like light products that I can't feel on my skin, especially a moisturizer after Ive just washed my face, I don't want something that's going to make it feel clogged and dirty.

"I really enjoyed trying out this product! I applied it to my face night and day for a couple of days and I must say it made my skin feel very soft and healthy. Very moisturizing, it didn't feel heavy nor did it clog my pores. The consistency of it wasn't too thick or too thin. One thing I really liked is that it had a pleasant smell, something most creams I've previously used didn't have. I would like to know how others felt about this cream. It is something I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think this is a good product. It glides on smoothly, has a pleasant smell and was absorbed quickly. It didn't leave my skin needing more, it wasn't to much, and it wasn't greasy. I would definitely purchase this product to see what the long term effects on my skin would be. The sample size is the only reason I had to give it 4/5. It just wasn't enough to see any long term benefit. I must say though that the short term benefits were great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was a bit nervous to try this product because I have very sensitive skin, however after a few uses (both day and night) I've yet to have any problems! It leaves skin very soft to the touch and smells great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If you are looking for a moisturizer to help improve your skins troubles spots then this is the moisturizer for you. My skin s tone has greatly improved since using this product. Awesome feel and scent too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really didn't like the feel of it going on to my face it I thought it would have a creamy feel to it, it just felt really chalky as I was trying to put it on. Probably wouldn't purchase this item for my self [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really love this cream! I have been using it on my face the past few days and really like how well it moisturizes my skin. I have naturally pretty dry skin, so I have to moisturize daily. This cream really blended in well and did not leave a greasy feeling on my skin at all! It wasn't watery or too thick. It had such a nice consistency to it. My only wish is that I could have it in a bigger bottle- I will be sure to get a refill at the store once my tube is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like that moisturizer but I feel like my skin is getting clogged up. At the end of the day there is a lot of oil visible in my forehead and nose. Nit recomanded for people with oily or moxed skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did not notice a difference in the color of my age/sun spots . Olay is a brand I do use but this was my first try of the tone perfecting cream. I do not plan to by this product because I did not notice in difference in my skin after I used . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that I need to use it for a longer amount of time for the results to show as advertised. I have some improvement in skin tone, but the luminosity was almost immediate. I will probably buy more to see if there is a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the scent and feel of the product. It only takes a small amount to cover the entire face. I have a skin condition though and have a prescription cream that I use. If it weren't for that I would use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of this cream! My face feels so soft- it's like powder. I like the scent as well and I'm very picky about scent in the products I use. This one is mild and pleasant. I have to use it sparingly and mostly around my eyes, because it causes my skin to break out. But I'm super sensitive. Everything causes my skin to break out. This one is better than most. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product went on smoothly which is always preferred but I tried it for 1 week and my skin became very dry and flaky. I tend to have sensitive skin but not all products I have tried caused that reaction. This product may work for others with less sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is nothing short of amazing. Great for women of color. I included this moisturizer in my daily routine regimen and it didn't take long to see the benefits. This moisturizer left my skin soft and radiant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I would've given an honest review if I had more samples. It was a tiny pack or tiny bottle that was only used once. I would say my face felt soft. Maybe if I had more I gave more detailed information. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to see that the sample was bigger and I was able more to use it more than just once. It smelled nice in the tube, but I didnt really care for the smell once I put it on. It makes my skin feel super smooth and it make my skin kind of glowy. I would love to see if it really does help fade dark spots, and sun spots because I have a lot and I'm only 28. Overall, seems like a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a sample in a pinch me box. I love the smell and the pink undertone that the cream has to it. It's also very moisturizing and somehow makes my skin look as if it is lit from within. I love the Natural Glow and the moisturizing aspect and as a bonus it also works amazing as a primer I'm not sure why maybe because of how it absorbs into your skin which is also amazing. Absolutely love this product and have already purchased a full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is a bit heavy for the consumer with combination skin. I was shiny on the places of my face that are normally dry. The fragrant was subtle and that's the best I can say in regards to the ""positives"" of this product. What was so disappointing is that I saw no change in my skin appearance after two weeks of usage. The claims of ""luminous"" skin and skin perfecting benefit were not evident in my use. This at best is a decent moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"i tried the olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream, at first i was like i like this. but about 5 mins later my face was red. like i had rash. i thought maybe i just rubbed my face to hard. well when i applyed the cream again at night my face got even redder. i wasnt happy with the product. thinking i might be allergic or just had a bad reaction to the cream. so i wont be buying olay regenrist luminous tone perferctin cream and time soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this sample and it felt nice on my skin, was easy to apply and not greasy feeling. The sample was a one time use but I did like it but am unsure how it would do long term. It absorbed quickly and had a pleasant smell. I would try it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very dry skin and most moisturizers don't do my skin justice. So after using this cream my face felt extremely moisturizered and soft. All the day dryness had went away and it lasted through the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The moisturizer made my face feel smooth and silky. The moisturizer I have used in the past made my face feel sticky afterwards. The OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM worked perfectly with my skin. I will defiantly use often. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream works as it's name suggests. I have no complaints about this product and I'm happy to have experienced it as a sample. I'll continue to use this brand because it has left my skin in better condition than it was before I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had high hopes for this product. I do not have sensitive and have never had such a horrible reaction. I put it on my face instead of my normal moisturizer. It made my face peel and turn red. There were no changes in routine besides swapping moisturizers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM Went on smoothly and didn't leave a blotchy feel on my face, especially under my eyes! I currently tried this product with my daily olay moisturizer and they worked great!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of the product. It works! After using it over the weekend, when I returned to work, my colleagues remarked that I must have had a great weekend because I looked so rested and fresh. I had been incredibly busy and got little sleep, little did they know, it was just the moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel like there wasn't enough in the package to see much of a difference in my skin to know whether the product works or not. i did like the feel it gave my skin but there wasn't enough for more than a one day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product. It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue. Just like the description on the product says it has a very subtle pearly sheen that leaves your skin looking dewey and glowing. Definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the way it felt when applying (spreads very easily) and the feel on my skin but I wasn't a fan of the long lasting scent. When it come to facial products my nose is very sensitive to strong smells. Other than that good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never bought Olay products because they were so expensive. Thanks to PinchMe and their samples, I was able to try Olay for free. Once I tried this product, I was hooked! I have taught myself how to coupon for Olay and now, I get Olay products for little to nothing. Thanks PinchMe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I tried what I had, I used it for 2 days and it made my skin soft and it smells great. I can't say I saw a difference in my skin for only using it for 2 days but I have purchased Olay products before that I love. I do recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I never knew a moisturizer could be this light and moisturizes your skin so well. It feels silky on your skin and goes on smoothly. It also smells amazing! I definitely see my self purchasing the full sized bottle. I do recommend this to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. A little does go a long way.

My skin is combination skin this product didn't make my skin feel too oily certainly helped in the dry patch areas of my face and went on nice. I don't think my skin is very uneven but there are a few areas that could use some smoothing I'll post a better review after I use it a bit more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product every morning and I can say I do see a difference with my face. It seems to keep it hydrated and it doesn't seem as dry as it has been.

"I was skeptical at first to try the tone perfecting cream from Olay. I am 30 and never thought about face creams, I have changed my mind! This product left my face so soft to the touch, and it toned just where I needed it to, it defined the apples of my cheeks, I never noticed how they drooped, after trying ONE time I noticed a big difference in my complexion, my husband also noticed! One more positive it smells great as well, doesn't smell like your ""grandmother's face cream"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Olay has been the leading cosmetic company in facial health, and anti-aging for years, being able to sample a brand with a good history of making products for women, makes you feel like you could trust it a little better, than something new.

This product smells amazing and has a nice creamy texture but I had an immediate reaction to it. I rarely get acne and I ended up with patches on my face a few hours after using this product.

As the sun rays get stronger, my face sometimes gets sun spots and this lotion, though only stretched the sample for a week,really made a difference in the darkness of the spots.

Skin also feels noticeably smoother immediately after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great product as with all Olay. Amazing results with only one use. I think this is a must have for women. After first use my face felt soft and glowed. I will definitely buy this again as it proved itself worthy. I liked that it is not oily and goes on smoothly. Definitely a top product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The moisturizer overall made my skin feel very soft, which I loved! What I would recommend is for a little more product to be able to see the results for a full week. I would also recommend to change the scent to something more appealing because the first thing we as consuners do is smell the product we are considering purchasing.

I would like to say this is a wonderful product. I only was able to use it twice with such a small sample but I loved how it made my skin look after I used it. Much brighter and smoother.

I did enjoy the smell and feel of the product, however my skin tone was NOT improved and causing it to break out made my skin tone even worse. I also noticed dry skin patches popping up. So this product was definitely not for me. I wanted to like it, especially because I have melasma. But this is not a winner. Thumbs up for the scent. Thumbs down for everything else, including the use of dimethicone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It worked fine as a moisturizer and the sample size was great and allowed me to test it out. I tried it give it at least 3 stars but the image would not allow it.

"I think this is a great product to possibly add to my skin regiment. I have been on a mission for the past few months to even out my skin tone. I use this product after my nightly face wash and toner application. I love that this product isn't heavy or overly scented. It leaves my skin hydrated but not oily. I think I will give it the advertised 8 weeks and see what kind of results I get. For now it's too early to tell, but so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This moisturizer has a nice non-greasy feel but doesn't really seem to have a high level of moisturizing ability. Because I would consider it a lighter moisturizer, I think there are other less expensive products that would work just as well.

I thought that this product will totally work on my skin because I never react to faucial products but this time I did and I was a bit disappointed. I'm not allergic to anything but I'm not really sure why this happened so I had to stop using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked it very much, light scent, my face did not feel oily with it. A little covers a lot. Although I do not yet notice the glow it offers, it did make me quite pimpily. Very tiny ones all over my chin and nose. On a plus, my skin has not felt this smooth ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed my sample, just wish I had more of it to test longer. But I love Olay and have used their products for many, many years and hope to purchase this one soon. I loved the feel and scent! Good job, as always, Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is super lightweight but still moisturizing! It gives you instant radiance. Although I haven't been using it long enough to attest to its long term effects, it definitely gave my skin a glow without making it feel greasy. I would definitely recommend. You'll definitely have a good skin day using this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I didn't really notice much of a difference with this product. It seemed to be a decent product but there wasn't much change in the moisture of my face (I have good skin anyways so I didn't really know if it would matter) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the fruity smell of this lotion and the way it felt so velvety when I put it on my face. I'm not sure about tone correcting? I don't think there is enough of the product to really see a difference in my tone. but I will definitely buy this product next time I go to store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using this product everyday for a week now and so far it has kept my skin moisturized but not oily. I already have oily skin so I only use just a dot of this stuff in certain areas on my face, for example, under my eyes, nose, and chin. These are my problem areas so after I wash my face in the morning and evenings, I apply a little in each area and my skin gets softer and smoother in those areas. Time will only tell if this product will hold up but so far I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was excited to try ""Olay Regenerist"" I'm 54 years old and suddenly my skin has started ageing and fast. Lol So I've been trying to find skin products to help out! I've tried things that make my skin feel like a ton of goop is on it or feels so oily that it feels like its running off my face. Lol When I tried REGENERIST I WAS VERY HAPPY!! No greasy feeling, no break outs etc. It does what it says. My skin feels smooth and we'll see about the wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this sample, but it wasn't something that was super exceptional. It make my skin feel good and was easy to apply, but it was pretty much the same quality as my current product so I don't have much of a need for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ultimately, this product left me unsatisfied. I currently use Olay products, so I was very excited to try this. The smell is great, and I love the feeling of my skin afterwards, but it was not moisturizing at all. I ended up having to mix it with my current Olay moisturizer, and was fearful of too many products on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved this product OMG I have dry skin but after I apply this product on my face it instantly felt 1000 times better and looked better too my face was soft, smooth and radiant I loved it so much I already purchased the product in full size also I invested in other Olay products.

Who says 46 is old? Especially with products as great as Olay Regenerist Luminous cream it goes on smooth without a toxic smell. After a little over a week I could tell such a major difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how my face feels after using this cream. Right after applying it, my face feels so smooth and soft. Usually my regular face lotion only lasts a few hours and then my face feels dry again, this one lasted all day. I was very impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely love the results of using this lotion even just a few times, It does make a difference. My only criticism was the perfumey smell was a little strong for just facial cream, however the end result was fabulous! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product smelled terrific when I applied it to be freshly washed and dried face. I felt a tingling sensation and I thought that meant it was working. The next morning I woke up and my acne had gotten worse and my skin was red. This product does not work for my skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the cream has a great feel and scent, but I don't like that it doesn't rub all the way into the skin. It seems to have a slight bronzer tint and if that is the case then it's more like makeup than correcting the dark spots. I hope all of Olays products aren't just a camouflage for real correction treatment. Maybe I need to have a larger sample to truly see how effective it is over a month or so period of time.

"I loved the scent and feel of this moisturizer. It felt very smooth going on, and did not leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. I used it a couple times in place of my morning moisturizer, and a couple times before bed. I am not likely to use it as a daytime moisturizer, as it does not contain sunscreen. I'm not sure if I experienced any tone-perfecting benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this product. It was nice to be able to sample it before purchasing since the product itself is a bit pricy. But it made my skin look and feel great. I definitely plan to purchase more in the near future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am out gardening a lot and have had blotches from the sun in my face. After using this product I feel that my skin is almost normal again. The spots are almost totally gone! I also have sensitive skin and it didn't irritate it at all. I am buying this for gifts for my fellow gardening family members. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
One issue I have with most moisturizers is the scent being to powerful. I no longer noticed the scent with in 10 minutes of putting it on and noone told my they liked my perfume (I do not ware any) when hugging me like I experience with my current lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed this sample as it seemed to give my face a slight glow. It didn't seem to moisturize as well as my current moisturizer as my face felt slightly drier. I broke out a little bit when I started using this, not sure if it was something else or this product effected my skin so I am slightly hesitant to purchase this.

"I was really excited to try this product because I have some dark spots from old acne, but my skin unfortunately didn't like it. The first day I used it I had a rash along my jaw line and lips. The second day I used it my eyes were puffy. I guess my skin is too sensitive or theres an ingrediant I'm alergic to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I have been using it for the past three nights... I have an uneven skin tone with red cheeks... So far I haven't seen too much of a difference. The pros: it doesn't cause further irratatation. Light smell Not greasy not he skin Cons: haven't seen much of a difference though it has only been 3 days. Will continue to use to see if there becomes a difference. Fingers crossed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this product goes on smoothly and has a pleasant scent. I only tried the product for a couple of days and haven't notice any changes in my skin tone yet. I like the fact that the product does not leave any residue or white streaks on my skin. I do which maybe the cream was a little bit thicker. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I feel in love the instant after I applied it to my face. Softening and very light. I raved so much about it my boyfriend applied it to his face after shaving and was amazed as well.

"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream feels good after you put it on. My skin felt soft and nice. I didn't see any visible results after using it for a week. Instead, I broke out in acne really bad. It cleared up slightly towards the end of the sample, but I have all these red bumps on my face now that need to heal. The moisturizer smells great and feel great, but it causes acne. I won't be buying it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer, the sample was to small to really notice a change. But the smell and feel are wonderful. I was a little nervous when I first applied the product cause it had a greasy feel, but it dried without the greasy feel. My skin was left feeling so soft.

"I have never liked putting lotion or cream on my face because I felt it made my face oily, but this cream makes me change my mind! I use it every morning when I get up, and before I go to bed, and I have noticed a change in my complexion. It's very light on the skin, it moisturizes my skin without giving me the oily feel, and it smells great also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Love the creamy texture. Very lightweight. Your pores don't feel clogged. Gives a nice healthy glow throughout the day.

"The sample came in a tiny tube, and I was able to get multiple applications out of it by testing it on my under eye area. There was definitely a bit of a brightening effect from using it, but nothing dramatic with the few applications the sample gave me. Id like to try it out in the long run and see what the results would be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the sample of the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. It went on smooth and had a pleasant smell. My combination skin felt moisturized all day. The only thing I wish is that the cream also had sun protection. I'm busy in the morning so I like things that have a dual purpose. Less time in the getting myself ready would be nice.But overall I like the quality, texture, smell and effectiveness of this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"What a name, I like the feel of said cream, I have so many allergies and the one thing I can count on is not having a reaction with Olay, I have used some of these products for a long time and have always liked them, they are within my budget, evidently according to other people have worked really well.

"I think that Olay will always be great with moisturizing creams.The tone preferctor was absolutely wonderful when using after washing my face for a fresh moisturized feeling.I know that it is a toning cream but I didn't see any difference in my skin with toning correction maybe because I had a really small sample size.Yes,I will be purchasing this product in the future.

"I need a heavier moisturizer and this one does not cut it for me. It's a very light lotion, which is nice, but it's light when it works on your skin. Some days, I felt like I needed to put on 3 coats of moisturizer, which can sometimes clog your pores. Otherwise, if you need a lighter lotion, this may be a good option for you.

"Application of this cream is very nice. It goes on smoothly, not pulling or tugging at your skin. I also like the subtle scent. Very nice. However, I won't purchase it at this time because after sampling it, I never noticed a difference in the appearance of my tone/skin. Perhaps at this point of my life, I don't need a product like this? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the sample, and it makes my skin real soft and brightens it up. My skin tone is whacked out in spring and summer b/c the weather gets hotter, and I am fair skinned, so all my face does is turn red. I really cant say if it evened out my skin tone. It does make my face feel soft and looks brighter, so I would buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've used olay facial moisturizer for years, however for some reason this product of olays made my cheeks pink.

I thought that this product was overall good. It was a pretty thick moisturizer and it did have a light scent. It kept my skin moisturized and worked well under my makeup.

"I like the consistency, scent and feel of the product. But once blended skin feels matte so it is great for my oily skin as day time moisturizer but I like more hydrating moisturizer for night time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually don't use tone perfecting creams. However, I really like the brand Olay. Therefore, this would be one of the first one I have tried. I'm very content with this product it definitely leaves a luminous tone and results are very noticiable! My Husband Wears A Hard Hat All Day So He Has A Line At The Top Of His Head Due To The Hat He Let Me Put Some Of The Sample On His Face also [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I liked the smell of the cream and felt it went on smoothly. I used it for only 1 week as that is all I had in the sample I received and didn't really notice any difference in the appearance of my dark spots. It did, however, leave my skin feeling smooth.

I don't ever use stuff on my skin beacuse of the fear of money wasted and false hopes. Of buy the olay toning cream beacuse I saw results in one days use! Not only did I feel like I had the glow I should and made my sub spots on my nose less visible. even my husband noticed it too.i just applied it after washing my face in the morning and like lotion let it dry and sink in. Went about my normal routine.Made me feel more confident in my natural skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTingrid. Cream will be a great addition to my beauty routine. This smell and the texture of this cre was fantastic . It was light, it smelled good, it didn't feel heavy on my skin my skin absorbed it quickly. I highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Upon opening the product, the first thing I did was smell it (I'm a sucker for good scents) and I loved it! It's not too overpowering and has what I consider being a classic Olay type scent (I hope that makes sense... I've used Olay products in the past that smell almost exactly the same!). It feels silky and goes on smoothly. The product absorbs quickly. My face feels amazing after putting it on!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There was nothing wrong with this moisturizer but I personally didn't care for the texture or how my skin felt after applying. It wasn't moisturizing enough for me and it almost felt a little chalky to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the product, but was unable to see much of a result due to the small amount that was sampled. I would purchase this just to see if it does what it promised. It feels nice on the skin and no funny aroma . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved this product. The soft and silkiness of this product on my face was exceptional. I actually cannot wait to go purchase this product as it will surely be one of the staples in my beauty care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how soft and creamy it feels but I don't like that it's greasy. It smells good however I don't like strong scents in my facial creams. I'm not seeing any positive visual results in fact I think it may be the cause of extra redness and blemish on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It would take daily use and more product to give a true review. I did like the feel of the product and the scent. My skin felt nice after using it. I have always liked the quality of Olay products and I'm sure this cream would give great results after prolonged use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This facemail cream left my skin feeling oily and greasy, mind you I don't have olio or greasy skin normal as to why moisturizer for my dry skin is a must but I don't want to be left with a greasy residue on my face of all places . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think only regenerist lotion makes my skin feel much better and better than it did before. You should no that it makes your skin much softer and clear. I've always had problems when I go in the sun so my skin would turn dark so using this makes my skin start looking better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have never tried any Olay's products before thought they are just OTC products. But after trying this Regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream, it gives me a complete different thought on Olay's product. I am considering to start switching to Olay's now :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There wasn't enough for the full 2 weeks to see the results it says on the labeling but it was a nice size sample for a couple day use. I would be definitely buying some of this to put in my bathroom to use. It has a nice smelling scent that I enjoy. It made my face appear healthier looking and more vibrant. Overall I really enjoyed this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After a couple days of use, I began noticing a difference in my face. It began feeling smooth and I think I saw evening in my skin color. The sample was too small for me to have a final say. But it is a great product if you want smooth skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this in lieu of my normal morning moisturizer to try it out. The first thing I noticed is that the smell was pleasant; although mild as to not overpower. Applied creme to my face and it was smooth and silky going on. Didn't feel heavy but also felt as if it was actually putting a protective moisturizing layer on my face. Still feels nice 6 hours later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this brand in the past, (not this product) Liked the way my skin felt after using. Wished I could have had a few days worth. As I get older my face feels rough. For the time I used this product my face felt wonderful. I do intend to buy soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I am happy with Olay tone perfecting cream. I like the way it feels on my skin and the scent is pleasant! I cannot give this a full 5 star review yet as I have not used it long enough. I am hopeful that it will lighten my dark spots so I want to keep using it for the full eight weeks to see how it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Hey ladies, when your husband even notices that your skin looks better, you know that the product is working. I didn't even tell him that I was going to try it and used it as part of my nightly routine and my skin is looking better than it ever has. I especially love that there is little to no scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
olay regenerist is the best moisturizer i have ever tried. this product really gets to the point of giving you the best moisture for your skin that i have ever seen before. i will continue to use this product and i will be recommending this to everyone that i come in contact with THANKS SO MUCH OLAY [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sample was a bit bigger but I feel still is not enough to do a proper evaluation. As it takes about a good week or two to see many changes and the sample was about 3 days worth of product. Olay always has a good product, I will buy it as I trust Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product makes a good claim, however, it's hard to make an educated guess as to how the product will work long term. There is just not enough in a sample to say one way or the other. The texture was nice, but pretty much all creams on the market look and feel the same. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product if you don't mind the chemicals inside. I prefer a more natural moisturizer, I use pure argon oil. Have no desire to change products but I did like the feel of the olay and I liked the scent. Didn't use it long enough to see any anti-aging benifits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really sensitive skin, so finding a moisturizer that doesn't leave me broken out, dry, or irritated is very important. In addition to this, I'm also looking for a product that can help my aging skin retain a youthful appearance and give it a ""glow"". After a few uses (which, let's be honest here, is all you get from a sample size), I did start to see some result but the sample size is too small to give a definitive answer as to if it really does all it claims to.

"This is my first time using any type of Olay product! I opened the container and first I have to say it smells wonderful!! I love the smell! Also, I noticed that a little goes a very long way. After putting the toning cream on my face and neck I noticed that both my face and neck were very soft and didn't feel or look greasy at all! I will definitely be using this again!!

"I was really excited to try Olay's tone perfecting cream because Olay has always been touted as a great brand.The cream itself smells amazing, but when I apply it to my face it makes my skin feel sticky right after application, and then it feels like there's a film over it, which I don't like very much.The positive of the cream is its scent and that little amount can cover the entire face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used and really liked many Olay products in the past. This one left me a little dissatisfied. I used the usual amount that I would use and my skin still felt very dry. I would not recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting moisturizer. I have oily skin, so I normally stay away from moisturizer, but this one is great!

I haven't been seeing any tone perfecting yet but that might been cause I haven't used it as long as months. It says its also suppose to be moisturizing but I face didn't feel as moisturize when using it so I used it in addition to another face lotion I used. It did give my skin a bit of a matte finish but still not that moisturizing. It did smell nice I must admit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I can't stop touching my face this crème gives the softness and radiance we all want in our moisturizer. This crème enhances the beauty we already possess . I recommend this to everyone who wants to feel beautiful without all the extras on our face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
In general I like Olay products. This one had a good texture but the scent was really off. It did not smell nice to me at all and to put something that I don't like the smell of on my face isn't going to work. So while this product was not for me it wasn't necessarily a bad product - texture was good and my face felt soft after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was so glad to be able to test this tone cream from Olay. I was pleased with how it was packaged and sent to me. I would of love for it to be a bigger sample though there is not nearly enough in the testing kit. I love it and will definitely buy it in the near future. The appearance and feel it gives to my skin is pretty amazing. I also do not mind how it smells. I would definitely recommend Olays Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream to my friends.

"I'm on the fence on this one. I love the feel of it, it makes my skin so silky and look fresh. On the down side, the smell is kind of strong. I'm going to pick a small bottle of this up and use it for a few weeks to see if I like it and go from there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I liked this product, it smelled nice and fresh and left my skin feeling soft. It would of been nice to receive a bigger tester since it claims better ""glowing"" skin in 2 weeks but there's not much product so I can't really say it actually does what it says it does.

i used this right after i got out the shower it made my face feel lets see how you would say this i have really dry skin and this gave it the moutire it needed felt refreshing i would definetly recommend this to all my friends i love it im so glad i got to try it thanks pinchme [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product in exchange for a review. The sample was small and I didn't really see that much of a difference to really say if it works for me or not. It would be unfair to say that it did or didn't work. As of right now, I have not seen a difference. The smell was pleasant and not overpowering like some can be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The sample size for trial was adequate for about 5 days of treatment. The lotion was light and easy to apply. I didn't see any brightening benefits to my face after its use but I think the info card that came with the product indicated it took 2 weeks to begin to see ""youthful skin"" & obviously the sample size was not large enough for that. I've had good results with Olay products in the past but this left me feeling underwhelmed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I had break outs due to the product. It also left a residue on the skin. It would bead up if I rubbed my skin at all. I would not recommend this to anyone.

"My skin looks way better then it did before, I have more of an even tone and have even noticed dark spots less and less.

"I was very pleased with this product. The texture of this product was very light and creamy, almost like silk. My face felt so soft. Did not clog my pores, like some others I have used in the past.

"The Olay tone perfecting cream has a nice smell and texture. It is lightweight and goes on smoothly. The claim is that you will have ""pearlescent, glowing skin in 2 week"". I can't confirm or deny the claim since the sample was too small for 2 weeks worth of use but my skin was definitely more moisturized. I would try this again but I would not replace my regular moisturizer with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never been dissappointed in anything I have ever used from Olay.I love the gentleness of this product & the way it just melts right into your skin. The scent is heavenly. A definate winner!!

I have always loved the Olay line of products. You can't beat the quality! The only thing that stops me from buying them on a regular basis is the price.

This cream goes on very well and absorbed quickly. I used this after another product that dries my skin a bit (Hyaluronic acid) and they both seemed to work better together than just the acid. The perfecting cream seems to add a glow to my skin that I haven't seen in years. I will certainly purchase this product. and have recommended it to a few friends already. The scent is pleasant and the cream feels very rich and decadent . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The feel of skin after application is awesome. It's a silky smooth. It even feels great on the fingers used to apply to the face.

"I love this product. Not only did it correct the tone around my nose and under eyes, but it smells so dang good. My neck felt softer and lines less visible too. I know its not a wrinkle reducer or minimizer but it worked that way for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the perfecting cream for a few days. The feel and smell of the cream were great. I did not notice a difference in my skin but given that i only tried the cream for a few days I cant say whether or not it does long term what it says it will do. I unfortunately did have to stop using it because my skin was irritated by an ingredient in the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ever since I received this product in the mail, I've been using it everyday. I love how it feels when applying it, it's not to oily and it goes on smoothly. I will continue to use the sample and most likely purchase it after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product so much! After 1 week of use I can clearly see a difference in face overall. I will for sure be buying this and replacing my other moisturizers for this one. I am one happy customer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I could tell that I loved this product from the second I put it on. It has a light feel and it just melts into your skin. After I put it on, my skin felt even lighter than it was before (which I don't know how that is possible). Over all, I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"To be honest I liked the regular Olay Regenerist compared to this one. It didn't give me as much help in the area of fin lines and wrinkles versus the other. I would by it,, it gave face a health. glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really did like this cream but after reading the ingredients it turned me off. I don't want to purchase any product. If they can palmoi make it without this ingredient I'm buying it in a heart beat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really loved this tone perfecting cream! I put it on my face and neck after cleansing before bed for 3 nights. Each morning I woke up with an even skin tone. My skin was plump, moisturized, and smooth! Each morning I noticed more and more of a difference! Great product! Can be picked up at your locate drug store which is a convenient bonus!

"Not sure it does what it claims as I believe I would need to use this product a lot longer than the sample size I was provided, but the cream feels nice on my face. Would I switch from the std Oil Of Olay I already use? Maybe... is there sunscreen in it? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream when applied on our skin makes it really smooth. So far I have used it a couple of times and I love the feel of it. My skin is on the oily side and this cream is not overpowering for my skin type. I would recommend this product to a friend without a doubt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been trying Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream for 5 days and have not noticed a big difference. My current brand seems to do a bit more for me, so I will be sticking with that one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to have oily skin, but if I don't use moisturizer it gets dry in parts. This moisturized my skin evenly, and at the end of the day, it didn't feel oily or dry at all. I do think my skin looks and feels smother after using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved the scent and powdery feel of my skin after applying the OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM, but I woke up the next morning with a massive breakout all over my face. Very disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"MY CURRENT MOISTERIZER DOESNT DO THE LIFT, THIS PRODUCT DOES AND I THINK I LIKE IT BETTER THAN MY CURRENT SKIN EVEN AFTER JUST 1X USE LOOKED A SLIGHT BIT TIGHTER AND FELT IT TO. NOT OVER THE TOP BUT ENOUGH FOR ME TO NOTICE. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is hands down my favorite moisturizer to date. I have mixed oily and dry skin with T-zone acne (blackheads). So, a lot of moisturizers either felt very greasy or did nothing at all. This makes my skin look soft and has evened out my tone to a perfect alabaster. MUST HAVE! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was very smooth and silky in application. It felt nice on my skin, and not greasy. I have oily skin so I am picky about moisturizers! With only a couple usages it's hard to tell whether it did much in evening out my skin tone, but I look forward to trying it again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I used the product, I did not see anything the first day. When I used it the second day my skin felt smooth and I could see a difference. I liked that it made my skin smooth. But to me it is like a moisturizer I already use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love trying new beauty samples especially since my skin is aging and trying to find the right fit for my skin. I love that this product was not thick feeling, I will have to use a bit more to notice a difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love it!!!! Olay you've made another product I really love. It smells wonderful! It feels like I've put silk on my skin! I will absolutely be using this stuff on the regular. The only reason I'm not completely replacing my moisturizer with this is because I use coconut oil to take off all of my makeup and moisturizer my face. I do not use it everyday it's more like every other day. This is a wonderful addition to my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I appreciate that the sample is a small tube that can be secured and offers multiple applications. The scent is pleasant, yet minimal, which is a plus for my sensitivities. The product is quickly absorbed and feels light on the skin, resulting in an immediate softness. I am eager to see how my discoloration is evened out over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was amazed. You can watch this work. It instantly plumps up your skin. And it's not like others where it's temporary, I woke up with teenager skin! I've told anyone who will listen about this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product and the sample was enough to make a decision. The smell of this product triggers a pleasant memory for me. I just want to smell it all day. It brightens my face and leaves a matte finish to apply makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It was a nice face cream but nothing different then my general target brand moisturizer. It didn't do anything besides moisturize. For the price and size I will just use the store brand that has been working. Really no difference besides smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is so nice on the skin. I have large pores and dry skin so using cream is really hydrating while still smoothing my skin. Because it is luminous, if you use it under foundation it gives a nice shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product seemed ok, but with such a small sample I don't know if it will really work on my fine lines and wrinkles like it claims. Being 30 I have some deep set wrinkles that need attention, and I don't know if this will work any better than what I'm currently using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
when I got the package it was so cute and easy to open.My mom was very excited to use it along with me and it worked great for her skin since she is older.i have uneven tone and before applying my make up this helped all the redness to be reduced and it was smooth and super moutirizing for my combination skin and it was also not oily either.Perfect for different skin types [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the smell of the product and it's a great moisturizer however it doesn't satisfy the claims it has such as toning the skin I've already boughten the full size and have used it for month and haven't seen much difference but if you're looking for a good lightweight moisturizer this one is perfect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not quite sure why, but this moisturizer didn't work well with my skin. Other Olay products have been amazing for me. However, this particular product made my skin peel after I used it. It felt like an allergic reaction even though I don't think I'm allergic to anything in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I immediately felt a difference with this product. I've always stayed away from the Olay brand because I feel they're pricey for drugstore products but after sampling them I realize the price is justified. The cream went on smoothly and left my skin feeling replenished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought this product was good but it kind of just seemed like a nice moisturizer, it didnt really seem to do anything super different to my skin. Its nice and I may purchase it when I run out of my current moisturizer but I wouldnt buy it specifically for ""sculpting"" purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample, and was thrilled to find out what a wonderful facial lotion this is! The scent is great, it glides on smoothly, and gives my skin a nice firm tone. I plan to buy a whole jar of it to see how well it works on my fine lines over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The sample. Was perfect enough that I was able to use this for days and clearly know what I'm talking about here! I threw out the old and I'm sold on this. Smells great feels good, try this It's worth your time!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Usually when I have tried other products by this brand, I have not been satisfied but I really did like this cream! I have sensitive skin and a lot of times it reacts badly to moisturizers but it did not with this. The scent was not too strong and the product felt great. I used it as a moisturizer and as a primer for my makeup. The size of the sample was just enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked that the sample came in a tube so that I could try it on my face more than once. The product went on smooth on my face but I didn't like that it smelled a little like shampoo :( I have very fair skin but wasn't sure whether my skin tone improved or not. I would not purchase this any time soon because I'm getting ready for preganancy as I'm afraid of the damage the chemicals in the product will do to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the scent and texture of this moisturizer. It is so soft! My skin can be pretty dry but then get too oily with some facial lotions and make up! This moisturizer was perfect for my picky skin! I will be purchasing this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the sample size and that I was able to use this for a few days to give an accurate review. It applied easily but can't say whether or not it has helped my completion yet. Not a big fan of scents and this one was a little strong for my liking, but I definitely will continue my sample period to see if this starts to improve my complection, tone & texture!

"I was not impressed with this product, it made my face feel greasy and it also broke out my skin. I wouldn't consider myself to have sensitive skin so that was a little alarming. Not right for me but maybe for others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use Olay already. I liked the smell of the product and how smooth it went on. My skin felt very soft after initial application. However, I have combination skin, so by mid-day my skin was more oily after using this product. I wish this product came in an oil-free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My personal thoughts about this product after pinch me send it to me to try,an excellent product which for a drugstore brand of skincare it has always been the top leading brands so its amazing that im in love with this product. I love how it smells, texture of the cream and surely a good skincare product a must have for all beauty conscious ladies :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did notice an improvement in my skin tone, the feel of the product was very nice and the scent was neutral, not overpowering or annoying. The product dis made my skin very oily. I have temperamental skin, and I didn't feel like this product absorbed into my skin completely, which was the reason for the excessive oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was nice when I started using it and the smell is great but after a few tries, my face started breaking out. Wish it didn't break out because it seemed to be doing great other than the breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, play never ceases to deliver. The scent of this product is amazing. It really does leave my face feeling nicely moisturized and hydrated without feeling or looking oily. The sample I received of this was very generous and I was able to use it many times in order to determine my liking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a moisturizer that would help with my combination skin. This was perfect. It did great with the drier areas (my T-zone) and left the rest of my face softer. I had no reactions (ie burning, itchiness). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream was included in recent samples to try. I've used the product for several days now and am pleased with the results. I'm sure after time, this product has a much more visibly improvement on skin tone and overall complexion. Looking forward to trying more to see the results.

I have naturally oily skin as it is so this product made the condition worse. I only used it for two days and then stopped. I did not use the product long enough to notice a difference in terms of treating wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was an ok moisturizer, but I didn't feel like it did as it claimed. To me, it was just another moisturizer. I feel my current moisturizer works a bit better and it's not as expensive as this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM is a very light cream, lightly scented and lightly applied, and lasts quite a long time. This cream has reduced redness in my skin and leaves it feeling smooth and, I guess, luminous. It's become my favorite cream to apply morning and night. It doesn't clog pores and my skin appears healthy and younger looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this sample and I like it just as much as the other Olay products...these are great products...it's going to be super hard to choose which to use...I definitely recommend this product also!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The product wasn't bad but I did feel that it made my face feel greasier overall. I couldn't wash it off of my hands after applying it to my face. It didn't make my face feel especially better or worse than my current moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was super easy to apply, went on smooth and was slightly scented. I did not notice any brightness until after using it for a few days, but I did notice my skin felt so much softer and I couldn't see any dry flaky skin spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this moisturizer. The smell was amazing such a clean fragrance. And the feel of it going on was great. A little goes a long way witch is a good thing. Over all I loved everything about Olay Regeneration Luminous tone perfecting crem. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I already use Olay Age Defying Classic Night Cream daily, so I absolutely support Olay products in general, and was thrilled to receive this as a sample. Only one use isn't really enough to see how the product will fare over time, but I think it has potential and will most likely purchase more. The scent was nice, it went on smoothly and it didn't cause any breakouts - which is great, since I have sensitive skin that is easily prone to breakouts.

"It feels thick out of the package, but very light and silky as you smooth it on. I need to look at the ingredients on cosdna to be sure it would be something I could regularly use, but it has been good so far on my acne prone, combo skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Was able to get much more use out of this sample size making it easier to honestly review. I used it morning and night. I feel it made my skin smoother and gave it a brighter, more even tone. I loved the feel of it on my skin as well. Depending on the price, I would definitely like to buy and try more of this. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am pregnant with my fourth child and have been planning my in-laws 50th anniversary party. I started using this moisturizer about a week before the party. I noticed a dramatic difference in my skin's tone and feel, pore size, and my skin glows now. This was wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleased with the size of this sample and got three uses out of it. I love the smell of the product, and I think for the price it is a very effective moisturizer. Have not really noticed the tone correcting benefits as of yet, which is why I say 4 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The sample I received was enough for about a week giving me the opportunity to really get a chance to try the product out once in the morning and once at night. When I read the word Luminous on packaging the first thing I think the product will do is leave the skin with a glow, leave the skin looking moist and feeling moist but this product does did not do this for my skin.

"I have been using this product for a couple of days now, both day and night. I use it on my face and neck. I love the way it glides over my skin and it smells great. And once it settles, my skin feels super soft. I have noticed a nice difference in the evenness of my skin tone and it has lightened the appearance of dark spots and acne scars. I will definitely continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is generously fragrant, but the good news is: I love the scent. The formula is pretty light, so it didn't leave my skin feeling greasy, which is a bonus. Upon the first application, I immediately noticed my skin tone was more even and brighter. I don't think this sample size will last long enough to speak of the long term effectiveness, but I like that it shows immediate results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It smells really nice.. Like a light perfume. It didn't rub off after about t minutes like other creams I've tried.. I feel like my skin is too fine lol. It worked wonderfully under my makeup and have my skin a lighter tint. I really like it :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To begin, I am extremely picky when it comes to facial moisturizers. My skin is usually dry, which can cause it to be oily. This product however is fantastic. It smelled great and fresh, moisturized my skin, and made it feel matte. 10/10 would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a pretty nice moisturizer. It did feel amazing on my skin and it gave me a slight luminous glow. I didn't like how it peeled off my skin after a few hours. Didn't work well with my serums though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has already made a change in the appearance and feel of my skin on my face which has changed since turning 50! It feels great, and is not too dry where before I didn't even want to use my makeup. With this my face feels wonderful, and looks glowing . After applying my makeup my face is not tight, and I've recently have gotten a lot of compliments ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This cream is thick so I can understand why its sold in a jar, even though jar packaging is not my first choice. Its difficult to tell if the product does what it claims to do because the sample was small but I did like it. If I ever need a cream to help even out my skin tone, this would be my first pick.

This product was packaged amazing and I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone I am definitely going to be buying this product for a while and hopefully I keep getting more samples because they really do help let you know what products you will be spending your money on and what by pure spending great money on like these kind of products. Definitely a recommendation! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed this moisturizer..I have oily acne prone and sensitive skin and this did not make me break out or irritated and it feels so smooth and great when I applied it and it made my skin feel great without the grease [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"My skin is not perfect at all. I have red splotches that are hard to cover up with makeup as it fades away throughout the day. I haven't received anything from a dermatologist to make it better. As soon as I used this sample, I could see the patches fading away a bit. It may be expensive, but I think it's worth the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Every morning after I do my usual morning skin routine and I apply my make up. It doesn't take long for my skin between my eyebrows to get dry and flaky. Not after using the olay I did not have this problem and my make looked incredibly soft with this cream underneath [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I rarely use facical creams or any kind of cleanser for that matter. It has an unique scent to it and leaves my face refreshed. Soft creamy and applying it was smooth and the results are notable. Highly Recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the feel of this cream and the way it felt on my skin after application. I can't tell yet whether the cream is helping my skin tone -- I think the amount of product in the sample is too small to judge long term effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Again, not enough product sample to really tell if it improves the skin appearance,texture.. But I can testify to the texture of the product. It's smooth and silky.But,so is my generic moisturizer.In the long run, I'm not sure it's worth the price difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the way it made my face feel after I applied it! It absorbed COMPLETELY (which is a big pet peeve of mine) and was not greasy or heavy. It was such a small sample so I do not know if it made my skin more radiant..but i would buy it in the future based on what I did experience with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The smell of the creme is good, it reminds me a peach as well as the color of it. I didn't like the ingredients - dimethicone and glycerin on the first positions, so the skin will hardly breathe under it and it's not fully absorbing on me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the ease of the application. It just glided right on. So far it held up quite well without feeling greasy or too oily. I have combination skin and that's a huge perk in my opinion. I can't wait to test it with my makeup to see how it all pans out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was just decent for me. I feel like the sample size wasn't big enough for me to make a really informed decision, but it definitely isn't a BAD product! I just couldn't tell if it made a difference. I probably won't purchase it in the future, but I'm glad I got to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with this product! It leaves my face so soft and smooth! If I had one complaint it would be that I have broke out a little more, but it is honestly nothing that would make me stop using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product and think that it has great promise. It applied well and did a good job moisturizing. However, the sample only gave enough for two applications so I can not review the claims that the product makes about how it will change your skin over a week or a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little skeptical when I received this moisturizer because they all claim to be a non-greasy formula and wont feel heavy on your face. Once I finally did try it though, I was pleasantly surprised. It feels very light, and absorbs quickly so there is no greasy residue and it smells great too! My face felt much softer and I am very happy with the product so far! I will recommend this to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream was extremely pleasant both in terms of scent and also how smoothly and comfortably it went on. It was very hydrating, and I didn't experience any irritation or redness after using it. I have no complaints about it, and would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"love the packaging, the scent and the texture of this product but it is difficult to see results with just a sample. I have very sensitive skin and I got a lot of small little pimples around the areas where I applied this product, so if you have sens skin I wouldn't recommend.

I love this cream. I have very blotchy red patches all over my face and its hard to get rid of besides caking on tons of cover up. I used this cream and later bought the cleanser and now my blotchy patches are disappearing and I can comfortably go out without any make up on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that this is a great moisturizer it claims to diminish the appearance of dark spots but I haven't been using it that long to see a great difference. I'm not agree if this product Is causing me to break out but it's agree nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used oil of olay complete for years. This Olay Ageless is very different . It has a luxurious feel to it and that fragrance I associated with Olay is gone. I think I'm going to be using the Olay Ageless from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm sure it's a great product but I can't use it. I had a bad reaction and my skin peeled but judging from how many people love I think it's just me so please don't dismiss this product because of me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this moisturizer! The fragrance is light and it has such a silky texture. It moisturizes well right away and does not have any greasiness whatsoever. It really does make a difference in the look and feel of my skin. It looks brighter and no dry or oily patches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't able to fully sample this product due to having a skin irritation shortly after applying the product.

"First of all this cream smells amazing. It had fresh scent kinda exotic. It leaves some residue on the skin and unfortunately it's comedogenic so be careful oily, brake out prone skin. Also if You have sensitive skin it can irritate Your skin a little make it redish/pinkish. But not burning. Afterward skin is smooth and soft. I didn't see any woe results yet but it's pretty good product :). I received this product complimentary but my opinion is 100% honest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. After using it I really could swear my face felt so soft and smooth ,it was like 20 years vanished and that soft silky skin I had in my 20's was back. I wish I could go back in time and take this with me I would have started using this years ago. Thank you O'lay. Another truly awesome product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is heavily perfumed! It's very light textured and goes on smoothly. It's great as a light summer cream. Not moisturizing enough for dry skin. Since this is for tone perfecting, it's not enough to see a visible difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is great that I got to sample this moisturizer. I have acne prone skin so I am always very apprehensive before I invest money in a moisturizer. This Olay moisturizer did not break me out or is not very greasy. It has a nice scent and I will surely purchase it now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have extremely dry skin that is dry all year round. I buy all sorts of moisturizing products, but they do little to aid my skin. Suddenly, I found out about the Olay Regenerist Cream and my skin took a turn for the better. It looked luminous, and it felt extremely smooth. I would definitely buy this product.

I love Olay products because they're reasonably priced and accessible in stores I shop at. I really like creams that are in Pumps because I think it's more sanitary. It would be nice if olay came out with an eco-line that had less synthetic perfumes and parabens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product works well on my skin. Keeps my skin soft and it also has a pleasant scent. I like using the Olay products and will continue to buy them. The price is good and can easily be bought in many stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I like the smell, and it is light and airy, which is a plus-the overall quality when it came to ""immediately brightening dark spots"" was mediocre. Didn't show any immediate illuminating quality to me other than a pretty smell ands light feel. Disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Although it can be a little pricey...Olay products never fail to amaze me. Have used oil of olay facial cream for years and never tried the Regenerist line because of cost. The sample I received was appreciated. Loved the way it made my face feel. Will consider this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the texture of this cream and how it applied to the skin. It was also EXTREMELY moisturizing (which was surprising due to interesting texture). I'm not completely sold on the wearability however as it seemed to somewhat ball up and rub off...which for a regular foundation wearer is NOT a good sign. Overall I'd definitely buy again if price point was lower but between the price and my misgivings about absorption, I won't purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very skeptical of this at first. But from the second I tried it I loved it!!! Made my skin look and feel softer and I really could tell a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles just after one use!!! I love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I found the product to be an extremely good product, its not something that I truly feed the need for, personally. I currently use a primer that I'm very pleased with, which gives me basically the same results. However, with that being said - the product is excellent, and yes, I would recommend to anyone who was looking for this type of creme/lotion. Your skin is soft, smooth and evenly toned after usage, it definitely delivers what it promises. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed trying this Olay product. I use a sonic cleaning system that cleans my skin wonderfully but leaves it incredibly dry. I love how this moisturizer replenishes the moisture in my skin. Awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer by far the best I have used in a long time. I have very oily skin so most moisturizer makes it worse. This product is so sheer and light weight it does not feel oily at all. Works great with my make up. Love this product will be buying this product from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It was such a tiny sample for me to be able to review. If it was bigger I would be able to test it for a longer period and get the feel of my skin after about a week. Overall it smells so good and made my skin feel good even after using it one day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always insecure trying facial products. This didn't act so much like a moisturizer, it went on really smooth. It gave me a matte finish glow (if that makes sense) my face appeared brighter, but not shinier. I liked it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay tone perfecting cream moisturized without making my face feels greasy or heavy. It made my face feel soft. The sample was small so it is difficult to know if it will even out the the tone of my face. I liked the product so much though that I am willing to buy it to find out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never liked any of the creams I've tried, until now! I LOVE this cream!! It feels silky & smooth! Like a satin finish on my skin! It takes very little to cover my face & neck. And it smells wonderful! Not too strong, very light & clean smelling. No chemical smell like others I've tried. I received this in a sample size, 0.24 ounce. I've used it almost a week now, day & night, and still have plenty left! I will definitely be purchasing the full size!"
It was really hard to tell if I would like this product in the long run because the sample was so small. If felt good and my skin felt great afterwards but it would have been better if the sample was large enough to try for a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this same twice consecutively after washing my face and neck to achieve the same result: light moisturizer that left my skin feeling it needed more of a boost. This sample reminds me of an older Olay product with similar appeal or maybe it is the same since the results were the exact. I had to use a skin-friendly oil to make my skin feel moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay products, and this cream is no exception. The best selling point is definitely the scent for me, but aside from that, this cream is great day or night. After a week of usage, my skin was definitely brighter, more luminous, baby soft and smooth. A great addition to my skincare routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"my experience with this product went very well, it made my skin look like it was glowing and it was also very hydrating to my skin. The only thing I would forwarn about this product is that the scent of it is very strong so if you have very sensitive skin or don't really like scents in your moisturizer you probably won't like it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream was easy to apply. The smell was okay, not fruity at all, but did not have that hardcore chemical smell. After applying the cream my face felt nice and fresh. Will most definitely try it out again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the light feel it gives, so prefer it as a day time moisturizer. But the scent did not appeal much to me. I will not be using this one as my go to moisturizer as I have dry skin and need more moisture. I will be trying it out bit more and see how skin looks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisturizer was easy to apply and I liked the packaging. The only downside for me was the scent. It smelled clean and fresh, but it didn't smell light. I like my moisturizers to smell lightweight and this didn't do it for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a fan of Olay products in general and the Regenerist line is no exception. I even saw positive results with the first application! The cream is very hydrating (without feeling greasy) and left my face looking and feeling soft, smooth, and bright. I finished the entire sample tube (which I received for free in exchange for my honest assessment) and have even noticed improvement in my skin tone. I look forward to purchasing a full-size product.

"I really didn't think that I would see much of a difference between my current Ponds moisturizer and the Olay Perfecting cream but I definitely did! Just after two days of using the Olay moisturizer I noticed my skin being softer, less imperfections, and glowy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream felt really smooth and like it wont clog pores, my skin looked really bright and didnt feel oily at all. There was tiny bits of glitter in the cream which was pretty weird but it gave a pretty look to the skin, by the next day my pores looked smaller and my skin looked brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The sampler say was pretty small. It wasn't enough to try for long enough to see if I actually buy this product in the future. I would like to try it on a more longer basis so I can make sure that I do in fact like it. When I did fine with that I like the way it feels on my skin. And he gave my skin a very nice glow. That gets two thumbs up in itself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this moisturizer ! I've actually gotten a sample of this from my sister and after the first use i could tell the difference . My face was smooth , much brighter . So Im so excited that ive gotten my hands on another sample . I will defiantly be buying this . Its a magic miracle to my face & it smells beautiful , none oily at all !!!!

"I love the fresh & clean scent of this product. Smells refreshing. Dont know if i will purchase or not, sample isnt enough to make a decision. I dont want to buy something that Im not going to use after a week or two. Sample isnt enough to determine to buy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Never tried this product before but I got to try it for free thanks to Pinchme. I was impressed with the feeling of the cream on my face and neck. It has a nice feeling, different than other moisturizers. It leaves my skin fresh and smooth and the smell is really nice! It says it helps with the dark circles but since I only had a sample I didn't have enough time to see if it works but I will definitely buy this product and hopefully it will get rid of my dark circles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product!! I had no idea that the tone of my face had so many red pigments in it, until I used this. I didn't know I needed this product, but now I do. Also, some moisturizers break me out. No break outs and my skin feels great! Couldn't be happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have sensitive skin and one known allergy, the dark meat of turkeys, but as soon as it touched my face I felt a tingling itchy sensation. I thought that was what was supposed to happen but I didn't apply anymore. The feeling died down after while but I washed my face just to be sure. 2 days later I still have a rash on my cheeks. So this was a miss for me. Looked in the ingredients but I didn't see anything concerning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Aveeno moisturizer for years and never wanted to make a switch. Now that ive tried this stuff im never looking back. I have dry skin and this stuff leaves my face looking great! Two thumbs up! Great job Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Tried this cream and it smells great and feels great. The scent is clean and simple, I don't like overpowering scents. The formula itself is comparable to high end brands. Overall I like this cream and will buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't used it long enough to see results but I love the concept, feel and scent of the cream. I apply it only to my darker areas and waiting to see results. If I do, I will purchase it. It is not oily and works well with my oily to combination skin. Would love to review more Olay products. They seem great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As I said in the other review before I would highly recommend this Olay luminous product! This feels good against my skin and I love the really nice perfume scent this gives off as well! That's vital to me because I hate products with a strong nasty smell that give me a headache. I love this Olay product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had never used this product before because of the cost of the cream. It is kind of expensive. I did like the scent and also how soft it made my skin feel. I have not used it long enough to know if it has helped with any wrinkles or anything but I did like how it didn't make my skin feel oily after applying it and even after I woke up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always been a huge fan of Olay products, and the luminous tone perfecting cream only validates just how great a company they are. the lotion went on smooth, smelled amazing, and left my skin hydrated but not greasy or weighed down. My makeup even went on smoother! Will definitely be purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion goes on with ease and smoothness. It has a fresh smell, so it's enjoyable. I've used this cream for about one week, and I haven't really noticed any change in my skin tone or spots. I'll give it a few more weeks to see if it really is as effective as it touts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked getting a sample of this product. I used it to compare what I am currently using. Both products do the same thing s and both are about the same price. Thought the Olay sample smells better than the other. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"the scent was pleasant and it was not greasy and did not cause acne which I'm prone to. I used it instead of my Este Lauder and seem to work just as well, but i only used it for a day so I could not write and accurate review without trying it for several days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first tried it, it made my skin feel soft, however, I woke up in the morning to red bumps all over my chin and right cheek. I'm used to Olay products making my skin feel oily, but both samples I got in my last box have resulted in allergic reactions. I don't see myself every getting something with Olay in it again.

I have sampled Olay's Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. I really liked this product. It has a light scent: applies well with a non greasy feel. I started to see a more even tone to my skin within a week. I do intend of purchasing this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer smells lovely-- like peaches-- and goes on pretty smooth although it leaves a powdery residue on my hands. But the fragrance bothered my skin, and the product is inferior to the Clinique gel moisturizer I already use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Glad to finally get to try an Olay product. I have always wanted to start using it to ""stop the aging process before it starts"" but didn't want to spend the money and it not show results. Now I know the results and can't wait to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a big fan of toners, I prefer skin brighteners. I will say the plus of ths product which blew me away was the texture this product feels so extremely good, soft, amazing to the face and neck. I wish they had a skin brightener but keep the texture ☺ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product went above and beyond my expectations. After just one day, I could see a difference in my fine lines/wrinkles. This is a product I've fell in love with. Can't believe I didn't try it sooner. But glad I have now because I will definitely be replacing all of my other wrinkle creamso with this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is honestly super hydrating to my skin and leaves a very fresh and radiant feel tony skin when I apply it after washing my face. I use this product now instead of my usually facial moisturizer and I'm so happy I got a chance to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer was nice and had a nice smell and feel. My face felt very refreshed after using the product. I didn't notice any difference in my skin's appearance or texture compared to my normal moisturizer after only one use. I think that I would need to use it for at least a week to be able to make a fair comparison. But based on the one time use sample that I recieved, I thought the product was nice and worth trying again as long as the price is affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was able to evenly spread out the sample over the course of two days. The product was easily absorbed by my skin, the scent was light and it left no greasy feeling. I can't vouch for its long-term benefits, but my first two days with this product were successful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I applied the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream after I had washed my face and immediately could tell a difference in how soft my skin felt. Smoot as a babys butt! I love it. Woke up the next morning and couldn't believe how touchably soft my skin still was [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product made my skin dry (ironic since it is supposed to be a Moisturizer), it leaves thin white paper-like residue on your skin and peels off. I also got a few pimples on my face which I think are due to the use of this cream as I did not change anything else in my diet or skin regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't notice a big difference. I have too small of a sample to really get to really see some big results. The smell is kind of unappealing. For me, a little does not go along way but I have a really small sample. I'm still going to use it until it's gone. Maybe if I got a decent sized sample, I would be able to use this long enough to see some results. But I don't think I would buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer smells amazing. It's light and moisturizes well, I only wish the sample size were a little larger so I could tell whether it made any long-term or noticeable difference to my skin, above and beyond what my current moisturizer provides. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to prefer cleaner ingredient than what this product provides. It didn't leave any adverse reactions, but the sample also wasn't big enough to merit a proper review. I thought my skin felt the same, and the product was very easy to apply. The consistency was also good, but just not a product I would feel safe using on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is seriously amazing. I've tried many facial moisturizers because it's always hard to find something that doesn't make my skin oily or making acne. Regenerist luminous surprised me with a beautiful scent. The feel is more like after primer which is even better because make-up looks flawles. It hydrates my skin all day and doesn't make oily at all! I'm really curious how my skin will look after longer using of this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As soon as I opened the product I felt in love. The smell of it just reminds me of something I have tried before. I really also like the concept of the product. I like the way it compares the product on your skin like a shining pearl. I also love the fact that it is not too runny, it has a perfect consistency for a moisturizer.I truly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Tone Perfecting Cream. It glides on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling great. It is not heavy or oily like some products. My mom always used Olay products when I was growing up and now I have my own Olay products to add to my skin care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The texture of the product was nice. Not too thin not too thick. It was CRAZY smelly though. Way too much fragrance. I had to wash it off because it was overpowering to have that much fragrance on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream went on with ease but it didn't look as though it absorbed well. It felt like it did but it looked white on the skin. I noticed a couple of small pimples after using it a couple of times. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! It is gently on the skin, yet it produces visible results. I love the scent and texture. It is thick without being too heavy or sticky. I use it at night and during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After 15 minutes of wear with this product, my skin (which is normally dry to normal) was oily. I love luminous products and use them daily so I can tell you it was oily/greasy not luminous by any means. I had to get going so i put my makeup on, as usual, and this product made my concealer break up on my skin and look blotchy and cakey. Not cute. I love the idea of this product but unfortunately it just is not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
One of the best feeling creams I've used in awhile on my face. Many luminating products have shimmer in them so I was a bit skeptic when I revived this but I'm happy this does not have anything added into it. Very silky and clean feeling on the skin!

I'm on the fence about this because not enough sample was provided for me to really decide if I like it. Smell was good though. I would recommend it to a friend looking for a product like this just because of the brand [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream was able to even out the tone in my skin so that the natural redness against my pale skin seemed to diminish within a couple minutes of application and improved with repeated use. It is definitely something I will use in the future and would recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a deluxe sample, so I was able to use it a few times. One of the reasons I do not like creams on my face is they make my face feel greasy. Unfortunately, this product left my face feeling greasy. I do appreciate the nice sample and the opportunity to try the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My first thoughts on the moisturizer was that the smell was amazing. Just the smell would have convinced me to buy. However I was twice as amazed by how my skin drank it in and I actually looked nicer after application. Will be recommending to my mom and friends for sure.

I love this because it is lightly-scented and fast-absorbing! This moisturizer illuminates and hydrates my skin quickly. It brightens my skin while fading the look of dark spots and age spots. Love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Love the feel as it goes on. It is not greasy like some other products. The smell is nice too. Also my makeup goes right over it. You know how sometimes if you put a cream on before your make up, the make up doesn't apply well? That didn't happen with this product. Very nice! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

First I received this product for free in return for my honest opinion. This product just didn't work for me.

I love this product. So many of the products in this area of beauty have this greasy feeling when when applied to the skin. This product doesn't have that. It goes on smooth and silky. There's no nasty residue feeling. There also isn't a harsh smell which I love. It also didn't break out my sensative skin. Overall a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Honestly? I can't say that I didn't like the product. I didn't do much for me in the toning area. Maybe it was the little sample or its just not for me. I've heard good things about it and I guess it works for other people. The cream itself has a good feel as well as an okay scent. I would recommend it based on reviews...not on my experience.

"I wasn't expecting to see any results, to be honest, but wow! I thought I'd need weeks to see anything, but by day two my complexion was more even and bright. I have an oily t-zone and lots of creams tend to make me break out, but even after using it both day and night, no breakouts. Very hydrating, has a velvety feel to it, and has a nice smell. Very pleased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay products before and loved it. Being in my late 20s I have started trying out moisturizers and creams to take care of my skin. I loved using the product, the smell is amazing and the skin feels good. However because of the size of the sample I could barely use it for 2 uses. So cant fully make out if this would suit my skin, since I have combination and sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to love this product as it offers benefits that I'm looking for (skin tone improvement and more youthful looking skin in general. However, like with other Olay products I've tried, there's something in it that my skin just does not like. I put it on at night and when I wake up the next morning, I have a pimple forming! Sadly, this product is not for me, but I gave it to my mom and her skin has no problems with it. Your mileage may vary, but for me, this is a no go.

I have used the same products for years now and was skeptical about trying and buying a new one.. I figured if I got to sample one I would give it a try. I absolutely love this product..I love the smell.. and the fact that my dark spots are so much less noticeable since I have been using it. I will recommend to friends and family and will purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how it felt when I applied the moisturizer, but the main claim of the product is something that takes time to achieve in more applications than just one. I might consider buying in the future because I like this product, but I don't feel like I can make a very informed decision just because of my one small sample. I currently use a different Olay moisturizer, so I might consider switching to this one in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product didn't really inspire me to change from my current facial products. I didn't notice a marked improvement, but there wasn't a decline in my appearance either. There just didn't seem to be enough in the sample for me to be able to see a difference at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I plan on purchasing Olay's tone perfecting cream very soon. I currently use a basic 15 SPF moisturizer made by Olay. The sample I tried contained enough cream for a few days.

I tried a sample of this product. The sample actually had a lot of product so I've been trying it out for about a week now. It has a nice scent and feels moisturizing. I do not know about the toning part of it- since I think I am too young to notice a difference. The only negative is if I apply too much to my face I get a white film.

"Feels nice on and easy to apply. Has a nice scent and a no greasy look and feel which for me who has oily t zone, is most important. I like knowing I'm doing something positive for my face, by treating and preventing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just the initial application from the generous sample was enough to make me realize that this is no ordinary facial moisturizer! It left My skin soft and smooth and never feeling so good as when using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great! I use it when I want to give my skin that extra luminous glow. It's not heavy or greasy but seems to smooth out my skin and even out some of the imperfections. Great under makeup or without for a natural look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is wonderful. I have never purchased this cream before because it is a little pricey for me and I didn't want to be stuck with it if I did not like it. I used my sample after cleansing my face. It applied very silky and absorbed quickly. My face feel very soft and smooth. I will purchase with a coupon.

"In comparison to other creams available at big department stores, this cream should appeal to the more price conscious consumer. The results appear to be the same as more expensive face creams but this product provides a cheaper option. Did not leave our face feeling too greasy and the smell was pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product instead of my normal facial cleansing routine. I was pleasently suprised by how good the product smelled and felt on my skin. My skin looks and fells better and the price makes this a product I will buy often. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the feel and texture of this moisturizer. It left my skin feeling really hydrated and soft after a few uses, I have yet to see any changes in my skins overall tone but I haven't used it long enough to see the full results as advertised. Overall I think this is a good light moisturizer for summer, but I will probably stick with my Cetaphil or other products during the winter when I need a heavier cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When open this product I like the smell. This product had silk cream feel to it. When I put it on my face it didn't feel heavy. Opened the pores on my face, and when I wash it off. It made my face feel soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a nice feel, it's scent is also not very strong. It's definitely not oily. However, I do not see any luminosity after using the product. It does not seem any better than my current moisturizer so far. Maybe in the long run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can't say that I was wowed by the product. I think perhaps having more of a sample could have affected my thoughts on the product. It left the portion of my face I used it on moisturized and it smelled nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Can't really tell if this will work for my skin with how small the sample is. You have to use something like this for over a week usually before you can really tell and the sample is only enough for one or two uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It doesn't do the best job moisturizing, but it does wonderfully at evening out my skin tone which has been an issue for my skin for awhile now. I really love the results even after just five days of using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed biggerthis. I told my friends and family all about it! Its definitely worth every pennyis product. The feeling of it was like silk when I put it on my face! Its so soft feeling afterwards! The way it Ade my face shine and look! I definitely went out and got a bigger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin was incredibly dry and flaky immediately before application. I applied this cream right before bed all over my face with extra love to the flaky areas. When I woke up I was incredibly surprised that my skin was as moisturized as it was with the flaky areas less prominent. I will definitely be purchasing the full size of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked how the product made my skin look after using it. I have very oily skin and I'm not sure if the product irritated my face or had a reaction from the oil in my skin but I broke out after using it the first time. I stuck with it and it seemed to work well after a week or so. I would recommend that if someone buys it and has a reaction to stick with it because it pays off in the end. My skin looks much nicer after having used this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This olay moisturizer to my surprise had a very pleasant smelling scent. I apply it in the morning after I get done washing my face. It makes my skin very soft, I like the fact that you don't have to use too much to get the moisturization that you need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I sampled this product for a week with all that it promises I am very pleased. I love the rich creamy texture, It goes on smooth and melts in my skin. I could tell a differance in my skin's texture and a lighter glow. I will buy this product again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It went on smoothly and I liked how it made my skin feel. But after only one application it was hard to tell if it would do as the product says. More applications will be needed in my case to see if it does as it says. But I do enjoy howit made my skin feel and look and am planning on purchasing so as to see if I see wrinkle improvement [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was hoping for a larger sample but with just the sample given I was able to see that a little goes a long way. i feel like in the long run i may see some tone perfecting in my skin but the full product comes in a jar which i find a negative. I would be much happier if it were in a pump form. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. It made my skin feel super smooth and the texture wasn't greasy at all. The scent was also amazing! I will definitely purchase this in the future and recommend to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given a small sample of this. It honestly wasn't extraordinary. Felt like a nice facial lotion. I don't think it will do too much for wrinkles, firming or anything. But. It is a great moisturizer! Smells great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting Cream maid my skin feel like I had the skin of an angel. My skin was so soft and bright. Everyone was like you are glowing. I going out to buy some today. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product seemed smooth and grease-free. Rather than sink in and disappear, it seemed to form a coating on my skin that felt like a protective layer. I can't attest to the long-term benefits of using this product, as the sample was only enough for 3 applications. I will consider buying it as a replacement for my current Olay moisturizer just to see if it improves the look and feel of my skin over time. Short-term, I liked the feel of the cream and the way it made my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream makes my skin look smooth and glowing and doesn't leave a greasy feeling afterwards. I haven't use enough to say how well it helps perfect the skin tone after a bit of use, but I intend on purchasing a full sized bottle to find out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only had one day to try OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM and I won't use it again because I had a horrible reaction to their other Regenerist product. I will not use any Olay products on my face. I do like their body products, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would have to say I think this is a good product from a responsible company.I've only heard good things from others that use this brands products. It felt good on my skin.I Willi will purchase this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked my sample of Olay Regenerist tone perfecting cream. I liked how it felt on my skin. My skin is very sensitive and I often break out after trying new face creams. I had no skin issues at all after sampling the Olay Regenerist tone perfecting cream.I will definitely be buying this and recommending to family/friends.

"love using olay regenerist. My skin always gets dry, and with olay, not anymore. Ive really noticed a softer and smoother appearance on my skin after just a few weeks. I cant use this before going to bed though as for some reason i always wake up with a breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel like using only a sample size its hard to tell if it makes much of a difference on your skin. I do have very sensitive skin and it didnt cause me to have any breakouts or anything. which was good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer feels nice and smooth on my face. It left my face feeling silky and hydrated which I'm always looking for since I have dry skin. I really like it and can see myself using more often. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this product! This product makes my skin feel amazing! I have very sensitive skin and I am very grateful to say that this product works wonders with NO harsh side affects to my sensitive skin and I just love the way my skin feels after use of this Olay product! None of my previous moisturizers compare! I personally highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel like I am using a quality product when I use Olay, and this lotion fits their image. It feels great on the skin and smells very pleasant. For me, the moisturizing component could be a little heavier, but I like heavy moisturizing. A great product overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product does not have a heavy feel to it so it spreads evenly on your skin. I've only been using it for a few days and I have a few dark spots on my skin so I will keep using this to see if they will actually disappear. I love the smell also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm already a huge fan of olay and currently use the luminous face wash and eye cream so I was thrilled to get to try the moisturizer too,iam happy with the results and the feel of my skin so much so that I will purchase this when my samples gone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the way it made my skin feel when I applied it. There was somewhat of a glow to my skin after applied as well. However when I applied it at nighttime (since the directions say either morning/night) my skin became excessively oily and I looked disgusting. I will continue to use this product and play with it different ways to see if a different application will work best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have many skin imperfections as well as dry, dead skin from the winter months. My current moisturizer was fine in the morning and made my skin look ok with makeup on, but by noon you could see the dry patches again! I was able to stretch this sample to a couple of uses, and after just those few times I see a real difference in my overall complexion. My skin also stays moisturized longer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an AMAZING moisturizer.... It feels like satin when you apply it! I am in love with the way it makes my face soooooo smooth!! I WILL be getting this, SOON and it's already showing fading of my spots from five days of use! I have been raving about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not think I would see a difference using a sample. I didn't think it was long enough. WOW was I surprised at how different, younger my skin looked after a few days of use! Love the texture and smell and how good my skin looks using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like to try new moisturizers and cleansers always looking for a new and better one. I found this one to be very moisturizing and hasn't broken me out yet. I have sensitive skin so that can be a problem. I'm going to continue to use it and see if I still like it. If so I will probably keep buying it! It has a nice light scent too, not overwhelming like some! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been a purchaser of the Olay Regenerist line for years but, this was the first time using their tone perfecting cream. Creamy and easy to apply. Cannot state on if it worked due to sample size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay has been a trusted product for me during the past 30 years. It goes on smoothly, leaving my skin hydrated and toned, without feeling greasy or oily. The price is much better than most department store products and Olay works just as well or better. Wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Olay products and have been using them for years. I just wish that the sample were larger so that I could actually make an informed decision as to whether I really like the product or not. It does go on smoothly and is not greasy, and has a nice smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like this product a lot! I have been looking for something to wear under my make up that gives me moisture but doesn't wear off my makeup and this worked perfectly!! Without trying a sample I would have never known! Try it out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The sample really wasn't enough to see a difference in the actual tone of my skin but I did like the feel of it on my skin and the feel of my skin after use. I'm impressed enough that I would purchase a retail size to see whether my actual tone improved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My mother grew up using oil of olay. I have always used their products I'm just glad new ones come out do often. New products gives awesome results. I'm 39 and people ask how I look so young and hope I get skin so soft. I always recommend oil of olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I put on this cream both in the morning after I showered and also at night after I washed by face before bed. The product goes on smooth and I noticed the results immediately. It helped even my skin tone. I would recommend buying this product and would like to buy the product to see what my skin tone would look like after a longer period of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I quickly saw results with the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. It definitely made my skin brighter and more even toned, which I've had problems with since I was younger. The only downside to this stuff is that I did have to use another moisturizer with it because it didn't prevent my skin from being dry. It did NOT make my skin more dry it just didn't moisturize it enough to prevent my naturally dry skin from being dry. Overall 5 stars the results are amazing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Right now my skin isn't the best to use this product every day but I can't wait for some of my imperfections to heal to see the it work to its potential. I have recommended this to friends that I know will love this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I saw results with this tone perfecting cream in less than a week this stuff really does it's job. The only down side to it is that it's not that great at actually moisturizing my skin, I still need to use my other moisturizer so my face is not dry throughout the day. I will give 5 stars though because I did truly see a significant difference in my face after a few uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product promises to even skin tone and that is precisely what it has done. I've been using this only a few days and already I can tell a difference in my skin tone. I've been skipping applying my normal BB cream and only apply a little concealer where needed because my skin is much more even now. The scent is great and it feels nice on. The only thing is that Olay products are getting a tad pricey for someone as frugal as I am. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really didn't like this Toning Moisterizer from Olay. When I put it on it was like I had a nasty film across my face. I tried to smooth it into my face more and that was a horrible idea... It formed balls of.... moisterizer on my face. It made my face feel really dry. Not my kind of moisterizer since I already have dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a sample of Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream from PinchMe.com and was happy with the item. I thought it has a pleasant scent when applying to my face. Was very easy to rub in and did not leave an oily feel to my skin or look. I will continue to use to see if I get any changes with my fine lines that come with age.

love the scent and the texture is nice too. it was easy to apply and I woke up with my fave feeling really smooth . as far as difference in my skins texture I'm not sure.

This is very different from my current moisturizer. I currently use cocoa butter to moisturizer my skin. This goes on dry and soft and I feel like this is something I could apply right before putting on makeup and not have to wait to put makeup on. I still think I would continue to use my cocoa butter at night but maybe use this when putting on makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I used the sample instead of my night time moisturizer. It went on evenly, absorbed well, and was non greasy. Since I only had enough sample to use for one application, I cannot comment on its long term effects of my skin tone. However, I loved the way it felt on my skin and that it wasn't oily feeling on my skin. I would definitely give it a try for a longer period! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

As a person with oily skin and some dry patches I usually have problems with moisturizers. This one didn't cling to dry patches and my makeup looked great at the end of the day. Not greasy. And it smells good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combo skin -- some areas oily, some areas dry. I don't like using a products that adds to the oiliness I already have.

"Now that winter is ending and spring is coming, my skin has been so dull. After using this product for several days, I could tell that my skin looked brighter. The cream is not too thick.

"Like with most facial moisturizers, one would expect all would just be oil you rub on your face. This product did not do that. Once applied and rubbed in, skin is soft and looks normal.

This facial cream felt so smooth on my skin when applied the 1st time as well. It wasn't to thick of a cream and it didn't leave my face oliy as well. My face afterwards felt smooth to the touch.

I have been using a very high dollar product for quite sometime and this one was almost as good.

I really liked the feel of this cream. Most are greasy and just make muy face feel like I've added a coating to it. This soaked in reasonably quickly and didn't leave me feeling like i had residue on my face.

So I was only able to try this tone perfecting cream for one day. What I noticed about it is that it goes on very smoothly. It does not take a lot of product to hydrate the skin.

"OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM was ok. The sample size was too small to see a difference in my skin tone and appearance. I am not crazy about the scent, too much perfume.

I love the product. It feels really nice on the skin and it has more luminosity.

I loved this cream! I used this cream before applying my makeup and I saw a huge change in my skin and makeup application. The product has a great consistency and sank into the skin well without leaving it too dewy or sticky. It gave my skin a luminous look and gave it almost a velvet like feel. My makeup just glided on afterwards. It didn't effect the wear time of my makeup either which was a huge plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I believe that this product required about a month to show the difference in your skin. With that being said the performance of this product is hard to rate with the small sample. The use of what was provided was used. This was just not that impressive to me. A product really has to prove above and beyond for consumers to spend our hard earned money on their products. Sorry this just did not do it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I absolutely love this product. It goes on featherily light and has no greasy after feel. My skin looks bright and alive after the first use.I am definitely going to purchase this product and will be recommending it to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked trying out this product even though I usually go for more organic products I liked the way it made my skin feel and I am curious to see how much impact it will have on my skin if used daily so I would definitely like to buy this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was happy that the product came in a little tube so I don't have to use it all in one go. I can't say that I noticed a difference because the sample was small. I'd need more product over a prolonged period of time to truly determine this products effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this product and did not expect it to make a difference. I loved that it made my skin feel so soft and silky. I think I need to use it a little longer to get maximum results but I am very happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay has created another moisturizer to fight signs of aging. Regenerist left my skin feeling smooth and much younger but not sure it's worth price as my regular Olay has same effects. I'd have to try a larger sample to give accurate review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's nice like the other I have tried but the samples are so small that you can't tell if it would work or not so I don't want to purchase it till I know it works for me but overall I like the creamyNess of the products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It works wonders! I love it so much. It really does the trick! At first i wasnt sure if it was working but just give it a couple of weeks, youll definitely see results. Im so happy i decided to just get it. It I give it 5/5 stars!! I hope youll get the same results that i did! :)"
"OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM was one of my favorite skincare that I have used and it took me about around 3 weeks to see results on my face. If you're looking for something to see result less than a month, this a must product for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed sampling this product. I liked the way my skin felt and looked, even after the first application. It made my tired skin look brighter, softer, and smoother. The smell was nice, not too overpowering. It soaked into my skin quickly and did not feel oily. I will buy this and will also try other products in this line.

My skin feels better than ever! I have never really moisturize before as I age I have noticed wrinkles produci I have never really moisturize before as I age I have noticed wrinkles in my brow line and four head I have started researching and products that will eliminate or reduce the wrinkles In my face and make my skin feel and look younger! This product does exactly that ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way this product smells and feels on my skin. It's hard to give a complete review, as I haven't been using for the full 8 weeks, as recommended to see results. I did notice my skin was a little brighter after the first use & I'm excited to see my results after continued use. The only issue is that it made my skin itch a little. I'm usually not at all sensitive to skincare products, so I have no clue what caused it. Still love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product just didn't stand out to me over other brands I have tried at lower costs. If the price were more in my budget I may be more inclined to purchase. The Olay line is popular but not anymore effective than others that are less expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting it s a good product his fast-absorbing moisturizer really does hydrate one's skin. I have been using this cream for 2 day now and I am totally satisfied with the results. This relatively new Olay formula, with a brightening complex, fades the look of dark spots, age spots, sun spots and discoloration even one's overall skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised that this small sample managed to actually might a slight difference. It gave my face a nice glow and I feel that the tone of my skin was slightly more even. I'm really interested in purchasing more of this product, so that I can try it for a longer period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought it absorbed quickly and that it was a matte finish and non-greasy. I'm not 100% how well it moisturized though. I didn't really care for the fragrance. Would prefer a fragrance free version of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this product. I have very dry skin and the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream left my skin hydrated and smooth. I noticed my skin really did have a nice glow to it also. I will definitely be purchasing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using Burts Bees Night moisturizer and Burts Bees Daily moisturizer. Olay regenerist feels about the same. I will have to buy it and add it to my daily routine for long term effects, since it is more for wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First thing I noticed was the soft clean oft clean scent! Then I was happy about how easy it was to apply, it just glided over my skin. It made my skin feel so soft and had a somewhat brighter look to it as well. I was very happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really been loving the results so far. It says that within the first week of use that you should experience more moisture into the skin. I suffer from dry skin so I am always looking for something that will help with that. This product is very good, it is extremely moisturizing. What I like most about this product is that a little bit goes a long way with this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My overall experience trying the Okay perfecting cream was good. I usually just use regular lotion on my face. After using this cream my face very moisturizing, and there wasn't a residue left like how thier is when I use just lotion sometimes. I feel that I'd purchase this product to add into my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Had a really refreshing, light quality to it. It felt cool and did feel as if it gave my skin a more overall tone and a bit of lift. It was not greasy and had a nice, light scent to it without being too perfumed. I would buy this to replace my current cream as it definitely works better, especially in the morning on tired skin!

"Listen, Olay- I like your brand and my mom uses a facial cleanser from your company. But I use a Lush Cosmetics serum on my face because I love the natural and gentle product. Mom might like this product though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't used this long enough to tell you that it does everything as advertised, but I'm willing to give it a try. The feel is light and silky and soaks right it. There is no heavy or greasy feeling. My face feels smooth and hydrated and the smell is very pleasant. Thanks for another winner Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product really, really, really irritated my skin. i only used it once a day for a few days (i can't even imagine using twice a day!). my skin is a mess. really red and so flaky. i have used overnight masks trying to fix it. this may be because i use retin a a couple times a week. and i did accutane last year. so my skin is just still on the dry side and sensitive. it may work well for people with less sensitivity. smelled great though.

OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM was a little thicker than the moisturizer I usually use but it doesn't leave me shiny. I enjoyed the feel of my skin after using it and the smell was very nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive try it for 3 days and what i love of this cream is that it absorbs so quickly compare to my daily moisturizer that keeps me greasy and dont absorb as fast as the oley at the time you apply it its gone to your skin and the scent is soooo sweet totally love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved everything about this product. I was impressed at the way it made my skin feel after using it. I also liked the ease of applying it. I will definitely be purchasing and recommending this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer smells amazing which is one thing I love about it! It feels very nice and smooth on the skin. Since it was a smaller sample I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I would like, but I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not a bad cream. I'm not sure if I got the chance to use it long enougb to see amazing results, but after 2 days, my skin does feel a little smoother. I probably wouldn't buy this much, because I don't have mucb use for it, but it would make for a great ift for my mother! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product tonight. I like the way my face felt afterwards. These products are hard to tell if you like the way they are working with just one sample. I feel you would have to purchase it and use it for a while to really see a big difference. But, I do fell I would purchase and try it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed the smell of this cream and also think it moisturized decently enough but I do not think I would buy this product. I'm beginning to break out a little from it and I am not to excited about some of the artificial dyes used in the cream. I much prefer my current moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a trial product and it seemed to be fast absorbing and non-greasy. Went on smooth and makes the face feel smoother. Thinking about getting a bigger size and give it more time to see the results claimed by others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It feels nice on my skin. Its hard to tell if its actually gonna doing anything as I only have one sample and the product says on its label you have to use it for 2 weeks in a row to see the effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizing cream is so great. It smells so great that I can't wait to put it on. It smells very fresh and it feels so cool when you apply it to your skin. It definitely leaves a glow to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is a Good Quality Product. The Cream is Silky Smooth and glides on nicely as well. I could instantly see a difference in my skin after applying the cream. Wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I only had a small sample pack of this and it didn't have directions so I applied once a day. I'm a side sleeper and have lines under my eyes when I smile. Don't know if I see a change in the appearance of my wrinkles yet but love how soft and moisturized my skin feels so I would be interested in trying it for longer to see if it helps with my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I do think a skincare products take time to work and with such a smal sample I don't not think I will see if this product truly has enough skincare properties to justify purchasing the full sized product however I have used Olay products in the past and they do work pretty well for the price point over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream really is wonderful. Usually I try most everything for my (old) skin and am disappointed. However, this was not the case with Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. It practically melts into my skin, and the affects are immediate. What a great feeling to finally find something that works like it says it does! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed trying this product. It was hydrating and lived up to its luminous name all at once. I would caution those with more oily skin from using this product, as applying a product that has a sheen to it can add to the already oily nature of skin.

"I really am thankful I got the chance to sample the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti Aging Micro Sculpting Moisturizer. It made my skin feel soft, smooth and wonderful. After using this sample I will be replacing my current moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have yet to come across an Olay product that I didn't like so I'm a general fan of the brand. I haven't heard of this particular line before so was really glad to try it! Will purchase the full one to see if it'll continue to improve my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried a sample of it, and really seemed to like it! Although i really like the products that i am currently using depending on the price i might be switching. It smells better than others i have used in the past, and keeps my face moisturized! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream feels great - very smooth and creamy. I like the moisture that it added to my skin. The sample was small so I'll need to purchase more to see what the results are over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What can I say... I LOVE this product. After only two days of usage I could see my skin evening out. Let me tell you when you see rosey cheek people, I am at the highly rosey end. Even sometimes with just splotches of redness. In two days I was able to see a noticeable difference (trust me I took picture evidence) :) I would highly recommend this product to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream showed promising results with long term use. I just received a small sample tube. But I noticed a difference with fine lines around my eyes.. It smells really nice and absorbed well.. I was happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I this is just okay. I don't feel like it's better than what I am using now. The small sample isn't enough for me to really test it out, I'd have to use it for at least 2 months to really see any significant results. I'd actually have to go buy a full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Goes on great and have yet to see real noticeable affects but I don't expect them with the small sample I received. I intend to purchase and continue as a daily routine. This goes on smooth and doesn't sit on the surface leaving a residue type feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using olay and never have problems with it. However, after using this luminous moisturizer, I've had couple breakouts in my face which is very unusual. I still love Olay products despite my skins reaction with Luminous. I am currently using the regenerist micro sculpting and I'll stay with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think i like the product but it wasn't enough for me to know if it actually was good go my skin or not because it was very little that it nearly covered my face like two times and it's not enough to see if it really works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was absolutely amazed with this product. I got my free sample of it and I loved it! I enjoyed how nice it felt on my skin and how nice it looked after applying it. This will defiantly be my go to in the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like this product. It makes my skin feel so soft and I have noticed the dark spots getting lighter. I like how it makes my skin feel. It's so refreshing! Also my skin looks brighter! I want my skin to look fresh and I believe this will make my skin look younger! So far my dark sun spots are losing the dark color hopefully no it will go away completely! Against n I love how it makes my skin feel ... So soft and refreshing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product felt good and smelled good on my face, but then I noticed that it rubbed off in little balls/flakes. That's a pretty bad quality for something that goes on the face, and will likely have to look good with makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"loved it, made my skin feel so soft.the scent was very fresh,not over-powering.Very easy to apply,not a thick heavy feeling on my face very smooth.I will be purchasing this in the near future and letting family and friends know about it.I have always purchased Olay products and they just keep getting better.

Nice baby pink fresh scent face moisturizer that was not greasy or sticky. I am currently happy with my current face moisturizer since I tend to use more moisturizers made with natural ingredients but this moisturizer smelled really nice and I liked that it left my face soft. I would recommend this product since it was a decent face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product! You can see the effects immediately! My skin looked much more radiant right away. I smells AMAZING! It goes on like silk and makes your skin feel so smooth.

"I usually like most Olay moisturizers, but this one has a very strong scent that kind of irritates my allergies. I really like how it seems to instantly reduce some of my redness which is a plus. I don't find it as moisturizing as some of their other skin care items. It also makes my sensitive skin a little bit clogged. Overall I like the effect it has, I just haven't figured out it I like it with my skin yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt revived and refreshed with this product it did not leave my face feeling greasy or shiny related to my oily skin.

"The biggest thing I look for in a moisturizer is to which dries my skin without a greasy feelI got, and without breaking me out. I loved how smooth my skin felt after using this moisturizer. Is a nice clean feel, it was not greasy at all and I have not had any breakouts. Overall I think it is a great moisturizer for all skin types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a really good moisturizer. It applies really well if you use a light touch. The application is more even if you wash your face first. I used it at night only; it tended to cause streaks when I applied foundation over it. I also prefer a moisturizer with a sunscreen. I am looking forward to using it longer to see if it fades dark spots and evens the skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the scent of this product and also liked the way it made my face feel after application. I am interested in finding out the cost difference between this product and my current product. That will probably be the deciding factor as to whether I switch products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is an awesome facial cream. It has helped my skin be exactly as its name implies, more luminous. My skin feels smoother, my tone is becoming more uniform, and my face in general looks brighter and younger. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to love the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream. However I developed a skin reaction where It made my skin itch and burn. Everyone is different in how react to a product. I love Olay but this one just isn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay is a product that I could definitely trust. Regenerist feels great on my face. You shouldn't wait to until you get older to start taking care of your skin. And Olay Regenerist is a great place to start. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. It feels light on the skin without that residue feeling. The sample I received wasn't enough for long term use so long term effects weren't noticed. It was very moisturizing and the scent was light. I wouldn't replace it with my regular moisturizer but I would definitely use it in addition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think this might be better for someone else. I have normal to combo skin, and I got terrible break outs on my chin from this. Even after cleansing and applying this, I noticed small bumps all over my face immediately. I did try it for a full two weeks (Funny enough, I did buy it before I even signed up for Pinch Me) and my skin was terrible the entire time. It might be better for someone with dry skin.

"I was surprised when i try this moisturizer the first time , the application it's really smooth , it has an almost non scent wich I personally love on my facial products and the day after i use it my skin feels amazing and so soft !

It was difficult to review this product. I did like it but the sample. Was so small there was not enough for me to really have time to notice any results.It was enough for a one time use.I am sure I will try it in the future.It is a nice smooth product.

"As I was applying this product it felt like I was rubbing course sand or salt on my face. Then the burning, tingling sensation set in. I couldn't get it off my face fast enough. I have used toning creams before and I have never experienced this type of reaction before. Even if I hadn't experienced a reaction, the odor of the cream would have prevented me from using it again. It smelled like soured milk. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I gave it to my mom to use. She said it feels and smells good when you use it. However, the sample had 2-3 days worth of cream. So she thought it worked but was not very sure because after a couple of days she was back using her regular cream. She would liked to use the product but since its expensive she will not buy it without being 100% sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have gotten used to using serums that being able to sample an Olay product was exciting for me. I love that it did not leave a sticky residue on my skin. It was absorbed by my skin instantly. I hope to see and feel more difference on my skin if I add this to my skin regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
To start off I will say I love this product. I love the smell and the way it came in the package. I'd have to say the best thing I love is the smell and how easy it was to use. I do recommend this but I couldn't give it 5 stars because I could only use it for a couple days do to a reaction. If I didn't experience this I would of given it all stars.

"So Ive never used a toning moisturizer b3fore , so I dont know what to expect and when to be able to see notices. My sample was too small to conclude my opinion.

"I didnt have enough of the perfecting cream to really gain an opinion on whether it ""perfected"" my tone or not so I cant comment on that but it smelled nice and I like Olay products. I also felt it was light on the skin which was nice. I would consider purchasing a full size if I had a coupon to actually try and see if it did perfect skin tone.

This had a nice scent and really moisturized your skin. Also made your skin feel really smooth. I would have to use it a bit more to see if it helped with other things but I do like that it came in an actual sample squeeze tube and not a foil packet and there was 0.24 oz instead of 0.02 oz of another face cream sample that I received at the same time. I feel like I can actually get a feel of how it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is going to sound a little strange, But it's true... I liked this product especially the scent of it but, when i put it on it hurt my skin. Maybe because i have acne, I don't know but. I don't plan on buying it because I could get a different moisturizer that doesn't hurt my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
With the name like Olay you expect the product to be good and I was not disappointed. I love the fact that my skin doesn't feel greasy and my skin really soaked up this product. I love how it makes my skin look. I use it under my foundation to have that extra dewiness all day long. I am hooked especially after all the compliments.. Great product!!!!

OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM was not very appealing to me. I liked the other Olay sample much better. I didn't like this one as much.My skin didn't have the results like I did with the other Olay. I don't think this is a bad product. I do feel that you should try it for yourselves to see if it works for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This Olay cream is really gentle on my skin and it makes my skin feel refreshed and new. It gives my skin this nice new glow to it. Also the scent smells really good not like some other creams I used before. The smell is great and a really big plus for me. This product shows great results extremely happy with it.

I've only used tye product for a couple days and can see and feel a differnce. I am pregnant and my skin tone has changed. It is spotty and has dark splotches.

I tired the OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM mainly on my neck and face and I liked the feel and it absorbed well into my skin.

"I used this for the first time in the evening before bed and, when I woke up, my skin was VERY dry. The product had also beaded on my skin so there was funky clumps of it around my jawline and chin.

"I enjoyed trying this product. It smelled great and made my skin feel smooth. It was easy to apply and I only had to use a little of the product yet it still glided over my skin. However, I didn't notice any additional changes to my skin that it claimed like tone perfecting. I would still get it again because it was a great basic moisturizer.

I felt my face after washing it so I'll know the difference once I applied the cream. My face was pretty dry and cracked because of my acne and eczema. Within a half of an hour I noticed my face softened up a lot. I'm looking forward to seeing how much this product brightens my face by next week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was pleased with the size and packaging of this sample. The tube allowed easier dispensing of the sample compared to little foil packets, and the amount of product was enough to make a more informed judgement.

"I was happy to receive OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM in my PINCHme box and I like the idea of ""tone perfecting"" but with such a small sample I am unable to tel if it truly works or not because I would need to use it for a much longer time. I did like the feel and scent, and would purchase it if it didn't cost so much. I do not want to spend that much just to see if it will work or not. A bigger sample would have made a huge difference for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product. It has good overall feeling and texture. I liked the way it covered my skin. The cream gave my skin a very soft and even toned appearance. Good overall product that does what it is intended to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this moisturizer for a few days after getting a sample and I saw results within 4 days. I have a lot of freckles, which I don't mind, but this cream reduced the appearance of them very quickly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a bad problem with my dry skin and a couple of dark spots, I know this. But, on the first application, the dry skin just peeled away under my fingers, revealing softer skin underneath! A day later, it's still nice! I'm looking forward to getting rid of the age spots! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Oh my goodness! I have been trying some very expensive moisturizers over the past few months and have been very disappointed. IMMEDIATELY upon application of the olay product my face felt as smooth as velvet! And the smell was so nice! It is no wonder okay has been around so long. They are really on top of the their game. Now I am interested in trying their prox product as I am very self conscious of wrinkles at 56. Wonderfully pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the scent of this product it's clean and fresh. After I applied the cream to my face, my skin was so soft. After using this product for a few days I could tell a difference in my skins tone, and the little lines caused from dry skin where gone. Over all, I really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So glad I received this sample,if not I would not have went out and bought a full size bottle. I love how it did not leave my face feeling oily would recommend to anyone looking for a grea skin care cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was definitely surprised when this product actually worked on my skin. I have weird skin, dark circles, and weird coloring in a couple of areas. I used this twice and could see a difference in the tone of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I generally love Olay products, but found the scent of this one to be cloying and sweet. Since there are other products I already like, there's no need to force myself to use this one. I liked the lightweight feel, but had to wash it off within the hour as the scent just never calmed down. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was okay, but I have very very very dry skin, on my face mostly! This sample was okay but I feel like it didn't reach to my level of moisturizing my other facial cream did. It helped a little but still felt dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Olay product line and I love the way it makes your face feel mosturized but not oily. My face felt soft and smooth the first time appling it but I have not used it long enough to see the true effects of the tone perfecting side of it but I feel confident in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have some skin discoloration so I was eager to sample this product. I put it on it was extremely silky, and the smell was very clean. I've yet to see it improve my skin discoloration but I really like it as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed trying OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTING CREAM. It felt so smooth and silky when I applied it and worked great under my makeup during the day. Some creams tend to 'flake' for me when I try to apply foundation over it -- this one doesn't. It absorbs into the skin and seems to create a perfect base for foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a huge fan of using moisturizer as a base for my foundation, this was light weight, smelled great didn't make me break out and all around worth while, would purchase in store if the price was right [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LOVE THIS! I am so sensitive to products on my skin and this had NO negative effect on my skin after using it.I love the feel of the product and the creamy consistency. The feeling of the product on my skin was amazing and I loved the toning effect it had. I usually have a bit of pink undertone and it actually masked that a bit! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product today by mail but as soon as I got my pinch me box I couldn't wait to try olay regenerist I actually really like this product and I am planning to buy it because I actually like it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moistrurizer works awesome! I suffer from both ezcema and psoriasis and I have to buy so many different moistrurizers to find one that will work for my problem skin. This product is actually clearing up a severe eczema psoriasis patch I have on the back of my neck. It's almost all cleared up and I've only been using the tone perfecting moisturizer for a week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did have a good experience when using this product. The texture of the product is very smooth and absorbs nicely into the skin. This is great for people who wear makeup and do not want their moisturizer to ruin it. I am not thrilled with the product though. The sample size did not allow for me to test whether or not the product evens skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't generally have super-sensitive skin or anything and I was very interested in trying this product, because I'm in the market for a new facial moisturizer, but this product definitely irritated my skin. (Can't tell for sure whether it was just irritating or I was actually having a sensitivity to it. I liked the squeeze tube (I prefer that to tubs) and it wasn't too strong smelling or anything. I would definitely have continued to try it, if my skin hadn't reacted badly to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely loved this moisturizer! This is not greasy and left my face feeling very soft! The product also has a very good scent. I was extremely happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There wasn't enough product in the sample to make a legitimate decision- it was okay, but it is heavily scented. Smelt almost like perfume. I don't think I would purchase unless the results after using for a few weeks were tremendous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product!! I have been using this right now for 3 days and my skin is already so soft and stays like that all the time. All you need is a little bit on the face and your smooth like a baby's buttom [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried so many products to get my skin back to what it used to look like a few years ago and nothing has been working. This however, does the trick. It goes on lightly and doesn't make you oil up after use. I definitely recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this lotion. It made my face softer than any product that I've used in a long time. I believe this works just as well as some of the high end products I've purchased before , but at a much cheaper price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this product does make your skin more picture perfect. The reason I say this is because it actually is blending my skin to match the rest an that's only a weeks use. Its incredible I'm most certainly going to buy this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Usually when I go for a moisturizer or face cream I go for the unscented fragrance . I don't like how this made my face smell extra perfumy! I usually use my rose petal toner and a moisturizer. But this cream made my face feel tingly. For anyone who prefers more natural smelling products this is NOT FOR US! But I like the idea of the product! Because of the smell alone and the tingly sensation I will NOT use this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I liked how after I cleaned my face, the moisturizing agent made my face feel fresher. After using the bottle, I found some significant changes but nothing super different. Possibly if I buy the bigger jar, it would do better. However, the moisturizer did change how soft my face was. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have dry skin so I usually use a vasiline creme on my face and neck. I tried the OLAY REGENERIST LUMINOUS TONE PERFECTing creme and I was very pleased with the results.

"This product is good to use at night. Well at least for my skin it is. I literally just applied it after I washed my face for the night. So far I like it. It didn't burn or irritate my skin, as I tend to have sensitive skin towards new products. I only applied a dime sized amount and dotted it on my forehead, cheeks, nose and chin and then rubbed it in. So far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"First thing first . The first thing I do when I first tryout a new product like shampoos or lotions is to SMELL. If it doesn't have a decent scent, I probably wouldn't want to use it. The Olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream smells great. It's very light and airy. Once it was on my face it glides on easy and doesn't feel greasy . It's been a few days so no visable changes to the skin. But it does feels nice once it's on. I think that this Olay product is worth the try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This morning was the first day I tried the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream and only using a little dab on my finger I was able to use it on my entire face. I paid close attention to my problem areas around my eyes. My face is oily naturally but this product did not add any more additional oils to my skin at all. As far as changing or perfecting my skin tone I'll report on that once I've completed the tube. I'm liking it so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

So I want to start off by saying I wish I had more of the sample to give it a thorough review but so far so good. I love the smell and consistency of the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. Tonight after I washed my face I applied this cream and I will say that the finish to me is similar to a primer. It didn't leave the hydrating feeling I was looking for but I will try again in the morning under my makeup to see if I feel a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"So upon receiving my Bzzkit I was super excited about this moisturizer because I've been looking for a good one. So the day I was supposed to go take pictures I used this after my cleanser and before I applied my makeup, then again that night before bed. Now I have these red splotchy bumps on my face! I'm obviously not happy at all. I will say my skin was soft and makeup went on smooth and the smell is lovely but I had an adverse reaction and that's just my experience thus far.

Love the results. I've always had insecurities with my uneven skin tone and this toner is fixing it one step at a time. It's lightweight and doesn't feel caked on. 10/10. I feel like you should buy this if you have an uneven skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have never used a toner in my life. Boy was that a mistake! Thanks to BzzAgent and Olay I got the pleasure of being able to try something I never thought of buying. What a difference this product made for me. Today as I got out the shower I was eager to put this on. I usually apply a small amount of lotion on my face but I put the toner on and it is so light and not greasy! After I use it all up I'm going tothe store and getting more.

I think this product is super smooth and makes the skin feel well hydrated and young. It's crucial in a cold climate like here in Michigan. This time of the year is hard on the skin and this went on nice and light and spread really evenly. I've enjoyed using it and found it to be very refreshing though I believe it will take consistent use to see visible differences in the brightness of my skin.

First i want to start with i don't have a problem with olay products by they don't work. The only problem i do have is the texture. It always feels powdery. Second the product smells great. Besides the powdery feel it goes on smooth. Its light weight. Doesnt give off the feel of clog pores. Just one use my skin feels hydrated and soft. Can't quit judge any toning till i give this product 1 full week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It had a subtle smell to it thats not too overpowering and i like that i didn't have to use much for full coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My skin baseline is good. Adding this moisturizer to my daily regimen just made my skin soft hydrated and smooth finish. I substituted my usual moisturizers with Olay. It feels good when applying foundation on it. On my 3rd day of application that's my conclusion. It's supposed to remove age/sunspots but I haven't given it enough time. So I will keep you updatef. #gotitforfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think that this moisturizer was pretty good. When I put it on my skin, it felt like silk afterwards! I was pretty impressed with it. It was lightweight and didn't make my skin oily or greasy. The reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because about an hour after I applied it, my skin was dry again. It didn't feel like I put anything on my skin! I do have dry skin, so I'm sure that's why. If I had more normal skin or even oily skin it would work better for me personally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I normally don't use face moisturizers with fragrance, because of my sensitive skin, but this product was an exception. When I first opened the cap, I was intrigued by the delicate smell. After washing my face and applying, it instantly caused my face and neck to feel smooth. I will purchase a full bottle in the near future, and wished that I receive a full sample, Thanks.

"I am not an avid user of Olay products but this tone perfecting cream caught my eye because I battle with uneven skin tone. It usually takes up to a month for a product to start showing any signs of effectiveness but this product does show potential. I quite frankly have only been using this product for the past couple of days. It hasn't been up to a week but like I said earlier, this product shows potential.

"The first thing i noticed about the product is a little goes a long way. I only needed a dime size of product. The consistency is not to thick and it has a smooth finish, The product is light and not greasy. After using Olay tone Perfecting cream i did notice my face was moisturized and it felt smooth. Olay also has a slight fragrance but it is not irritating. I do believe i would by this product based on how my skin felt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I've only had the product for 2 days now and I've only got to try it out for two days so far... Overall I like it so far I don't have no complaints except that the sample that I did receive is so extremely small that I'm using it sparingly so that I may be able to use it for quite a few days to get an actual honest review on the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like this stuff. It works well enough to make my skin soft and smooth. I love how it blends into my skin well and I don't feel like I have to use a lot of it to see results. It has a light scent which is pleasant and not overbearing. It's also moisturizing but not overly. The only thing I don't like about the product is its consistency. It was a bit runny to me. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin or dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think the product is awesome. Works really well with my type of skin. Because my skin is super sensitive, certain products either don't work or break my skin out. This product actually helps. My skin is usually dry so I didn't know of any good products that kept it moisturized until I tried this one. It works really well and I'd recommend to anyone with dry skin that needs a little moisturizing! It was a pleasure trying out something new! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think this cream has a possibility of being great but the sample I received was so little I got 1 good wash out of it . It did foam up nicely & left no film on my face after & felt nice on my face . Too bad I couldn't get a better feel of the product . I did price it in stores & for the price I would not get it again since I couldn't even tell if it would work [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried this cream for the first time when i got the sample in my Buzz kit. My skin is fairly normal, but i do suffer from sun spots and I am always searching for a cream to help minimize the appearance of my dark spots. I used this cream and my skin felt amazing afterwords. It gave my skin a beautiful glow and kept me very hydrated overnight. It smells amazing too and did not irritate my skin at all.

I only tried a small amount after receiving it from one of my subscription boxes. I did get 4 good days out of it and I think it worked pretty well from what I could tell and with the time I had to use it. This is a nice face product in the winter because sometimes my face can get a little dry in the colder months. I also fill like it plumped up the area's around my eyes where I am sadly getting very fine lines. I would buy again.
no other product is as good as olay ive used product after product nothing will never stand before olay products try them there the best thanks olay keep them coming if you use just one time you will ee what i mean olay makes your skin feel baby soft i love feeling soft as a new born baby so thanks olay
"I tried to put less product on my skin, like I've read in some comments, but, I still having issues with some white residue. I'm trying less expensive products like nivea moisturizer now and it works, no matter how much product I put on, no white stuff on my face."
"I am so disappointed by this! I used more than 10 jars of this and my dark spots are still there. I live in CA, so I think, this face lotion needs a high SPF protection in its formula... because without it, it is actually useless! I spend money on this for nothing! The sun still does some damage!"
I love this product but not sure if anyone else is experiencing the same effects. After applying just a small amount of luminous moisturizer it leaves a white residue all over my skin..almost like flakes..very disappointed. Not sure if am using too much but doubt it..other products like the pro x line does the same thing to me?? Probably won't buy again
I am writing this review to let Olay know I love the Rengenrist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! Please do not take this product off the market. I can tell a difference in the freshness to the look of my skin. My skin looks vibrant. This product does not cause breakout as most other moisturizer do. The scent is show and appealing to the senses.
"Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream made my skin feel rehydrated and seemed to me to smooth out my skin tone. I felt it was much more affordable than many department store creams I have used and I felt it was a product well worth repurchasing.. At my age, I feel I am searching for the impossible, the illusive ""fountain of youth."" Time takes its toll, but this product made me feel as good as possible and that is probably the best I can expect.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product. I tried this perfecting cream at a store and immediately felt the smooth silky feeling. I have always used OLAY product but by far this one is my favorite. After washing my face with Olay bar I smear this cream all over. My face which feels dry and tight immediately gets this smooth silky feeling and if I can say I feel younger! When I forget to put it on and leave my house I don't want to be seen by anyone cause I feel old tired looking! Love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream goes on so smoothly and feels light and airy. As the summer months approach, a lighter touch is comfortable and quick to apply. As women age, the skin requires a bit more maintenance to keep skin moisturized, natural and vibrant looking. Olay does a beautiful job in smoothing and evening out irregular skin tones caused by age spots and sun exposure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the regenerist luminous tone sculpting moisturizer as part of a free box from a product testing website and I instantly fell in LOVE with this moisturizer. I used every last drop of it. It made my skin feel so healthy at the end of the day. I will definitely be repurchasing this product and including it in my daily beauty routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olalla!! I really love this cream,I used it everyday. I noticed a good result the first week I was using it , my skin is really smooth and gentle and a lot of my friends notice it so I told them this product,my skin is glowing and it makes me more beautiful and confident!! So what are you waiting for?! Grab one now!"
"Been using this cream for almost 2 years,This last May I was 76 year old,and do not look 1 day older than 60. my Son tells me that i look younger than some of his friends :-) he is 54, I have used Oil of Olay from the age of 21 and I know that this product worked well for me!

I am a 2nd generation Oil of Olay user. My Mom started using this product in the late 60's and was the only product she used until 2009. I have used different Olay products and love them but I found Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream creates a luminous texture to my face and neck. It's light but penetrates my skin making less small lines and plumping up my skin. I love the dewy glow and at 58 and looking 48 it's all Oil of Olay!

I had used micro sculpting cream forever but felt it a little heavy for daytime use. The tone perfecting luminous does just what is says and yet is creamy enough for use at night also = double blessing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have religiously used Oil of Olay every night for many years. It leaves my skin moisturized and glowing. I don't like going without. People always ask me what I use on my skin and are shocked when they find out my age. It definitely makes a difference. I even use it on my tween daughter's skin. It's never too early to start!""

"I have used the Complete line for moisturizing for the last 10 yrs. My sister gave me a jar of the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream to try. (she is older than me ;o)) The first time I tried it, I immediately fell in love with it. It made my face and neck feel sooooo soft. I cannot be without it. I recommend it to all my friends, even the younger ones! Thank you for making it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product goes on and feels amazing - not sticky, or smelly. It makes my skin feel so nice. The only issue I have had is that sometimes my Olay CC cream does not go on well over it, it doesn't stay on. I have solved this by turning this into a night cream, or using it on my neck and decollete only, and using the Regenerist SPF 50 lotion under my make up, which works very well.

"I saw results in the first month. I had a lot of dark marks left behind from horrible acne. In the first 2 weeks I noticed the dark marks were lighter. By the end of the first 30 days most of the dark marks were gone. By the end of the second month all the dark marks were gone. I was over joyed, and very satisfied with the results. I was so impressed I began using it on my neck and chest. Very impressed with the results. I have a clear, glowing, youthful face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so happy to see the positive results in my facial skin within 4 weeks! I have always been a 'sun worshipper' and I always will be. The product does what it says, and because of my first hand positive experience using it, I will continue using this product knowing that I will receive it's great results! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
We will want instant gratification and the thought of actually trying something and sticking with it for more than five days 10 days or even 30 days it's hard to do. I actually can say I noticed a difference in the product almost immediately the next day my skin felt better look better and had a different look and texture. I'm excited to say at 45 I feel like I got my glow back and it's all because of this product thank you for giving proof in a package and making it work.

I have enjoyed using this product for several months. My face has several sun spots or darker spots that I believe are blending in better with my regular skin tone and getting lighter the more I use the product. Also it feels so soft to my skin and has such a nice consisitency that I also feel better moisturized as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product! After only one week of using the Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, I saw noticable improvement in both the tone of my skin and even less wrinkles and was complimented on how young I look by my husband! It's definately a keeper in my daily beauty regiment! I am anxious to see more fabulous results in the continuation of using Olays Regenerist products!!!

This product provides the results it says it will. I have sun-damaged and chemo stressed skin. I have been looking for a product to turn back the hands of time along with being gentle enough to manage my aggravated chemo skin. Olay products fit the bill perfectly. So happy with my skin looking better and better all the time. Thank you Olay for making gentle yet effective products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product does exactly what it says it will. I am 68, so spots have been appearing all over my face and the color uneven. This evens it out and makes my skin even toned. It also gives your skin a soft, smooth hydrated feel. I love all of the Regenerist products and use them. I find they are the best at keeping my skin the way I want it to be. I would be lost without them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the new line of Luminous products! The tone perfecting cream makes my face feel so soft and moisturized. Most important for me, it really has faded my age spots. This is the first cream I have tried that really reduced the darkness of my age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In my younger years I didn't protect my skin from the sun like i should have. I gave this product a try and after about 2 weeks i did notice the sun spots diminish. While i do still have the spots, they are lighter in color and my skin is silky smooth. It is a staple in my morning regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a creamy, lightweight feel to it. I've received several compliments on my skin after using it a few weeks. Not that my skin was in horrible condition, because I've used Olay products since I was 16, but there is a difference, healthy look to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay does it again with an outstanding moisturizer that is light as a breeze, but works overtime brightening and removing those pesky aging brown marks. I love the entire Regenerist line, but love this moisturizer the most. Plump, even skin tone, flawless! Love it!"
"Just a drop of this cream makes my skin feel alive,soft and youthful. Regenerist soaks in and blends with the skin. Others feel like they coat the top layer but do not penetrate. You don't need much, therefore, it lasts a long time before having to repurchase. There is nothing else like it and i have tried many. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product gives spectacular results! I had a large ""age spot"" on my cheek and in a few weeks, it disappeared! Finally a product that keeps its promise! I have been using this product on my hands to make them look younger too. I'm hoping Olay will develop a formula for hands and body.....Are you listening Olay?..

I've been using the Regenerist for about 4 months and the cream seems to be the finishing touch to getting smoother looking skin. Your face seems to get a gentle polishing/smoothing look. it also hydrates and moisterizes at the same time without being greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is just what I was looking for. My mother has been using Olay since I was a little girl and I grew up using it for a while (Oil of Olay). Now it is a treat to have such a vast choice of Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had a very rough patch on my face and I began to use the regs deist pore sculpting cream and after about 2 weeks the pores got smaller and the rough patch disappeared and makeup was a pleasure to put on. I looked great and my face feels great! Love regenerist! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a few sun spots & freckling on my face. I used the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream for about 3 weeks. I was able to tell that the sun spots & freckling had noticeably lightened. It's a great moisturizer too!! I highly recommend this product for anyone who desires luminous skin!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am into my six weeks using this product and I already noticed that some of the dark spots on my face have disappeared. This product moisturizes my skin all day and my face is soft and silky to the touch. Another improvement that I noticed is my skin pores are getting smaller.

"I've always loved the Olay skincare line, but I LOVE the Luminous products! Since using the tone perfecting cream I've noticed my skin looking younger. It not only helps exfoliate dead skin, but hydrate and brighten my face, even the dark circles under my eyes! Thanks Olay for this skincare line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been searching for a product to tone and revitalize my brown skin. This product has done wonders to fade my dark spots, while improving my entire complexion. Every women of color should have this product within their skin care routine. The cream is light, and airy and a little goes a long way. You will not be disappointed but the results.

"I've been using this product for a couple of months now and it is by far the best product I have ever used. After cleansing each night, I apply this product and my face feels velvety smooth instantly. No greasiness, no irritation and great results. I've seen a definite change in evenness of tone and smoothing of wrinkles & lines. My skin loves this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the tone perfecting cream. I have a sensitive-combo-oily/dry skin type. I use this in the morning and before I go to bed; after I've washed with Olay Age Defying cream cleanser, and closed my pores with the toner. Trust me; this product is worth every penny! The product is not oily nor does it irritate my skin. Furthermore, it brightens and illuminates my face. I feel 100% more beautiful when I use it! Thanks Olay!

"At almost 37 and with a very sensitive skin, I have always had issues with getting a cream that will not make my skin break out and that will help reduce the dark spots on my face. With Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, my skin is incredibly soft and brighter, it does not make my skin break out and it helps my skin look great. The best part is, I started seeing positive changes in less than one week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay products for a long time. I started when the only Olay product was the very basic moisturizer. Since that time I have used many of the different categories of product. Currently I am using the Regenerist line and just love the luminous tone perfecting cream. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I use it under makeup and it is never too oily. Just want to say I have been in love with Olay for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this since the product came out in the stores.It fades out the dark spots,age spots and evens out the skin tone.It is non greasy and you get healthy looking skin in about eight weeks.It is worth the price you have to pay for it.Your face looks so much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used regular Regenerist moisturizing lotion for years and was very happy with the results. I have been using Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream now for almost a year. I am amazed at how wonderful my skin looks. I always get complements when people find out how old I am. I love it!!! Thanks Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this cream for over a year and it really makes a difference in my complexion. If feels and looks smoother and people can't believe that I'm 71 years old! I will keep using it until I'm 101!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As I get older I noticed dark and light skin on my face. the Regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream helps a lot with the discolored skin. I would love to try all the Olay products. They are a little to pricey for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is outstanding! It is so creamy and lushes it makes my face so soft and smooth! I am a senior and Ive never had such soft facial skin. It feels smooth and soft like a babies skin! I use the luminous cleanser first then the Perfecting cream. It hydrates and moisturizes and I Look younger and don""t have any wrinkles on my face. I will use this forever! Its a Keeper! Thank You Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Regenerist products for many years. Recently I decided to try Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream as my moisturizer and I am loving this product. My skin just drinks it up and leaves my face feeling so soft and supple. At my age this is a real plus for my very dry skin and is already making my complexion look much softer and more even in tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have blotchy, sensitive skin and the Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream is the best product I have tried (and I have tried MANY!) Is NON IRRITATING, goes on smooth and silky and feels GOOD and NOT HEAVY on my face! Also I have noticed it actually IMPROVES the look of my uneven skin! I only wish it had a SPF in it so I don't have to wear 2 moisturizers when I go outside. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one product that lives up to its press. If it had sunscreen it would be perfect. I could actually see my face get brighter as the days progressed. It goes on easily. I prefer the tubs to the pumps, because I like knowing exactly how much I have in the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has definitely helped fade brown spots & even my skin tone and at 65 everyone tells me I look more like 55! Not only that, but it feels and smells wonderful going on and not sticky or stinky! :) I am addicted to all Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the absolute best product that gives my skin a luminous glow. I truly fell in love with the results. My skin looks so bright and beautiful. I have now even tried the overnight mask and what a pleasant surprise. The both of these together are marvelous. The look and feel of my skin is truly wonderful.

"Been using Olay lotions & creams seems like forever. Have switched off here & there, but always come back to Olay. Seems to be the brand my skin reacts too. Love the feel of the hydrating creme after washing my face. Feels refreshed & smooth. The tone perfecting cream great after a shower. Makes my skin clearer & it's not greasy. The night moisturizer seems to calm the dry flaky parts of my skin. Love these products, wouldn't leave home without them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using the usual regenerist microsculpt on the red container for a while but needed a little more 'oomph' to help erase the dullness that had set in. The Tone Perfecting cream really lived up to its promise - even out the skin tone, minimize small discolorations and fine lines, especially around the eyes and mouth. My skin feels healthier and fairly glows even if I don't use face makeup, only the cream. I use it at night, too. An exceptional product at an affordable price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I super love it! I was using the regenerist micro sculpting cream but the luminous is so much better. I've been looking a product that can minimize my pores & can brighten my dark spots. I can tell that this is the one. Thanks luminous! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The luminous tone perfecting cream makes your skin so soft. I have not noticed all that much difference in tone and if you are looking for a wrinkle reducer you should probably go with the regular regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used olay for aprox 35+ yrs. recently I started using the regenerist line and wow!! Can you see a difference. Not all my wrinkles are gone but a lot if them are. I will continue to use this product. It's wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Regenerist Luminous Collection has been amazing for my skin. The Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream has evened out my skin tone making it so I don't need a heavy foundation to look polished. I will continue to add other Regenerist luminous products to my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
At age 52 I seem to have developed more issues with uneven skin tones and I have found Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream helps to decrease their appearance and brighten up my overall facial tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always loved Olay products... and they are improving all the time. The Olay Luminous Tome Perfecting Cream has become one of my favorites. It leaves my skin feeling smooth with an added glow that I had lost over the years. Thanks for continuing to make wonderful products for us. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought the regenerist for the first time. Was not sure what to expect, it cost a little more than what I usually use but needed something new. Was highly pleased, it felt so good on my skin and within a few days looked so much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Regenerist for years and decided to try the Luminous Tone Perfecting to see what it would do on some sun damage to my cheeks and foreheads. I was pleasantly surprised at how much it lightened the dark spots! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since using this product (and any other of Olay's products) there is no place I go where someone doesn't tell me what beautiful skin I have. I always proclaim with boldness that it is because of Oil of Olay. As a matter of fact, I am going to be 63 in a couple of months and people I meet or have known for years comment on how I don't look much past 45. The few wrinkles I do have are invisible unless I use a magnifying mirror. I say ""Ole"" to Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I switched to this product after having terrible results from a high end store brand, and it repaired my skin in no time. I will always use it. I have tried lots of products, and though some work, usually they are so highly scented my eyes react badly and I have to discontinue. Not so with this Luminous product. Just wish there was a version with SPF in it."
My skin used to look so dry and old from acne medication but Olay has turned my skin around to a younger and brighter complexion. I have tried so many face creams trying to clear up my complexion from dark spots due to acne scarring but with my skin being so sensitive I would always have a breakout. I also have not had a acne breakout since I've been using Olay. I am so pleased with this product!!
"I cleanse n then apply this cream generously it's moisturizing then later in half hour skinn is very dry , I cannot again use this cream it comes out a white soft flakes ..I have been using nearly 3 weeks trying to experiment different methods to apply alone or with other moisturizing cream but no use..the smell n colour is awesome plz suggest some ways to apply ..I want this to work for me.."
I have only been using this moisturizer and the oil that I bought with it for a few days and people are asking me what I am doing because I look younger. I have always used the UV moisturizer and been satisfied but these two products together appear to work miracles.
Keeps my skin hydrated and redness from my psoriasis around my nose and cheekbones is calmed down
i am using it everyday before i go to sleep .day by day my skin looks healthy
It could be more of sample if they put more in it I mean I didn't cover my whole face but probably half of it I mean I have that I do got it it's okay
"I love Luminous Oil of Olay! My skin felt great after using! The fragrance was clean. I wouldn't say your wrinkles disappear or become less refined, it's not a time machine, but your skin does feel great after using it!"
It made my sensitive skin burn a little and I had to wash it off. I didn't love this one but my skin is pretty finicky so don't hold my opinion against this if you are a fan of Olay products!
Olay Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream goes on smooth and not greasy. I hope that with prolonged use I find that it will fade my dark spots. I've read other reviews that say it works great.
Took this on a trip with me and used it for 4 days. Really liked how it felt on my face. My face still felt moisturized even after giving presentations for 8 hours.
"I tried the Olay Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Face Moisturizer as a sample. I liked it, for what little I had. I might try it again if the price is right. Nothing too special about it."
"This moisturizer saved my skin! I use it when I wake up and before I go to sleep. If you have a breakout monday, and continue to apply the product daily, by friday your skin will be glowing!!"
"I would love to try this product again, would love to try more of these products and do a review on my page!! I am always looking for new products to try!!! Love all Olay Products"
"I have used Regenerist for a year since my friend gave me a sample. My face looks smooth. However, my skin looks dark and want to try this. However, My Mom is using this product and says it is not effective. Do you have any sample for this product."
I tried this product 2 nights. The scent is way too strong for me. Gave me headaches even after I washed it off. Not a product I can use and would not recommend to anyone sensitive to strong fragrance.
"Have been using Oil of Olay products since I was 16 yrs (am 69 yrs). Since I have oily skin, I love the lightness of Olay's creams. I also use Olay's Facial scrub daily. Their products are so gentle."
"Wow. I know this brand but this product prooved to be amazing. Who needs overly expensive skin care products, when less than an oz of this product produced wonderful results."
The moisturizer cream was easy & quick to spread onto my skin. It left my skin feeling soft and moist. I would definitely keep using it and I would definitely recommend it.
"I love skin care products and have been an Olay user for quite some time, I really love this one. My skin is so soft and the smell is not overwhelming."
I love Oil of Olay moisturizer. I have used it for many years and it is great for soon that is not happy with any changes to products. My skin looks great and feels great.
"The cream felt nice but I didn't see a difference in my skin after use of a sample product. I would not buy this again, I didn't feel it was worth the money for a full sized product."
"There wasn't enough in the sample for me to say how much impact it had made on my face. However, I did like it, I just wish that there more than one time use; it was one of those tiniest samples on a large ad and I think there a coupon(s)."
After trying the sample I went out and bought the full size. I really like how this cream feels on my skin; it is not heavy or greasy but moisturizes very well.
The sample was very small and pretty dry so either some air got in the packet or it isn't a very moisturizing product. I saw no benefit to using this product.
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer is so nice, leaving your skin soft and not greasy. Love Olay for staying on top of the game with great new products."
"I liked this. Not overwhelmed by it, but I really did like it. The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone perfecting cream moisturizer does moisturize and even out skin tone. And the scent was okay as well."
I loved the way this product made my face feel and look! It was generous enough in size so I felt like I could actually get a feel (no pun intended) for what this product would be like longer term)
"This is a great cream, very moisturizing and it made my skin look better. But it does cost a lot for what it does when a generic is half the price. It depends on how much you're really willing to pay for it."
You can't go wrong with an Olay product & this one is a good one. I love how it made my face soft & very hydrated for the whole day without feeling I was wearing something heavy on my face.
"Lightweight and feels very silky, absorbs quickly, left my skin kind of dewy without looking like I have the meat sweats at Golden Corral. Definitely evens overall skin tone. (I'm a redhead, as much as that can be said)"
"I really liked this moisturizer, it went on smooth wasn't greasy and felt good on my face, not heavy like some moisturizers do. However, I do think it's a little pricey."
"The cream is great, your skin feels so soft and moist after applying it! I would definitely buy it. The price bites a little, but I guess that's what you have to pay for the quality product."
"Love this, but you need to exfoliate first to get good results quicker. I am medium-dark and have sun damage from years of not wearing sunscreen, because I thought I didn't have too. Wrong!"
"This moisturizer instantly grabbed my attention with its smooth, light formula. It has a nice fragrance that is subtle. I went out and bought a full size jar after my sample was empty."
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer is beyond awesome! It has a light and airy application and wear, it has a subtle scent, and leaves your skin non-greasy. I would highly recommend!"
I love Olay. This Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer feels lovely on my skin. Not enough product to tell a big difference but it does make you want to purchase it to find out the results of long time usage.
"My Grandmother used Oil of Olay most of her life, & didn't have the first wrinkle at age 95! So of course I'm staying with this product, especially since it's been improved! I love Oil of Olay!"
"Its a nice cream, feels nice on my skin, absorbs quickly and all that. I just can't tell if it actually works with two applications. These kinds of samples for products like this are not effective."
"I enjoyed this Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer sample. Not enough to really see toning results, But it feels nice and would probably buy to see results."
My Mom actually uses this and I had already tried it. It is sitting at my makeup table and use it everyday! Wonderful product! Oil of olay is the best!
"I am a long-time Regenerist user, but I was surprised to like this new Luminous moisturizer so much. It has a lighter finish and felt terrific on my skin. Definitely recommend."
"The cream glided over my skin effortlessly. No harsh odors present. I did not notice any dramatic change in my appearance, but my eyes brightened a touch. Worth a purchase to evaluate further."
My face is super dry. This product is amazing. It went on so smoothly. You only need a dime size amount to apply to your face. The smell is great and my face felt smoother and stayed hydrated all day. I will purchase this in the near future.
As always this moisturizer from Olay was not disappointing and quality is in par with high end ..
Quite hydrating and improves skin texture making it look radiant and smooth .. One of the best from drugstore for winters for my oily combo skin ..
I used the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer sample and I fell in love with it it made my face feel wonderful and it just seemed to perk my skin up When I can I am gong to get me some of this.
"Love all Olay products and this is no exception! Lightweight formula gives skin a dewy look without feeling greasy. Fresh, clean scent too - not heavy or perfume-y."
I've just recently started a nightly face routine. A friend recommend this so I gave it a try. I use it every night before bed and my face feels amazing.
"I loved this cream. It was so silky. Not greasy, not heavy. Just light and lovely. Felt like a really expensive, quality product. I will definitely buy this product."
"I tried this sample and found it to be comparable to my cosmetic counter name brand. I enjoy this product, and it is much less expensive than the one I was using."
"With the small amount that we got, I think this cream might do the trick. I have one dark spot on face and used the cream sparingly on it. Seems to have faded. Now if it did more than just even skin tone I would probably buy it. Too costly for me."
"This product felt nice on my face, but I am also careful to not use too much of any moisturizer on my face as I have very oily skin, which can make my skin look ""luminous"" already without turning things into an oil slick."
I really liked that this felt very light weight and not at all sticky. My face felt soft and moisturized without feeling like I had added a moisturizer.
"Not a enough sample to see big results , but I can tell this is going to be a good product to purchase anyway. I have always liked Olay Regenerist products. I trust them."
"Even though it is a little pricey, I bought it and love the way it makes my skin feel. I'm looking forward to seeing how well it lightens the age spots on my face."
I only used It the one time & I liked the way it felt I didn't use it long enough to know if it actually fades the dark spots on your face or evens yone
I love oil of olay..I have used several products for years including their day and night cream. I'm sure it's a great product but to say if it does what it says..I can't tell in just a couple of uses. 5 stars just because I love oil of olay!
This stuff really made my skin feel soft and felt amazing. Great for the cold dry weather making your skin cracked and rough just a dab of this and it will help. Definitely a great product to have in the winter time.
I wish this would have been full sized! I loved it and the way my skin looked when I used it. I definitely would like to buy this and would recommend to women of all ages.
I like this product but the sample was so small you really didn't get a chance to see the benefits of it for long term use or if it would be worth the purchase price of a full size.
As you get older the moisture in your skin gets less and less. Olay as far as I am concerned is the best. this product makes my skin feel better. I recommend it.
"Another winner product from Olay, this nice cream made my skin smoother, softer and firmer. I applied it on my face, no allergic reactions and my neck. It softened my crepe neck."
Love Olay products. This is a great moisturizer I would use it again. It would be great if it was wrinkle help moisturizer. Or for baggy eyes. But it is a great product.
"I can't review a product that you only give us a tiny sample of! This product might be ok but a one time use is nothing to review, give me a actual sample bottle and not a foil sample that only has one use in it!!!"
"It would be great, except it is a little beyond my price range. I do use some of the lesser priced products. and cosmetics. The Olay products I always use are very good."
I was the Best Christmas gift giver!
Who does not love Olay! Awesome FAVORITE product of mine of all time!!!
Thanks walmart beauty box!! I Love You!!
"I use Olay products on a daily basis. This cream was only used a few times, because it was just a sample. I didn't notice any difference, because there wasn't enough in the package to really notice any difference."
I try a lot of different eye creams this stuff is nice but how ever there's not enough of the sample to see if it even works to make a decision to buy the full size product!
"I love this Oil of Olay. It makes your skin really soft and evens out your tone. I would have given it 5 stars, however, I have been using it for years and I don't feel that it lightens age spots as advertised."
This moisturizer works well but as far as a perfecting cream I am skeptical. They never seem to do anything. The price point is high. I would not buy.
I have used Olay products for over 35 years and love them. I am lucky to have nice skin with very few breakouts or uneven tones. This cream would be for someone other than me but if its like other Olay products it would rock for them!
"It is hard to give a true review of this product. I only received a small sample, so though I only used it once, it felt good on my skin. I don't know what the long term effects of the product will be."
"I love how this product is moisturizing and is also for dark spots, though I cannot say whether it did anything for my dark spots it was so hydrating that I would purchase from trying the sample."
This was nice it did give me a matte look minimising my pores. Easy to apply make up over. Very nice smell. Only thing dried out my face a little more than i like. But worked ok.
"I tried this product first time and absolutely love it! Super soft and moisturizing. Smells amazing as well, I highly recommend it, although personally it's a little pricey."
"This cream smells fantastic, I love it. It goes on my face so smooth and blend and absorbs well. It's not greasy feeling or sticky. As far as perfecting and toning, I'll have to check on that in the morning. Great stuff."
This did make my face feels soft and I only needed a little bit to do it. It didn't leave me feeling greasy or oily and helped with the winter dryness on my cheeks.
Love this moisturizer
Felt good going on and absorbed into skin nicely
Just bought another jar using the coupon they included which made it even sweeter
I was a bit skeptical at first. This goes in quickly. Did not irritate my skin. I did notice a difference in the dark circles around my eyes. I really liked this sample.
I TRIED THIS PRODUCT AND DIDNT REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR MY SKIN . I HAVE USED CHEAPER PRODUCTS THAT DID BETTER FOR MY SKIN. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE
"Being a redhead with freckles, I have a ""mottled"" skin tone. However, after using Olay Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, my skin looked more even and brighter. My only problem is the cost of this product."
"This moisturizer was much too greasy for my already oily skin. I usually use a very light moisturizer as I have oily skin. My face felt like it needed to be washed again. Upside, it does smell nice."
The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer is wonderful. It goes on easily and makes my skin feel smooth. The Regenerist line is high quality and this is a great addition.
I've been using this for 4 weeks and see a definite brightness to my face. I see a bit of fading as well. I can't wait to see what my skin looks like at the end of 8 weeks!
It's hard to fine a moisturizer that does feel oily or filmy but this does neither! And fave my face a healthy glow. I have combination skin and I can say this worked exactly as it says!
Smells good! The texture is light & creamy without being greasy. After several days I could see my skin had a nice glow and feels so smooth. I went right out and purchased a new jar!
I have dark circles under my eyes and i was not expecting this product to work so well. They were gone after 3 days of using it. I bought this as a gift for my mom.
"The sample was a bit too small to get a real GOOD idea of this works over even MORE than one application, since there was only enough for about 75% of my face and neck but what was covered felt nice."
"The smallest sample given out, ridiculous. Anyway - saw no difference using the product and not. Would not recommend or purchase and I am an Olay fan. :-("
This moisturizer is nice and smooth. It it not heavy and smells good. My only concern his the small amount received for the price. I tend to slather creams and would use this up too fast.
I used the sample and it dried quickly leaving a silky feel. Will be able to use and apply makeup without waiting for my face to dry. I have only used it once so I am not able to confirm benefits for using for 8 weeks. But def on my to buy list.
"I think this product is wonderful. It's not too oily and is still moisturizing enough that it doesn't just sit on top of your skin. However, I do think it's priced a bit more than what it should be."
"It was really nice and made my face feel so soft, would of liked to try longer to see if my skin changed cause its really hard to tell from just one use"
"MY Grandmother used this product, & didn't have the first sign of wrinkles at age 96, so I'm going to use it myself! Well, I love it, & I wish I had followed her lead from day one!"
"At 31 years old, I have finally found a great moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin oily or make it break out! A little goes a long way with this moisturizer. I have continued to purchase this product when I have ran oit. Highly recommend."
Loved this product and was so happy to get to use! I haven't been able to get it yet but it is definitely something I want and will be getting next shopping day. Thanks!
"I use this product when I have extra funds to buy it. It does a good job but unfortunately, it is pricey even at Walmart so most of the time I need to go with a lower priced product. I always come back to Olay because it works."
well the product feels nice on the skin and the scent is light it moisturizes pretty good but as for the toneing can't say yet because i havent used it that long yet
I love the product it feels so light and refreshing. The moisturizer I had been using felt to greasy and heavy and clogging almost. I love this product and the $3 off coupon!!
While applying the moisturizer it started flaking everywhere on my face. It seem to dry out quickly and a white flakey substance appeared. Not sure I will use this again.
Honestly so surprised because this like moisturizer like honestly cleared out my face honestly I'm like not even like right now like really really surprised at how good it did
I received this product in the mail as a sample I definitely was shocked by the results. It over time faded dark spots on myface to an even layer of skin. Moisturized it without being to oily. I use every morning love this product
I have been using Olay cream for years now. It was not what I expected for this long period of time. I now changed to another product ' I really see the difference in this one.
I have been using the product for a couple of weeks now and I have notices that some dark spots have faded. It is really light weight and smells great.
"I hate the new formula. The old formula gave me smooth silky skin, and lightened scars from acne. I am disappointed that the old formula is not available anymore."
"This product smells great, amazing actually...but after 3 weeks of continued use, I saw no change in dark spots on my face. I wanted to love this product considering how pricey it is, but I didn't :("
This product is just amazing!!! I had my mom video calling me and the first she noticed was my glowing skin. She asked what kind of cream I am using to my face.
Greate products only the price is high for those of us who don't have much to work with. I'm lucky If I can afford one price every 3 or 4 months. Just because I am disabled I still want to look okay beautiful.
"I bought this to try to fade old acne scars, and I noticed a difference overnight. After a week, I feel confident not wearing any makeup. While it says it is for morning and night, I have only been using it at night."
"I've use this product before and it works real good,i would definitely recommend this, my mom been using it for over20yrs she looks beautiful and the smell great"
I am very pleased with Olay Regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream. It's absorbent and goes on smooth without being greasy. Very light pleasant scent.
"I have always loved oil of Olay products. I have tried alot of different brands but none of them ever measured up to Olay. It brings instant relief to my face, I just cannot say enough good things about this product line."
My grandmothers used this and I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel. I use Okay anti-wrinkle cream and body wash . My skin stays youthful and I am 45.
IIT good and works. The feel of it is really well. I love how Smith it feelsbon my skin. My skin feels so much better after using this product. I feel refreshed after using this project. I tell people to use this because it worked for me .
Their skin care line is simply amazing! It's has great hydration & moisture for you skin to reduce fine lines & wrinkles that has you out on your best you!
It's one of the best Olay cream I ever use I been using oil Olay for as long as I could remember my daughter and grand daughter uses it thank you olay

Olay is a brand I trusted. Always does what its suppose to. Light and creamy on my face. Feels nice on and leaves my skin feeling soft.
First moisturizer that doesn't make my skin oily! I loved the texture and light scent. Definitely will recommend
Every time I used the product my husband had complimented me on how beautiful I look and I didn't even put on any other makeup.
I've been using the Tone Perfecting cream for a few years and loved it. Something has changed as it now flakes off the skin shortly after applying.

"I did enjoy using this product, I just don't use this kind often. The price is a little preventative for me."
"With just one use, my seemed brighter. The cream was not heavy, not sticky, but very light and seemed to absorb nicely. Would definitely recommend!"
I loved the Oley Luminous moisturizer. It goes on smoothly. It doesn't feel greasy. It doesn't break me out. I have actually purchased more.

I don't have any varying tones on my face but this is a nice moisturizer. I have used this cream daily.
"This is a moisturizer, and it does just that, moisturizes! Feels good to the skin and soaks right in."
"It was a great product, scent was great, it made my skin feel great! It was just alittle pricy for my buget"
The feel was nice but the sample only allowed for one use. It had a nice smell and maybe continued use would make a difference.
This cream was easy to use. Not oily or greasy. It improved my wrinkles more every day. I would use this by the tubful!
"Not something I will reach for normally but if I needed something to keep my face moisturized, I will definitely use."
I loved it so much I bought it full size!! It leaves my face soft and hydrated and smells really good! I love it more than my high end ones!!
This product left me skin looking 10 yrs. younger. My skin is softer and appears to have less lines.
"It glides on smoothly on the face, no greasiness. I massage my face upwards and outwards when putting it on at night."
I love the way this made my skin feel and how moisturized it was all day long. It has a great smell to it too!
I love OLay products but this was too small an amount to really test out. I would have to rate on how I know their products usually are.
"Received a sample, I liked the way it goes on smooth. Does not leave your face oily or shiny. It also has a great scent. I would buy this product."
I loved the way it made my skin feel however it was not enough product to remotely see a difference.
"It's smooth and watery. I say it as a compliment though, as I hate thick creams. I'm thinking of buying it after my current cream is finished."
This cream make my skin look and feel great! I have dry skin and a few uneven tones. It's helping it look better than before.
"I love how it felt on my face. Silky smooth. Has a pleasant scent. Unfortunately after one use, I can't tell if out helps with skin tone."
I love facial products from this company . My skin absorbs them so quickly they are not oily and my skin feels soft
I have multiple dry patches on my face and this moisturizer has made a significant change in the appearance of these dry patches.
"I regularly use Olay moisturizer products. Unfortunately, the small size sample is not enough to rate the product."
I have been using oil of Olay for years and people always ask me how I stay so young looking. It's definitely because of Olay products.
I really enjoyed this product. It did not irritate my sensitive skin and lived up to all of my expectations.
"Light-weight formula, lightly scented, absorbs well and doesn't leave behind any residue. I would use this product again."
Loved it. Made my skin feel so good. Looks great under makeup or by itself. I'd use this all the time.
Love how easy this is to apply. Love the way it makes your skin feel.
Love this product and will be buying it again.
This moisturizer is so refreshing. Makes my skin appear a little more youthful. I need this product in my life.
"This was very nice, it left my skin soft, and supple. I would purchase as one of my daily moisturizers."
I have a favorite lotion I use daily but I did try this one. It was very smooth going on and seemed to be good at moisturizing my face.
I have used olay products for most of my life and this is a lovely moisturizer. The sent is sweet and the touch is light with no oily residue.
You can honestly expect a good product with the Olay name on it. This was a very good moisturizer. I definitely recommend it.
Was not a real sample .was just a foil pack. If these are going to be the samples from now on . I will be canceling my beauty box subscription.
Is the worst skincare line I've ever wasted money on. The sample was too small to be any sort of a gauge of effectiveness.
I enjoy Oil of Olay products. This cream moisturized my skin well. The coverage was amazing. It didn't feel sticky or messy. I love it.
"I got this in my Walmart box, and I always loved Olay, but this is just awesome. This really rehydrates my skin, and leaves no build up."
I use this at night. it is non greasy and non oily. makes for soft skin. gets rid of rough dry patches and evenly tones and moisturizes.
"Since I have started using this product, my face feels so much better. Is not the least bit dry and it has helped the tone of my skin also."
I only had a small sample so I can't tell how this would improve my skin but it felt nice on my skin.
"I loved this in the sample I got... It did feel a bit heavy, so oily skin users use a smaller amount!"
This product did well. It moisturized without being oily. I have oily skin as it is and this worked well.
It was easy to use the moisturizer and it didn't feel greasy. Would like to continue and hope for great results.
My skin have been very dry. I started using this and saw a definite Improvement in a very short time. I would highly recommend this product
"This felt good, and really did minimize the fine lines on my face. A better value than some of the more expensive products I have used."
"with older skin can tell it was used. made skin look younger, and looking in mirror made me feel younger."
"I love the way this made my face look and feel. First, my face had a smooth, dewy look and it felt really soft. Would definitely buy this."
Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is an amazing product with great results.My skin has never looked better!
The little packet didn't even have enough in in to really tell if it did what it said it would. That's way I didn't give a good review.
"Awesome cream, not sticky, moisturizes very good! The only downside is that it is too expensive, but you are paying for quality."
"This is very nice moisturizer. However, so many of these are too pricey. I use Ponds and it works fine at half the price."
I'm 26 with combination skin. This product was very hydrating but didn't leave my face oily at all which is a rare and wonderful find.
"The sample was skimpy, just enough for 1 use. It is hard to say I noticed a difference after that one time. I normally love Olay products"
"Left skin so soft, but not greasy. Helped to decrease the appearance of wrinkles too! Thanks for the sample #Walmartbeautybox. !"
This was very silky and absorbed quickly without being greasy or oily. Very smooth and nice product.
"Not very moisturizing which is something I need. During fall and winter, I need a heavy cream. This would probably be best for spring and summer."
"Just like any tone correcting cream, it takes a bit of use before you start to see a result. Over time, I did start to see some tone correcting."
I tried using Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer but it seemed to leave my skin a little greasy feeling.
apparantly my box was missing this item as well as another item...not happy as it took over 3 months to get the box
Extremely high in perfume fragrance and I could smell it on my face all day long. I prefer an unscented or mild natural scent if there is one.
The amount in the sample was so little that it didn't cover my face. Not enough product to talk about it.
"Felt so smooth on my skin, and you could also feel the tingly toning as well. Would refer to friends."
Great moisturizer woke up to smooth dyrdrated skin. The cream has a very light texture and is perfect for moisturizer under make up. Will buy again.
"Nice light scent, thick cream, doesn't leave your face feeling greasy. Only received a sample so not sure about long term effects."
What an amazing product! I can't wait to finish up the dozen or so other moisturizers and stick with this one permanently.
Love this. This was my favorite sample because it made my skin feel so soft. I am 70 and just one application made a difference. Can't wait to buy!
It took a while but i am seeing some improvement in the appearance of the fine lines and wrinkles on my face
I love Olay products starting with their gentle face was all the way to Tone Perfecting Face Moisturizer.
"Not really enough product to test it fully, but from what i got it was super nice, felt great on the skin, blured pores, good scent"
Only got enough in a blister pack to use once which isn't really enough to determine value & a decent overall review for a facial cream
Really enjoyed this as I had never tried before and I was really happy with the results after using a few days. Full size has already been gotten!
"In the sample I received, I was able to use this product twice. And even though it was only twice, I instantly saw my dark spots fading."
"This went way above my expectations, i saw results the very first time I used it. I will be buying this in the future"
I want more of more of the Olay Regnererist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer and I'm going to get some today. It is da bomb.
Wish the samples were bigger to get a better result to judge. But went on great and seemed to rub in easily
This stuff is amazing!!! I tried a trail version and instantly knew it would be added to my skin regiment. So light and smooth.
"I've only used the sample so far, but it evens the tone of my skin well. Lightweight coverage on the skin, too, which is nice."
Wish there had been a bit more In the package to get a good feel for the product. Seemed to firm though.
The fragrance is light and refreshing. The feel on my face and neck is so moisturizing. I use it twice a day
I got all day protection and moisture without that greasy feeling or look with continued use you can see and feel the difference.
This cream left my skill feeling smooth and refreshed I was shocked to notice how it was far from sticky or smelly
I really love it I can tell it really is doing what it said it would. My skin looks and feels younger and I haven't felt this way about a product
"This cream brightens my complexion, give a healthy appearance and has taken the place of my daily foundation. Love it."
I have a lot of dark spots and ive been using the cleanser and this moisturizer for two months and so far its doing its job..Yay !!

"I've always looked older than I am and this product has done miracles for me, I'm back to my baby face!!"
"Left my face feeling soft and didn't dry my skin and didn't have that left over film, some product have."
Changed my life no more wrinkly dry skin. It smells so good and lasts even after putting water in your face
"This product help me stop from having dry and flaky skin. Now since using Okay, my skin is soft and smooth."
"Love the pdoducts & how they work love i,it smooth when you use it,I myself as a male use it as much as a female would use it ."
"Love this stuff, myself and my daughters use it. We look and feel fabulous, also it smells great and my skin is like new again."
The pyroduct makes you feel 20 years younger I would recommend it to my friends and family and even strangers lol
I have never in the past found a product that works as good as this! I am telling all my friends and family about it!
"It makes my skin look ten years younger! I was hesitant at first, but after a few weeks of use, I have noticed an immense difference!"
It's so freshening and moisturizing. I love it. It's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesome!
Brightens because of the products and has a very smooth texture to it. Feels great on my skin and has a very good outcome.
Nothing bad to say this product is amazing it meets all of my expectations keep up the good work but you could lower the price
