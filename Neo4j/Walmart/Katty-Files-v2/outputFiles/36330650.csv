This is the most excellent organic face cream I've ever used! I experiment with lots of facial creams that are good for my skin. This leaves your skin glowing and is highly absorbent! I recommend it highly!
"I bought this and thought it was the best moisturizer I've ever used, but then I couldn't find it again until I spotted it on Jet. Happy to have it again. It is light and not greasy."
"I just bought this yesterday! Already, I notice a significant improvement in my very sensitive, dry skin! The red patches are going away. I have tried many expensive products. Claiming to be good for sensitive, dry skin. None of them were what they claimed to be. I'm sold on this product! Great Value too!"
"Has a nice rosy and citrus smell to it. I do not have to use a lot of the lotion 1 or 2 pumps at the most about a pea size per pump. I have dry to normal skin and some times the product is to oily for me. I do use it in the winter, but during the summer I'll just stick to my coconut oil."
This face lotion is ok... but it is pretty thin. Its more of a watery lotion rather than a cream. Also it has a strong citrus scent
My face is itchy and redness appears after using. The product smells great though.
