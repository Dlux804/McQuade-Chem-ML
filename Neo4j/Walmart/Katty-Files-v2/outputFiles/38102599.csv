"I was so pleased with my first purchase that I bought it again. It appears to be almost too thick but spreads beautifully. My skin feels soft and looks years younger. I like the ""glow"" I have now! Feels great under makeup as well."
I love this product. But I live in Texas where it's a 100 degrees all the time. This product is thick and just sweats off of your face. So again since I paid for it I decided to use it at night. Wow I'm glad I did. What a difference. And we have so much sun so by the time morning comes it's all in my skin. and I still have sunscreen until I get to my face in the AM. Then I use the Revitalift anti-wrinkle+ and firming day cream.
I bought this product 5 months ago I've been using it ever senseI love it the way it goes on pretty creamy I love the fragrance I have seen results in my lines they been disappearing I think this cream is good for the winter months when is mostly more dry or if you're doing lots of swimming or outdoors activity in the summer and your face gets pretty dry after the sun it will work great
I have oily skin yet at night its dry. Most night and day creams that worked for me were extreamly pricey and those that were cheap did not hydrate but then i found this product. Light weight yet it was creamy and dense. It last all day. I even use it at night. My skin is soft and looks refreshed. Scent is very soft. Works well with my sensitive skin and did not break me out. My boyfriend who has extra dry skin loves it.
"Bought this a while back and liked it at first. Nice, smooth texture, not too heavy. Have used 2/3 to 3/4 of it, then the skin under my eye starts drying out. I check the ingredients, and there's the probable culprit: salicylic acid. Why add a known skin-drying agent to a moisturizer? This stuff is not cheap, either! I will not be buying this again."
I have been buying this and it is very effective for me. I have been using this for years.
I am on my late 50s and I don't look like one they say.
I felt the most moisturized skin I have used daily in the last 2 weeks. I think the signs are getting softer.
After giving this cream 3 days days of use the reddness and greasey gloss (didn't absorb ) .I was very disappointed especially buying a full size jar.I think oil of olay products are much more skin active and gives better results .
"My skin has never been softer, less prone to breakouts, or looked so even and smooth! I'm 48, and using the whole line, my skin is better in the last 2 months than it was in my 20's!!!"
"With the cold weather hitting New England, I decided I finally needed to start using moisturizer. I'm 50 and haven't used facial moisturizer before because my skin was always oily. Now, I know I should have been using moisturizer all along. I picked up Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream at CVS the other day. After one use, my skin was soothed, soft and the roughness is smoother. I can't believe how healthy my skin looks after just a few days."
"Light, absorbs quickly, we'll see if it helps my fine lines!!!"
My skin looked tighter and I had less puffiness when applied in the morning. I felt like I had a more youthful glow and that gave me more confidence to face the day. Any product that has this claim makes me happy and able to enjoy the day so much more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After facial surgery, when the assistant removed the tape, she literally tore some skin with it. It left an area about the size of a nickel damaged, and crinkled. After one month of faithfully applying Age Perfect at night, I swear to you it has totally disappeared! My skin, overall, has improved immeasurably"
I like the moisturizer it helped me with my dry skin but i do not like that they add perfumes I do not need perfumes in my face So it started irritating my sensitive skin so it is a shame because i do like this face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great moisturizer for dry skin - it really does hydrate your skin well. But, the day cream (I haven't tried the night cream) has a very strong, sweet scent. The serum has a scent that didn't bother me. This day cream scent stays with you for over an hour. I felt it interfered with the fragrance that I like to wear. It has some nice ingredients - and is truly hydrating but not greasy. I just wish the scent was much milder. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i really like the product. i wish they sample was a little larger so i could really tell. however, i did like the way it left my skin looking a little plumper and i also liked the it included spf 15. i use about 3 layers of sunscreen so i appreciated the additional protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only tried a sample but I love how it feels on my face and I have very dry skin. Other products do not make my skin feel moist, but this one did and not too greasy. I am going to buy the product and see how it performs in the long run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I RECEIVED A FREE SAMPLE IN THE MAIL AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID. I USE OTHER L'OREAL PRODUCTS AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SATISFIED WITH THEM. THIS ONE IS A STEP ABOVE IN EFFECTIVENESS IN TREATING MY 64 YEAR OLD DRY DULL SKIN. THANKS FOR LETTING ME TRY IT NOW IT'S TIME TO BUY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very good cream. Comes on very nicely, and feels good, skin improves within days of using it. Thank you LOREAL. I wish women would stop complaining about scent or perfumes in cosmetics!! Dear L'Oreal - some of Us still like those beautiful scents you put in your products! It enhances the experience of using a good cosmetic! For those who do not like it-well, buy unscented and stop complaining! 5 STARS !"
This day cream absorbs nicely and made my skin feel moisturized without being oily. I used the day cream along with the Age Perfect serum and like the way the duo works to together. An added bonus is the pleasant fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the sample. There was only enough for one day so it is a little hard to rate but from the one day of use I really liked it. I am probably going to buy it to try for a few weeks and see if I still like it. I could not reaaly see results with one day of use but my skin felt soft after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how silky it is between your fingers. Also my face stays mosturized all day! I loved using it during winter
This is my second time purchasing the products. It provides the correct nourishment my maturing skin needs.
"Both products for night and day are thick, the substance of paste. Very hard to absorb; makes skin oily."
"Nice feel, didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. Looking forward to seeing results from long term use. My only complain is a lack of instructions on the sample pack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It feels so luxurious on your skin. I had no idea L'oreal had a product line that included this wonderful cream. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It seems to work well but the scent is strong and one I really don't care for, when it is first applied. The day cream glides on and leaves your skin feeling nourished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This works great.
"I recd a sample and loved this immediately! So went out and bought the eye cream and day cream. Love, love,love, both! I have tried numerous dept store creams, and was using Elisabeth Arden. No more!!! If you ever discontinue this, you better send me a lifetime supply! The best cream! Smell texture and hydration. Great under makeup!"
"Didn't notice any difference at all. Fragrance reminiscent of pesticides. SPF so low, didn't seem to make much difference saving skin from sun in any way. Gave it two stars for SPF factor. All AGE PERFECT and REVITAL LIFT lines didn't work for me. I'm too young for the lines? Not enough wrinkles, not enough sagging? Probably the case. Do like the ROSY TONE cream."
"I love this whole line of products. I feel like I am putting silk on my face. I am 50 years oled and my skin is radiant, soft, and young looking. This product does what it says it does. I am a believer and will use it forever. P,ease don't stop making it. Thanks for a great product."
"Because of health issues and the medications I take, my skin has become quite dry and fragile. I've been looking for facial moisturizers that will help protect my skin from damage. I received a sample of Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream in the mail, and was pleased with it's light, silky texture. I will definitely buy the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this over the weekend along with the Golden Serum and a trial size of the night cream which I purchased locally. All three products have the luxurious texture that I have come to expect from L'Oreal. There was an obvious improvement in my skin's texture with just the one use. It appeared softer, plumper, less lined and firmer. I will definitely add these products to my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was disappointed, too. L'Oreal feels they need to add perfume to all it's skincare products! That will break down the collagen in skin! I went back to Clinique after trying too many products that have way too much fragrance it them by L'Oreal. Fragrance is not skincare! I will come back as soon as they decide to make some fragrance free products. Even Olay does!!!"
Loved the feel of the cream on my skin. Blended well with a lovely scent too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like everything L'OREAL, so this was no surprise, that cell renewal day cream is everything the ad says about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started using these creams. When I wake up in the morning skin feels moist, I do however still have wrinkles and fine lines. I am looking for a product that will remove wrinkles and fine lines. I plan on continuing to use for next month., Hopefully I will see more results after the projected time suggested."
"I received a sample in the mail. I liked Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream SPF 15. The product made my skin feel smooth, velvety and well hydrated. It gave my skin a glowing appearance. Having SPF as an ingredient is a plus. I like to keep my skin protected throughout the day. I like the fact that it does not contain parabens. I have tried to purchase only products that do not have this ingredient included. I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of Cell Renewal Day Cream moisturizer along with the Serum. I just finished the sample that lasted about a week. Although I cannot see visible results yet, I am impressed with both products. The Day Cream has a pleasant fragrance that does not linger. It goes on smoothly and makeup applied after the Day Cream is not adversely affect. I will definitely purchase the Day Cream and Serum this weekend and highly recommend both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Amazing product! At 56 I am beginning to see fine lines around my mouth and eyes.I have used Oil of Olay faithfully since I was a teenager and I love it too but this product has made a very quick change in my face. Very smooth an soft.I bought the trial size and have used it about 2 weeks.Takes a few minutes to soak in so I wait about 5 minutes to put on foundation. No need to use a lot because it spreads really easy.
I feel that the product worked really well . I noticed a difference after just a few days. My only complaint was the smell of the product. The fragrance was very strong. My eyes watered for a few seconds each time I put it on due to the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the L'Or√©al cell renewal day cream! This cream is just right amount of coverage I like to feel on my skin before applying my makeup for the day!, the smell is wonderful as well! I have been using it for about 10 days now and I can tell my skin is feeling much softer and fresher, it also has moisturized my skin equivalent to high end creams costing three times the price of this! I highly recommend L'Or√©al cell renewal Day Cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for four weeks, I can say that my skin is glowing and looks younger and softer. The cream has a great smell to it, is light on the skin, and really helped with my dry skin. I didn't feel like it necessarily helped with fine lines, but perhaps with further usage it will! This product is only half gone, so I can get at least 2 months use of the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The day cream goes on nice and light. You don't need a lot. I love that it has spf in it already so one less step. It smells nice too. Because it says cell renewal, I was hoping for some lightening on my dark spot areas but over one month it hasn't changed. Goes perfectly under my foundation as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't to for sure how good this product was going to be but after trying it for a few weeks.I was hooked. I have try many products that say they work or they are non greasy but they aren't. This product blow me away. My face looks so health and you can tell that the product was starting to heal all the damaged from years of abuse. Highly recommended this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream exclusively for over three weeks now. My first impression was somewhat negative. I found the cream to be very greasy and it felt tacky and sticky on my face. I adjusted the amount of cream I used but it still felt too heavy for me. I think this cream would be a great choice for someone with a dry complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream has a pleasant smell and did not cause any breakouts. It is a bit on the greasy side, so make sure you give yourself enough time to let it absorb before you apply your make up. Very little product is needed, so it should last you quite awhile. I've used it everyday for 3 weeks and I've barely used 1/4th of the container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I looked and felt refreshed (even when I didn't get enough rest). I also found that I did not need to ise any concealer for bags under my eyes. Using this cream enabled me to only need my usual everyday powder. This one wasn't oily which I liked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think Loreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream is an ok product. Yes your skin feels better but the smell is not so great, slightly reminds me of a hair salon. I would recommend the product to an older group range only. I believe my skin did look better after using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am pleased with this particular L'Or√©al product. I always look for something that not only works well with my skin but has a nice light scent. This line of products is it for me. No problems whatsoever with leaving an oily feeling to my skin. I have been using the day time creme faithfully now for 3 weeks and will definitely continue to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin on my face and was so excited to use this product. I applied it, it went on smooth and my face felt great for about 30 seconds. I than had an allergic reaction, face turned red and i got little red bumps all over. I would not recommend use of this if you have sensitive skin or mild allergies."
"I really like how smoothly this product goes on. It's not too thick, but makes my skin feel moisturized immediately. A lot of products make my skin feel greasy and I end up washing them off before I leave the house in the morning, but this one wasn'the like that. After using this product for several weeks, I feel like my skin is brighter and more youthful looking. The fact that it has SPF 15 in it is icing on the cake. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Cue the Hallelujah chorus! I have finally found a facial cream that works. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream makes my skin feel wonderful. It moisturizes my skin without feeling oily. I have noticed that the fine lines around my eyes are gone and the lines on my neck are getting smaller too. I have dry skin, so I even use this on my hands. I love the way it smells but I love how well it works even more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just love the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day cream. It's not heavy, has a nice smell and it leaves my skin feeling great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who struggles with having age lines and dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The idea of a facial moisturizer plus sunscreen is a win win. However, I was a bit hesitant to try something that promises to ""replump"" my plump enough face. I do like that it stimulates surface skin cells and I did notice that my skin seemed softer and smoother after a few weeks. The one thing I disliked was the heaviness of this moisturizer. I felt like there was a thick layer on my face throughout the day. It was a bit heavier than I'm used to for a daily facial moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal facial cream to be just what my over 50, dry, lifeless skin needed. The cream is rich and creamy, but not greasy and quickly absorbs into my skin to make it look more polished and young. Concealer and foundation glide right over it and there's no dryness or tightness or extra shiny-ness . I love the way my skin feels when I wear it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So after trying L'Oreal Day Cream for the first day, I can say it is ""okay."" The cream is thick and takes a while to absorb. I had a slight reaction to the cream with some red patches. The smell is not offensive and my skin did feel nice after the application. Not sure it is the correct product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product . Along with age comes fine lines and wrinkles , but this product not only helped plump them up but it mosturized my skin without leaving an oily residue like most products I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I highly recommend this product as it really helped my face feel refreshed, young, moisturized and smooth ALL day long! Even hours later, my face looked and felt great! Such a great smell and easy application makes this a great product for a busy mom! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is very light under my foundation. Non greasy, and not thick. Takes very little to cover my face and leaves my face very soft and smooth. I can't say I have used a better moisturizer. I especially love the fact it has spf 15 as well in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This L'Or√©al Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is the bomb! I've only been using it for about two weeks and I can already tell a difference in the texture of my skin. I have slightly oily skin (even though I'm in my sixties) and a lot of products just make my skin more oily, but this day cream moisturizes without creating more oil. It absorbs into my skin so easily and makes my makeup go on like a dream. L'Or√©al has come up with another awesome product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product was really nice in that it made my skin feel smooth and like it could breath the next day. Even if I had on make-up the day before, my face didn't feel ""clogged"" from being covered in powders. My only real conplaint was that I did feel a bit of an oily residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in my mid 40's and have used moisturizers and/or creams since I was in my early 20's. This is a great item. It makes my skin look and feel the best without being greasy but still giving me great protection and is a great base/primer for my makeup. Thanks Loreal!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this Moisturizer to be a good day cream for me. My only wish is that it had a higher SPF. The SPF 15 is ok for the winter, but in the summer, I usually switch to a SPF30 or higher moisturizer. Other than that, I really liked this and after a few days of use, felt ""glowy"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for a few weeks already and I must say I have noticed a great difference. My skin is more plump and I can notice lines have diminished. The serum has a nice fragrance and is not oily at all. I will be buying the night cream as well to use as a combination, cant wait for the result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like wearing this alone, but not under my makeup, it seems too thick. When worn alone, my skin feels nice. This product does not make my skin very oily, which is a concern for me. I will continue to wear the L'Oreal Day cream on weekends. This product works wonders along with the L'Oreal eye cream. It has a nice clean feeling when worn alone. I would suggest this to anyone with aging skin care concerns, even someone in their 20's! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It didn't leave my skin dry which is great,it's so hard for me to find a product that doesn't break out my skin.It left my skin so soft and hydrated. I will definitely be buying some of this.such a wonderful product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for 2 weeks. I was happy to have a moisturizer with sunscreen in it. Unfortunately, this wasn't a good match for my skin. I tend to have oily skin and using this product caused me to start having small blemishes and breakouts. It would probably be best for someone with normal or dry skin looking for a good quality moisturizer/sunscreen combo. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to give credit when it's due, this stuff is awesome. My skin hasn't felt this great in a longtime. Products smells good first off, the smell is a refreshing scent and very mellow. The texture is thick but not oily. A small portion goes a long way. My skin feels looks radiant after I put this on. This product blends well with my makeup. I haven't had any break out sense applying this product on my face and I have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product is light and refreshing. Foundation goes on smoothly over the product, with no separation or flakiness throughout the day. Slight scent in product was not overpowering. Hard to differentiate between day and night cream with glasses off. Can be worn under foundation or alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Again the smell of this cream is what made me fall in love with it...after about three weeks of using it I have notice the dry spots on my face are at a minimal now...my face is so much smoother I love how my foundation just takes to my skin so much better now...When I was a teenage I wish my elders would have told me how important it was to moisturizer but now I have found one and will stick with my new routine.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about three weeks now and I love them! As I'm getting later into my 30's, I've started to stress over my wrinkles and have been looking into different lotions/creams. In using this product for only three weeks, I have already noticed a difference. The lines around my lips and by my eyes seem to have improved. I am so excited what it will look like after using them for many more weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for a few weeks and it's a nice product. My skin feels soft and subtle. It does not feel greasy when applied and does not interfere with makeup application. This product has a nice scent but it can be slightly overwhelming if you're sensitive to scent. I do wish the spf was slightly higher as it is only 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using L'Oreal Age Perfect Renewal Facial Day Cream for a few weeks now and I can see an improvement in my skin. My brown age spots seem to be disappearing and I have less small clogged pores. The cream goes on silky soft without any greasy feel. Another great feature is the light sent. I don't like a strong perfume smell and this is just right. Definitely worth buying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm at my 40's and my skin is dry. Most of the time I just forget to add some cream during the day. After putting L'Oreal Paris Age perfect Cell Renewal on, I felt my skin smooth and radiant and I was ready to tackle my day. Couple of days later, my kids started to notice the change on my face, it looked smooth and softer. I use it every morning and I don't have to worry that my face will be dry again or that the cream will leave my face oily. And I love the smell f the cream :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this day cream! I've tried sooo many different day creams and I always seem to have problems - not the case with this! It's very light and doesn't feel heavy going on. It didn't make me break out at all or leave my face shiny - major plus. I used this in the heart of winter living in the northeast so you can imagine I had dry skin starting and my skin instantly felt smoother. I recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream for over 3 weeks. There is a major change in my skin consistency. It is soft and supple and firm. the cream is light and glides on, never feeling heavy or greasy. My wrinkles are diminished and my skin looks young and glowing again. I love this product and will continue to use for great skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As all of us know we aren't getting any younger but we still want to appear young to everyone else. I have tried several different kinds of anti-aging lotion which only seem to dry out my skin. However L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream did not dry my skin out. It put moisture back into my face and it no longer felt scaly. My makeup looked better and the complaints I started getting at work asking what I was doing different sure makes a woman feel good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product . I have tried many other creams but nothing even came close to erasing the small lines and helping in fading deeper wrinkles like this product . I will be buying this product on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love how well this keeps my skin moisturized, hydrated, and nourished! It also contains a sunscreen which helps protect the skin! It keeps my skin looking and feeling soft! I have smooth and radiant looking skin all day! No more dry or irration, just beautiful and brilliant looking skin! #WalmartContest"
Like the perfume smell and the absorption to my skin feels so easy and smooth. It moisturizes and brightened my skin to a healthy glow and the fine lines have been less noticeable. The skin regains new vitality and is perfectly hydrated. Immediately the skin is soft and it feels great and radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the L'Oreal day cream for about 2 weeks now. I really have seen a different in my problem dry areas. Prior to using this product you could really see my foundation on my problem areas. Now my foundation blends in much nicer. I like the consistency of the cream and it has a very pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is very nice packaged and doesn't smell like purfumes. I could feel like a tingling on my face when I used it. I didn't break out, which I'm thankful, since my skin is sensitive to certain products. Overall very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like loreal age renewal day cream moisturizer it's not sticky and smelly like alot of all the other creams haven't used it long enough to see results it isn't heavy feeling either really like it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so impressed with the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream. The first morning after putting it on my makeup went on so much smoother than normal. This has to be because the product renews your lost skin cells and nourishes your skin. I wish this was on the market when I was thirty (30)! Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is heavy and for more mature aged skin. I am in my 40's but it was still too heavy for me. Generally I use only gel type moisturizers that are soaked in pretty fast this just left my skin feeling heavy with cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am not a big regimen follower when it comes to face creams, but I must say... I love this product. After my shower my face feels dry and stripped of moisture and I find myself ready to apply this cream to my face. It feels calming and super moisturized and I feel the hydration all day. I have a smoother complexion and more refreshed appearance. I will definitely keep buying this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is truly amazing. The most exciting aspect is that it moisturizes without leaving a greasy or oily residue, and a small dab goes a long way, so it is economical and effective. I will definitely be buying this product and recommending it to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I been using the L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream for a few weeks. I apply it in the morning after cleaning my face. My skin feels moisturized and refreshed. In one week I saw results. My skin is more vibrant and hydrated. My skin is loving thus product. I will be buying it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this wonderful L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15 for a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it! I am using the eye cream as well as the night cream and they are so great for my skin, I actually feel a difference already. The cream is creamy and rich without being heavy and greasy. I have already recommended this product to my sister and close friends. Please try it, you will love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scent on this needs to be toned down a little. After having it on for an hour it gave me a headache. It's not a bad scent, but it is very strong. It's a little greasy and you don't have to use much. It does absorb quickly, but in the short time I used this product, I didn't notice any change in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The daily face cream was an excellent cream that made my face feel hydrated and nourished through out the day. The cream had a gentle feel that would leave my face feeling clean and light and not greasy. The cream was thick and rich and easy to spread. It left my skin feeling soft all day even after being outside in the cold winter elements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried out The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream. It made my skin feel greasy and it was not as light as i thought it would be. It had to take a little time to get my skin used to it. I am on day 13 right now of using it. I would recommend it if you don't have sensitive skin. It makes your skin feel good, sorta makes it greasy, depending on how much you put on. Definitely glad I tried it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the L'Oreal Paris Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream now for a couple of weeks and am very pleased with it. Its not a real heavy cream and absorbs into the skin nicely. It is also not oily. I put it on everyday under my makeup and it doesnt make my makeup look blotchy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's very smooth but not oily cream and I feel great on my skin after putting it on. It's a little out of budget for me but still worth it. I'm at my 40's and my skin is dry. I use this in the morning and L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Moisturizer for night. I didn't feel dry or oily all day and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this a great product! I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream every morning before work for the last 3 weeks. I have already noticed my skin becoming softer, less pores, and I have also noticed my skin becoming younger! Or at least my daughter says so! I will totally be buying this product again. I give it 4 and a half stars out of 5! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I Think the L'Orellana Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream has a nice creamy texture and isn't too heavy for a day cream. It is great as a base for a facial moisturizer and base to your everyday make and helping your make stay in place. It wasn't clogging or heavy. After a few days of use my skin felt better and no longer dry. It gives a light dewy look to your skin so I could go out with out make up on most days. I loved using this.

"I have been using the Loreal Age perfect day cream for a couple weeks now. I have to say my skin does feel softer and smoother. I like the light scent and the fact that besides moisturizing it has sunscreen. I put it on in the mornings before my makeup, so my first step has my skin protected for the day. The only drawback I found at all with this cream is that my skin tends towards being on the oily side on my forehead and this seems heavy for that area. Overall a great daily cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is too heavy for day wear. Although it softens the skin on contact and has a pleasant scent, it did not get absorbed quickly enough and my skin felt oily shortly after application. Very unlike the night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried a few samples and now have the full size. So far I'm really liking it, along with the matching eye cream and serum as well. They definitely hydrate the skin and make your skin glow. On days when i dont have a lot of time, i will simply apply a powder over it, mascara and a lip gloss and im good to go. #walmartcontest"
"I think this is a great product, women can feel good about how great this product works to keep their face looking great as they get older. Before purchasing this product I would want to know how it compares to others performance wise and price wise for value, is this product safe for all skin types. I have found this to be a very good product, although I have yet to price it and I would pay a little more for a product that performs better than a cheaper one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product goes on smooth and doesn't leave a greasy or sticky feeling on your skin. It soaks in pretty quickly. I can tell a difference especially around my eyes. My skin does seem softer and smoother than it did before. This product is something I would make part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have taken time to use this product and I have discovered that my face feels wonderful after using this product daily. If you have not tried this product, go buy it because your face will feel amazing. #lorealdaycream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and I will continue to use it! The scent is not overpowered by the sunscreen in it. It gives me instantly smooth feeling skin and I can apply my makeup evenly over it without it clumping up, streaking or looking greasy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many day creams on my face, but have not liked any of them because of the harsh chemicals in them that break my face out. This day cream by Loreal is awesome. I have waited for a while to try it and I have to say that I love this product! #lorealdaycream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off,let me say,I loved how this product was packaged.It looks like a high priced item.It works well on my normal skin. My skin immediately felt smooth and silky.It sinks into your skin immediately and doesn't leave your skin feeling all clammy and oily.After just two weeks,i could see that this cream was working! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a chance to use the Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream. I must say this is a nice product. I don't feel like it left me mosturized. It is a nice creme feels like cashmere for the skin. Overall it was a great product that I enjoyed using. I like that it has SPF 15 in it. Would be good to use for pre makeup application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While this did help reduce some of my fine lines and wrinkles, it made my face breakout like crazy. Seriously... At least one new whitehead everyday. That aside, my skin did feel very hydrated and soft. However, although I dislike wrinkles, I hate acne even more. I won't be using this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The scent of this product was to much for me. It triggered a migraine. I have it to my cousin when it wouldn't work for me. She used it and said it was a great moisturizer but didn't do much for her wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The facial day cream left my skin feeling bright and alive with a sunscreen , you just can't go wrong here. L'Oreal has truly outdone themselves with this trio, cell renewal facial day cream, the cell renewal night cream and the age perfect renewal eye cream. I won't go a day or night without it now that I see how great it works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this product makes my skin feel. I apply it every morning after I wash my face. The smell is nice and it goes on smoothe. Can definitely see improvement in my skin over the last 30 days. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
While the day cream was very smooth going on it was so strongly scented I could barely stand it. While I am almost 40 I don't like smelling like my grandmother! And I didn't notice enough benefits of the Cell Renewal to make me overlook the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is okay. My face still seems to peel in my T-zone. I have combination skin so its real hard to find something that takes care of every need. Ive only used this for a week now and I can say it does make your face really soft . I haven't noticed any other appearance changes tho. I will continue to use this for a couple more weeks and write another review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am not one to use facial products. In fact, I only use lipstick. Well, after using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15 , I am hooked. I am in awe how great my face looks and feels. My face is not pasty looking now. It feels so smooth and silky. It is not flaking now. My face looks refreshed. I will buy this when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I actually enjoy using this daily face cream! It is lightweight and doesn't leave an oily film like other creams containing sunscreen that I have tried. After three weeks, I have noticed my skin feels softer and some fine lines seem smaller and less obvious. I also use this cream on my neck area and have noticed a difference there, too. Overall, this is a great product that I would purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the day, night and eye cream now for two weeks and seen some improvement in my skin tone. My face looks and feels smoother and has a nice glow to it. I have fine lines around my eyes that have not changed much but I would still recommend as we all have different skin types and different results. I would recommend giving it a try the only thing you have to lose is a few wrinkles!! and lets face it nothing wrong with that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a thicker cream, but it does not work the greatest for very dry skin. It is also greasy, so when applied, you have to wait a bit before makeup can be applied. The fragrance is not the greatest either. I have noticed my face is a little softer, but because my skin is so dry with our harsh winter, i feel that i need to apply it half way throughout the day, which is unfortunate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with this.i am 47 and have tried and wasted so much money on other products.combined with the others in set i feel my skin is beautiful.i have smoother, tighter skin.my friends keep saying wow your skin looks like it is glowing.told them they can try mine but they need to get their own.i wear it under make up too.my make up goes on smoother.lasts all day too.when this runs out I will be buying more. i recommend for all ladieswho want beautiful soft skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a pretty thick cream, much heavier than I'm used to wearing (with combination skin). At first I broke out a little, but as I used it that let up and I liked how it made my skin feel- very soft and bright. I love that is has SPF as well. It is more scented than I am used to, it smells nice but is pretty ""perfume-y"", but I got used to that as well. I'm looking forward to using it longer and seeing some more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Well I have been using this sunscreen for about a week. But it is winter now. So I can't really tell if it's been working. I do feel the smoothness of my face. It does moisturize my face But can't tell if the SPF is working or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am someone who is very sensitive to smell when it comes to using products. For me, this smell was a little overpowering. It does smell good, just a little strong to me to wear all day. It left my face feeling a little ""greasy"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a light, non greasy, breathable cream that didn't cause me to sweat or have that oily face feeling. It has a refreshing smell, and I noticed a difference in 3 weeks of using this product in combination with the night Cream, and eye renewal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream is a great product. It has a very nice smell too it, light and not to strong. It goes on very smooth, and doesn't feel heavy. Absorbs very quickly, feeling like there is nothing there. Makeup goes on over it nicely, doesn't make it feel thick or heavy. I noticed my skin looks brighter and more youthful.

I think this is a great day cream for those of us who aren't quite ready to accept getting older. It felt light on my skin and did not leave it greasy. It had a very light pleasing scent and did not affect my makeup application at all [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have had the opportunity to use this product for a couple of weeks now and I must say I am impressed. It goes on quite nicely, my skin absorbs the product and didn't leave my face feeling greasy. My skin feels and looks very soft, smooth and firm. I would highly recommend this to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
smooth and light. goes on well under makeup as a primer. would use this everyday. i like that it has a sunblock in it as i live in the south and our spring and summer days you always need protection from that skin aging sun. its nice to have extra protection and moisturizer.

"I liked the feel of this product. It was lightweight, non-greasy and just enough coverage for daytime without ruining makeup or making it hard to apply. The bonus was that it had sunscreen in it. Do not dislike the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the cream for a week my skin was softer and smoother. I noticed a definite change for the better. The smell is amazing. I love the fact that i was able to have sunscreen already added into the cream which cut out an added step in my morning routine. The only drawback I did notice was that it left my skin shiny and not in a good way. I would have to wipe my face after to get rid of the greasy look and feel.

"First of all I wish there was sunshine so the SPF facial cream could have been useful! My facial skin felt nice and smooth after I applied it, although it was a bit heavy for my liking. I did not see any difference using this cream opposed to my other one that I normally use. I did have an occasional pimple here and there,which I do not normally experience [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product for the first time and I am now a devoted customer. The difference in my skin is amazing. It is moisturized and supple. It looks bright and revitalized. I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream with SP15 and I loved it! I am 53 years old, my skin is dull and dry, but this cream truly has helped me see results! My skin looks smoother, moist, and a little more radiant. this Day Cream also helps my foundation go on smoother and stays looking good for about 6 to 7 hours.

"I found this to be very hydrating without leaving a greasy residue,it seemed to absorb right away,leaving my skin feeling like velvet,and i felt like my skin looked and behaved like younger skin..also left a lovely soft canvas for face makeup to rest on...loved this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't to happy with this. It made my face feel oily. I wasn't happy with the results after a week. I wouldn't recommended this product. If you want to try it don't expect to see a real difference. Just wasn't satisfied with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ahhhmazing is what I think. This day cream makes my skin feel so soft. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin is getting so firm and tightened and I already look 5 years younger! I have tried other day creams and this is just the best....hands down! My skin feels so silky smooth. If you have been trying to find the perfect renewal cream, look no further, this is very much worth taking a chance on!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've not used very many facial products in my life but this one I loved so much. The appearance of the box alone was nice. It looks pretty fancy even when you take it out the box. The smell is beautiful. With the cold weather, I've accidentally licked my lips and tasted the product. Tastes a lot like sugar. I liked wearing this for everyday use. It wears well even under makeup. Overall, I would definitely continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream smells so good and feels like silk on your skin. It contains sunscreen, but it protected my face during the cold winter tempatures. My skin was smooth, not chapped by the winter winds. My face and neck looks and feels smoother. I highly recommend this product. So easy to use with wonderful results. I love the day cream. I look better, so I feel better!

"From Day one, this cream went on beautifully and absorbed quickly, with little effort. No need to work it in. I'm usually very sensitive to the scent of creams and lotions, but this one was light and very pleasant. It didn't feel sticky or oily and left my skin feeling silky.

I always look for if a product is going to clog my pores but still moisturizes well and protect me from the sun. It says the last two items but does not tell me if it won't clog my pores. I haven't had any issues with it but I would like it to tell me that without having to do a whole bunch of research to find out. Otherwise it is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It's not heavy feeling on the skin. A little goes a long way. It has a light soft scent. It absorbs quickly on the skin. My skin appearance looks dewey and refreshed. I haven't had any problems with wearing it under my make up, and I haven't needed to use primer when wearing this. The appearance of my wrinkles also seem less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was hesitant after the 1st use of the eye cream and night cream after having a slight break out the next day. Unsure if it's due to the cream. After 3 weeks use of the day/ night cream and eye cream, I am happy with the products. The eye cream does cause light stinging around my eyes but overall, my complexion has a bit more even tone with the circles under my eyes being slightly lighter. My make up goes on smoother.

"I have found the day cream firms and smooths my skin. It smooths on so easily it seems to disappear, yet my skin is softer and more supple. I also like that it provides SPF sun protection with each easy use. A winner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I really like this cream ... I used it for about 2 weeks now and I swear I had an uneven tone in my face and it has really gone away. I have really dry skin and it has fixed my problems with that. I'm swear by this day cream. It's really easy to apply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the day cream is light and love the smell. Sadly I think that it's breaking me out instead of helping with my anti aging regiment. I did receive this product from being buzz agent. Glad I got a chance to try it out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this day cream makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I applies as directed and the first 3 days were amazing. I then started noticing my skin was getting blotchy.

L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15 (1.7 oz) is my new fountain of youth! I have been using this product close to a month and my skin looks more youthful.

I absolutely love the way it feels on my skin when I'm applying it and unlike other products I have used in the past it does not leave a sticky/ tacky residue.

"I have been using these products for a few weeks. I like that they make your skin feel nice, no greasy feel. It absorbs into your skin and doesn't leave a residue.

"I'm prone to adult acne and am hesitant to try new products, never sure if they will aggravate the problem. Happily, after using this product for just a few days I saw an improvement in my skin.

I am completely satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried this product for three weeks it just didn't work for me.Product has easy to follow directions to use just smoothed on face every morning after washing face.I didn't notice that my skin looked more youthful does not appear more bright or supple after using.

I was very pleasantly surprised when i opened this up. It is packaged very nice and a beautiful gold container. Has a very pleasant soft scent to it that is a nice surprise when u open it up. Its a soft cream that is not heavy weighted or oily at all. It smears over the face smoothly and you really dont need a lot. I have been using this product now for 3 weeks and i am really liking the results so far and also how it is weightless on you face. My majeup goes on smooth over top.

"I loved the texture and delicate smell of this cream, I felt pampered and loved the idea of having spf protection included into one step. I did not feel a transformation in the texture of my skin, though I gave it a few weeks of use. It works great under makeup, especially if you're needing to maintain a ""matte"" look.

"This is a GREAT daytime moisturizer! Has a luxurious silky texture and goes on very nicely. You only have to use a small amount to get full coverage. I noticed, after only using it for several days, a noticeable softening of my lines. Has a nice soft fragrance, not overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the smell and the feel of the product but later in the day and the next day my face was really oily. I don't think i would use this product outside of using it to review it! I have somewhat oily skin as it is and I don't like using a product that makes it worse. If I had known what it would do to my skin I wouldn't have wanted to use it at all!

I started using this product a few weeks ago and I was very religious and making sure that I used it everyday. It left my skin shiny but that was about it. I haven't seen any other changes and no one including me noticed any difference. The product was easy to apply and absorbed fairly quickly and it had a pleasant scent. I am going to give it a few more weeks and see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a skin care junkie and usually get my moisturizer from department stores , however I must admit drug store brands are not bad at all after trying this one.

"This product is more than I expected. Keeps you feeling like you are moisturizer is actually working to keep you young and free of wrinkles. I tried it for 4 weeks along with the night cream.

I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a fool proof way to keep you looking younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream for just over 2 weeks. My skin looks and feels softer. I do believe it's looking a little firmer too!

"Great product!. Lightweight texture with a powerful moisture level. Never makes your skin feel greasy or gross!!! Softens and smooths out fine lines and wrinkles. Great under make up because it wasn't heavy not did it over power my make up. Pleasant smell, some moisturizers can smell stronger then perfume! but this one was just ""light and fresh"". Over all a perfect product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only been using the cream for a little over 2weekd. It absorbs well but I it isn't a rich as the Night cream version. After a while you don't feel like you have moisturizer on & works well under make-up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I actually really like the product. It seems to be doing a good job. I have been using it for several weeks. It does have spf but I have no use for that this time if year. My skin is definitely softer and clear. I have sensitive skin and it didn't cause redness or irritation. I would definitely buy this when it runs out. So glad i got to try it free first.

"I think Loreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream Moisturizer is a great product! I've used it for three weeks and there is a noticeable difference in my skin.

My skin is smoother, more supple, and looks more youthful. The cream feels soft, not greasy, and it smells really nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the product day cream for 3 weeks and can definitely see a difference in my skin. It is much brighter and the cream absorbs quickly, yet feels very light when applying.

I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"What I would really like to know before purchasing this product is if it works like it claims to. Well, I have to say, it really didn't make much of a difference on my face as i was hoping it would. It does smell good and I think the texture is just right but it didn't reduce any lines or wrinkles nor did it hydrate my dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the day cream and people have noticed that my skin is a bit more oily. My sister told me I needed to cut down on my fat intake that my skin looked olyer than usual.

"I've used this faithfully since receiving it, along with the night cream and eye cream. The scent is strong but fades not long after applying. This is perfect under my makeup, has added moisture without making my skin oilier - even though I have mature skin, it does get oily. I find my skin has plumped up since using it which diminishes the look of lines and wrinkles. I really like this product and will recommend it to friends and family!

Loved all 3 of the products. I did see an improvement in the wrinkles by my eyes they became less noticeable. Also the Day cream didn't cause any break outs or make my face to oily. I have oily skin to begin with. All in all after 30 days I did notice my skin looks healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. I love how smooth it goes on and how soft my skin feels. I can already tell a difference in my skin and how it looks more rejuvenated. It is not greasy feeling at all and makes my make-up go on nice and smooth and very natural looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is most excellent. I often don't wear makeup so this is perfect to just wash my face and put it on. It's very creamy and you don't have to use alot each time. This smell is fresh and clean. If you are looking for a facial cream to use during the day this is the one to use. Plus it's from L'Oreal a very trusted brand name.

I live in Fl and this is the perfect product for someone in the sun a lot. I loved the smell and especially loved the way it made my skin look and feel. My friends all commented on my skin!without even knowing I was using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day and night cream as well as eye cream have a wonderful texture. Exceptional moisture without feeling greasy. I noticed a dramatic change in my skin, which is exceptionally dry in winter, after one week of use. It seemed to ""plump"" with moisture and became smoother to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the day cream for 2 weeks and there is marked difference in the sight and feel of my face. It no longer feels tight after a wash and fine lines are no longer visible. I am over 50 so the little lines are definitely showing. After using this day cream my face feels so much softer. I would recommend this 100%. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm used to facial creams that are greasy, thick, take forever to absorb, and then don't seem to do anything. This day cream is the exact opposite of all of those. I love the way it smells, the fragrance is light and dissipates quickly. I love the way it feels - not greasy, absorbs quickly, and light enough to be used regularly under makeup. And after a week of use my face seems more even and smooth. A winner for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product, I can see the little lines I had disappearing! This is a definite must have! My skin is softer and smoother and I have had people actually notice the difference in the last couple of weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Day Cream!!! Not heavy leaves my face feeling soft and fresh. I really like the smell not a strong smell just a clean fresh smell. I would highly recommend this Day cream to anyone and will be using L'Oreal regualarly now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for almost a month, and I absolutely love it no complaints at all, very easy to use. I started to see results in the first week, the skin around my eyes is tighter, the crows feet are going away, the skin on,my face and neck are tighter than before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product came in a small, easy to open container. The product is easy to store and not bulky. The day cream is nice and has a silky texture to it. You don't need much to cover your whole face so it's lasting a long time. I noticed my skin was not as dry after using product for several days and a little brighter. The only con I have for this product is that it made me break out at first. I used both the day and night cream so I'm not sure if it was one more then the other. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a few weeks now. Although I can tell no immediate effects I still like the product. I guess the effects are more long term. A little goes a long way which is a big plus for me. It makes paying a little more seem worth it. Its not greasy and has a nice smell. I recommend it. The jar is nice too. Its heavy and if you're crafty you should be able to reuse it for something. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little goes a long way! I love the smell! It feels good when I put it on but within 4 hours my face feels so oily and itchy. I have very sensitive skin too. I noticed breakouts after using. This would be a good product if you have normal to dry skin. I think it is a bit too harsh on sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I Love the moisture this verme provides. It has been a cold winter and my skin gets dry I decided to try to wear it under my makeup and it has been very helpful to keep my makeup from drying me up even more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved this product! L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream is light, non-greasy, and goes on perfectly under my CC cream. I have combination skin that gets a bit flaky in the winter, but I still need to be careful with moisturizers because I break out pretty easily. So far, so good. It also contains sunscreen without smelling sunscreen""ish"". Bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is a great addition to my morning routine. I try to use more natural products on my face, but I do like that this day cream is filled with SPF 15. It has a pleasant smell and I like that the cream, although somewhat thick, goes on smoothly and soaks in rather quickly; leaving a non-greasy feeling on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I normally use face lotions thinking creams would be to heavy for daytime, but although this cream has a thick consistency, it doesn't feel heavy on my skin. My foundation smooths on nicely over top of this cream and my skin looks luminous, moisturized and healthy! I have noticed less redness and fine lines after using this product for about 3 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream was easy to use. It has a very creamy, smooth consistency that was pleasant. I could see a positive difference in the softness of my face, as well as a brightness to my complexion that was nice. The scent is a little sweet for my taste but wasn't terrible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product says sunscreen so I'm not sure if it is useful during the winter but I did use it everyday. My skin is very dry and it kept my skin moisturized all day long. I also suffer from breakouts and have not noticed any since using this product. Also it has a great smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin feels and looks great after 3 weeks of use. Baby #2 had definitely taken its toll on my skin. My pores look smaller and I fine lines are reduced around my mouth. This provided moisture without a greasy look [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOOOOOOVE the smoothness and glow that it gives to my face with the added benifit of sun protection. Its a great day time moisturizer alone or under make up. Its consitency it what I love the most about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This container was larger than I was expecting, it has a good amount of product in it. I like the light scent and the fact that it has spf already in it. This way I don't have to put on a separate sunscreen!! I haven't noticed a difference in my skin tone or wrinkles, but it does do a great job of fighting winter dryness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is just what I was looking for to moisturize my face. It feels so creamy and I immediately feel refreshed after applying it each morning. My face doesn't feel dry at the end of the day as it normally would in the winter weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just recently started using this product and I am hoping it will be my ""go-to"" moisturizer in the future. When I opened the package I immediately noticed the product smelled good and the texture was just right for a face cream. I can only rate it based on my recent use, but will be happy to adjust my score if it shows long term benefits in the wrinkle department! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like this cream, but it was too much for my skin. Very heavily fragranced, this cream did rehydrate my dry skin, but after two days of using thing and the night cream, I started to get an itchy breakout on my jawline. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in my early 30's with combination skin and a history of acne. This cream has a light floral scent and goes on easily. It absorbs well and doesn't leave a sticky residue. It is a bit thick. Great for the winter, but probably not for the summer. I put make up on right after applying this cream and had no problems with the make up ""pilling."" While this moisturizes well, I didn't notice any difference in my skin compared with my usual drug brand lotions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal's Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is luxurious, yet light weight, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It feels like I just left the spa and I love the fact this cream has a specific ingredient to stimulate cell renewal. Not only that, but the cream has an antioxidant and SPF which makes my morning routine simple, starting my day off happy and healthy. My only criticism- I know the cream is thick, but I wish it came in a pump to keep my finger from contaminating! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did feel that the day cream gave me fresher, more youthful looking skin. But it did nothing beyond that and I can use another day cream for those benefits. I was also unimpressed with the ingredient list. It seemed like the active ingredient was components of sunscreen. I can buy inexpensive sunscreen instead.

"I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Call Renewal Facial Day Cream for a few weeks now and LOVE it! As soon as you open the lid the soft fragrance of the cream smells amazing. A little bit goes a long way. It goes on super smooth too! It leaves my face feeling like silk. It has proven to not only moisturizer my face, but has also given my face a glow. I would definitely reccomend this Cream to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is creamy but is not too thick which is good. It goes on smoothly and is perfect under makeup. It makes my skin smooth and protects my face from the sun since it has SPF 15. But one thing that I wish is that the SPF is higher than 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the facial day cream and I loved it! It made my face feel smoother and I noticed my complexion was more blended. It wasn't greasy like other face creams I've tried. I liked the way it smells too, very inviting [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally did not like this product.when I first put it on I thought it was awesome,but then I tried to put makeup on top of it.when I would touch my face balls of day cream mixed with makeup would come off!this product didn't work for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream has a wonderful texture. It is creamy and non-greasy. I have combination skin with an oily t-zone and this day cream left my skin feeling wonderful. It has a very pleasant smell, and I love that it contains SPF15. I would definitely buy this cream again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this product is excellent for a daily moisturizer. However, I do have a complaint that it is a bit strong smelling for me. I do not like a lot of scent in my moisturizer but it went on smooth and not oily at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the day cream works just as well as the night cream. The day cream has a spf of 15 so it helps block sunrays. I love the clean feeling I felt when I put it on. It was never sticky. I also loved the fact that my skin was receiving the nourishment it need to help perserve my skin and keep it young looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used the product for a couple of weeks now and have noticed some difference. My skin appears to be a little brighter and less blotchy. I am definitely going to continue using this product. I would recommend it for aging skin as I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have to admit i was unsure if the day cream would work. I have to say i am blown away by the difference in my skin.the cell renewal day cream has helped my skin feel much softer. i was scared because i have sensitive skin. it works so well i will continue too use this product. i highly recomend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never been big on this kind of stuff, but I have been converted by this product. Just like the night cream I felt like it made my skin feel a bit oily but the good def outweighs the bad. I love that a little goes a long way and I love the scent. I am a customer for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm 48 years old turning 49 this year and I try nearly everything. Winter makes my skin so dry and this product is much needed. I combined all 3 products and feel within a couple months the real difference wil show. I'm allergic to a lot of products and this product did not make me break out at all. I have a bad case of milia under my eyes and although it did not clear it, there is a gentle difference of new skin. Before and after pic shown. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a new product that I decided to try out. Day Cream is not something that I use every day, after using this product I have to change my mind. Usually in the winter I have dry skin and can feel my skin actual dry and pulling tight throughout the day. After using this product a couple of days that has changed. My face feels much more healthy and looks so much better. The tightness has gone away. I absolutely recommend this to other people it has converted me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product worked better when I used the night cream at night and day cream in the day. It is packaged well. The texture is very rich and creamy. It did not leave my face feeling greasy. I would recommend buying both day and night creams together. As far as giving my skin a youthful look I cannot tell that it worked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do not go out much into the sun because of my work schedule so I do not use this product as often as I should. This cream comes in a beautiful jar and upon opening it you can tell it's worth using. The richness of the cream is unlike anything I've seen. This has an SPF of 15 which is great for my skin. My face tends to dry under the sun, but when I did use this product my face stayed lucious all day. I can actually see no dead cells on my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never been one to use a day cream but with getting older my skin isn't as youthful as it used to be so I decide to try one. I'm using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15. I have used the day cream for a little less than 2 weeks. I have noticed that my skin is softer and smoother and small lines are not as noticeable. You don't have to use a lot as a little goes a long way. And, I like that the jars have a wide mouth so it's easy to get the cream out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product my skin feels & looks great So much brighter & clearer. It's so easy to use & fits easily into a skin care regimen. Silky smooth. Seeing fine lines reducing around my eyes & lips Love this loreal creme I was doubtful that it would help my skin because it's uneven & blotchy but it really worked well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given the opportunityto try this product and write a review. This was very nicely packaged. I opened the bottle...i enjoyed the fragrance, it was not too strong. The first time i used it, it was easy to apply. It did make my face feel soft but was not able to apply my makeup right after...i think i may have put on a little too much, but after about 30 min i was able to apply my makeup. Now after using this for a few weeks, my skin feels smoother and looks more refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OK to be honest I'm not one to do a daily face cream are even sunscreen on my face and less needed but as I'm getting older and things are starting to droop a little I should've taken the time I started using this of L'Oreal Paris age perfect cell renewal facial daily cream SPF 15. I am 10 days and do using this and man the way my face feels how much healthier it looks and hydrated I'm sad I didn't start this a while ago this is one product I will keep using [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't like the Day Cream quite as well as the night cream, it wasn't quite as thick and creamy, but it still felt great. My skin didn't feel nearly as tight at the end of the day and my dryness was completely eliminated. I will definitely try to keep up the Age Perfect Regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a rich moisturizing cream with enough SPF for daily use. I tend to have combination skin, and the cream is too rich for my regular use. However, it has been fabulous during the winter when I've spent time outdoors. it has held up to the cold, biting wind and prevented my cheeks from becoming chapped. I recommend it to anyone with dry skin and everyone during the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that sounds far this is a really nice product. I have used it consistently in the dry winter air of KS and it has made quite a difference. I love that a little goes a long way. I also like that after three days, I went from two applications a day to one. This is a product that I would definitely recommend to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I finally found a facial cream that works for me. This cream is non-greasy and is the perfect base for my makeup. I have noticed visible results after using it for only one week.

"During the winter months, my skin gets very dry. This cream did wonders for hydrating without leaving any greasy feeling. My makeup was much easier to apply since my skin wasn't dry, which was a plus! On top of all that, it smells great, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My winter skin appreciates this product. Not too greasy, although it does require some time to sink in. Did not have any breakouts in the 2 weeks I've been using it daily. I like that it has some anti-aging ingredients; it's a good maintenance product for sensitive dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love LOREAL age perfect cell renewal Facial Day Cream. I'm a very cautious kind of person when it comes to creams for my face. I have to say I really love it. It wasn't greasy with a lightweight feel. It has a nice clean smell, it helps nourish and renewed my face, with a firmer fell. I would recommend you try LOREAL age perfect cell renewal it helped me a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using the product to two weeks now. Makes skin more supple. Face is soft. Though I like the product, it made my face too shiny, greasy looking. I actually have been using the L'Oreal Paris Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream at night and the night cream for day because for some reason the night Cream looks more matted. My skin in the morning is nice and soft. My whole face looks brighter and fuller ( less saggy) . Will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the perfect product to combat the brutal WI winter and the dry skin that comes with it. With each use my skin instantly feels smoother and completely moisturized and the results last all day. I've been using Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream consistently for two weeks and have already noticed brighter more refreshed looking skin. Pleasant scent and non-greasy formula.

"I was pleasantly surprised to find this product actually did what it said! It did blend fine lines. It did help to blur the wrinkles. My only complaint is that once applied it was somewhat greasy. I found that if I waited until it fully dried (about 10 mins) and then applied makeup, the results were better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think this product is great, it provides great moisture and SPF protection for the skin. The fragrance is great but to be honest it is very strong for a face product, if it was a body lotion it would be fine but for the face I personally believe its too strong. I would be careful with this product if you have acne prone skin because of all the added ingredients. Overall it's a great product and does moisturize the skin well.

I love love loved this product. My first initial reaction was that this cram was going to be too greasy on my face but much to my surprise it was quite the opposite. It left my face feeling light and refreshed. This product will now become part of my daily routine along with the night cream and the eye cream. So glad I was given the opportunity to try this product out as I otherwise would not have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how soft this makes my skin. However, I find that you do not need to put a lot on, as it will be very greasy and oily. This would be a problem because then the rest of your makeup piled on after won't stick so well. But for the price, this makes a great age-correcting product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved the texture of this day cream, I'm a makeup junkie so I made sure I was all natural (which was very hard for me LOL!) This cream has a very nice scent and as an added bonus SPF 15 which is not super thick so it won't cake under your foundation! I can't wait to keep seeing the results as the weeks pass by and will totally recommend this day cream to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer kind of took awhile to absorb and kind of stuck to the top of my skin . I was able to use it under makeup so that was ok. I wish this didnt make my acne prone sensitive combination skin break out but I felt like it clogged my pores. It gave me texture almost immediately and no one wants that. It was moisturizing but I didn't feel like it was overly moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The consistency and smell are perfect. I'm always a fan of this brand and reasonable price for high end quality. I've used it only three times, after I apply my face starts to sweat as though it's only sitting on top of my skin. As the day cream doesn't do this - my thought is the SPF is causing inconsistencies for me. This makes my bb cream tough to stay put - it makes the appearance of my pores more visable and dry skin on my nose more obvious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this about 10 days ago and immediately started using it. After using it for a week, my skin looks visibly smoother and more evenly toned. Its easy enough to use daily and smells good too. It helped moisturize my skin and now my face is soft and smooth. I would recommend this to anyone looking for easy to use facial cream that leaves you with soft and smooth skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the idea that this facial cream has SPF 15 to protect your face but overall I did not like it. I live in Texas and believe it or not our weather is crazy. I noticed that on hot days my face would sweat a lot with this cream. Especially my T-zone area. The cream is too moist and oily for my skin. It would also itch my face a little after putting on make-up. I thought no this cream works out for people with dry facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the age perfect cell renewal line is a great line. It has a fresh light scent. I like that the day cream isn't oily and smoother to apply than the night cream. Make up easily applies over the day cream. I have oily skin and this doesn't add any extra oily appearance. It has kept my face well moisturized in this winter month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I give this 4 out of 5 stars. At first it would say 5 stars but i am noticed that the first Few days of using it the my skin became irritated. I am not sure if I am just not used to having this on my skin but on a great note I gave it four stars because I have noticed a change after trying it. My skin is not longer irritated by the product and I am giving 4 stars only because of the initial skin irritation but that may only be because of my skin.

"I enjoyed using the whole line of L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Renewal products. I used all three products together to be able to reach full benefits. The day cream prevents further damage and protects you from the sun. I for one never remember sunscreen during the colder months or dreary days but I know I should. This cream protects my face while moisturizing and rehabilitating, I couldn't ask for more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the L'Or√©al day cream. It has a great scent and goes on smoothly. It is a thick cream without being greasy at all. I wear make up every day and I put it on under my foundation. It didn't make my face break out at all. I love that it has SPF in it. My face felt smoother after using this product. I didn't notice any other major changes but I think this is a great moisturizer for every day wear. I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Love this moisturizer! The day cream was super nourishing without feeling thick, heavy or the least bit greasy. It has a very light and pleasant smell, left my skin with a slight glow and felt so smooth. I personally feel like this cream minimized my blemishes and made me feel like my skin looked super healthy. When I used it along with the night cream it was a little much for my skin.

I have dry skin, and noticed that when using this my skin looks more radiant and my make up goes on much smoother with no dry patches to cling to. I LOVE that after I apply this product the appearance of my fine lines around my forehead is greatly reduced. Not a 5-star review because I am not a fan of Avobenzone sunscreen.

"I have never used an anti-aging product before trying this. However, I received this for free from bzzagent free for testing purposes. So, I thought I would try it. I was immediately impressed with the texture of the lotion. It feels very soft and silky and goes on my skin very smooth. It looks a bit greasy at first but dries in clean. I like it overall but I do not think that it will help with making my skin look any younger. Thanks for letting me try this I may purchase it again.

I have applied the creamy day cream every morning as instructed. I feel confident wearing it knowing my face is protected by the spf. However the jar says to reapply every couple hours.wearing makeup makes this task virtually impossible. So far I am quite pleased by the results. I can feel the difference in my skin already.

I have been looking for a day moisturizer for my face. I have very oily skin but recently it had been drying out in the mornings after I wash my face. I've been using this for about two and a half weeks and I have seen a big difference in my skin since then. It's a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is a little greasier than the night and eye creams. It does moisturize well, but I don't like the feeling for the first 5 minutes after I put it on. All in all it works pretty good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the day cream for a while and I did not like it at all. It was very thick and did not absorb well into my skin. It made my daily routine very difficult because it never fully absorbed & left my skin feeling very heavy and greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for a free weeks now, and I really like it. It's been a super dry and cold past month and my skin had been drying out but with the loreal face cream my face is not drying out. I also like that it doesn't have a greasy feel like a lot of lotions do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been searching for a face cream that would keep my face moisturized throughout the day, especially with the cold weather, and this stuff has been fantastic! I never feel like it's worn off half way through. It's light, but keeps your face feeling soft all day, without the greasiness that some day creams can have. Smells good, and has an SPF for daily sun protection which is a plus, especially without the sun screen smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product has wonderful gold packaging, which is eyecatching. I loved that. I also like the shape of the container. The first time i tried the day cream, it gave my (dry) skin a soft dewy glow, which I loved. A little while later, it seemed as though the cream never soaked into my skin. i had touched my face for some reason and little pieces (balls) of it were coming off my skin. Look like dirt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this now for about 2 weeks. I can definitely say its not the greatest for my oily skin. It feels okay going on, the texture is nice, and it soaks into my skin fairly well. My makeup goes on smoothly over the Day Cream. An hour into wearing I realize how very shiny my face looks. Triple the shine I would typically have. Blotting and applying powder only help for a very short time. I have tried several different foundations, but have gotten the same result each time.

"I've been trying to work more anti-aging products into my routine and this day cream has been great. It's moisturizing but not to heavy on my oily skin and love that it has SPF included. The fragrance is light, not too strong and did not irritate my skin. Will definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this day crew product. I am not the person to normally worry too much about my skin or skin products. This cream was great though. It was really easy to use and went on super smooth. I noticed right away how soft the cream left my face. It's great how it also has sunscreen right in so it will help protect all day long. The product also has a pleasant smell. The price for this product is good also. The container is a good size and you only need a small amount each day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This smells amazing and works really well with my skin. I've been using it for a little oner a week now as my morning skin routine. Very thick for the winter, it also layered very well under my makeup primer and foundation/concealer. I am excited to try more from this line, I'm just not sure how well that this will work in the summer or spring when my skin can e much more oily and greasy as apposed to dehydrated in the winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is wonderful, especially when used in conjunction with the Night Cream and the Eye Cream. I love the texture of the day cream. It goes on silky smooth and wears very well under my makeup. It didn't feel heavy, and it moisturized extremely well. I also noticed after about a week that my fine lines were noticeably reduced! Yay!! Overall, I love this line of products and I will be adding it to my daily regimen for a long time to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am someone who has absolutely NO skin care regiment. So, remembering to use this product daily has been difficult. I do like the scent it has, the product itself makes my skin feel very soft. I have pretty sensitive skin, so I was a little worried it might make me break out, but it hasn't! That has been a pleasant surprise! All in all, would be happy to add this to my skin care regiment (if I had one!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loving this face cream!! I am halfway through my 30 day trial! Here's my before pic! I have noticed a HUGE difference in the tone of my skin already. Acne scars are diminishing, wrinkles are lessening, and even better-no breakouts! I am always scared to try new facial products for fear of a breakout, but my skin is LOVING this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels good on my face. The smell is too sweet for me, so I could not see myself purchasing this product. If it was not as sweet smelling, that would be much better! Great to input an SPF into the daily cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for two in a half weeks. The Day product is amazing. Light on the skin. Sun protection is a must and this works well. I normally have breakouts or my skin goes dry after using certian products. I have not had any issues with L'OREAL s products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was hesitant to try this product at first because I don't like oily products and didn't know how this was going to make my skin feel. I love it! I'm not used to applying anything on my face I cannot wash off. This does not make you feel oily at all. It has made my skin smooth and soft. I can tell the blemishes are going away and my face looks refreshing. I got a compliment from a coworker that I look like I'm glowing. I will continue to buy this product after I'm done with this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this for both day and night.. it is such a smooth and gentle moisturizer that I can use anytime. It has a nice fresh scent and absorbs well. I also appreciate that it takes very little to spread all over my face and neck area. I noticed my skin was more supple with this moisturizer. Will definitely consider purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think it's a great product & it smells so good I look forward to putting it on every day. I can definitely tell the difference when I don't use it because it makes my skin feel so soft when I do. I'm one of those people that don't really have a skin care regiment, but i do now! The only downside for me was that it makes my face really shiny. Overall I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this day cream. It has a very pleasant scent that is not overpowering. The day cream has a very good consistency--not too thin or watered down feeling or not too thick. As with the night cream, a little goes a long way. My face has felt very soft all day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this would be good if you didn't have sensitive skin. It's not hypoallergenic. It does go on smoothly and my face did not feel dry all day. Makeup goes on smoothly after the moisturizer. truthfully, my only issue was hours later, my face itched and it happened each time I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you are looking for a thick facial cream, then this is for you! I prefer my facial products to not have a scent to them and this product has a strong perfume scent to it. I wasn't a fan of that! I also had trouble getting my foundation to spread over my face smoothly after applying the facial day cream. I gave it three stars out of five because it did moisturize as promised, but the thickness and odor were definitely not for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw a huge change on how my face looked by using the Loreal Paris Age Perfect Cream after two weeks. My face was less red and very smooth. I also like the smell of the cream it was very pleasant. I am definitely keeping this in my skin care protocol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how my face is looking and feeling after two weeks of using L'Oreal Age Perfect day cream. My face feels soft and firm, it's time is evened out and it has a nice glow! I love that all my little subtle lines are fading and the bags under my eyes are disappearing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF-15 is a good moisturizer and having sunscreen in it also really helps. I am not too good at remembering to use sunscreen. I usually don't like putting it on my face because it tends to sting. This was a little irritating the first day I used it buy not since. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the age perfect cell renewal day cream just like directed and I didn't seem to see a change in my skin....although I loved that it protected me from the sun. The smell was great the packaging was also nice the gold lids were really cute! All in all it was ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great stuff!!! I love it already. I shared it with my mom Judy. Started using it on 12/23/16. We feel fresh, clean, and definitely glowing!!! I would recommend this product to anyone L'Oreal products are a favorite of my mom and maybe one of mine too now!!! Thank you!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I totally LOVED L'Oreal's Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream. It feels amazing on, no issues at all!!! I am also trying the Night cream and eye cream and so far loving both of them as well. Great products, no problems at all with my skin. It looks great and I've had many people asking what I am using because they notice the difference in my skin. It feels so soft, looks cleaner and clearer and you can truly notice the difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This would be a great day cream for someone with very dry skin. For someone like me who has normal to just a little dry skin, it can take a while for it to soak in so you have to wait before applying make up and such. But it makes my skin soft and it doesn't break me out. The fragrance was a little strong for me and took some getting used to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this product is awesome. I tried it on the first day that I received it. Throughout the day, I kept feeling my skin. It was soft and looked dewy. I have continued to use it and it gets better every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. My mother and I were doing our faces and felt the best change. Our face is soft and looking younger after trying the product a week we can tell the difference! I have always had a very oily skin and this product made me feel better about myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the texture of this cream and it is not too oily for day time use. I also like it because it has SPF in it. The major dislike of this cream, which also applies to the night cream as well, is the scent. It has a strong perfume like smell and it is a big turn off for me. Would like to have it comes with a unscented version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I tried the L'oreal Age Perfect cell renewal day cream I was unsure how it would affect my large pored completion. I am glad to share that I had nothing to fear. There have been no breakouts from clogged pores. My skin is soft and and I've noticed improvement to my crow's feet. It absorbs quickly so I can keep moving onto my busy day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SP-15 is a fair product. It does not moisturize as I would like. I find myself needing to apply a lot of the product in order to moisturize my face and neck. My skin still looks and feels dull and dry. The winter months are harder on my skin, maybe in the summer this product may be different. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the daydream daily since I received the product. I have found that it is very lightweight and non-greasy. I haven't noticed any fine lines diminishing, but I think that would probably require more time to really notice that kind of a difference. I also like how it has built in SPF to help protect against sun damage. That's particularly helpful to those of us who regularly forget to put it in separately. That being said, I would most definitely but this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Felt like a princess !!Using Age Perfect cell renewal day cream was a delight.The packaging made me excited to try the product. The light scent and smooth texture made it a superb finish to morning cleansing ritual right before make up application.Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. Absolute daily morning treat!

"I think this product is great. I love the way my skin feels. A little goes a long way and it soaks into the skin quickly. My skin feels soft and my complexion looks great. The only thing I don't care for is the scent, but I'm very scent sensitive. Would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is quite greasy and takes a while to absorb but my skin feels so soft and smooth after applying it. Its a good cream for normal to combination skin.it keeps your face hydrated for longer time no need to apply it again.Overall ,loved the product and would buy it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that L'Oreal Cell Renewal Day Cream is an outstanding product. I have been using the product for about 13 days. I have seen significant changes with my skin. Fine lines are diminishing, pores appear smaller and the most amazing sign is that a dark spot on the right side of my face has lightened alot.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, the packaging of the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal (trio) is elegant and makes an inviting display on any bathroom vanity! The day cream has no scent and is very thick. A little bit goes a long way! It goes on very smooth and makes my face feel like it is getting hydrated! I have seen major changes in my overall smoothness or tightness after using this product for more than 4 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the cell renewal day cream. It moisturizes my face as a whole. I have combination skin type so in my dry areas it was a perfect fit...no more dry skin. In my oily areas it was a bit greasy. I found that dabbing my face with a tissue after applying it helped to reduce the oily feeling. I also like knowing I am protected with SPF 15 sunscreen.

"This is the best facial cream I have ever used. It smells good,thick so a little goes a long way, which is great!!! MY skin feel soft and moisturized. Doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy which I love. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody looking for a new facial cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was good, but I have extremely oily skin. I had to stop using the day cream if I was wearing makeup. My skin would be so oily within a couple of hours that I gave up. If I want wearing makeup, it was fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The day and night cream made my face feel smooth.. my face did not have a sticky feel after applying like most creams do.. I have used it for 10 days now and my face feels and looks or even toned and firmer.. I would recommend anyone to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the first time I tried L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect product. I used Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15, it is moisturizing, smooth, and not greasy. But I wonder if it works well when Summer time in CA, have to see the result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this Loreal Age perfect cell renewal skin cream.I wear mine and I see a difference in my skin.It does look refreshed and my dry skin is now soft.My skin was dry and rough feeling Now it is soft and looks amazing!Leaves my skin soft and smooth.

"I'm not quite sure about this one. It seemed like a thicker consistency than others that I have tried. I think it would be good for a day without makeup. But if you put concealer or foundation on, this cream might effect your outcome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how moisturized my skin feels, spf is a plus, wish it was higher. First i was disappointed that it felt so greasy for under make up but thr skin absorbs it really well and my skin doesnt feel oily. Really like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This daily facial cream was a little greasy for my taste. It left my skin feeling pasty and shiny. I do like that there is some SPF in the cream, but would prefer it to be at least SPF 30 instead of just SPF 15. The cream also smells a little like hair spray. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This day time cream has a great feel--I love the creamy texture, but it doesn't compare to my current product. The negatives for me are that it only has an SPF 15, versus my current daily facial moisturizer which has SPF 30. Also, this L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal cream has a fragrance, which I don't care for, and my current product is unscented as I prefer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well I was so excited to try this product.. I used it for a week and half and my face was breaking out daily. :-( I think the SPF was causing the breakouts because I stopped using just the day one and have continued with the night cream and my face is clear. My face has been extremely soft, I do recommend this product if you are not acne prone. I am, unfortunately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all I think I'm obsessed with the smell of this day cream. This winter my skin has been so dry, but I've been using this for the past week and I'm impressed. The cream is not greasy and it absorbs into my skin instantly. My skin stays soft all day long. I also rub this on my chapped lips and it has made a major difference. I've even gone a few days without foundation because my skin looks so hydrated and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this day lotion. It makes my skin so soft, and feels plumper. Doesn't irritate my skin, gives great amount of moisture for winter. Doesn't make my face greasy, when that happens your makeup comes off quick makes you look a sweaty hot mess. So all in all satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the day cream the last week. From the container it comes in to the rich thick cream with a light scent, easy to apply and feels good to my dry skin. I feel prettier and even my husband noticed and commented that he could see an improvement after only a couple of days. I will continue to trust L'Oreal with my skin needs.

L'Or√©al is by far has the best skin care products. I have tried others and L'Or√©al is great. It is non greasy and it makes your skin feel alive and soft. I also use many other L'Oreal products. I would not go without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far this day cream is pretty nice! It smells great and isn't super heavy. It's not heavy under my makeup which is nice. I like that it has an spf in it. I would t say it's my favorite mosturizer just because it can be a little irritating when my skin is super dry and sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that the day cream works wonders for your skin.especially when you can use your makeup right after without the cakey build up.It also has a light airy scent not a very perfumed smell.Age perfect day cream has perfected this for me.I've also shared this with my mom who's very picky about facial products.She agreed to try and loves it.She bought it for herself..

"I have very dry and sensitive skin. This product was very silky and thick . It went on great and I didn't feel like I had a product on my face. A little bit went a long way. It was very fragrant, almost overpowering in it's smell. After a few minutes, my face began to have a burning sensation to it. I washed off the product and my skin felt better. I tried the product a few days later, and the same thing happen. I think the strong perfumes caused a reaction with my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15 is the absolute best aging product. Love the packaging with the golden trim. This product made me glow!

"This is a very good moisturiser. It has a thick texture but it absorb nicely without leaving me any oily feeling. I also believe it has a good SPF coverage. I wore this while spending full day outdoor and I didn't get burnt. Compared to the night cream, this contain less fragrance. I also found this face cream provide me good moisture level in winter.

"The product is great . I used it daily with a regime. Feels amazing on your skin. I used it with the eye cream and the night cream. Although I have a youthful face and skin, I would like to keep it that way this product helped to do just that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this after loving the night cream. I did not like the fragrance and I found that this did not absorb into my skin sufficiently. My foundation and this day cream did not work well together, no matter how long I waited. This was okay to use on days when I did not use foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was non-greasy and soaked into skin very quickly. Make up used over the product did not cake or crack. Noticed that there was a difference in fine wrinkles. Would have given it 5 stars but the scent was a little too strong for me. However I am very sensitive to smells and often prefer unscented products. It wasn't an unpleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the product is good but would like it better with some changes/improvements. I think the scent is ok but a little too strong like perfume. It would be nicer with a more mellow clean scent, like fruity or citrus like. Also, the label font is too small to distinguish Day cream from Night cream. The way the lid screws on has to start just right to close properly. I like the texture and color. Does not feel greasy and blends into skin quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the smell. It goes on with a silky texture. The cream leaves no residue and absorbs quickly on your skin. A little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and prefer my day cream without spf. Even though the spf causes a few breakouts its managable with a good clarifying face wash at the end of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was super excited to get this product in the mail! After opening the box I noticed the bottles were very heavy and well made. The cream also smelled so nice! I tried it that very day and you don't need a lot and it absorbs easily. It goes on very smoothly and leaves your face feeling nice and smooth all day. After a week of using my face felt smoother and looked brighter. I love it because it doesn't leave my face feeling oily or shiny. I highly recommend this product!

"I've been trying it for two weeks and the situation is this, is very oily for my taste and when I go out in the sun I start to sweat and I'm left with that very unpleasant feeling. Not everything is bad, after using for a while I can see some results as a skin more clear and soft, which I like, but not enough to forget or pass the fact of the oily texture.

"I think the day cream has a nice light scent and smooth creamy texture. After applying this cream, my face feels soft and smooth, not at all greasy. Unfortunately, I found by midafternoon my face felt dry. So I used a little more in the afternoon. All in all a good cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for 2 weeks and I really like the way it makes my skin feel. I have combination skin so its hard for me to find a cream that does not make my face oily in places while moisturizing the dry areas. This product solved that problem. It has also made my skin look brighter with less blotches. I will continue to use this along with the night cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Will definitely be buying this love how it made my face feel and look . Along with the L'Oreal age perfect eye cream and the night serum . I waited a bit to do my review so i could give a good one this stuff is great . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is great. It goes on smoothly, and is lightweight. It works perfect under my foundation and makeup without leaving me feeling greasy. Doesn't dry out my skin. The bottle size seems like it would last about a month, which is important to me when I'm buying a new product. I think you would be getting your money's worth!

I have been using the day cream in conjunction with the night cream and eye renewal and I love it. After only 2 weeks using the products I see a reduction in the five lines around my eyes and my skin is soft and feels great. It is not oily or drying. I use it under my make up and foundation smooths easily over it and leaves a flawless finish. I highly recommend this product and I will continue to use it regularly.

After using the daytime facial cream for two weeks I have found it to be a very light non oily very refreshing face cream. My skin feels well moisturized and there is no heaviness after application. It has a very refreshing scent and makes the skin feel renewed. The spf is a plus as I am always looking for a moisturizer that has a spf and is dully functional. I will be buying this feom here on out. I have found everything I want in a moisturizer in this day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the daily renewal and it was pretty oily as well as pigmented so it's not something that you can wear prior to applying makeup. It would hve to be used on your day off or applied several hours before you work and removed before you leave. I haven't decided if I like it yet or not.

"I think this product is quite amazing! My skin is softer, radiant and there's a renewed look to my skin! The fragrance is wonderful. It's non greasy as well! Before you try this product, now that it really works! Plus it contains sunscreen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Day Cream is perfect for the cold New England weather. Very light, but so moisturizing, without feeling oily. I use it in the morning, before applying my makeup. It actually helps the makeup go on more smoothly, and stay in place longer. SPF 15 is perfect for preventing those damaging wrinkle causing rays! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the clean feeling with night cream. It is absorbed quickly, leaves clean feeling. Day cream is truely moisturizing, leaves a glow of healthy skin, absorbed into skin slowly, feels clean and refreshed. Eye cream is great, easy to apply small amounts and smooths in quickly. Does not hinder eye makeup...helps keep makeup in place all day, not dry eye skin, stays great looking and cleans easily when removing makeup.Wrinkles fade rapidly.

L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is perfect for mature skin for several reason: 1) it has an SPF of 15 which helps protect it from normal daily sun damage 2) it's rich formula helps seal in moisture and thus plump up wrinkles and skin for a smoother look and feel 3) it takes little that it lasts a long time and is more economical 4) it smells fresh and feels light on the skin 5) it absorbs quickly and thoroughly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream has made my skin look so much better. I love that it has sunscreen in it so you don't have to remember to put sunscreen on separately. One less product to put on in the morning helps me save time. It absorbs quickly so I can put on makeup and is lightweight but hydrating. My skin is pretty sensitive but I did not have any reaction to this cream. The price is great too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream is very nice - it is light and easily absorbed and has a pleasant scent. it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth and doesn't feel greasy. It also makes my fine lines very much less pronounced, after only using it for a few days. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really wanted to love this day cream but I just don't. It has a very strong chemical scent that last for quite awhile after application. It does leave my skin smooth and moisturized but the smell is terrible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loved this product. Can already see the difference it is makeing in the appearance of my skin. I also love the fact that it does not feel greasy or make my makeup run more easily. As a base for my makeup it actually makes it go on smoothly and more evenly. Love this and I have already checked it out in the store so when I am finished I can buy more. I actually looked for what other products loreal had in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the cream my face look healthier and smooth eventhough i have pimples scars from my youth. also like it has spf15 helps during sunny days and dry skin moistorized your face.I use it everyday, apply before you go out wait for 15 min i dislike that.

"I love this day cream. My skin seems to be with a glow and smoother. The fine lines around my eyes have really improved. The scent is nice and it's easy to apply, love the consistency. Have not had any breakouts which I'm prone to, especially when I use a new product. All around happy with the results I've seen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the way my skin felt when I used the day cream, however I naturally have oily skin so putting it on before my makeup made my skin feel a little more shiny and oily than I prefer. I still really liked the product and would recommend it, just be careful of how much you put on if you have oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L.Oreal day renewal cream has really became a treasure.Greatly hydrates your skin with out leaveing an oily texture to your face.I've found my jewel it also seems to melt in to the skin really hydrating.not just sitting on the top of your skin.Leaveing your skin soft and hydrated..

"The Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is thick, without being greasy. It's what my face is craving this winter. In one week of use I'm noticing no dryness or flaking, and smaller pores without a shine through my makeup. No breakouts for my sensitive skin, either! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal products, as my Mother says, are the best. Although the product is good (and smells good), it is a bit too heavy for my face. I have very dry skin. It felt good going on, but felt heavy and alittle greasy. Made my face shiny, even under base. It's great that it has SPF 15. I gave the night cream to my mom (on Christmas morning-not as a re-gift!) She was thrilled. All in all, I liked it. Not my first choice, but it's good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've have seen a difference in how soft my face feels. Some of the dark marks on my face have seem to start to fade as well. This cream feels great and smells great! My makeup seems to stay on better as well. Works best if used with the other products in the same set. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only just begun to use the product. My initial thoughts are that the product is ellegantly packaged and has a very pleasing, light scent. I normally don't wear moisturiser, however this is very lightweight and allows for an even distribution of makeup over it without being oily. I'd also like to add, it even has a rather sweet taste! While I wouldn't recommend eating it, if you do happen to get some on your lips it isn't an unpleasant experience! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is GREAT! I have been wanting to try a more expensive well known product that helps with aging. It didn't feel heavy on my face. And I have to say my face has never felt so soft with any moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't care for the smell or the texture of this day cream. I kept using if for a few days to see if I would like it enough to stick with it and switch and to see if I noticed any difference in my skin. I did not see any change in my skin and it gave me a shine that I didn't care for. I stopped using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very nice day cream. Absorbed into my skin right away and left it silky feeling - not greasy. I really could tell it was moisturizing well. It has a nice fragrance, although I wish is was unscented as I have a sensitive nose! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just started using this product two days ago. It is so lightweight and smells so good. I am 41 and really don't have a beauty routine but I do NOW. I have noticed in just to days softer skin and some of my age spots are starting to fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was unsure about using a face cream since my skin is still prone to breakouts even though I am almost 40! This cream has an spa of 15 and is a thick consistency. I have had no breakouts and my skin is the softest it has ever been! It smells awesome, I don't even have to wear perfume since my face smells so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"ANOTHER great product from L'Oreal. I have been using this for about a week before I put on my make up and it is the perfect moisturizer and makes your make up go on more evenly. I can really see a difference around my eyes and laugh lines, Everything seems to be smoother ! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has fine lines they would like to soften or anyone just looking for a great all day moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the smooth, creamy, day cream. My skin is a little dry and I always have to use moisturizers. With this cream it also moisturizes without the need of anything additional. It feels light and refreshing on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not sure I wanted to use this product the last time I tried a face cream it smelled bad and left my face full of oil. Well I'm glad I decided to go ahead and try it, it smells really good, left my face soft not dry or oily. I am going to continue to use this product for my age is moving forward and I need to take care of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the entire Age Perfect regimen for only one day, I have already seen positive results. My skin already feels much more hydrated and smooth. I have yet to see any ""age specific"" results but expect that will come with time. The product feels high quality and is nicely scented as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While this cream does go on smooth, I'm not a fan of how much fragrance is used. I have very sensitive skin and sometimes could stand the smell. It would be nice to have a more natural fragrance instead of perfume. It didn't do much for my skin either. Not impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin definitely feels more fresh and not so dry! Its visibly more noticeable after being outside in cold frigid days and when i come back inside my skin doesnt feel wind burned or dry! Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product for a week I have noticed that my skin is smooth and soft. My fianc√© has also noticed the change and says we will be buying this product for a long time. Friends have noticed and asked ""What are you doing different?"" so I explain to them about the product I am trying out and now they all want to know where to get it. I am very amazed and happy with the results. Thank you for allowing me to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about a week now and I think it's great! My skin feels so much smoother and softer. The product smells great and goes on good. I tend to have oily skin so if you do, I recommend not putting it on before makeup. I did and noticed my makeup was looking a little oily that day. I don't wear makeup everyday so it worked for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just started using and my skin feels very soft and smooth. It absorbs quickly and moisterizes very well. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I'm looking forward to continue using and seeing a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this cream, and would have given it 5 stars except the smell. It's slightly overbearing. Although, that is the only negative aspect for me. The cream is light weight, I can't even tell I have it on, except that it makes my face so soft and smooth! I really appreciate the sunscreen ingredient. I have been using it for a week with the night cream, and I could swear my little lines are disappearing! I will be continuing to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I applied the day cream after my shower, it instantly softened my dry skin. I work as a server and sweat a lot but my skin wasn't greasy and was still soft at the end of the day. I really enjoyed this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is excellent! I see approvment in the fine lines on my face. My face is firmer and age spots seem to be vanishing. This cream smells great and leaves my skin super soft. I have combination skin and this doesn't leave me oily or cause any breakouts. This is a fantastic product! The biggest improvement was to my skin texture. After just a week, the dry areas are less flaky-looking under makeup and the oily areas are satiny smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the day cream everyday for 1 week now before putting on my makeup. I spent Christmas in Florida and the SPF in the day cream seemed to protect my face from the sun (i burn really easy!!!!) I love the scent of the product but it did leave my face looking a little shiny and feeling oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was concerned that this moisturizer would leave my skin oily but it didn't. While it absorbs quickly it does leave your skin a little too shiny. Works well with your foundation and has a very pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is so creamy and makes my skin feel so soft. It has a faint scent of sunscreen, but the smell quickly dissipates. The cream is very light, which is good for my breakout prone skin. I have never been a day cream user, but when I was asked to sample this cream, I decided that it was time. I love everything about this cream, including the elegant packaging (it makes me feel fancier than I really am). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the day cream for about a week now. I love that is leaves my face feeling moisturizer without feeling greasy. The fact that it contains SPF 15 will be great for using it in the summer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream and I LOVE it. I started using it on my face, neck and throat and it works great. My face looks brighter and the redness on my neck is diminishing. I am trying the night time moisturizer and will let you know how it goes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a pleasure to apply this cream to my face. It's thick and smooth and once applied my face was smooth without being greasy. It has a faint pleasant smell. Love this day time creamy face cream with sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This day cream is great. My skin was dry and my complexion was so so. I have been using this about a week and my complexion looks brighter and supple. People have noticed and I told them what I was using.. I'm sure some of my friends will try it.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great. It made my skin softer without the great feeling like other face creams. I will buy thus product when I am finished with my sample. I also loved the other products that came along with it. I would definitely recommend this product to mu6friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have fair skin and make sure to wear sunscreen everyday but most feel too heavy or have a very strong sunscreen scent. This day cream has great coverage and is lightweight with a lovely scent that is not reminiscent of sunscreen. Overall, I feel like I am getting a great dose of moisture, good sun coverage with SPF 15 and the scent makes the product feel really expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a good product it leaves my skin feeling moisturized. Today was my first day using it so I'm excited and looking forwars to using the Night cream tonight and giving thr eye renewal cream a try!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a wonderful daytime moisturizer. I love that it disappears into my skin and goes well under makeup without turning greasy. The texture is lightweight and smooth and after a week of daily use my skin feels softer and smoother. Having SPF coverage is also great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this item! It's not greasy like most moisturizers and it definitely moistens my skin. It leaves such a nice glow on my face and makes me feel young again. Still trying out this product but just from a week I see a difference ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After applying the cream for the first time, it was obvious that I would have to get used to the smell. The old perfume smell that it let off is kinda strong. The cream left my face feeling tacky until it dried. Once it was dry the only appearance it gave was that I had put lotion on my face. After using for right a week I didn't see any changes in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've noticed my skin is another and younger looking, after only a week. The product feels a little oily compared to my dry skin, but after some time, I was able to put on makeup. I love the packaging, and it definitely feels high-end. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 55 and I have very complex skin. I have oily skin and large pores. However, I also have sensitive skin and the oiliness causes my skin to get irritated and flaky. I wore the Day Cream for the first time yesterday and I noticed in the evening that it still looked good ND had not made my skin oily. Thumbs up so far!

I think that the L'Or√©al Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream was a joy to use. I loved the scent....sometimes a scent can be overpowering and this was not. The texture was perfect....not too thick or thin.....very good coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way it leaves my skin feeling. I apply is it every morning and it feels soooo smooth and soft after applying it. I haven't noticed any changes in dark spots or wrinkles as of yet, but I have only used it for less than a week. Can't wait to try it for a while and see the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15 is really nice. I have really fair skin and most lotions bother me but this does not. Very light and not oily. Do not need to use a lot which I love because I hate feeling stuff caked on my face. Also nice that it has SPF 15 since I burn so easy. My face looks smoother after only using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Living in a colder area, my skin tends to get really dry. I really don't use a lot of products on my face, because I break out from most of them. This product worked like a charm! It moisturized, and left my skin feeling refreshed without feeling greasy. I have only been using it for about a week, but am still hopeful of my skin firming up a bit too! ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Day cream is a light cream. It goes on soft and simple, Leaving your skin feeling refreshed and protected. I love this cream because it has a small amount of fragrance that is not overwhelming at all. I also love the packaging the Jar is small in size and has a wide mouth that makes getting the cream out of the jay is very easy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using L'Oreal Perfect Renewal Day cream for about a week. It makes my face feel smooth and hydrated. I can see a little difference in the texture of my skin already. I love the idea of having sunscreen! It makes one less step I have to do during my busy morning routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Got this is today YIPPEE! I've already used the eye cream & the daily moisturizer. Almost time to try the night cream. I work from home so I shouldn't have a problem using the daily cream as it says to apply every 2 hours?? That seems a bit much but I'm totally willing to give it a try. I can already tell a firming in my neck (hope it really works on it!!!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the L'Oreal Paris age perfect cell renewal day cream SPF 15. After the use of two days I feel a different in my skin. My skin is softer and has a glow. I think BzzAgent for introducing the product to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you are looking for a day cream that actually makes your face feel refreshed, this one is for you. It does not leave your face feeling oily and brightens up your complexion. Making it look smooth and silky. It has a very nice light clean fragrance. I personally have to say, it's the best day face cream I have used thus far. L'Oreal is a definite must if you would like the look of younger refreshed facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved my skin from the night before, but I am now having a mini love affair with the day cream. Used with the night cream my skin felt teenage supple and noticeably softer. I had a radiant glow and no need for an additional moisturizer. I am in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product, L'Oreal age perfect cell renewal facial day cream, SPF15 is truly amazing! It truly moisturizes my face all day without an oily feeling. My face is as soft as a baby's ....... and looks healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I tried the new L'Oreal Age Perfect cell renewal day cream. Things I liked...Its a thick cream and is non greasy. I like the way it made my skin feel softer and smoother without feeling oily. It also has a nice smell. It comes in attractive packaging. There really wasn't anything I disliked about this product. I would purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! Smells wonderful! Goes on smooth and makes my foundation so much easier! I don't have to use as much! My face feels smoother to the touch! I'm looking forward to seeing how much my skin improves! Will keep you posted! Pic is day one! I have uneven skin tone so I'm hoping this product will help that.

I absolutely love this makes your skin feel so soft . Before using this my face felt so dry all day. I put this on first thing in the morning and my face still feels soft by night time. I have been using this for a week now and when I run out I will deffinently be buying more of this product. Absolutely love age perfect cell renewal day cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Less is more with this product. A pea size amount will do your face and if it doesn't add slowly to that size amount. This cream like the night Cream left my skin greasy and caused my fave to break out. I would suggest trying on a small portion of your face before using on your whole face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this day cream. It sits nice under makeup or for just a bare face. It has a great smell, unlike other day creams. It is very light and goes on smoothly. It comes in a nice size container so should last a while even with everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't like to wear a lot of make up and this Cream allows me to not wear any at all. It brightens my skin and leaves it with a beautiful glow. Even the container is so beautiful that I leave it displayed on my bathroom counter! It feels very light and it's not at all greasy. I think anyone could benefit from using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this has a light clean smell, goes on silky smooth and doesn't leave me with a greasy feeling. After a couple of days use my skin doesn't have as rough of a texture and my makeup goes on easier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started this day cream 5 days ago. I needed complete and easy to use skin care products. This line is amazing and results were noticeable within a couple of days. Even my husband noticed! If you have 'over 60' skin like mine and need help with fine lines and wrinkles, this is your product! Even if I skip makeup for the day, I'll still be using this because I love the silky feel and the way it makes my skin look and feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the product overall. It has a nice light scent and is light enough to not feel like I'm weighing my skin down with a heavy cream. It does make my face shiny-which I don't like. The other issue I don't see anywhere on the actually jar, a description of what it does. It only mentions using it as a sunscreen. It does leave my face moisturized all day and i enjoy using the product. It would be helpful to know what it is actually doing to renew cells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I put the day face cream on an hour prior to putting on my makeup.. It left my face feeling a tad bit oily .. I think this would be better for people who do not use foundation.. This product also doubles as a sunscreen .. Which again would be better for people not using foundation since you have to reapply every two hours .. Other than the fact it left my face feeling oily under my foundation I didn't have any other problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the L'Or√©al age perfect cell renewal day cream. It is absorbed quickly when applied to the skin. It doesn't make your skin feel oily, making it easy to apply makeup over it. I like it that it has spf 15, however if I would be spending a lot of time in the sun, I would wear a higher spf. This cream makes my skin feels soft with no breakouts. I would recommend it, unless you are looking for something unscented. The scent is nice, but a little strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a fantastic product. The product come in a beautiful package. Its very rich and creamy and leaves skin feeling soft and rejuvenated. It also has a light refreshing fragrance.

this is one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried. I have been a daily user of a different cream for years and had no idea how much silkier and effective L'orealParis Age Perfect Cell Renewal is compared to my old product. It truly lasts all day. It is especially effective in these cold winter months in Wisconsin!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Amazing product! Look at how my face glows! You only need a little dab and it leaves your skin tone more even, makes your skin soft and hydrates but not oily, very moisturizing. I honestly look younger because my skin feels firmer and more vibrant. Definitely helps with the cold weather drying out your skin and leaving it vibrant, not dull, I definitely reccommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The packaging is beautiful and I was hoping it would be great. But the truth is that it made my face too oily. I tried it for awhile thinking it might feel different and to just give it a chance but my skin felt oily each time. I really had a hard time not letting myself wash it off because I really wanted it off the second I put it on but I wanted to be able to really give the creams a chance.

I gave it a 4 as i am waiting for long term results. I normally break out as i have very sensitive skin. So far it has been wonderful and has left me with a smooth complexion. I love it especially this time of year our skin can use the extra boost [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this cream!! Its thick rich and very moisturizing. I have really dry skin and this cream keeps it moisturized. Ive noticed a huge difference in the look of my skin.

I think that L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream is amazing! I have added this to my daily regiment and have noticed several changes that I am so happy about.

l'Oreal Age Perfect day Cream lives up to it's promises. I have been using for about a week and have noticed that my skin is smoother and seems more refreshed. As we age we are looking for products that can renew the surface skin and L' Oreal does just that. I love that it includes a board spectrum SPF 15 that protect my skin from further sun damage. If you worried about aging skin this is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

A little goes a long way. I have just begun using it and I love it. It makes my face look hydrated and youthful. Not gray and ashy as some I have used on the past. The scent is pleasant. This is all that I need in my morning routine. I prefer a more natural look. Everyone is telling me I look more refreshed that's when I tell the ladies about my secret weapon.

"My skin was depleted after pregnancy, leaving my skin dry & dull. As soon as I started using this product, it brought life back to my face. My drab skin was quenched, my glow was back & my fine lines softened. The product smells great & it didn't make my face feel oily. I love that it was a little SPF too.

I think using these products on a daily basis is great. The creams feel so nice. They do not leave your face feeling oily like some products I've used. And they SMELL so good :) It's very important to use day and night age creams even if you are not older. Prevention is key to healthier younger looking skin! I would definitely recommend these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think L'Oreal Paris is a great product. I normally use Olay products and they work great for my skin bit once I started using L'oreal I noticed a visible difference.

Like a dummy I rubbed my eye after putting this on my face. I love the way it smells and the way it feels on my face. Not so much in my eye. So make sure you don't get it to close to your eye when putting it on your face. I still love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have never tried a product like this. I really love this line of products. The cream goes on smooth with no greasy feeling. My skin feels soft and fine lines look softer. The eye cream is great it lightens the under eye circles and I feel that my skin looks and feels a bit younger. I really like this line of products and recommend this to anyone.

"As a ""visual shopper"", I absolutely love the packaging for this product as it reminds me of an upscale product. The cream absorbs into my skin smoothly and quickly and leaves it feeling fresh and rejuvenated. The only downsize, in my opinion, is that it is not fragrance free. Overall I am happy with the cream so far and will continue to use it going forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started trying the L'Or√©al Paris age perfect cell renewed facial day cream. The cream smells nice, clean scent, is very thick and moisturizing. Packaging is that of a high end product, thick heavy jar. I have given it a four star because I haven't used it very long, has a very small amount of spf which I would have liked to have higher and I am not sure if it will break me out. Hasn't yet.

"I have been using these 3 products for 4 days and so far my skin is much softer and smoother. However, the dark circles under my eyes are still the same, which has been disappointing. I will continue to use these and see if it does in time help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is light but still moisturizing for dry skin like mine. The scent is very light and barely noticeable. I am very sensitive to fragrances so this was a great find! I have tried this for the first time today. Hoping to not have any breakouts or reactions to the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does make your face moisturized and smooth. But for me I found all throughout the day my face looked very shinny and oily. I was constantly blotting my face. So I have stopped using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"After only 3 days of using the Age Perfect Day Cream I can say that I can already tell that my skin is noticeably smoother. The cream smells good but is by no means overwhelmingly fragrant (which I appreciate) and does not leave skin greasy. It does, however, produce a nice glow. So far I'm quite impressed!

My experience with using this product was great. After using it my face felt refreshing and renewed. My face felt so clean and looked so smooth. My family even saw a difference in my look.

"I love the silky texture and scent of this day cream. I naturally have oily skin and found this gave me more of an oily feeling. However, I would rather deal with oily skin than dry. I have been complimented on my appearance as most people think I am younger than I really am. That's a good thing right? Overall, I am pleased with this product and will continue using it for the cell renewal benefit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that this product has a gel like texture that is not greasy. My face looked awake just seconds after use. Feels good and smells fresh. I do not wear make-up and this product is perfect for me because it looked liked I had put on a facial brightener or foundation. This day cream minimized the look of my wrinkles.

I love the day cream moisturizer which has sunscreen of 15. My skin feels refresh and renew which makes me happy and feeling young. I would want to know that the product really works as they say it does. I told my friends and family about it so they can try it out for themselves. Hope they try it for themselves. Hard to find a moisturizer that does everything. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the day cream for a couple days now and I am in love with this product! With winter drying out my skin this cream definitely works all day long no need to reapply multiple times throughout the day. Does not leave a greasy feeling and like the other 2 products it does exactly what it says it does. It does not have a smell to it like the night cream.

"I was a little nervous to try this day cream, as my skin is sensitive and I break out easily; however, I have not had any issues with this product. I particularly like that it has an SPF rating in it. I admit I'm not great at using sunscreen. You only have to use a little bit of the cream to cover your face and it doesn't have a strong scent which I like. My skin is nice and soft and looks nice and hydrated. Very nice product. If you are looking for a face cream, this is the product for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the day & night creams and have noticed a huge difference. My skin was starting to really show its age. It's a lot smoother and isn't dry and brittle looking. As a matter of fact my mother in law noticed and I told her about it. She loves L'Or√©al and is going to try it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
For all 3 of these products have a light feel to them! Not sticky nor do they feel heavy. They all have this light aroma to them but without the strong smell that my skin does not like. I have always had sensitive skin from head to toe. But so far (on day 2) my skin feels soft and elegant. So far I think this product might be on my permanent shopping list!

"The labeling on the container seems to promote it primarily as sunscreen. I enjoy having an extra layer of protection on my face as part of my morning routine. However for sun protection it recommends reapplication every 2 hours. As far as a moisturizer it works well. My skin felt softer after using it. There is a light fragrance that smells nice, but not my cup of tea. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The packaging is attractive & the jar of moisturizer is quite substantial ( 1.7oz!). The cream has a delicate scent to it. It reminds me of Honeysuckle. The cream glides on smoothly & is absorbed quickly. The gentle formulation didn't cause any irritation. I did experience a slightly tacky feel on my cheekbones after applying it. I like that it has an SPF15 in the formulation & that it claims to be non-comedogenic. The product claims to provide visible results in 1 week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First of all, this smells amazing. If I could wear this scent as a perfume, I would. Second, it gives your skin a nice glow. It was a little greasy. I am not used to using anything that doesn't absorb in completely and this did not. Over all, I like it and will continue using it. I like the sun protection as an added bonus!

I think that Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream by L'Oreal Paris is great because it feels so clean and fresh when you put it on. My skins feels so much better after only using it a couple of times. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product helped my skin not feel so dry and fatigued. I could feel a real difference after just one use. I do feel the product should be in a lotion type bottle so there is ni getting too much. It takes very little of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Tried this product for the past two days. It smells great and really hydrates my thirsty winter skin. So far the only thing so far that I am not really a fan of is the feeling that the cream hasn't been absorbed into my skin completely. That dewy feeling makes me feel like my makeup is going to slide right off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The scent of the cream is nice. Not too strong but it has a nice smell to it. I like to feel the cream that I just put on and this was the perfect amount of heaviness. I love that there is sunscreen Incorporated also! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Day Cream SPF 15 smells great and is rich and creamy and left my skin feeling soft. Even though I prefer a moisturizer with more benefits than just a SPF this is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is day one of using the Day Cream. Since winter has started my face has become very dry. After using the day cream just for the first time my face feels hydrated and my make up went smoothly on. There is no oily feeling it just feels refreshed and hydrated and this is just day one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just received the products from L'Or√©al today. This is the first day of using the product. So far I like how the product does not make my face feel oily.iwillpost a before picture and after using the products post an after picture. This will show the difference . I will post on the next item in the kit tomorrow once I try them [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ok , 2nd day of trying L'Oreal Day Cream , My Face is not Broke out & no Tingling , And that in itself is Wonderful . I am so Sensitive to many products , so Test spots when I received the product , My face feels like Silk . No Greasy after feel , Just a nice product . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"ok so this is day 2 of use, and today I put my make on with it and it did bring out my shine later on in the day, but other than that it think it held up better well. for it being day 2 I haven't seen anything change on my face but it did help hide my deep wrinkel's today. I like that it has an spf in it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have been using product for just two days and my skin is noticeably already smoother. I have a few dark dry spots on my face from sun damage and they even are smoother.... will keep going with product and check in later [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think I found a whole new line of products to fall in love with. Got my #bzzbox right before Christmas and its the best gift so far. Feel great on my skin. Not heavy either. I'm 33 and my skin feels so fresh and revived. Can't wait to try the whole line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best day cream i've ever tried it goes on so smooth and silky and is absorbed right into my skin it leaves no sticky feeling I was not expecting it to be so light weight on my skin usually when you get a SPF 15 it's very thick and sticky. Well, not so with L'Oreal I started noticing within 3 day my tiny crows feet started to diminish and my skin looks and feels so youthful & healthy. I also like the fact that a little bit goes a long way so this jar is gonna last me a longtime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I gave the Day Cream 3 stars because this isn't something that you can wear under make up. It has a slightly oily base as well as lightly pigmented. I was able to tell where I had put it on my face because of a slightly brown discoloration. The directions do not say not to apply it prior to or after applying makeup. After it was on for a while I tried to rub it in more and my skin began to slough so It would be good to use if your able to stay in for a while after applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to try the L'OREAL PARIS AGE PERFECT CELL RENEWALFACIAL DAY CREAM......loved the fact it has a SPF 15 as I wear sunscreen a lot.. it went on smooth... my face felt firmer and looked younger . it wasn't greasy ... as a lot of other products of this kind are . all N all it was a wonderful experience I would definitely buy this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have such sensitive skin and ive tried tons of different creams/ lotions to keep my face moisturized and most lead to red spots burning and drying out my face more than before but, not with this product it smells awesome and my face feels so soft no red marks no burning i absolutely love it im completely sold on all 3 day, night and under eye creams from loreal could not be happier!

"The first thing I noticed was the beautiful scent, even my 3 year old son said mommy you smell great! I learned that a little bit goes a very long way which I love because I'm all about getting the most for my money. I put the product on and really love the ease of application and how light it felt. My skin was left feeling hydrated and not oily at all. My skin looks bright and fresh. Over all I'm really excited and really recomendations this product to others.

"I just tried the loreal cell renewal day cream. Had a nice creamy texture and pleasant smell. However, it did feel kind of heavy on my face. If someone would need sunscreen I would suggest wearing a hat instead of this unless that was not an option. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this is my 1st day but I like the feeling and how it goes on and the feeling of it being on all day. it does give an oil feeling and I haven't seen any extra shin going on which is a huge plus for my face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Being that it is my first time using this product I don't have much to say about it just yet. My face feels very smooth! I normally have reactions to products because I have sensitive skin, but I don't have any burning or itching. I really like these products so far. I am very excited to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a very faint scent, which I like. It's very creamy and feels like some serious skin care. When I first put it on I thought ""uh oh, greasy"". Then after about five minutes my skin just sucked it up and it does not feel heavy or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best product I have found, hands down. My skin gets tight feeling, and just looked tired all the time. After useing this for only 2 months, my skin no longer is tight and uncomfortable, and people stop me all the time to tell me (I'm glowing). Love,lovw,love this product.

This the first product from l'oreal that's I've tried that's not makeup and I freakin love it! It makes my skin feel amazing and so hydrated! I honestly can't get enough of this day cream! I feel so refreshed after applying and it feels great! I am definitely happy I've recieved this in a beauty box and I plan on purchasing this product!
I received this small sample in my beauty box. I know being 33 I should start thinking about the future of my skin however my skin is very sensitive. I really have issues with creams like this as they can dry out my skin or cause pimples. I did not try this one to be honest. This one I passed along to my mother who will use it.
"I have been using this daily for the past two weeks. I find no matter how little of the product I have applied, my face appears oily and shiny. This is very moisturizing, but the oiliness actually makes me look older and emphasizes my wrinkles and dark circles. I haven't noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of wrinkles. I won't be purchasing this particular formula again."
"Loved the sample! Made my skin look younger, fresher, more hydrated. Viscosity was perfect and the fragrance level was just right. Glad to see it is offered with SPF. I would like to see the packaging changed to a tube or pump; I'm not a big fan of jars, but will definitely try a full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As soon as I applied the Cell Renewal Day Cream, I could feel my skin getting smoother. It was a nice light cream formula that was light to the touch but once applied you could feel it working. I will purchase this produce next time I go shopping! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
tried your day cream and thought it was just lovely. i found that even the next day my face was softer and smoother. my makeup went on so cleanly and smoothly. i like the product very much and will buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I only had a sample so it really didn't do anything. I think you need to use this a couple of weeks to notice. The sample I was sent was just a card with two days worth to try. If you really want people to review they should get a least 1 weeks worth to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really use L'Oreal ""everything""... From hair care, to face, to skin care... Lately, though, I have switched back to the Oil of Olay day and night moisturizers; the truth is I had coupons...! Whatever... I WILL go back to L'Oreal, and I would like to see if there is any kind of difference with this ""Cell Renewal"" option. Thanks again for great products & maintaining reasonable pricing without lessening quality. I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Blessed and Happy New Year!

Wow- Age Perfect Cell Renewal is amazing ! It really is different from any other day cream I have ever used . It didn't leave you feeling the least bit greasy and it didn't absorb my makeup like some day creams can. But the most amazing thing about this product is how it leaves your skin so soft and fresh looking and feeling . I felt my face looked firmer yet plumper. Plus SPF is wonderful in itself. I highly recommend this product and will be using myself. Love the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I enjoyed the silky smooth feel of the product once it was applied. I put it on one cheek only, to see if it did assist with fading the brown spots. It did not appear to make a difference using the product sample size. Overall it is a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I began using this product about 3 weeks ago, and could tell a difference almost immediately! My skin feels so much better, and make up goes on much easier because my skin is moisturized.

"This Product is AMAZING!!!! I am nearly 60 yrs old and I have had DRY skin all of my life. Right away, within 3 days, I started noticing a difference in the way my skin felt. My husband commented that I looked rested and I was glowing! (after 2 weeks of use). I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wish I could give this product zero stars. The other Age Perfect SPF 15 day cream blows this out of the water. Also, you are paying more to get way less product. This moisturizer leaves a gross film and irritated my skin within HOURS of use. The next day, I woke up with a few new pimples and I am not acne-prone at all. Stick to the original formula, everyone!"
This whole line of skin care products are the best I have used. I highly recommend them.

L'Or√©al Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream SPF 15 is a very effective moisturizer that penetrates the skin and leaves it soft and moisturized for hours and has a very pleasant fragrance.
I received this in my beauty box. I just can't do it!! The smell is too much for me. My skin is very sensitive to fragrances and I can't do it. I smell it so much when it's on my skin I had to wash my face. I just can't. #walmartcontest
I received this in my Walmart Beauty Box. It felt good going on. Within a couple of minutes my eyes were tearing up and stinging. I would NOT recommend this product. #WalmartContest
