"I've struggled for years to try and find a moisturizer for my face. I'm 55 years old, menopausal skin, and prone to breakouts. A new cleaning regime and I started using this product. My face feels amazing!! And it feels like that all day. I use it as a primer under my makeup and it really helps with foundation application. Please dont ever stop making this stuff...its like gold!"
67 Years old and love this moisturizer.... Have benn using it foralong time daily! Nothing better than this!
I been using this Renewing Collagen Elastin Moisturizer since my 20's... It always gives me a fresh feeling in the mornings. Now that I will be turning 60 this year... People still think I am in my 40's... I couldn't thank this product enough...
It really works I have impossible dry skin...It doesn't smell bad it just i don't like any smell at all so it is confusing a little bit but it goes away. It was my best friend last season (cold season) and it will be forever. This moisturizer is fantastic.
"I am going to get this! I always buy top dollar moisturizer from Ulta or Sephora, but on a recent trip I forgot to pack it. My sister offered me her moisturizer and I was skeptical due to the inexpensive brand. Needless to say I was wrong! Thanks baby sis! My skin looks n feels amazing."
Work for my face..I'm 44 y/o...I saw a recommend on Dr Oz program..I give a try..working perfect for me so far..plus a budget....
"This is seriously the best affordable moisturizer out there. I've been using it for years, and often get compliments on my skin. I have paid way more for others that are simply not as good and always end up coming back! This one is light, not greasy and it doesn't have heavy perfumes in it. It's also mild enough for my sensitive skin."
I tried 2 years ago and since that time 1 use it 3 days a week
"Throw away your expensive moisturizers!!! I've spent so much money on moisturizers, and nothing has compared to this! i love this. it doesn't leave a greasy texture to my face at all, and it keeps my face moisturized all day!! i apply this after my nightly routine, and in the morning whether i'm wearing makeup or going bare!"
I love this stuff. I got it because it was a cheaper face moisturizer but this stuff is awesome. I have not been able to use many lotions or skin care products because I have super sensitive skin and Im allergic to almost all of it. But this stuff I am not. And its so gentle on your skin. I feel so good after using it. My skin doesnt feel oily or gross after using it. It is just so awesome. I highly recommend it.
"love this product and have been using 35 years. I am getting up there now 76 and can still pass for 60 as is my husbands age. It truly is a timeless product, is non greasy and just gives your skin a visible smooth and healthy glow. My daughter is 52 and now can't live without it. All the stores in my zip listed have zero jars,Please Help!"
"I have already recommended this to so many of my friends, even my mom! and all of them have been so impressed. One of my friends who usually has to use dermatology approved creams can use this, and is so impressed! It lasts ages, and never fails to hydrate any type of skin."
I love this product. Its helped get my dry and flaky skin feel smooth and hydrated. Its a good price and the container is packed to the brim with cream so you know itll last for a long time! This cream is amazing. I refuse to go back to my old moisturizer after trying this one out.
I love this product !!!!it's good on my skin abd healthy benefits.makes feel Buetiful!!!!love the price on this stives timeless cream!!!
"This lotion is just awesome,my skin looks&feels great!It's not greasy or sticky&I use it as day&night on my body&as a night facial moisturizer(before going to bed)I don't use all that expensive lotion&creams.St. Ives is the best."
Twice a day all over my face and neck. Great product.
I am actually in love with this! Not only is it super affordable but it lasts a really long time. Its really helped my skin out during the harsh winter days.
"I have had a rough go with finding the right moisturizer over the past thirty years, I bought this product and have never looked back! My skin has cleared and the price is wonderful!"
Just wanted to say for those complaining about packaging I use a qtip dip it in jar and apply to my face. That one dip is enough to spreadall over and you won't be wasting product or spreading bacteria! Hope this helps
"This is exactly what I was looking for!! It's not greasy,light (for me personally at least),cheap,and perfectly moisturizes! And it helped with my acne so that's a plus"
"I have been using timeless for 5 years and love it. I bought renewing because I thought the packaging changed a little bit is the same stuff. It is not! They have less percentage of the 3 ingredients they brag about. The collagen, elastin and saeflower oil. The ingredients listed on the back are almost the same but these 3 are lower on the list, with alcohol being higher up. I am truly bummed by the change and will no longer use it"
"I have used st ives timeless skin for 10 years now. This was the only moisturizer that prevented my dry skin from drying out in the harsh Michigan winter. Unfortunately I bought the new version of it 'renewing' recently. This moisturizer would be alright for summer, but does not keep my skin moisturized in winter. Please bring back the old formula."
"So every moisturizer I have used has either made me breakout or it wasn't hydrating enough. This moisturizer is AMAZING! It's light enough and doesn't make my skin feel greasy and it's extremely hydrating. It's great for layering under makeup too, it won't pill up."
I really really really enjoyed this moisturizer!!! It was the first moisturizer I had ever used (always been a drug store skin care gal) that really seemed to sink into my skin and have a lasting effect! The only reason I stopped using it is because I had heard online that St. Ives ingredients aren't that great for your skin. Very good starting point though!
"I've been trying to find a moisturizer that would really hydrate my skin since I accidentally over exfoliated my skin using Neutrogena. I've been using this moisturizer for about a week and let's just say my dry skin is so much more hydrated! It's not even dry anymore! I use this product every night and a moisturizer with SPF 15 in the morning. It would've been nice if this moisturizer had SPF (sunscreen). This feel extremely nice on the skin. Even if you have oily skin, I really recommend this product."
"I've been using the Collagen Elastin Moisturiser for 4 years now, and it is a permanent staple in my beauty routine. It leaves my skin feeling tight, moisturised and baby smooth. I can even see the difference in my complexion through old photographs! It looks the best when I've been using this particular moisturiser everyday! Even my friends and family comment on my clear skin and I owe it all to St. Ives!"
"Your products are all very amazing and I will never stop buying them. But I have noticed that I'm allergic to perfumed products, me and many others. So if you please consider products without perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So tired of people saying this formula has been ruined. It is literally the same thing. Love it.
Very nice on my sensitive skin. great moisturizer.
I've tried so many different types of facial moisturizers for my sensitive combination skin and it always caused an inflammation. Once I found out that St. Ives also made a moisturizer I gave it a shot since their apricot acne scrub hasn't given me any issues. Thank goodness that this stuff works! My skin has never felt more nourished than it does now and I haven't had any redness since using this cream
"I have been using St Ives moisturizer for years! Stupidly, I recently decided to try different moisturizers specifically for acne and they broke me out really bad! It doesn't get rid of acne, of course, but it definitely does not add to it like everything else I've tried. Not for this price and quantity! I think this lasts like 6 months, for real. It's absolutely amazing. Thank you, St. Ives!"
I use the moisturizer everyday. At almost 67 years old
I feel it keeps me looking younger and makes my skin feel great!
I like the texture and I seem to see more firmness and smaller pore size. I have very dry skin so I have to layer a heavier cream to get enough moisture but I like the results so far.
This has helped my dry skin and evened out my skin tone. I use it before bed and in the morning. It helps clear up my acne when I get flare ups.
If you compare the ingredients to the one that had the purple on the tub they are in a different order now. The better ingredients have been moved to the bottom which means there are less of them. Just not as good as the old stuff…
PLEASE DO NOT KEEP FIXING WHAT IS NOT BROKEN! WHY DID YOU DO THIS? I USED TO USE THIS YEARS AGO BOUGHT IT AGAIN TO ONLY BE DISAPPOINTED YOU CHANGED IT!
"This product is a great moisturizer for dry skin. I used it daily, in the morning and also at night. I've been using this moisturizer for about 6 months now and My face looks radiant and healthy. I would highly recommend this product."
"I thought the price was wrong when I found this moisturizer, you get so much for how affordable it is. Not to mention it is so smooth and just a great basic moisturizer. And it smells great!"
The old formula was awesome. I searched high and low unit I realized it had changed. The new formula isn't as hydrating and doesn't feel or smell as nice. Unfortunately I will be looking for a new face cream
"I love this! It leaves my face feeling amazing. It's not heavy, doesn't clog my pores, leave it greasy and that nasty feeling most moisturizers do. I skin has never looked better!! Hello to a healthier me! :)"
Please go back to the old formula. This new product is so disapoiting. Your loyal users would rather pay more to get the old product back. The new product contains ingredients that can be considered toxic. The collagen and Elastin are not on the bottom because of the small amount it now contains. I am actively looking for another brand.
Mantains your skin feeling and looking fresh and young. This cream has one of the most important components in life collagen. We will always need it and this cream will always provide it. Nice texture and affordable cream. Highly recommend
"The cream is not moisture, it makes my skin became more dry & breakout. Not recommended unless you have a very oily skin then it shall be neutral. I read many comments saying that previous formula is much better, why don't you consider to continue with previous formula?"
"Great great moisturizer! It is probably the easiest to apply and spread compared to anything else I've tried and it is so light and fresh feeling you'll want to use it everyday, which you can because it doesn't seem to have any chemicals that hurt the skin longterm. Works great for healing sun burns as well!"
"This moisturizer is the perfect light, gentle moisturizer! It's my favorite for daily use. It comes in a big tub too so it lasts forever—great value for the price. It's so gentle I can use it under my eyes too! You can layer it, use it at night or in the morning under makeup, wonderful product! Will definitely repurchase."
I use this every single day! It keeps my makeup in place and keeps my face hydrated all day long. I do use it morning and night and I think my skin has honestly began to look tighter as well. It's been about 3 months. AND it will last a LONG time. Theres so much product it's unreal.
This product makes my skin glow. I have been using it for a month and it freshens up my skin and makes it feel alive. A little goes a long way and the price is perfect. Its gentle and seeps into my skin and keeps it hydrated. The price is perfect and you get a lot of product.
"St Ives has always been a favorite skin care line for me. I love this moisturizer so much! It leaves my skin very soft and supple and I love the natural smell. It's thick but not greasy. I use it at night and wash my face in the morning. The size is generous and it's very affordable, which is a huge plus!"
"I love St Ives products. This moisturizer is now my favorite product in the line. It works better than products I've purchased for 5 times the price. I never write these reviews, but was really inspired to after using it for just a few days. Now after a few months, it's great stuff! Also it lasts forever☺"
"I'm in my 20s and since getting older, I noticed my skin doesn't revert back from acne as well anymore. I was searching and searching for a product to get rid of red acne marks and this product worked amazing! In less than a week, I can see my red acne marks lightening."
This cream is so fresh smelling and light but moisturizing. I use it to cleanse my face as well as for moisturizing. It is great because it does not strip my skin of its natural oils when used as a cleanser. And as a moisturizer it is perfect because it's light enough to not leave me oily but has the perfect amount of moisture for my face. I love it and have loved it for years....I am a big fan of stuff in tubs too.
"I started using this about a year ago. Really loved it, left no oiliness, no residue, never irritated my skin, felt great any time of year (any temperature). Then I got pregnant and everyone started saying I needed belly butter, oils, etc. I tried oils for a short time. Got a rash, felt itchy all the time. I switched back to my Renewing lotion and everything has been awesome. I have no stretch marks, my skin feels great and the smell hasn't offended my pregnant senses once. I love this stuff!"
I hate the new formula. I want the original timeless back.
I love this product. It really agrees with my aging skin.
I have tried several different brands but this remains a favorite. It works great and isn't ridiculously overpriced.
My favorite moisturizer! So cheap and lasts forever. I definitely notice a change in my skin. I use it both morning and night.
This moisturizer is definitely fantastic! I put it on right after I get out of the shower and I always get tons of compliments on my skin!
Smells great and feels great on the skin. Very affordable and you get more than what you paid for. Leaves my skin feeling nice and moisturized. One downside however is that it doesnt keep my face moisturized for long periods of time and I end up having to reapply every few hours.
"I had high hopes for this moisturizer because it had such good reviews, and it was a good price for such a big bottle, but it just wasn't for me. This is not a good product to use if you have oily or combination skin like I do. My face just looked super greasy after I used it, and my face still felt dry a few minutes after using it."
Very smooth on the skin. Hydrates and rich in textures. Leaves a great smell. Works on all skin types
My skin is very sensitive so I do not use it all the time because it can make my face break out. On occasions when my skin is dry I love to use this face moisturizer right before bed even when my skin is peeling as well.
"In love with this little bottle. It's the best moisturizing cream out there. Helps you eliminate fine lines, great for under makeup. It leaves your skin looking glowing and healthy!"
"I love this facial cream! It absorbs into the skin very quickly. It does not leave my skin feeling oily at all, and it does a good job of moisturizing my skin! I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will probably repurchase!"
"This product lasts so long and is very reasonably priced, my skin never breaks out when i use it and my skin always feels perfectly hydrated after using it. The packing is cute and simple and perfect for storage!"
Im in love! Smells so fresh and leaves my skin velvety soft! Ive been using St. Ives products since I was a teen Im now in my 30s and still love them!!!
"This feels great on my face. My face was so dry and wrinkled. It really plumped my skin like the product statement. It's very light weight.. Smells great with a light scent, that I s not overpowering and good for my sensitive skin. This product is adorable."
"I LOVE this moisturizer!! First of all, it smells so amazing and fresh. It leaves my skin supple and moisturized! I wake up in the morning with all of my redness gone and glowing skin! Plus this comes in a large tub that will last you months! The only downside is I wish it came in a pump, it would be more hygienic!"
"I've been trying a lot of skin products that will work on my skin. It's been more than a year since i used this product and find it suited/working on my skin. It's not greasy and lightweight that's makes me feel comfortable every time i use it. I am very happy with this product as it doesn't clogged my pores and works well with my face wash and toner. It keeps my skin hydrated, soft and healthy and glowing. I so love it."
"i used it on my face and it just absorbs right in. it doesn't feel heavy or sticky, and it works very well on my combination skin (dry cheeks, oilier tzone). plus i live in a humid climate and it's not heavy at all even though it is a cream. best cream ever!"
"I love St Ives' moisturizer and face scrub so much! This is a light lotion, I have repurchased it since my last one is gone. This is a big jar of lotion with a very affordable price!! I love how it absorbs into my skin in short time, leaving my skin moisturized and not feeling greasy. I use it day and night, and I never experienced any breakouts. I have normal skin, and I apply 2 thin layers and massage them into my skin. St. Ives, keep it up!! And thank you for the great products that you make!"
"I love this product I been using the same jar for a couple of years now because I only use it for my face at night but a little goes a long way, I love how it helps diminish my laugh lines, but I'm really upset Timeless Face scrub is off the market!!!! Why??? That was a great product as well it tightened my skin and made my face very smooth. Please please please bring that product back and take one the apricots scrubs away we don't need two of that lol. Thank you."
This is a lovely product at a reasonable price. For me this product has worked as well and better than other higher priced products that do the same thing. But my main reason for loving this product is there is NO sunscreen! In this sun paranoid world I am very thankful for a product without it. Thank you St. Ives
I have acne prone and combination and I havent had any major breakouts what so ever! It had leave my skin really soft when i wake up in the morning. One thing is that it does look oily after applying it. My skin is usually like that with or without moisturizer after cleansing. Ive had acne in my teenage years and This helped me clear up my acne :)
have been using this for over 25 years - back when it was in a 16 oz pink jar! always keeps my skin hydrated and dewy and i will keep using it as long as they keep making it! everyone thinks i am a lot younger than i look and this is DEFINITELY one of my beauty 'secrets'. i get a lot of free facial samples from high-end companies and nothing compares to this miracle in a jar!!
"I am a 58 year old woman with a 28 year old neck. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer that does not break out my neck or my face. I would highly recommend this to everyone. It absorbs quickly, smells great and really keeps your skin moist all day."
"Ladies I am 52 and have been searching out a all over body lotion that is not too think and makes my skin feel amazing, I gave these out as Christmas gifts also and everyone I gave them to asked where got it, as you see I purchase the 3 packs, You have to try this you won't believe the difference in you skin."
I was excited to try this as I never use anything on my face but water even in the shower. I did not need much & it adsorb quickly. The only thing I did not like that made me hesitant on trying was when I got it home & opened the lid there was no protective cover of any sort just the lid itself. Now I found this strange & thought anyone could have tried it or could have tampered with it & I would never have known.
"I was looking for a moisturizer since one morning I realized I had flaky and patchy skin under my foundation. I was terrified so, I bought this moisturizer within 1 use I seen a whole lot of difference the next day my flaky skin was almost completely gone."
"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. At 61 I love your product. PLEASE DO NOT, DO NOT add sun screen. People who request it can buy some sun screen and put a coat of that over their moisturizer... I love this as a day and night cream....thank you for keeping the price low."
"I am a 30 year old female and have been using this facial moisturizer since I was 15 (my mom used it). It is the best facial moisturizer I have ever tried. It is light weight, non-greasy, and you don't need a whole lot to cover your entire face/neck. I'm not sure if it's the cream, or genetics, but although I'm almost 30, people tell me all the time I look like I'm 18."
"This facial moisturizer is absolutely the best moisturizer I have ever used! It leaves my skin soft and smooth with a natural glow. It has a pleasant scent and it is very affordable especially since it can be used as a day cream and a night cream. That's why I'm so glad there is no sunscreen in this product!! It is perfect just the way it is and that is why so many customers continue to use it just like I have for the past fourteen years."""
"I cannot say enough positive things about this exceptional cream. I have used many expensive brands that cannot compete with this product. This is inexpensive and very effective. With my department store products I could not get rid of dry skin, but this did it. It is not greasy and unlike my expensive products it actually is soothing and does not promote the redness I was having trouble with. One more thing, it is a great makeup primer and will not make your makeup slide off."
I'm a senior (72) female and have always had oily skin. As I've aged it has dried somewhat. I've never used any product on my face other than a medicated cleanser. About 3 years ago I decided to try St. Ives and found that it really works well. I don't know if it's the collagen but I have very few wrinkles and even the bags under my eyes have seemed to decrease. This is a great product at a bargain price.
"I'm 24 yrs old with oily/acne prone skin and this stuff is amazing! Since it moisturizes my face so good, it's not producing as much oil so my acne has calmed down a lot. And the collagen is a bonus! It's never too early to start using anti aging creams. I love that you get so much product for such a great price! I've told my whole family about it. I won't be buying expensive moisturizers anymore!"
I decided to try this moisturizer a few days ago. I didn't have high expectations because every mositurizer I have ever used caused acne. After the first night I was very impressed. My face WAS NOT broken out and it felt smooth and silky. Great Product! Please do not change it.
"I bought this product 2 years ago in the 12 oz size, and it has lasted me this long. I've tried other fancier or more expensive night creams during this time, thinking that would be better, but I always come back to this. Now I have to find it in the store again since I think they changed the packaging look. Super cheap, makes my skin feel like it did when I was 20. Agree with another reviewer, the only thing that would make this better is SPF. So I only use at night and after bathing."
"I'm so in love with this stuff! I'm getting into my late 20's and though it's a good idea to watch out for my skin early to prevent as well, also attempt to reduce my obvious expression lines where I smile. In just 3 days I have noticed an obvious difference. I have that youthful glow I'm suppose to have at this age. This stuff brought it back as well as minimized my smile lines and all without clogged pores or pimples! So happy, thank you St. Ives!"
"I have been using this since I was 18 years old. I am 25 now and everyone says I still look like a teen. No one can guess my age! I am a firm believer in prevention. As soon as you turn 18, you need to start using anti aging products on your face, neck, & decolatage! Because it's not about reversing aging (because you kinda can't)....its all about prevention! This stuff is truly a well kept secret. And by the way, my skin is very acne prone, but this works for me!"
"I have used this product for a long time, 10 years? I am 52 and fair skinned. I have recommended and purchased this product for friends and they love it too! I have virtually no wrinkles, lines or crows feets. Just beatiful radient skin! Thank you St Ives!"
"I have strugling before to find a product that will suit my skin type. I have dry sensitive skin and always having a problem with my flaky skin especially in the face, Im in my early 20's so I really need to moisturize my skin a lot. Then I discover this amazing product that blows my worries away and leaves me happy and contented as well as leaves my skin hydrated and fresh. It gives me glow and healthy skin that everyone is wishing for. And it keeps me on the go."
"The amount you receive is amazing! You get so much product for such a small amount of money. The scent of the product is so fresh. It wasn't overwhelming and my skin hasn't had any reactions from the fragrance (which may be natural). The days that I use the moisturizer, I don't experience any excess oil. The only thing I don't care for is the container. I didn't have a beauty spatula, so I had to use my hands which could cause bacteria growth inside the tub."
"I have been using this forever. Occasionally, I mistakenly buy a pricey cream, but they never work as well as this! Recently, I started using it on my neck and chest as well, and after one jar there is a remarkable difference! I told all my friends, and they love it too."
"This is such a pleasant facial moisturizer. I love the earthy smell, and the silky texture. It makes my face a bit dewy looking, which is fine. I didn't buy it for the anti-aging properties, but my skin does look younger. This product, and the Green tea scrub, have made a very noticeable difference on my skin. I don't know when I bought this, but I've had it for a pretty long time. This stuff goes a very long way. I will be buying this as long as I can, I hope it never changes."
"Light, smooth, non-greasy. At age 58, my skin looks much younger, and I particularly notice that my neck looks much firmer. I put a dab of foundation on my palm, and a dab of St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer, and mix to create a tinted moisturizer....no need to blend around the edges of my face or jaw, no settling into fine lines. Just perfect, creamy skin. I love this product."
I believe this is the best cream on the market! I have spent lots of money over the years to find the perfect facial cream and found there was none other than St. Ives. Please do not ever change a thing about it. I have been using it for over 20 years and will never stop buying it.
"first moisturizer I found I can put on and not be a grease ball by the end of the day, or when I wake up in the morning. I love it, it makes your skin feel soft and smooth and hydrated. I love that I can put it on under make up too and it doesn't leave any heavy greasy feeling. GREAT PRICE!"
"I was using Mirta for collagen and elastin - the price jump has me looking for a comparable product. So far, I have had no problem using this cream although the oil ingredient did concern me as oils tend to make my face break out in little bumps ( a common thing). Thank you for a good product BUT everyone is correct in wondering why there is no protective film for the product. Please consider a seal of some sort. I'd be willing to pay a bit more for the product assurance."
"I have used the Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer for many years and have never found anything else I like as much. It has just the right consistency. My skin feels clean and clear, but soft and glowing. It has kept me looking 10 years younger. I love this product!!"
I have tried soooooooo many different moisturizers (from cheap to very expensive) and I started using this about a week ago and really like it! My skin feels tighter and much smoother. I use this with the Apricot Scrub and I also use the Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask every few days. I have definitely noticed that my pores are smaller. I think I have finally found some products that I will keep using!
"I've used several different moisturizers over the years, but have always come back to St. Ives. It is now my only moisturizer and I love it. It's creamy, smooth, absorbs into the skin quickly, and isn't greasy. I use it morning and night and it leaves my skin soft, helps minimize the fine lines and gives it a nice glow. Don't waste your money on the expensive brands, this moisturizer will give you the same results for a lot less. A jar lasts me about 4 months, no other brand can do that!"
"Just started using this and i love it so much that i want to marry it! So much different from what i used to use because i have oily skin and they usually made my face even more oily. And this doesnt! Would be a plus point if there's spf included. Also, worth every cents i paid for for such a huge tub!"
Amazing moisturizer . leaves the skin nice and soft and moist without the greasiness or tackyness of other products ive used! Will re purchase ! Especially for the 4 bucks I paid for it this creates soft glowing skin and a flawless base before makeup application
"I absolutely love this formula! It leaves my skin soft, without grease, and absolute radiant. I can visibly see the difference and I love it. The smell is beautiful and I would hope this product won't be discontinued. It's amazing and refreshing and I'll be very unhappy if it is ever taken off the market."
"Love this moisturizer. Have used it for about a month now and my skin feels so smooth and soft. My skin was starting to look ""thin"", but now it looks firmer and healthier. The weather has been hot and I was afraid it would make my skin oily, but it didn't at all. One suggestion: If it had UV protection I would have given it an Excellant Rating insead of Good. Love your products!!!"
"after spending so much money on skin products,finally i found this woderfull cream.....after a tiering day at work, exposure to sun ,pollution, and 2 hours in gym,just wash face and apply this cream as a thick layer is all what i have to do now for my skin care.......when i wake up,i have softer and glowing ,healthy ,brighter skin:) thank you guys"
"I bought my first Collagen Elastin online prompted by high recommendations, price and quantity. I am very fussy about facial beauty products and I usually favour ROC but I also love a bargain. I was delighted with the product. There is so much of it and it costs less than many of the better brands smaller versions. It feels light, soft and comfortable on, smoothes lines and plumps up skin beautifully. It also has a lovely subtle fragrance."
"I'm a 43 year old guy with oily skin who tans easily. I find this product to be awesome for 1) a nighttime moisturizer after I use an oil-cutting astringent, and 2) a hydrating treatment for my face after tanning. Either way, my skin feels great afterwards... soft without feeling greasy and firmer with minimized crows feet and sun stress."
This product is perfect and wonderful just the way it is. The thought of sunscreen being added to it makes me cringe ! sunscreen is an irritant to those of us with sensitive skin and it simply does not belong in this product . I like to use this cream not only in the morning but always at night too and I'm certainly not going to bed with sunscreen on my face (how stupid) . So many people love this product and have given it a five star rating and they have stated that they don't want sunscreen added either. Please leave it alone.
St Ives is full of timeless products and this moisterizer is no exception. It has a very silky texture that absorbs into skin fast without feeling greasy or leaving behind residue. I keep mine in the frig for an added cooling sensation. This miosterizer leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated without adding extra oils. I am oily with acne prone skin and I haven't seen a problem with it clogging my pores. And let's not forget how affordable it is! As with all St Ives products I feel like I get more for my dollar.
"I have been using this cream for years and hope it never goes off the market! I love it so much and the price is affordable for me. It's non-greasy and feels so pure on the skin and it does wonders for my skin tone and look! Keep it on the shelves forever, please!"
"I have been using this product for at least 5 years and I love it, but I am also having trouble finding it on the shelves. I don't know if it just sells that fast or the stores don't stock enough of this product. Whenever I do find it, I will buy at least 3 containers so I can be sure to have enough until I find it again. It is so easy and the price is right. It works so much better than the really expensive facial moisturizers. Thanks, please keep producing it!"
"I have tried soo many moisturizers for my face because I have oily acne prone skin and all the ones I have tried seemed to just irritate my skin more or make me look greasy. Although I don't have any wrinkles yet, I adore this product! It leaves my skin hydrated and extemely smooth and soft, without making me feel greasy. And I think it makes my makeup look even better on my skin and helps it stay on longer. It's by far the best facial moisturizer I have ever used and I doubt I will ever switch again :)"
"I've been using the Timeless skin formula for years, it was my favorite. I'm disappointed in the reformulated version. I appreciate that it doesn't have sunscreen as I am terribly allergic to traditional sunscreen and have to use zinc only. Consider bringing the previous formula back, I don't want to find a replacement. :("
"I love this product! Great price and you get a lot! I have combo skin. I tend to break out on my chin and sometimes my forehead, but still need moisturizer or I would really dry out. I learned that a thin layer is best and give it 5 minutes to soak in and dry on skin. I then use a primer, Clinique Super Primer, and then my foundation. Primer really helps my foundation to go on smoothly. The moisturizer has not caused any more acne and my skin feels great! It is not sticky either. I use it on my arms and hands too!"
"I love everything about this product, the fresh scent and the light consistency. I have no problems with the container, St. Ives please dont change the formula of this product and the packaging This product is amazing and it lasts forever. Its so amazing that Dr. Oz raved about it on his show <3"
I have very oily skin especially around my period time but this product doesn't make me more oily. I use it every night & when I wake up my skin looks soft & glowy not as if I slept in a pillow covered in oil lol. I love how this smells & I think it'll last me a looooong time bc there's a lot in the jar & I only dab my finger in it. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a protective seal thing so anyone at the store can use it & put it back on the shelf /:
"It is hard to find products without sunscreen so this product is wonderful. I don't understand the sunscreen fad and don't want it on my skin. I've heard that many people don't have enough vitamin D because they wear so much sun screen. St. Ives, don't give in to the fad. My skin feels great and I seem to have fewer wrinkles with your product so don't change a thing."
I just started using this not long ago and I already love it! It leaves my face touchingly soft and personally I like the scent. Although I am a little bit confused about the packaging. I mostly see the jar version of this product but just not long ago I found the packaging in the squeeze tubes that are the usual cleanser tubes. I'm assuming the only reason is because I was looking at two different stores in two different countries.
"I love it! This moisturizer is light, absorbs quickly, and smells earthy. I prefer a thicker cream at night, but for daytime this is amazing. It absorbs so fast and no greasy finish! It leaves my skin soft and bright with not a sign of irritation to my senstive skin. Plus, the fact that the ingredients are natural makes me love to use St. Ives."
"I have been using this for a couple days. My skin is very soft and not greasy. I can't say yet if it is a miracle cream, but I really like the way my skin feels now. And for the price, I may start using this as my all over body cream!! My hands feel great too, I just rubbed the excess into my hands."
I've been using this product for the past 27 years everyday. I am now 50 years old but I always come across people commenting that I look 28!! I give full credit to St.Ives collagen-Elastin facial moisturizer for keeping my skin soft and for restoring the natural glow. Thank you St.Ives!
"I love this moisturizer! I have been using it for well over twenty years. I am 63 years old. My skin is soft, no wrinkles and people say that I look much younger. Its like whip cream. I love it. When the store is out of it I get very angry! It is the best and very affordable too."
"I have been using St. Ives - Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer for many, many years, and I am 72 years old now. I have never found a better product for the facial skin than this; of course, I haven't looked elsewhere for probably 10 years. I haven't needed to because I am constantly being told I don't look my age. That is always nice to hear since I've never had any ""work"" done. When I look in the mirror, I see a 72 year-old-woman, but she does look very good for her age."
"I LOVE this product, I have used it for 20 years daily and I have old high school friends that say I look the same as I did in high school lol, its great. Im about to run out but this jar lasts a long time (at least 6 months) and now Im having a hard time finding it in stores, really sad :( when I do find it though, Im buying more than 1."
This moisturizer is great. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth with out feeling heavy and greasy. I just started using it two days ago and notice a difference right away. I would have to say that the only down side to it is it doesn't have spf in it but not that big of a deal. And the price is great compared to a lot of other moisturizers out there. Thanks for making such a great product.
"I absolutely LOVE this cream!! The texture is so creamy & smooth, goes on excellent, smells wonderful, and love the feel of my skin afterwards. I'm 52 and my skin looks 32!! I use this daily, and I always get questions on how I keep my skin so vibrant and smooth! I tell everyone that THIS is the stuff to use. Forget the pricey junk, try this instead!"
"I have very sensitive skin, and after trying many other (much more expensive) moisturizers, I've found that I love this one the most. It is so affordable as well. Please don't add sunscreen, for those of us with sensitive skin that just adds an extra irritant, I prefer to moisturize and then add sunscreen on top! I live in super dry Idaho and constantly struggle with dry, flaking skin as well, this stuff works great! Thank you St. Ives!"
I have combination/oily skin and LOVE that this moisturizer is very light on my face while leaving it tight and hydrated. It's not thick/ heavy and my makeup looks great over it. I've been using this since I was in college and I'm 24 years old now. I always get compliments on my skin. I love this product!!
"My skin gets very dry during the winter and I hate using moisturizers that make my face feel greasy. I found this product by chance while looking for the hypo-allergenic oil free moisturizer that I used to have, also from St. Ives. First of all, the tub is huge and second of all, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the price! I figured I'd give it a try and boy was I surprised! The skin on my face immediately stopped flaking and has not felt this great in forever! Thanks for such a great moisturizer!"
"I have used St Ives since in my twenties and my 2 children who are in their mid twenties haven't used anything but St Ives and we love it. Occasionally we have tried other products for a change and always go back to St Ives products. I love the Moisturizer because it doesn't feel heavy, greasy and it is fragrance free."
"I am 30 years old. I decided it's time to find a moisturizer. After so much research and unsure of what brand I should buy, I decided on this one. It's not to thick or thin. The smell is great. My face doesn't get all sweaty or oily looking. I do have combination skin. I love this. I even use it as a body lotion sometimes. Lol!"
"This product is awesome and does work BUT the strong fragrance makes my skin SO itchy. It doesn't look irritated by any means, but it burns and stings. I swear by St. Ives products, they're all I use (green tea scrub, oatmeal mask, pand the pink lemon scrub which occasionally bothers my skin but is worth it). I wish you guys would stop putting so much fragrance in your products because they would work perfectly fine without it! I would recommend this product to someone with normal skin for sure!"
"This really is a great facial moisturizer. It blends into the skin quickly without ever feeling greasy. In fact, after a few minutes after application, I can't even feel it on my skin. I also apply it around my eyes and it never irritates my eyes even if it gets in them. I have been using this for more than a year and plan to continue using it as long as it's available for purchase. I love this product."
I truly love this product and use it everyday. It makes your skin so smooth and supple without having an oily feeling. I don't just use it on my face. I use it on my entire body. My skin is so soft. My guy is always telling me what soft skin I have. I have been using it for 3 years now. I even got my granddaughters to start using it. You're never to young to start moisturizing. Try a jar. You won't be disappointed.
As I was getting older started to see these fine lines mostly below my mouth area. I freaked out nooooo! I bought many of products and nothing worked or made it worse. I finally did my research and found St. Eve's timeless and gave it a try. It worked those fine lines disappeared. I been now using this product for over 5 years. I'm 54 thank god I was blessed with good genes but can easily pass for 40 with help from Ives.
I absolutely love this face lotion. I have fairly sensitive skin and also oily skin. This is usually a tough combination to find lotion for but this lotion is amazing. It tightens my skin and doesn't leave me feeling greasy or break me out. Its also a very reasonable price.
"I have extremely dry skin and this moisturizer lasts all day! Most are gone by mid morning and I've tried a ton of lotions and creams over the years! This is the real deal and it smells amazing. Don't waste money on expensive overrated products, it doesn't get any better than this!"
"St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer is just the best for all age groups.What held me back for years is that i thought a product so reasonably priced jut couldn't be good. I was so wrong! This is very good, also, as the 1st step prior to make-up application. The astounding thing is-it works AND it is so affordable. You get a lot of bang for your buck! The only problem for me is trying to find it."
"I am 54 years old and I have no wrinkles, people always complement my skin. I have been using the Collagen Elastin facial moisturizer since my twenties. We went on vacation with my sister and brother in law last year and we where sharing a bathroom they used my mointurizer and they are hooked. I have to confess my husband has been using it for years and his skin looks better than his younger sister's."
"I was quite skeptical as to St. Ives timeless moisturizer being one of many creams sitting on my dressing top but it`s becoming my all time favorite. This huge tub contains moisturizer that would last a life time for a very reasonable price. I am not a big fan of the fragrance but I love the light texture. It doesn't feel greasy, great for mixing with foundations resulting in a dewy finish. Oh and its working wonders for my medium acne prone skin, with or without makeup !"
I've been using this moisturizer probably for almost 40 years. My youngest son is 22 and oldest is 36 and I still get compliments on my skin. I was recently told that I look too young to have a 22 year old! HA! I'm 59 and can pass for 40. THANK YOU ST. IVES! I don't think I could have done it without you.
"This is the best product i ever had ! I just have to post a review on it that im grateful St. Ives have such a wonderful moisturizer. I had dry skin and fine lines, dull face. This really brightens and firm up my face. Notice less fine lines and it gives me glowly skin without being oily which i love it !! Im so gonna stick to this moisturizer. I hope St. Ives doesn't make any changes on this, please just stay as it is and supply more stock in singapore !! <3"
"I am 65 years old - have lived with dry facial skin for so long and have tried so many moisturizers. I refuse to buy the expensive department store creams, believing inexpensive products can be just as effective as ridiculously high-priced ones if you can find one you are happy with. Since I tried this St. Ives product I have never strayed from it - light, freshly scented, lasts a long time and my skin looks and, more importantly, FEELS great all day. I use it as a day and night moisturizer - need nothing else."
"I've been using this for a while now and my skin feels and looks great. I highly recommend this product! I use the timeless skin scrub as a cleanser, and I am so disappointed that you guys have discontinued that product because it is one of the few products a use on my face that doesn't make me breakout."
"I have oily skin (always have, probably always will). This is the only moisturizer that keeps dry patches away, absorbs into my skin quickly, and doesn't cause me to breakout. I usually put it on under my makeup during the day in the winter time, and then I use it only at night in the summer. There is no point wasting your money on expensive,greasy, overly perfumed moisturizers when this stuff works great. I'm in my 20's, and I can even see a difference in my skin. You have to try it!"
"I just can't describe how much I love this moisturizer. For me, I have sensitive acne-prone skin and this has not broken me out once, which is absolutely amazing. It's soft, and it gives my skin a glow that makes it look like I just had a $100 facial. I am a little disappointed that I have run out and can't seem to find it anywhere!"
"My daily moisturizer! I use it morning and night and my face is much softer. Also, a little goes a long way! I originally bought this 3 months ago and I am just now only halfway through the container. Added bonus: Paraben-free! Very affordable and I will be buying this again!"
I had to try this moisturizer after seeing how many great reviews it had. I've only been using it for about a week and my skin is already starting to look clearer after getting a few breakouts. It feels a bit oily when you first apply it but give it a minute and it absorbs right into the skin. Perfect for before applying makeup. It's also amazing that it comes with way more product than other moisturizers and is still inexpensive. Absolutely love this.
"I first bought it because I wanted to give myself a break from department store priced moisturizers, and I ended up loving it more that anything I have ever used! Hope they never stop making this, feels great on my face, never oily. Fixed my unbalanced face that used to be both oily In the T zone and very dry in other spots. It is also very important to me that the product has safe ingredients and no parabens. I look forward to washing my face just to put this on."
"This product lives up to its promise. It really does reduce wrinkles, and it is also economical. Plus, I am not allergic to it, as I am to all the other face products I have tried. I just wish St. Ives would bring back their excellent shampoo and conditioner."
"I live here in Kenya, I started using this product early this year 2014. Its the best product for my face. the skin is well moisturised, especially for this dry season here. above all my skin is smooth and soft.it is now my staple product. however, here we do have counterfeit of the same but I hope this could be addressed in time."
"I use this product as a moisturizer in my daily routine day and night. I love the feel of it, it's not too thick and not oily at all. It smells wonderful and you get a lot for the price and I only use a few dabs for each use. I will continue to use this product on a daily basis!"
"I love these products. I use this lotion on my face as well. It has a nice scent and does wonders for my dry skin. I is it everyday after I wash my face morning and night. It is very gentle, I have sensitive skin and I have no reaction to this lotion. I would recommend in a heartbeat"
I struggled for years to find a good moisturizer that would actually moisturize my skin without making me break out. Almost every moisturizer would either break me out really bad or it wouldn't do anything for my dry skin. This one is perfect! Plus it's huge so I'm never gonna run out of it lol
"Well let me start with I never ever give reviews for whatever reason. However, I had to respond on this miracle product. I love love love this moisturizer. Amazing results in just a couple of weeks!!! I have been getting compliments like crazy. Please please please keep this moisturizer on the market and Thank You!!!"
"I am so happy to see other reviewers also love the scent. It's so fresh, clean, and gentle. Please don't change it! I have used this product for years, and my skin feels so soft, not greasy, and I have accumulated very few lines over time. I will always buy it! Love!!"
"I am 22 years old and am in love with this moisturizer. It's light weight, goes on smooth, leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple. I bought it for the moisturizing properties and have been in love ever since. It doesn't cause acne and is a great night and morning cream. Hope they never discontinue"
best price&best results great glow after using with StIves peach scrub will never use anything else MY skin loves it. Ive tried everything and you cant find anything with theresults for the price. I can use it as a full body lotion for this price. Even my hands look better! dr oz is right why spend tons of $$$ which we think means better results only to be fooled by horrible marketing
"works great, not greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This skin cream for your face is amazing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer, especially after I wash my face in st. Ives scrub!"
Very softening to the skin. Even put on elbows and knees. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It's a shame that Walmart doesn't carry it in the store anymore, but they offer it online. How odd. But at least I can get it. It has elastin and collagen in it. It's smooth and light on my skin. Thanks St. Ives!"
This makes my skin feel so soft and smooth . This is also good for me because I have sensitive skin and it doesn't break me out
Everyone thinks I'm 15 to 20 years younger. My skin looks just as young as it did 25 years ago since I started using Timeless Skin by St. Ives. Just a very few lines under my eyes and neck. Not too bad for a senior huh?
"I'm am 69 and have been using this moisturizer for about 20 years maybe longer, I have no wrinkles. I've moved recently and had to get new doctors, even they can't believe how old I am looking at my face."
I absolutely love this product! The moisturizer goes on smooth and leaves no oily residue like most moisturizers I have used. It has a clean smell. I have recommended this product to friends and family.
Am a T zone mixed Face skin 34 years old and I tried all the expensive and New facial cream Nothing fits my skin and make it soft and bright like this one and am using it scince 2011 or before cant remember
"I love this cream, its light weight, absorbs easily and smells delicious. Great value for money and it really helps with my combination skin. I have posted a full review on thetreatmenttester a UK beauty blog"
"Never sticky, even in 90+ heat in the South. I am in my 50s, it is fabulous. My daughter is in her 20s (with acne), it is fabulous. PLEASE ADD SUNSCREEN to make this PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This moisturizer is the perfect fit for my combination skin. It's helped me have a more even skin tone and complexion only after a week and my face feels so soft.
Love the way it makes my neck and face feel. I am at the age I need all the help I can get and this moisturizer really works well. I look forward to trying other products from St. Ives!
"I've been a St. Ives user for about 2 years now and I absolutely love this moisturizer, it does the job like no other. It's light weight formula, fragrance free and it's super inexpensive. Keep up the good work! :)"
"Thanks St. Ives, for another great skin care product. The collagen elastic moisturizer is the perfect soothing and smoothing solution to my skin, without breaking my budget. A high class product for a fraction of the cost of other name brands."
I began using this skin cream when I turned 39 and was about to be married. I am now 68 and everyone thinks I am in my early 50s. It is fantastic and the only skin product I use.
I have been hearing about this moisturizer for awhile and decided to try it -WOW!!!! I just turned 47 and my skin already feels like I'm 27 ! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and everything about it !!!!
I am 48 years old and have tried many facial moisturizers. I have very sensitive skin and found St.Ives to be a wonderful product.. I will purchase this again - its great!
THIS HERE LEAVES MY SKIN LOOKING FLAWLESS.. I LOVE IT & RECOMMEND TO ALL THOSE LADIES WANTING TO START THE FIGHT ON FINE LINES & WRINKLES. IT IS VERY AFFORDABLE & THAT IS A BONUS.
"I and my husband have been using this moisturizer for over 7 years. I also introduced it to my parents and siblings in Nigeria. Indeed, we can't go a day without it. I wish that it is repackaged with a pump."
"Great product....collagen and elastin....good stuff..., it is wonderful to find this product with those good ingredients in it....tell me it is going to be around for as long as I live!"
"I've been using this product for years, I love it people tell you how young I look , that I don't age I tell them I've been using the moisturizer for a long time and I truly believe that's my secret. Thanks St. Ive's"
Lot of people want to know my secret fountain of youth and tell me they thought I was 35 after I reveal I'm 51 and tell them St Ives products especially the Timeless Collagen Moisturizer! Thank you for formulating such a great product!
"This is my all time favorite moisturizer for night. I have spent sooo much money on products and systems that do not work. I always come back to this! I wish there was the same product available with an SPF for day wear, tho!"
How refreshing to find a product that does exactly what it says it will do and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I am hooked. I will buy St. Ives for all my skin care needs.
Please never discontinue this amazing product. I love this moisturizer very much. It is very moisturizing and quite refreshing. I use it both morning and before bed. It smoothes your skin so nicely and leaves it soft. Great for acne prone skin.
I've been using this product since I was a girl and I always get compliments on my skin. I will never use another moisturizer. I would like as someone else suggested for a larger pump bottle like the lotions.
I use this as a night cream because there's no sunscreen in it...I have combination skin and it doesn't make my skin oily or broken out at all. Great product for the price!
"I have dry and very sensitive skin. After trying this out for a month, my skin became soft and supple. There's also a calming effect on my skin. No more dry skin and allergy breakouts."
Don't stop with your face...I also use this all over my body and while it's not super intensive it moisturizes well without any greasy feeling or overwhelming fragrance. Love It!
I will be 40 years old this year and people think I'm in my 20's all of the time. I like to believe it's from using St. Ive's moisturizing products for over 15 years. I can't say enough about it!!!
"I love this lotion. Most lotions make my skin breakout, but not this one. And it feels great going on. Just need to figure out where I can get more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw this product on Doctor Oz and recommended it to my mother who is 47. After she used it a couple of weeks I noticed her skin looked healthier and more radiant with fewer lines. My sisters have noticed as well and her face always smells good.
"I can't find this product in Portugal, I use it since I wento to Copenhagen many years ago and now my father starting using mine and I dont have it anymore"
"I have been using this product for 30 years and obviously I love it! It has the perfect consistency (not thick/gummy or too greasy), a light fresh scent and makes my face feel so smooth. It's like comfort food for my skin."
"This product is affordable, smells very subtle and good, and after only a month of using it my skin is much more firm and my fine lines are gone. The only thing i don't like is that it doesn't have a pump."
"I have been using this moisturizer for 5 years and absolutely love it. I can use a simple tinted moisturizer foundation with it and avoid the heavy, cakey look of most foundations."
"Wow. I've never written a review before... but thought I MUST for this. I've only been using this for a week, and I can already tell a difference in my skin. I am almost 25 years old and think i have found my ""secret weapon"" to aging gracefully."
I LOVE this product! I have used an expensive direct sales brand for years but love this moisturizer. I can't seem to find it anymore in my area please stock this!
I have used this product for over 20 years! I have really sensitive skin and it doesn't make my skin break out when I use it. It is the only product I have ever used that makes my skin feel truly moisturized.
"Ths is one of the best product that you have, I use it twice a day, and have never been had a problem with it. Before I was using you anti wrinkle cream but you took it off the market. This is the closest thing to that."
Ever since i started using this product in 2009 my skin just glows and is always looking fresh and nice... I usually apply it after washing my face.. Totally recommend it.. My top choice for a moisturizer
"I absolutely love this product! It soaks in great, is very light and doesn't leave my face feeling oily like a lot of facial moisturizers on the market! Not to mention the amount you get and the price is great!"
"Thanks to St.Ives -Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer.This is the 2nd day I'm using and my uneven skin tones vanished ,fine lines around my eyes vanished.It's Amazing."
I have used St. Ives for many years and I love the look of smoothness and the softness my face and neck have with the Timeless moisturizer people I first meet have a hard time believing I am 60.
I have used St. Ives products for many years. I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin so soft and not greasy. Really like it compared to the regular collagen elastine moisturizer. Love Love Love this stuff.
I loved. Results can be seen from the first day. The skin
"Feels very moist, smooth, soft as soon as you put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for 20+ years. My skin is beautiful! I use it every day, even under my foundation, if I wear it. The cost is more than competitive. I can feel a difference in my skin, if I forget to put it on. A great product."
i love it simply :) i just start using it 2 months ago and i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed it super amazing moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Living in a dry climate with dry skin, I need lots of moisturizing. This is the best facial moisturizer by far.  Feels great on, absorbs quickly, and last all day!"
"Best face cream ever!I use this cream more than 20 years and for me is something magical what happened with my skin.For the first time I saw this product at ""duty free "" at Turkey and I want to try it and after I don't stop to use."
"I just recently started using this cream, but I could already see and feel the difference, especially whenever I touch and feel my face. I have never been this happy and religiously contented, thanks to St. Ives"
"Great product and finally something Without SPF in it. I'm allergic to anything with SPF. I very much appreciate the ""natural"" aspect of this facial moisturizer. Thank you :)"
"My skin doesn't do great with products sometimes, especially moisturizers so I've been using this for about three years now and it's absolutely a life saver. Moisturizes without being oily and clogging pores!"
I just purchased this for the first time and I love it! The smell and the feel on the skin are great! Why can't this be used for the entire body and not just the face and neck?
I have been using this product for over a year and my skin looks and feels great!!!! I especially love that it does not leave your face feeling greasy. It just glows!!!!
I seriously can't live without this product ! The one & only great affordable drugstore moisturizer that doesn't break me out & keeps my skin moisturize LOVE IT !
I have used this product for years and love the results no lines or wrinkles and get told all the time that I look so young. I love this product and now my girls are starting it too.
"I have used this product for over 30 years, and love it! Very good moisturizer! I'm having a hard time finding it in the stores, so had to order it online. Wonder why it's not in the stores anymore?"
I have been using this moisturizer since I was 25; I am now 44 and everyone I meet thinks I'm in my early 30's. It has helped to reduce any kind of wrinkles and made my skins smooth and vibrant.
I have battled acne and large pores sine I was 11. I started using this lotion a few months ago and my skin has never looked better! I tell everyone about it!
"I have used this moisturizer for more than 4 months and I have noticed blackheads and hard sebum on my pores, I dont recommend this cream if you have acne prone skin or big pores since it will make you break out."
"I have been using this cream for about a month, and my skin looks better. This cream is not oily. It goes on so smoothly. It soothes the dryness and relaxes the fines lines on my face and neck."
I just love the soft scent of this moisturizer! I am very sensitive to smells and this is to die for...I just wish you had a body lotion with this soft fragrance as well. Although I have been using this on my arms and hands as well :)
I love this stuff I know Im only 20 years old but out of everything I've used I honestly have to say it's the best!! non irritating to the skin very gentle and creamy!! I could use this all my life and really does diminish lines!!!
I have super dry skin around my nose and forehead area especially around this time of year when its bitter cold out. So I got this to try out and it definitely moisturized my dry spots and makes my skin feel super soft!
"This moisturizer is a great deal for the price! It has a nice consistency that is not too thick, and a light clean fragrance. I put this on at night before bed and wake up with the softest skin in the morning!"
"Love this moisturizer, I always have a had a difficult time looking for a good moisturizer since my face is oily. But I like this one plus it's a pretty good size jar and lasts a very long while. I recommend it."
Hard water can really take a toll on the skin but this cream moisturizes it right back up. I love to put it on in the morning and evenings right after a shower or bath. I would totally purchase again.
Been using this for about two weeks now. It seems to add a nice moisture to my skin and it's keeping that dry winter skin at bay. I don't see any drastic fine line changes but hopefully with more use I will see some big changes
"I think this product is really good for dry skin, it adds a glow to your skin and makes it look hydrating especially using it with fresh skin apricot scrub!"
"This is a pretty good, light moisturizer, it sinks in pretty quick and it's very gentle on my sensitive skin. It lasts forever and for $5.44, you can't beat it! I have noticed that it can be a bit much if you have oily skin but it's perfect if you have dry skin! I have bought this many times and it is the only moisturizer I use. I do wish it came with a pump though.... Overall, I would recommend this product."
Loved this product for the price! Hands down my favourite budget moisturizer. The St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer was my go-to while travelling (to both colder and warmer climates). This moisturizer helped my skin cope with the climate change by keeping it calm and refreshed. Definitely a staple in my skincare regime.
I had the worst experience ever from the moisturizer. It was my first and last time I used it for two weeks and ended up with the biggest break outs in my life. So bad that I'm embarrassed to even leave my house. I'm so disappointed in the results as I'm still trying to recover from the breakouts . 
"This moisturizer is amazing! I have tried many different brands (including high end) and nothing works like this. It leaves my skin so soft without being oily or greasy. Doesn't break me out, in fact it tightened my pores! It doesn't feel heavy and goes perfectly under make up! For the first time I feel confident with my skin!! Even my friends saw the results and have purchased this moisturizer for themselves. I have no complaints!!!"
"Absolutely Amazing!! Feels terrific, smells good, lasts forever!! As to the reviews about sunscreen... I'm a VERY fair skinned Red head :) I wash my face, put this on and let it soak in while I get dressed, then I put my sunscreen on OVER it!! Works GREAT!!"
I've had this same moisturizer for about 3 years now and I am completely in love with it! It makes my face feel so soft and I do not have a single wrinkle. I love all the st.ives products and I will continue to purchase this moisturizer. Thank you for making such a great and affordable cream!!
"I just bought this so haven't used it long but dd want to out there that I tried this on some stretch marks I have( had a son last june2014) and it instantly worked wonders! They don't seem as prominent. They aren't completely gone with one use of course but after seeing just ten minutes on some of the looser skin, I am in love. I feel with regular use it will help drastically change my tummy! Love it! Haven't used on my face yet since I am prone to breakouts I may not. But love it for other areas that need firming."
"I tried this lotion after using the timeless apricot face wash. While it is the best facial moisturizer I've been able to find in the US I do not think it is as effective with the face wash no longer around. It still however is very compareable to the Korean brands I used to use. It's non oily, doesn't leave your skin shiney, and leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed rather the heavy and weighed down."
"This moisturizer is great! It smells good! I'm only in my teens and I use this, because it is the only moisturizer that won't break me out. You only need a little bit. :) I usually only use it 3 times a week, because it can give your face a little bit of a oily feel if you use too much, and if you use it too often. I use it after I wash my face with St. Ives Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange face scrub."
"These bottles are smaller than the ones you generally see in stores but they do cost less. I prefer the larger bottles, but these are the same product and will be easier to travel with so I am not disappointed. This body wash smells nice, does not cause allergic reactions and helps with dry skin."
If you get super dry during the winter time this will defiantly be your best friend!
"Love this stuff,feels great on my skin not to greasy,just perfect and it absorbs fast leaving my skin feel so soft"
"I'm 26 years old and I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now, I think this is better than a lot expensive moisturizers"
The old formula in the pink jar was far superior to anything else on the market for over ten years and I cannot find it anywhere.
Please what is in this jar is amazing. I bought it because of tiny wrinkles on my smile line this clears my uneven skin tones.
This moisturizer is simply amazing!!! My skin is soft and smooth and wrinkle free at 51. I would love a lotion with an SPF and an eye cream please!
Seriously love this product! I've been using it for about a year now and love the fragrance and how my skin feels after every use!!
"I always use this product right out of the shower, and it leaves my face feeling wonderfully refreshed without being oily!"
"I have been using this for years, and love it! It has the best non-greasy formula, and absorbs so quickly. PLEASE, MAKE ONE WITH SPF!!!!"
This product is magical. Amazing scent and hydrates the skin perfectly. it does not clog pores. I will definitely purchase another jar. Love.. love!
THIS FACE CREAM IS THE BEST! IT'S NOT OILY GOES ON SMOOTH AND FEELS GREAT EVEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY. I DEFINETLY RECOMMEND!
Have been using for many many years. I don't need makeup due to my even skin tone and firmness. I look 10 years younger.
It's light weight and absorbs quickly. Leaves my skin feeling like silk. I hope they NEVER stop making this wonderful cream.
It leave your face moisturized all day long.... I can say no more...Two thumbs up...Thanks a lot St. Ives!
"while living abroad i met this facial cream, i bouhtg in my country, Chile, but it isnt selling no more WHY???!!! :("
I am in love with this product;my eye Doctor cant believe that I am 67 years younger. In love for ever. Lu.
Love the feeling of this cream. It soaks in and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. Skin is so soft. Can tell a real difference. Love it
"great product for everyday use, not heavy but not too light either, great for day or night and it makes my skin look and feel great"
"I love everything about this produc, I have a really dry skin and I recommend this product for everyone it's very good"
"I love this moisturizer, because not only does it make my skin super soft, it's a great price even though it's hard to find at your local store."
"Its not greasy on my skin. I love what it does to my face when I wake up in the morning, it gives me that fresh looking skin that I always wanted."
"I have been using this product since I was about 20 years old, I am now 71 and I have very few wrinkles."
Great product. Makes my skin tight and firm. Doesnt leave my feeling greasy or oily. I would recommend this to my friends
The BEST can honesly compare to Le Mer!! I have tried them all. St Ives is the finest most well kept secret that needs to be known!
I am in LOVE with this moisture. I have been using it for years. I have gotten so many compliments on how beautiful and youthful my skin looks.
Just started using this. Was very confused as to why there was no protective seal. Seems super weird. But i like the product.
"I've been using this for over a year.Nongreasy,does not clog pores.I use morning and night.Great product!"
This moisturizer leaves my face feeling fresh and soft without feeling heavy or greasy. It also has a lovely light scent.
This moisturizer smells soooooo good and has such a good consistency. So hydrating and moisturizing!!
This is a light soothing and refreshing cream. I find the collagen elastin the ideal cream to use after derma rolling
This leaves my skin feeling not oily. It also has reduced some little wrinkles I've had! I'll be using this for as long as they make it
This is the only moisturizer I have ever put in my face. I used to combine it with the cucumber toner that I cannot find anymore.
This is such a great moisturizer! The price point is awesome! Its almost a dupe for the hope in a jar. Its so great and hydrating!
You can't beat the price for such an amazing moisturizer. I have tried many expensive ones and this product by far surpasses them all.
I started using this when I entered my 30's to help with anti-aging skin care. I could not pass up the value! The jar last forever. I even used it on my loose areas after my c-section. I will always continue to buy this product.
I like this so far. Its very thin feeling so I use it under my makeup. Works well. The price is great for the amount you get. Its not my favorite moisturizer but its good.
I actually use this on my stomach at night. It's a great product with a great scent at a great value. I use it for some extra skin from having kids and it keeps everything tight. Love it and would recommend!
"I came across this cream a few years ago and fell in love with it. It is leaves your skin hydrated and glowing. I am never without it. I apply it all over. Face, neck, arms... I apply it right after my shower and in the morning. Love it!!!!"
"I have used St. Ives colleges elastin face moisturizer for many years. Now I can't find it anywhere....CVS, Walgreens, supermarkets. Why are they not carrying it anymore?"
This product works well. I noticed a difference in my skin.it smells good. I haven't had no recent break outs. Good value seems like it will last awhile. A little product goes a long way
St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Moisturizer met my expectations. It did leave me feeling a bit greasy though. It is very gentle and has nice packaging too. I will definitely buy this again when I run out.
"It smells great and it's somewhat gentle on the skin (however I am very careful not to rub too hard either, so o my use gentle motions). It's a good exfoliant to keep by. I also leave it on for 5-10 mins after exfoliating."
"Fabulous aroma, gentle, and packed with moisture. Absorbs well into skin. Light weight, leaves skin baby soft and smelling clean. Affordable and the product last for months. My to go to moisturizer. A must have in everyones cabinet."
Bring back the timeless formula it was so much better i don't think I will be using this one
I am using that product more than five years and I am so happy with it!
"It feed your skin enough, not to be greasy, not to be too oily, just enough to feel and look great!"
"This is by far the best moisturiser I have ever used and I'm 60 and have tried them all! This holds up against the most expensive of moisturisers and then some! It's true,y amazing!"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a few years and it is amazing. It makes my skin so soft and it feels so hydrated, without feeling greasy. You get beautiful skin for an amazing price."
"On my quest for an economical facial moisturizer, I bought this because of the brand and the type. Also, it was a good price for the quatity. I have proudly used St. Ives scrub and mask products since I was teen. I am aware of the Avoid the eye area warning, and have been doing so, yet, my eyes have been watering for the two days. My eyes are just too sensative. Better luck next time."
"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! Now, I have combination skin and I use a drying face cleanser. This moisturizer significantly minimizes the dryness and yet to have a single dry patch on my face. Also the price is so right with how much you get (I got mine for around four bucks). Totally worth it!!!"
"This is one of my favorite moisturizers! It is available at most drugstores for a reasonable price. It is only lightly scented, and it goes away within minutes of application. It feels like it moisturizes deep, and it's definitely not sticky. My skin feels plump and supple the day after applying this moisturizer."
"I'm 23 and finally realizing that all my hours working and not sleeping, too much sun exposure, and not enough moisturizing are all going to catch up with me. My skin feels amazing. I have combination skin and this helps my dry areas and doesn't over-do it on my oily areas. And it smells absolutely amazing!"
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer and pray that it NEVER changes or is discontinued!!! at almost 50, it has made my skin soft, clear and silky. I have used every cream, lotion and potion ever made and THIS is the one I know I can count on. please keep it comin!!"
"I noticed my skin was getting very dry and was looking for good inexpensive moisturizer. I loved the apricot scrub from when I was a teenager so when I seen this product I was figured I give it a try since I already trust this brand. All I gotta a say is since using this product my skin has not been dry at all, it's very light weight, leaves skin looking healthy and youthful, and absorbs quickly. Really loving this product so far and will continue to use and recommend to my family and friends"
I like your products. so I was looking for a new moisturizer. and sent I already know and use your other produce I decided to try this one and fell in love with it and makes my face so soft. I use it at night and in the morning. and does not make my face fell oily.
"I was really rooting for this product, but it fell so short for me! The smell is awful and overwhelming, it even made me nauseuos. It also wasn't very hydrating for a moisturiser, my skin still felt dry even after a thick application. Overall, this product did not meet my expectations and was a product I regret buying."
Absolutely amazing. Moisturizes and leaves skin feeling so soft with no greasy feel.
Love Love Love my skin using this product. I will never switch to anything else.
"Good moisturizer if you have dry skin , and very refreshing smell and it is gentle on the skin ."
I have many years using st. Ives
Love all products. ❤️❤️❤️
Its very light and easily absorbed by my skin it leaves my skin soft and smooth
Love this stuff but can't find it on the shelves anymore. Where can I buy it?!
Love the way my face feels after I put it on. Will never use anything else.
I love my moisturizer early in the morning and at night. It' smooth and clean.
Have used for years. Always get compliments on my skin.
A nice light facial moisturizer that makes my skin glow I have this on hand all the time
"I love this product. I use it every day, and nobody believes me when I tell them how old I am."
This facial product makes my skin feels and looks great. I use it every day.
It smells and feels so awesome. The skin feels kind of silky with no oily texture
Do not know how to add photo. Love the item. Am age 77 with no wrinkles.
Love this cream. Not oily and I like that it has no sunscreen.
This is my number one moisturizer! I love it and I feel like ill never run out! Worth it!
"Doesn't clog up my pores, soaks into my pored immediately, goes on smooth onto my face."
Wonderful facial moisturizer! Very light and not greasy at all.
"The products leave my face feeling smooth ,soft and pores looking smaller."
"It is a very good moisturizer for the price, and it does not make your skin oily."
"Greatest product keeps me looking young, gets rid of wrinkles immediately!"
"Second to none, and I would use no other product on my face."
I've used this for two days now and I can't believe how soft my skin feels. Absolutely love this!
"This product stings my face a little when I put it on my face, but it goes away the more I rub it in. I use it as a night moisturizer and it works."
I really like this product I do have oily skin so I don't use it daily but when I do it leaves my skin so soft.
I love this. It makes me feel refreshed. I believe my skin is getting the moisture it needs this winter!
I am a great fan of this brand ..... This product is amazing and I like the formula and texture of it ... love it
I like this moisturizer and it gets the job done. It is very gentle on the skin and it makes my skin look very moisturized and dewy.
I love EVERYTHING about this moisturizer ❤️ From the smell to how it makes my skin feel. Love love love it.
I'm really upset it took me so long to realize this product does not work with my skin. It was fine for the first week I used it and then all of a sudden I started getting so many pimples all over my cheeks and neck.
"This face moisturizer is something I would definitely buy out, after cleansing my face it gets dry sometimes but this moisturizer helps hydrate my face and gets rid of the dryness. I would most definitely recommend this to people."
This product is absolutely amazing for anyone who has dry skin and cannot find anything to work for them. I absolutely love it! Definitely would give it more stars if I could!
Just buy it 2days ago and hesitate because its a face product and didnt have a protection seal. At the first application you feel a difference in the skin and it feels comfortable. I trust in having good results.
"I've used expensive, mid priced, and cheap moisturizers, all of which have made me break out. This is a light feeling moisturizer and so inexpensive! I will recommend this to friends!"
I am a 60 year old man with sensitive skin especially after shaving. My girlfriend bought St Ives facial cream really felt great after shaving. Added benefit of tightening wrinkles really like this product
This face cream is wonderful!! So light and very fresh feeling to skin. Not heavy at all. Great under makeup in these hot summer months. Thanks St Ives
I have been using this product for about 2 years. I am only 23 years old when I started using this. It is important to keep you skin hydrated by adding this and drinking a lot of water. This product leaves my skin nice and it not oily !
" ok, so I usually use cetaphil because it's fragrance free. However, despite the rather pronounced smell, I do like how light this is and how easily it sinks into my skin. One thing though: along with the tub, could you guys produce a smaller bottle or pump for travel and hygiene? Other than that, I like this one. Thanks! Maybe you could also create a scentless version."
I've been looking for a facial moisturizer for about a month so after all this looking my girlfriend recommended st ives the 1st day I used it I never felt so new so clean and so hydrated . Please st ives keep this product in the stores and always on my drug store shopping list and in my heart . Finally found you
"This is my favorite moisturizer to use. I use this every night as my moisturizer all over my face, neck, chest, and sometimes even my elbows. It's not sticky or greasy and it sinks into be skin quickly. I've already gone through an entire container and have already repurchased!"
Love this product so much! Would recommend to anyone! Defiantly worth the price! :) love!
"I love this product, price and quality can't be beat."
"I love this! Works just like the expensive ones, but naturally...."
I enjoy buying St Ives body products but this was a miss for me. My skin is sensitive and reacted to this moisturizer.
I love this product! I used it 1-2 times daily and I am never disappointed. I saw this product on Pinterest over a year ago and have used it since.
"Damaged skin after few days of use, with severe dryness and red. Been over a month and redness hasn't gone 100% away!"
"I love this moisturizer! It leaves my face feeling hydrated, firm, and soft. I've used this for years!"
I have been using this product for years. Love it. I have a hard time finding it in my area. Not sure why.
My skin feels soft and does not look or feel oily. And the scent is fresh but not too much fragrance to the point where i get tears. Love it!
This is my everyday face moisturizer. I love it! It goes on smooth and doesn't leave a greasy or oily feeling after. My skin is combination (oily and dry) and this cream works for both aspects. This is my brand!
"I really like St. Ives and their products. This is a great daily moisturizer to use. Helps keep in moisture and clear up dry areas, giving you a natural glow. Affordable and easy to find in department stores."
Me and my sister just started using this product about 4 weeks ago. And we see a difference In our skin. My sister lost a lot of weight and this lotion has really helped her firm the neck and face area..
"Love this product. It makes my skin feel smooth and toned, The only thing I would ask is if you could put sunscreen in it. I have fair skin and worry about skin cancer. This is the only product that has worked for my face. Every other product has made my face break out or made my face feel greasy. This product is the best."
I have used st. Ives products before with no problems but this cream did not agree with me at all. Within 2 days of using this product my pores became blocked and I broke out with a rash and horrible acne. I stopped using it a week ago and am still dealing with blocked pores and rough patchy skin. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin
"I really like the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel, but I agree with many others, it needs a sunscreen, preferably 30+ and then it would be PERFECT!!! I'm 54 years old and just started using this based on my 25 year old daughter's recommendation. I LOVE the way it makes my skin feel, soft, non-greasy, just lovely! I like it so much I want to use it twice a day, it feels that good! Just need to add sunscreen! Thank you!"
"Bought this help combat my dry face post-cleanser two years ago, but I use it every morning between cleanings. My facial skin feels hydrated and plump. Since I am mid 20s, I cannot say anything about lines/wrinkles... OR one could say I don't have any due this moistureizer. Two demands: 1. Add SPF for anti-aging addition! PLEASE. 2. Formulate it paraben free (the other lotions have pampered me)."
Love it!!!! First time buying and I will definitely continue to use.
My skin is noticeably softer and more moisturized!
I have been using this product for about a year now and I absolutely love it.
"I have used this moisturizer for years. It is light, not oily, and makes my skin feel great!"
First time buying this and will continue to purchase it. Leaves my skin feeling soft and plump very moisturizing.
I absolutely love this product. It makes my skin so soft. It smells wonderful. I would definitely recommend.
This works so great on my mom. It helps with her laugh lines and the wrinkles. I use it more as a preventative measure.
I am sick that I can't find this product anymore. It seems every time I find I find something I love it is discontinued. Hope this is not the case!!
Provides skin with much needed moisture. Creates a smooth surface for makeup application. Truly feels like you are smoothing and softening your skin with every use.
This cream feels very nice on the skin:)I'm just not thrilled about it having Paraffinum in it.
"Left My Skin.. Glowing, No Greasy, Residue.. Absolutely A Wonderful Product.."
I have only been using this product a few days and cam felt and see a difference in my skin .
I love Timeless it is a quality moisturizer at a price I can afford.
Really like this product but will have to stop using it because there is no sunscreen. St. Ives folks--hope you are paying attention!
"I wish this product had SPF! With this being a major concern nowadays, I am looking to switch moisturizers for this specific reason."
