"Best 'drug store' brand I have found yet. I have worked many years as a beauty specialist in big box stores and used the high end brands, like Visionnaire ( Lancome) and Miracle Worker (Philosophy), as well as some by Estee Lauder and Dior, this one worked just as well! My skin had plumpness, clarity and smoothness. A real winner!"
"I have moisturized every day since I was a teenager , it makes a huge difference especially when you use quality products like this one. It smells beautiful and I noticed that overnight it maintains skins softness and feels fully moisturized in the morning. I love it two thumbs up !!"
I have been using Revitalift for many years. It is not greasy and does not clog my pores. It has kept my complexion fresh with fewer lines and wrinkles than you would expect for a 68 year old woman. I have gotten compliments on my complexion from friends and strangers. I use it twice a day. Thank you for a great product.
I received these for free and I must say that I wish I had discovered this sooner. It really does make a difference. I want to let everyone know that if you plan on earing makeup after applying wait at least 15 mins and don't apply much. A little really does go a long way. Your skin will be left smooth and plump. It feels amazing on the skin! It is very moistering ao if you like more of a gel feel then this may not be for you. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This smelled good. I used it as a night cream mostly and it was fairly hydrating. It left the skin with an almost light, rubbery feel that I think is associated with silicon based products. I liked this but also thought if was a little strange. I would possibly buy this again to use as a night cream and it got me interested in other products in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample. I applied it to my face, it looked nice. My skin felt really slippery and matte. BUT the product doesn't even absorb into the skin. If I touched it, it started to just come off. White little rolls of this stuff. Disgusting and had to rub my face with a towel just to get it off. Worst product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not a big fan of this product. I think it's too heavy and smells a lot like perfume. I prefer a cream that is more lightweight without a fragrance or scent. My products don't need to smell good, they just need to work. For the price I would not buy this product in the future. Its nothing special. I did receive this product for free in order to review it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have serious problems in my forehead, big dented lines I look older, but now everything change thanks to this cream , the only thing is hard to find it , is this going to be discontinued???"
"I bought the eye cream, serum, and moisturizer in this Revitalift Volume line. After almost 2 months of religious day and night treatments, my skin looked dull and waxy. Completely lifeless. Would not buy this again. Would not recommend it."
"I bought this product, a couple of years ago. I am sorry to say, I loved the texture . But I was not pleased with the length of time it stayed on. Kindaof smears easily."
"I am so happy I bought this. I was looking for a good affordable but effective face cream. This did the trick. The results on my face have wonderful. My skin looks smoother, healthier, less wrinkled. VERY HAPPY I TRIED IT!"
"It has a nice, decent smell."
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Makes my skin feel so soft.
It was very fast and easy to do. There was no line no problems no worries.
"I recently received this product in a VoxBox from Influenster.Is very different from any moisturizer I've used , non-greasy and absorbs well . The ingredients are incredible. The finish is a smooth and the benefits amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm usually not the biggest fan of day creams because I have oily skin but this one is a winner. It feels weightless and very comparable to higher end products. I will definitely be repurchasing it. I received this item for free for review purposes and am really glad I did! Found a new go to day cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While this felt nice on the skin, I did not feel it did a very good job of moisturizing. My cheeks still felt dry after it had sunk in. The rest of my face which is normal/oily felt fine. I would recommend this for use in summertime for light moisturizing or for people with normal/ oily skin. If you have dry skin you will need something else.

I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I honestly love it. It has made my skin much more smooth and has erased many fine lines. No breakouts. Light fresh scent. Feels like velvet. Amount lasts a long time. I've been using it for about a month and I've only used about half of the container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product was ok but goes fast and is not a miracle worker. I prefer a water based moisturizer and this just seems so/so. I received this product for free from Influenster and L'Oreal for my opinion. For the price I would go with the Neutrogena Water Based moisturizer. Lasts longer and feels great on your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this for testing and reviewing purposes and love the formula however did not care for the smell of this at all. it is highly fragranced so if you do not like your facial lotions to smell, I would stay away. I also reduced another star because even though it feels like it is very smooth it does feel a little heavy and does take time to soak into the skin. (making me wait longer to put my make up on) I do have sensitive skin and did not break out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very pleased with the product results I would definitely buy it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would buy again and would recommend to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for testing purposes from influenster. I love love this cream! I have extremely dry skin and this cream is very moisturizing with out being greasey. It also smells great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The moisturizer works great and is true to it's name! Definitely moisturizes just the right amount and after a few weeks you can tell a difference when used with the other products in the line. **I received this product complimentary for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tested the L'Oreal products that I received for free in my Influenster Vox box. This product had a nice smell and went on smooth. I would have to say that this product is better than using nothing at all. I usually use Olay product. Now that I'm almost done, the only thing holding me back from trying this product again is the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this in a set for my opinion of the product in a VoxBox, through Influenster. That being said. This is my 2nd favorite product I received. I love how soft my skin is after applying, and I only have to use a dot to cover my face and neck. I also really like the light fragrance it has, it's very relaxing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thank you L'Or√©al and @influenster for allowing me to test and awesome product. This went on smoothly, non-reactive and non-performing smell. I instantly had softer looking and feeling skin. With most products in would experience break-outs, not with this."
"I liked this product, good smell, husband is sensitive to smells.  He didn't complain so that's always a good sign, once I had to take a 2nd shower to wash off a new body wash (hence the product went into the trash). Non irritating, skin feels nice and smooth with it on. I received this product free for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"have terrible experience with moisturizers that don't actually moisturize, feel heavy and seem to sit on top of my skin. Thankfully this Revitalift moisturizer is nothing like that. My skin actually felt moisturized. And I didn't feel the need to reapply multiple times. Combined with the other Revitalift volume filler line, I saw a noticeable difference in my makeup application and appearance. I received this product in the Loreal Influenster Voxbox. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a free product tester for Influenster. I couldn't be happier with this product. My face feels ao smootha nd soft after using. The product is light and fluffy and has a great smell. I see visible difference is n about three weeks. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product definitely smoothed over a lot of blemishes, fine lines and discolorations I had. I've been using it for over a month and although I dislike the smell, the texture is comfortable and the effects are worth the money. Note: I received this product free for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer. I love the smell, the consistency, moisturizing feel on my face and how it made my face feel all day. It did make my face tingle and my cheeks red all day. But I over all liked it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Now that I have started using this product for several weeks I cannot go without it in my daily routine. This product helps to restore moisture to my dry skin, makes my skin extremely soft, and I do not feel the lines and wrinkles on my face the way I used to. I received this product free for testing purposes via Influenster. #AskSkinExpert [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the L'oreal Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer for Free to try & review from Influester. The Volume Filler retains skin moisture, helps with fine lines and wrinkles, & makes your skin look younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This works very well, it's also strongly scented. I wish it was unscented as it would then be perfect! I have very oily skin and this was a very thick product. It sat on my skin if I applied normally. What I did, was pat my face dry after washing and used half the amount I normally would. This method worked very well! Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved the smell of this moisturizer. A lot of times moisturizers that are supposed to work well don't have a very good smell but I had to problem with this scent. My only issue was that sometimes it didn't work well with my foundation and it kinda peeled off of my face which wasn't very attractive. I received this product for free to test from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this stuff! It has improved the fine lines on my forehead in a short period of time. The cream feels amazing on my skin and does not leave a greasy feeling. I received this product complimentary but plan on purchasing again when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this for reviewing purposes, I've been wanting to try it for a long time but let's face it, it's pricey for anti aging products. This stuff is amazing , leaves your face soft smooth and healthy looking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the RevitaLift Volume Filler for free from Influenster to try out and review. I liked the Daily Moisterizer alright but found it to be a little to heavy for my face, I have oily/combination skin and this made my face feel extra oily, however I did notice a little difference with my fine lines! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This didn't work terribly well for me, but it may just be my skin. It can be sensitive. I noticed a few other reviews that said their skin looked dull or waxy. In my case those might no be the perfect words, but it was certainly a bit duller than usual. Influenster sent me this line to review. So far the eye treatment gets a hearty endorsement. The rest I have a more mediocre feeling about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product from Influenster free for testing purposes and I am on my 3rd week of using it. I love it. My fine lines are disappearing and my crows feet have all but flown away. This is a miracle product. My cheeks look fuller and my face looks less hollowed out. I just love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product complimentary for review purpose. Having said that, I am not a huge fan of this cream. It does nothing to skin. It is an okay product. As a day cream, I feel it should have some SPF. I would have preferred something with SPF 15. The cream is just right. It is neither thick or runny. It goes on great and is absorbed quickly. It does have fragrance and since I am sensitive to smell, it feels a bit too much. Other than that it is an okay product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this 3 days ago and I'm so disappointed, my skin looks more dry."
"What a waste of my money!! When this product dries, it begins to turn into a white powdery film on your face. I have to get a wet washcloth and patted on my face to set it. It eventually starts to become powdery again and then I just wipe it off."
"I received the samples to try. I like how the product works, i noticed a changes in my skin. It's nice and easy to use you skin feels nice and soft afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Oh my goodness this day cream is to die for I have used it every day for four weeks and I'm in love !!! I recommend this to everyone I'm 46 years old and couldn't be happier [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. I received this compliments of Influenster to try and review. This is an excellent moisturizer. Leaves skin very soft feeling.I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product, makes the skin look healthy, radiant and feels soft. Minimizes the appereance of wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product came free from #influenster. Not sure I was going to like it because it is so thick but I ended up loving it! It absorbs nicely into my skin and I feel hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this to try and review. i love it's smell and the way that it leaves my skin feeling. it says that you can also use it in the morning, so i do wish that it had spf in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is fabulous! It's very hydrating without being greasy and compared to much higher priced eye treatments, it doesn't break the bank. I would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample. I'm on day 4 and have noticed a huge difference. It seems to even minimize my pores. I love the scent and the way it makes my face feel. It's so much softer, smoother and my skin tone is more even. I highly recommend this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This was soooo thick it feels more like a night cream. I had to wait forever for it to set before I could put on primer otherwise it would leave residue pieces all over my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this moisturizer it replenished my skin fullness and it did help smooth out my fine lines and wrinkles, it said I could see results within hours although I did not. I did however see results within about two weeks of using it my skin was more plump and more from. I did see a reduction in my forehead wrinkles they seemed significantly reduced as well as my crow's feet. I did receive this product for free but my opinions are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this cream in conjunction of other products from the same line, my skin feels smoother with a glow and the elasticity of my skin feels better. I have combination skin and this cream does not feel greasy with this moisturizer. I receive this product free of charge to test in exchange of my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This day cream made my face look very greasy with and without the facial serum that was recommended. This might be good for those with dry/normal skin but I'd definitely do not recommend this product to those with oily skin. I also wish this was packaged in a tube form. I did get this product from Influenster to review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product! My favorite part about this product is that when applied and smoothed into the skin, it gives a nice satin finish. Nothing shiny appears on my face and it does not make me look greasy! BONUS! The packaging is nice, but its not hygienic to continually stick your fingers in a jar to get the moisturizer out. I appreciate a pump or a squeezy tube more. I received this product for free and have given my honest review on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. I used it for 30 days before reviewing and can honestly say that I have noticed a reduction in the irritating lines I have around my eyes and mouth. I would definitely purchase it again and am very happy that I had the chance to sample it for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product with high hopes. I was disappointed. It left my skin feeling very heavy and greasy. Thanks to Influenster for sending this to me for free. I enjoyed the other products in the line, just not this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a light floral scent, if you are sensitive to scent it may not be for you. It is very moisturizing, and leaves a soft velvet feel. The only con is that when I layer it with my other skincare, it balls up. Like you are peeling from a sunburn. The other problem that it's in a jar. I'd rather have it in a pump, but that's just personal preference. I think it would be great for low maintenance days, or if you're in a hurry. ** I received this item from Influenster for a review. ** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have noticed the most improvement in my skin texture by using this product every day for the past month. I've tried the full Revitalift line, and I feel like this product worked the most on my skin to plump, moisturize, and smooth the texture of my skin. It works incredibly well when applied right before your makeup! I received this product for free to test out in my home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how rich and moisturizing this product is, I am combo oily skin type so i mostly used this at night. and its great for that. It has a very pleasant scent I didn't notice drastic changes in my skin. I think if you have Dry or Normal skin you will enjoy this product. I received this products complementary from Influenster for testing and review purposes ... thoughts and opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product but it is not a miracle worker. I am 42 years old, and my main ""issues"" are fine lines and big pores. After wearing this product for 8 weeks, my skin feels smoother, and the elasticity of my skin feels better. It does not feel greasy on my oily skin. The scent is ok. It's not overwhelming. I wish that it has SPF. Overall, the product is not bad for its price. I received this product compliments from Influenster, in exchange for my honest reviews."
"I love this day cream! It does a great job moisturizing without being greasy, and my makeup goes on really well on top of it. My skin can get very patchy and dry throughout the day, and after using this for a month I've notice a decrease in the patchiness and an evening of my skin. Love it! I was given this product for free to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am new to all this skin treatment, but this whole set has to be the best thing for a newbie like me. I don't nee to do much researching...or mix match combos, everything is worth its money and actually works. I need help with that dry skin and keep firm skin. I like the texture of this serum and the way it feels on my skin. I love the light fragrance, which is comforting helps me fall asleep! I LOVE THIS. this was free as I was a tester and I would buy again!!! the entire set...its neat [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has become my new moisturizer. I love the supple feel of my skin. It absorbs into my skin well and has improved the look of my skin. I have really noticed a change in the texture as well. I highly recommend this product to all skin types including sensitive skin like mine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This volume filler is really great of filling in fine lines and shallow wrinkles. It applies quickly and absorbs really well. Please make sure to wear sunscreen because either can make your skin sensitive to sunlight. This works best with the rest of the revitalist line. The smell is moderate, but not distracting from the good quality of it. Full disclosure, I received this for free in exchange for my honest review from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product from Influenster to try for free!!! This is a fantastic day cream!...I am 42 and have come to admit that my wrinkles are catching up with me. I have been using this underneath my makeup as an added moisturizer. I also have a deeper crease in my forehead and fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I have noticed an incredible difference. The formula is light and feels refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this so much! It was fluffy, went on well, and I did not wake up feeling like I slid across my pillow all night. I absolutely loved this product! The texture was light and disappeared, and it did not leave a tacky feeling like other products. I received this as a complementary trial for testing purposes, but the results were on par with expensive salon products I have previously used. I will most certainly buy this again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my favorite product in the whole line. Very versatile. Use under makeup or over serum treatments. Really helps fill in lines so that your makeup goes on smooth. Love it for that. Great every day product that has really helped reduce the look of fine lines.

"I started using this product right after i delivered my baby, its been 4 weeks and i do see a lot of good improvements in my skin.. my skin was tired, dull and lacked fullness from all the delivery process. Nd this cream has been a saver.. its a staple for me evry morning in my skin care routine I did receive this product for no cost on exchange of an honest opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a pretty good moisturizer. I'm basing my review mostly on the results from my mother, as I have very oily skin and anything that's not gel based makes me break out and even MORE oily. It has a really nice smell, and my mom did notice firmer skin after a few weeks of use. She's gotten a couple friends to buy it as well as my sister, and they all love it as much as she does. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly just could not get past the smell of this. Also, it was very thick and my skin started tingling upon application. Usually that's a sign that something is ""working,"" but then my neck started turning red. Not for me. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked how this cream went onto my face nice and smooth. I am only 31 with small minor visible lines and wrinkles. this did not leave my face greasy or oily and did not break me out. I must say a lot of anti aging products I tried I don't know if they really work or do they? only due to the fact I don't have visible wrinkles yet and than again I think my mind is playing tricks on me if it isn't working. I did receive this as complimentary testing from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Nice creamy everyday face cream. Doesn't feel heavy on the face or greasy. It absorbs nicely into the skin allowing foundation to go on smoothly and not look cakey. There is a fragrance to the cream but I didn't feel it was overwhelming as some have said I thought it was a nice clean fragrance. All in all its a good everyday face cream for all skin types. ** I received this product in return for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. This is my least favorite of the four products I received. I would smooth it on and about 20 minutes later attempt to put my makeup on for the day. I would find it left a build up and would need to wash may face again. I attempted to use less but unfortunately the results are the same. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this full product line from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I love the way this feels on my skin. It is velvety and light. It makes my face feel smoother immediately and the scent is nice. I don't know how helpful it will be long-term but I plan to keep using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used to Revitalift system for 4 weeks. Did it change my life, no. I will say that it left my face feeling nice. Hydrated but not greasy. My biggest complain is that it does not contain SPF. I was given this product complimentary to test and review, but it may have caused this department store product user to switch things up!"
The daily moisturizer that I got free for testing purpose got my attention. I used daily following a several step process that includes other L'oReal products and my skin feels healthy. Thanks to Influenster and LoReal my skin is feeling happy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a free sample from Influenster to try and review so the opinions are my own. I was concerned this product would dry out my skin as most anti aging products do, but this did not dry me out. It went on smooth and absorbed into my skin easily. I love the smell although it might be to strong for some. This helped to improve the appearance of my skin and helped to reduce eye puffiness but leave my face looking full and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This day cream is awesome! I use it daily prior to applying my makeup. Love that this does not leave my oily skin feeling even more greasy. It moisturizes well and leaves my skin feeling soft. I re eived this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes! All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Got this product to try out from Influenster and thought it was a decent moisturizer. It left my skin feeling smooth and went well under makeup. I just wished it had SPF in it, so I wouldn't have to apply another product with SPF before applying makeup. Left the skin feeling hydrated as well, but it was too fragrant. Thanks for letting me try this, Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This day time moisturizer is amazing it's not greasy goes on smooth makes your skin look fresh and new once you put it in it absorbs into the skin quick there's no harsh smell it's light and pretty I love it works great makes my skin look great with makeup over it.

I've enjoyed testing the LOreal Revitalift Volume products but this daily cream has been wonderful. My winter skin if very dry and this creamy but lightweight moisturizer is a skin saver. Pleasant fragrance a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Revitalift Volume filler for about 5 weeks now. I am very happy with this product. While I haven't seen any miracles (darn it), this is a nice lightweight day cream that makes my skin feel good. I have read some complaints about the scent, but I like it a lot. It is light and pleasant. I received this product from Influenster, but I would buy it again on m own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It is not greasy and it absorbs really quickly. It smells great and it a fantastic moisturizer.

"I received the L'OREAL RevitaLift Day Cream as free sample from Influenster recently. I wasn't able to use it myself so I gave it to my sis and she absolutely loved it. She told me that while she liked all the product between the day and night cream she really preferred the day cream.

Love love loved this! Living in an area that has all 4 seasons my skin dries out from time to time. I started using this right in the middle of winter and haven't had a regret. It may feel a little greasy at first but not after I rubbed it in. I did receive this product for free but that has no weight on my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't love or hate this cream. It has a nice texture, but I dislike jar packaging because I feel like it's unsanitary as opposed to a squeeze tube. It was somewhat hydrating and I would continue to use it for hands/chest but I want something more hydrating for my face. (I received this product for free for testing/review.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great moisturizer, but I didn't find that it did anything for anti-aging. I used it for a month, but didn't see any noticeable differences. The smell is light and fragrant. I am very sensitive to smells and this did not bother me at all. I had no irritation from this product. I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.

"This moisturizer is impressive. It instantly refreshes my skin, smells great and is perfect for my sensitive skin (yay). I would highly reccommend this product. I did receive this product as a part of a promotional sample from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am absolutely enjoying using this day cream. I use it before I put on my makeup. I love the it feels smooth, and not heavy. It also makes my skin feels soft. It's goes on so smooth.

This product was by far my favorite of all even though I loved them all this product worked so much quicker my skin felt more firmer and it left a all around fullness to my skin I used this before my makeup routine and it was a definite WOW!!!!! thanks to Influenster I got to try this amazing product for free for my honest opinion!!!

"I received this free from influenster just in time because I was about to go purchase some type of anti-aging lotion. This stuff is so so good, love the smell and the feel. It makes my face feel so soft and refreshed. I have noticed the wrinkles are less as well but the feeling of it on my skin is the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from Influenster and was so happy to try it. I found the results were noticeable after just a few days. Not that I have very many lines, but the lines I have are there, laugh lines, and crows feet. I found them less visible after about a week of using the L'Oreal Revitalift. This moisturizer is great for daily use, as it absorbs right into the skin, and does not leave your skin oily. Thanks again for the opportunity Influenster, for the free FULL SIZE product.

"I love the way this makes my skin feel. Fuller, younger and so soft! My forhead wrinkles have diminished and makeup is going on much smoother. I received this product free to try and I couldn't be happier! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in my influenster vox box and to be honest at first I didn't like it. I kept using it to see if the benefits were really there. I couldn't take the smell at first I am scent sensitive. The way my skin felt afterwards was definitely worth the smell. I use it before my makeup routine so the smell quickly goes away.

My new favorite! It is amazing and will make your skin feel and look amazing! * I received this product at no charge in order to test and give an honest review. This in no way influenced my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great daily moisturizer, but there are two problems with it. First, I believe that all pot-type of containers are unhygienic because you constantly dip your fingers into it. Second, it behaves poorly with my other products because it seems to ball up and rub off instead of sinking in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received free from influenster this daily cream is very moisturizing too moisturizing for my skin I have oily tzone and tend to breakout around jaw area which made my breakouts worse it does smell really good and I think it would be better for someone with normal to dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't think this really had any effect on my fine lines. It's VERY thick and quite heavy for day use. It also has a very strong odor. I got this for free to try from Influenster but I wouldn't purchase it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is everything I was hoping it would be and more. It really helped my skin to feel fuller and more hydrated. Also within a week I noticed the fine lines on my face starting to look less deep and way less noticeable. Also one of my favorite things is the way this feels so smooth on application. This was sent to me for review through influenster but my review is 100% satisfaction! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product wasn't for me. I didn't notice anything worth my time to use for longer than a couple weeks. It's just a weird consistency that isn't satisfying. Not very hydrating or face volumozing. I received this for free to reveiw, I would never purchase with my own money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy this entire line. This product delivers on all day moisturizer for my mostly dry skin. The scent is somewhat stronger than I prefer, but is pleasant. Since using this, my husband comments daily on my appearance- that's worth a repeat customer! Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to try this product for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a little over a month now and really like the way it feels on my face. It is not too heavy and goes on very smooth. I can tell a difference in the way it makes my skin feel. It does help smooth out lines in my face and isn't oily feeling. I received the L'Or√©al Paris kit for free from Influenster to test and see what I thought of it. So far am loving all the products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Nothing but rave reviews from me. I could not be happier with the way my face is now. I look younger my skin is more supple, smooth and vibrant. Turning 50 never looked so good. I am getting complements from friends and family. I am already purchasing the whole line of Revitalift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was pretty amazing, especially for the price. Within days I noticed a difference in my skin. It was far more luminous and dare I say supple? It was bizarre! My only qualm was that it flaked whenever I put any type of make up over it. I received this free as a trial and am happy I did. I'll certainly pick it up again, but until L'Oreal uses all organic and natural ingredients I will stick with my usual brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OMG!!! I love this L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Volume Filler DAY CREAM !! It's light weight feeling, I wear this under my makeup daily. It's definitely working on hydrating my skin. I love the scent, it's a light fresh scent. I let the day cream soak in about 5 minutes or so before I put my makeup on and it is lovely! Definitely a product I would continue to use. Thank you Influenster for sending this for my review! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The day cream was very greasy and it caused my sensitive skin to break out around the chin and forehead. I love the other RevitaLift products, so I was disappointed that the Day Cream was heavier than the Night Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this day cream complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. This is probably my favorite item from this line of products. It goes on smooth and does not leave my face feeling greasy. I have now replaced my daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream leaves my face feeling amazing! It's light and doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin! I can barely tell I'm wearing it! Not only does it feel great, my skin looks great too! Thanks Loreal and influenster for another great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I do enjoy the day cream. I have been using it for about a month and notice a slight plumping of my fine forehead lines. On my oily/combo skin it is a little sticky. I do honestly have moisturizers I reach for more because of this reason. Under makeup it leaves my skin a little sticky. I will wear it at home though when I am not wearing any makeup. I received this product for free for reviewing purposes through Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster and I absolutely love it! I have been using all creams consistently for 3 weeks now and I have noticed a visible difference in my skin texture. It hasn't dried me out and the moisture lasts all day long! This specific cream left me a little greasy however [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Scent is wonderful; not too overpowering, but just enough to lift your spirits when applying. I found it to be a tad too greasy as I was applying powder foundation afterwards, but during the time I was using it exclusively, it kept me hydrated and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After 4 weeks of using this line of Volume Filler products, I can see a difference in the smoothness of my skin. I agree with the comments that the product has a scent, but I don't find it to be too much. It doesn't linger and is pleasant. My skin certainly seems more hydrated and full. I received this product as a part of an Influenster VoxBox but I would certainly purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this to try and review from Influenster! I like this as a day cream because it moisturizes and helps tighten skin. You'll enjoy this product if you're looking for something with added oomph. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free for testing & review purposes and I'm glad I did! So far this line has been amazing! I use the Revitalift cleansing face wash and then this moisturizer! Not a strong smell at all! My face is soft, and ortected from the sun and I notice with everyday use improvements on fine lines on my forehead and cheeks. Another great product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't get enough of this daily cream. I love it! It is a great moisturizer. After using it for four weeks, my skin feels younger. I wish it had SPF blended in. Overall, it's a great product. I received this product for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to really like this moisturizer. It felt good going on, but it was just way too heavy for my skin. I was using it in conjunction with their serum and together it was too much for my skin. When I used the moisturizer on its own it was slightly better, but still a little too heavy for me personally. I really liked the volume filler serum though, so I will continue to use that with my regular moisturizer. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I purchased 2 of your products, age perfect day cream along with the night cream. I used your product religiously for the last 4 months and have not noticed any difference. I am quite disappointed with statements made regarding anti sagging and anti age spot hydrating. I have noticed no change in my age spots or sagging no noticeable difference in firming as well."
"I thought the product was good, but the smell of the product was very strong. I prefer something unscented when using a product on my face. I liked the moisture provided but didn't notice a huge change in my wrinkles. I did receive this product to try for free from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the texture and the moisture this gives my skin. The part I really struggle with us how scented it is. It's too heavy of a smell for a face cream. I was sent this product as a sample to review with my honest opinion. If you don't mind scents in your products you will love this product. It preformed well. I just am sensitive to strong scents. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's a lightweight non-greasy moisturizer that has a nice light fragrance. In just a few short weeks my skin appears fuller and has a smooth texture. My lines and wrinkles are less visible. My skin is firmer and crow's feet are significantly reduced. I highly recommend this product and I will purchase this product in the future. I received this product free for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for a few weeks now. It has a mild pleasant smell. It leaves skin feeling moisturized and soft. Unfortunately, I see no improvement in my fine lines or wrinkles. I will continue using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great moisturizer, especially if you have dry skin like me. It seems to create a barrier of moisture on the skin, and it makes the skin feel so smooth. I applied foundation on top of it (as normal people do) and it glided across the skin as if a primer had been applied. It makes the skin look healthy and luminous, but not oily. I really love it!! I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed how thick and creamy this moisturizer is. As with the other products in this wine, a little goes a long way. Product in the amount of the size of a nickel can cover my entire face and neck. However, I don't see this product being any more special than some of the other moisturizers I use. I would rather pay less money for a product that's just as good. I did receive this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't sure of what to do with this. Mine came in a different type of container that was hard to squirt out. I think it worked okay but didn't see a difference in my skin when I had it on. It felt nice going on though. I got to try it for free from Influenster and VoxBox. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great day cream! Love the consistency as it is thick enough so you don't really need to apply so much and it leaves my skin feeling soft & smooth. It has a nice scent that my husband says reminds him of a high-end men's cologne. I think it smells fresh & clean! My skin stays moisturized all day. No dry patches! I received this complimentary & the opinions shared are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this day cream. It works so well and not only does it help diminish my wrinkles it also keeps my my face moisturized all day without making it greasy. I don't noticed a strong smell like other reviewers in fact I think its a light pleasant scent. I received this product for free from Influenster for review purposes but these are my own honest and truthful opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have really dry skin and this product makes mine soft and without any breakouts. I love the smell and texture of this product!!!I received this product and a few others to try out and I must say they are wonderful!!!! When I have finished using this tube I will BE buying more!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this moisturizer. Its lightweight and does the job. It also sits well under makeup and has not caused any breakouts. I just wish this day cream included some form of SPF. I normally get moisturizers that include SPF to have one less step. But I am glad that I received this line for free. I will be repurchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the texture of this moisturizer. It feels thick and soft, without being overly rich or greasy. My skin is a combination of dry & oily and this does not exacerbate my oil at all. I like how it absorbs into my skin quickly and doesn't make me feel like it's caked on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. It works well for me to wear at night and seems to really be helping my whole face after just 3 weeks. The only reason I give it a 4 is because it smells a little bit. I wish it was fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to admit that this is one of my favorite parts of my morning routine. This cream not only smells good but it really works, I've been using it for almost a month and my skin feels and looks really soft. I will continue to use this product and definitely recommend it. I got this product for free as part of a reviewing campaign. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a very nice day cream. I will say though if you don't like a fragranced moisturizer you won't care for this. While it's not a super strong scent it is quite floral. It does reduce the look of my fine lines and wrinkles and does give my face a plumper look and firmer feel. It also makes my face feel like velvet and my makeup applies like a dream over it. Thank you to Influenster and L'Oreal for sending me this product to test and review honestly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Container: cute and classic, but not as easy to get the cream out as the night cream tube. Scent: just like the night cream, this smell is a bit overwhelming to me. I prefer a lighter scent. Result: My skin is oily, and when I put it on my face i feel even more oily.. My acne actually hurts when I put it on.. I'm guessing this isn't really good for oily skin type. [Product received from Influenster for testing purpose] [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love this loreal revitalift volume filler moisturizer! I have never used a moisturizing cream that made my face feel so wonderful and to see quite the difference in the tightness and moisture in my face is amazing!

I received this in my Voxbox from Influenster to try and review. I LOVE the feel of it on my face. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and can tell my lines have started to ease. I will definately continue to use this product line!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer is great at moisturizing my dry skin during the harsh winter weather. The only issue is that the Moisturizer does not soak into my skin well. Even waiting 20 minutes after putting it on, my skin still feels oily when trying to put on my powder foundation. I received this product for free from Influenster and L'Oreal Paris in exchange for reviewing it and all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got sent this product for testing and I must say that I really like it. It's hydrating and made my face so smooth. I have good skin anyways but I saw the difference. My face just looked so fresh and well rested. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I get very dry skin especially during the winter and this stuff is great. I can actually feel it penetrating deep into my skin to moisturize and heal my skin. It's great. I was worried it would be too heavy but it is not. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth soft. I freaking love it! *Thanks L'Oreal for sending me this product to test through the #influenster program and then write my honest feedback about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the way this cream smells. It has a light clean scent. It goes on smooth. Its great to wear under makeup when I want a dewy look, not so much when I'm going for a matte face. I don't think I would rebuy it for that price, maybe if it was cheaper. I received this product for free from influenster for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for about 3 weeks now. I think it makes my skin feel softer and smoother. The scent isn't too strong like some lotions. I also like that it hasn't made me break out, my skin can be sensitive to some products. I don't know if it really helps with fine lines or not, maybe I need to use it longer to find out. Over all I like that it makes my skin feel smoother and not so dry. I received this product free to test from influenster and all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, this product irritates my skin. I'm not sure if it's the strong fragrance or one of the ingredients but I started breaking out in small bumps all over my cheeks after using this for a few days. I tried giving my skin a break and only using this a few times a week. However, even that didn't help. Every time I would use this, I'd end up with bumps. I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review"
I received this product free from Influenster to try and review. I was reluctant as I have very oily yet aging skin. I was happily surprised to find that it wasn't overly heavy and did not cause any breakouts! It actually made my skin smoother and seemed to lessen some scars and wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this product before using I had really dry dull skin I can feel that I was losing volume to my skin it felt rugged now my skin seems bright and fresh I feel the softness almost like baby skin I have a tightness to my face again and it helped with my dull complexion I highly reccomand this product for anyone looking for fresh younger looking skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Volume Filler for about a month. It's a pretty good moisturizer, but it has a very strong perfume smell. I will not be purchasing this product. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. #AskSkinExpert, #Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this for free to sample. I have fairly dry skin or at least it can get there quickly without a good moisturizer. While I do really like this product it is maybe a little too light for me. The fragrance is nice and not over powering. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave you skin greasy. Would purchase as it is a nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little goes a long way! Absolutely love the way this moisturizer feels. Smooth and silky. I am seeing results now being using this for approx 2 1/2 weeks. I received this free for testing purposes. Thanks L'Oreal and Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What a great, creamy, moisturizing daily moisturizer! I absolutely love how this lotion feels on my face! It moisturizes completely, no dry spots where I need to reapply. It releases the tightness I feel in several facial areas - lips, eyes, forehead. I have to say this entire volume filler line is working together to help smooth out my skin and keep it hydrated! I received this product complimentary in exchange for using it and providing my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I use this, in conjunction with the other Revitalift products, and have seen a noticeable difference in the softness and firmness of my skin. I have been using it morning and night for about 3 weeks. It smells sooooooo great. The container that it comes in is of a very high quality. I received this product for free as part of a reviewing campaign. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love l'oreal products. I started using the volume filler moisturizer (two weeks ago) what I like the most is that the cream penetrates pretty quick into my skin, leaving it soft, it doesn't irritate my skin, I gave four stars because the scent is too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love this day cream! I have acne and those treatments tend to really dry my skin out which is not good for makeup because you get flaky! This cream is just heavy enough to battle the flakiness, keep me moisturized, but it does not make me oily! I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now. I really like this moisturizer a lot! It hasa slight scent that i do not mind & leaves my skin soft, smooth, and vibrant. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. I have seen a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and forehead. I would definitely recommend this product. I received this product free in exchange for testing and my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Revitalift collection for free to review from Influenster and any opinion given is that of my own. I love the packaging. I didn't think it did anything to my fine line and wrinkles but it did give my face a glow and my face feels firmer. The moisturizer was amazing. I loved applying this and bought more. I put it on before my makeup and it helps keep my fave feeling fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am using four of the products from this line right now and this is my least favorite. It isn't awful, but it doesn't really do much to improve tone, and seems to clog my pores. I love love love the night cream, but I think I'll go back to Belif for day time. It takes awhile to absorb and feels a bit tacky for longer than I prefer. * I received this product for free via Influenster. They have not paid me or influenced my review. * [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this day cream for a few weeks now and I really like it. It's very moisturizing and makeup ties on just fine without a primer. I have not noticed any difference in lines, wrinkles, contours, etc, but I will use it again just for the moisturizing properties. As fir the scent: I like the smell...I can be sensitive to some scents, but this one smells fine and doesn't give me a headache like more perfumey creams. I was sent this product for free to provide an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complementary for testing purposes along with three other Revitalift products. I have sensitive skin so I started using them in a sequential order in case I had a reaction (which thankfully, didn't happen). I saw notable results from using the eye and face serums, however I didn't see any specific improvement that I can attribute to this product. I like it but it is a little too thick for daily use and I don't plan on buying more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just turned 31 this week and thought that I needed to take better care of my skin. I this this product to try and I have to tell you that it works. I really like this product because it makes my skin very soft and hydrated. I feel that after using it for a week it has improved my skin, making it feel more reinvigorated and young. The only pro for me is the smell which I think is too strong. I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pros: I have been using the daily volumizing moisturizer for three weeks now. I do notice that my skin is much more moisturized and smooth. A little bit goes a VERY long way. Cons: No SPF. For the product to be relatively thick, I don't want to apply anything else with it, so I was worried about sun protection. I received this product for free to test and provide feedback to the manufacturer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'OR√âAL Revitalift Volume Filler Moisturizer is a white cream that smells clean & absorbs quickly. I am not a fan of this day cream since it is in a jar format & dries to a texture that feels powdery even though it initially feels like a thicker cream. This is just not hydrating enough for the winter months where I live. This is my least favorite L'OR√âAL Revitalift product I have tried thus far. *I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.
"During the day, my skin has a tendency of getting really dry, however, since I been using the Revitalift Daily moisturizer, it has not happen. My skin feels hydrated through the day and soft. The smell is very soothing and my skin doesn't get irritated at all. I wear first the serum of the same line, then this moisturizer and last but not least, sunscreen. I received this item from @Influenster free of charge for testing purposes."

I received this product for FREE from IINFLUENSTER and I never realized how dry my skin was until using this.....it definitely made my face smoother and softer to the touch.

I am a fan and will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product acts like a moisturizing primer. It goes on and feels soft and light and leaves your skin feeling very soft & make up ready. It has a pleasant scent that I appreciate. As for the volume filler qualities, I can't really speak to them as my skin is fairly voluminous as it is. I think for a $20-ish cream, this is worth it's cost.

"This is a good moisturizer, but the smell is a little overwhelming and too floral for my liking. I also wish it would have spf in it, as this is supposed to be for daytime wear. Other than that, it keeps the skin moist, but isn't over oily. And I did see an improvement in my developing crows feet when using the whole regimen. I wouldn't purchase it again, only because the smell is too overwhelming for me. DISCLAIMER: I received this product free of charge, for testing purooses.

I received this product from Influenster free in exchange for my honest review. I find that this cream is very thick and easily absorbs. It leaves my face feeling very soft and moisturized.

"Daily Moisturizer is amazing, my skin is softer and firmer, can tell difference above eyes and around. Will continue longer, because I know wrinkles didn't appear on my face in a week, so it will obviously take longer to firm all of them. So happy I got picked to try and review this product and can't stop bragging to my friends and family. #AskSkinExpert [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before using this moisturizer my face was very dry especially my forehead. I have been applying it as recommended, it's been two weeks and I already can see the difference. My face always is moistures without feeling greasy or oily. The small lines on my forehead are less visible and I look well rested. I was given the line of Revitalift to test for free and will be purchasing 3 of the 4 creams that were complimentary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product. I received it complimentary for testing and was greatly surprised by it. I usually buy mostly higher end products. This keeps my skin moisturizers throughout the day. It also sits under makeup well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I usedon't several high end moisture all none of them preformed the way this product did. I have dry dark spotside around my chin area. When applying make over the area would only make it worse. But by using this product I noticed softer, smoother, brighter,firmer, moisturize skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What I like most about this moisterizer is that it has a more serum/primer/silky feel rather than the creamy consistency of most moisturizers. It doesn't take long to sink in and leaves my skin looking matte. It has definitely helped my dryness and has softened some of my wrinkles. **I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.

"This is a really, really heavy moisturizer and has a very white, conditioner-like consistency. I needed a very, very small amount to apply to my face. It has a very strong scent. I would be wary of using too much as I think it's so heavy it almost feels like frosting! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
after using this for around 10 days I have noticed a difference on my face! I use it every morning with the serum and eye cream and It has made my skin look much healthier and beautiful.

"I received this product compliments of @influenster to try this day cream. I like the consistency of the lotion, to apply all you need is a fingertip of lotion to cover your whole face and the scent smells great. I do not believe this day moisturizer has spf protection though. I have seen a difference in my face by using everyday. My skin seems much smoother and my makeup seems easier to apply. The moisturizer definitely helps in the harsh elements of winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a sample from Influenster and I like the product. The smell is great and the feel as well. My skin is looking great.

I received this product for free for purpose of review. These thoughts are my own. I have only been using this product for less than 2 weeks and I must say I am surprised! My once deep wrinkles are getting more minimal daily! Goes on so smoothly and really makes my skin feel so soft and supple. I am loving this product! Can't wait to see the overall difference after using it for a month!! I highly recommend trying this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the product and it does make the skin look fuller and more youthful, but I can't get over the way it balls up and peels. It did this to me when I used it at night and during the day. Not a good look, especially under makeup. I received this as a free sample to try and review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is so bipolar, its dry then its not. I am happy this product keeps moisture in my skin (unlike many other products I have tried) but isnt too greasy. Other products usually dont hold moisture very long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This daily moisturizer is great! When I first opened the jar, it was very heavy, with super-nice packaging. Then, I opened it up and fell in love with the smell! Then, in using this moisturizer, I put quite a bit on my face and neck because it is so thick and creamy. But, it doesn't feel greasy or oily and absorbs very quickly. I have noticed a major decrease in my dry skin and a small reduction in my wrinkles. I did receive this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't care for this product because it rolls up on my face and looked like my face was peeling. I really wish I could have used this everyday, but it was embarrassing to walk around with all those white fakes on my skin, and it fell all over my shirt as well making me look like I had severe dandruff. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is definitely going to be my go to day moisturizer. I notices results after first use. My skin was noticeably softer and smoother. This lasts throughout the day. After about a week of use, I'm noticing my fine lines are less visible. The skin under my eyes is formed and less dark. I love the Revitalift products! Influenster sent me this product complimentary to test and review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I got these products complimentary for testing purposes. I'm surprises that the quality is so similar to Lancome brand. It smells nice and the package looks fancy like a high end product but you just pay drug store price. You see results the next day. I'm very satisfied with this product. #AskSkinExpert [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Just the right amount of moisture without being to greasy and causing breakouts! In combination with other Revitalift products, I really feel like my skin is looking so much better! I hope to continue to see even more improvement over time. I received this product free, to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like that this is thin enough on my skin that it doesn't feel like a goopy extra on my skin throughout the day. It firms up my skin, but I by no means think it'd do much for major lines. Thankfully I don't have to worry about those yet. I received this product for testing and unbiased evaluation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I notice as I have gotten older my skin was starting to look dull and dry. This product adds moisture and life to my skin and makes those fine lines more tolerable by reducing their visibility.

I've been using this twice a day morning and night all over my face and love my results. My face becomes so hydrated once I apply this daily volumizing moisturizer that my skin look plump and feels so soft and smooth. Yet my skin does not feel or look greasy at all.

I would definitely recommend this product and all the revitalift products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a lovely day cream. In general, moisturizers shouldn't be in jars because they lose their effectiveness. But I've been using about 2.5 weeks and appears to be effective. I received this day cream to review from Influenster but all opinions are my own. One star removed because this brand is not cruelty-free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is probably my favorite face lotion I've ever used. It goes on thick, but doesn't feel greasy at all. It makes my skin feel very soft after using it, and my husband really likes the smell. Didn't noticeable reduce wrinkles, which is why I give it only 4 stars, but my fine lines seem to be a little less noticeable after a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free jar of this from influenster and I am so glad that I did! This lotion makes my face feel so soft and fresh. It moisturizes so well and doesn't feel oily.

"Creamy, creamy goodness! Helllllooooo hyaluronic acid! Where have you been all my (adult life?) I can honestly say that it does exactly what it says it's going to do. I've had a few friends ask me if I've had botox or fillers!!!!!!!! I received this product in exchange for my honest review....and when it's empty, I'm buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this cream but only gave it 4 stars because I dislike the smell. I am very sensitive to smells and this one has a perfume-like smell that gives me a headache. It is sad because the lotion itself is wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this product. I don't have a ton of wrinkles, but I totally see a difference. My skin is softer and fuller and feels as though its baby smooth. It smells great and I usually do it right before bed. I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This Revitalift moisturizer is great! I have been using it for a few weeks now and have seen great results. It has definitely reduced the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes.

This product surprised me. It works to minimize my deep marionette lines. This line does what all the high end products that I have use did not do. My fine lines r almost gone. U have to look extremely close to see a very tiny line. My skin looks plump and fresher since I started using this product. Great anti aging line. I received this product as part of a promotion.

"I received this product from Influenster. It was complimentary for testing purposes. Comes in a nice jar. The consistency is on the thicker side but not as thick as I would expect. Goes on fairly smoothly and isn't perfumey in smell. I use this as step three of my morning routine, after I apply the L'Oreal eye and face serums. Wish the product had sunscreen!

"I received the product free for testing and review purposes from Influenster in the L'Or√©al Revitalift VoxBox. This product is amazing in every way possible.

I received a free #RevitaliftVolumeFiller regime for testing purposes compliments of #Influenster 2weeks ago. The day creme smells lovely and nourishes my dry skin. It was just what the Dr. ordered since the cold weather has been rough on my skin. So far so good! #AskSkinExpert #LorealParis [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really into this moisturizer right now! It smells great and after only 2-3 uses I can feel my skin is softer (I am using other Revitalift products too) So I'm really excited to keep using it and see the results! I received this in the L'Oreal VoxBox from Influenster and it came almost 2 days after I ran out of my old moisturizer--perfect timing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product and compliments the other items in the Revitalift series well! I have dry, dull skin and after one week of use I already noticed slight improvement - my skin looked more refreshed! I also recommend using a small amount as I used a little too much at first which caused my skin to feel oily and the lotion would roll together and flake off during the day. Otherwise great product! *I received this complimentary for testing purposes . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It really go beyond lines and wrinkles and helps in replenishing skin's volume. The results can be seen just after applying first time. I am just loving this product. Makes my skin softer and softer after each use. So light to apply and non-sticky. Works even more better if applied after concentrated Serum. I got this product complimentary from influenster to try.

"The L'Or√©al Revitalift Volume Filler was sent to me by influenster to try and review. I was so happy to receive this box and start using the products immediately! It has a nice feel to it and absorbs super quick. After use I've noticed that my very fine lines are filling in nicely and look less noticeable. Long term solution? Probably not unless I continue to use the products everyday, twice a day. I received these for free from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. It is thick but not greasy and I've been using it for a bit over a week with no breakouts. Many other moisturizers cause breakouts along my t-zone and cheek bones. I don't need to wear as much foundation as this product smooths my skin and adds a great base when I am layering. The only downside is a light perfume smell - I prefer my product so to be fragrance fee - but that is me. I received this product complimentary to test and review.

"I received the cream for Free from Influenster for testing purposes. I have been using the product for the past 2 weeks. I like the smell of the cream, but for my kind of skin is a little bit to light, I need a little bit more to mosturize my face since I have super dry skin but so far I like it. Since it absord super quick, I just add a little bit extra and it feels good, soft and it helps to fill the small nightmare spots on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I will continue to use this! You should too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is one of the best things in the entire Revitalift line. It comes in a medium sized lotion pot. I rubbed it into my skin all over, over the area where I applied the eye cream and the areas where I applied the serum. It leaves my skin so moisturized which I really need during the winter months. It battles my dry, red skin so well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft. I would say that this product and the over-night lotion are the only things worth the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my first free product since joining Influenster. I like the product but the smell is a little much for me.

"I received a free sample of this from Influenster. I like the smell of the lotion, it is light, not overpowering. The lotion works well and spreads easily. However, it feels a little heavy for a daily moisturizer, and the heaviness made applying makeup difficult. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Influenster sent me this full size product to test and I love this! I apply it every morning and evening. I have been using this line for 2 weeks now and I have seen changes in my fine lines and wrinkles and I'm seeing some fullness back in my face. They say real results in 4 weeks so I will be using this until it's gone for maximum results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've been using this product for a while now and I really, really like it. My skin looks great and I always look more refreshed, which makes me look younger. My only issue with this product is that it is a little harsh on my sensitive skin. Because it is not dye-free / scent-free, I have to use it sparingly and alternate nights of use so I don't end up covered in break-outs. Even with that, I still have great results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Revitalift Daily night cream from Influenster to test and review and i absolutely love this product! I mean I just got this product and I could already see the difference.

"I received the L'Oreal Revitalift line to review from Influenster. This product has good ingredients. It does its job. However, it is not comfortable to apply or wear. It has a medical scent and does not apply smoothly. It is also heavier than I would like for my oily skin. I have other products that show similar results, contain the same key ingredients, but do not have the issues this does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Smiley360 for review purposes. My opinions are 100% my own.

"Revitalift‚Ñ¢ Volume Filler Daily Re-Volumizing Moisturizer will most certainly become a part of my daily beauty regimen. I was thrilled with the way it filled in my lines and gave me a fuller look overall, and I haven't found a moisturizer at a similar price point that hydrates as well as Revitalift‚Ñ¢ Volume Filler Daily Re-Volumizing Moisturizer. I loved that my face didn't feel dry mid-afternoon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer looks thick but doesn't feel heavy on the skin. The scent is pleasant and not irritating. My skins drinks this up and it leaves my face soft, hydrated, and with a bit of a glow.

"The L'Or√©al Revitalift products are simple to use and should be applied in the morning and then again in the evening. After using a cleanser on my face, I apply the Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum followed by the Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Moisturizer. The products both have a very pleasant scent and I feel an immediate difference in my skin after application. I not only feel the moisture in my skin now, but you can actually see that it holds more moisture too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

LOreal is one brand I know and trust. Revitalift has not let me down! I appreciate that the concentrated serum did not leave my skin feeing greasy but did exactly as promised. The only thing I did not like is that I could not see how much was left. I ran out before I knew it and had to go without before I went to the store.

"I was not impressed with this item. I did not feel as if it delivered the results that were promised. The smell was nice, the consistency of the product was nice, but I did not notice a major difference in my skin at the end of 4 weeks use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product for several weeks and noticed an improvement in my forehead lines and frown lines. It goes on smoothly and does not feel greasy or sticky. It moves with your face rather than feeling stiff and crusty. I think the fragrance is not too strong and it's not unpleasant. I would recommend the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a huge skeptic when I received this product. However, I have to admit that I did see results after about 2 weeks, especially around my eyes. The perfume smell was a little heavy for me, but it left my skin much softer than other products I have tried and did have a noticeable effect on my wrinkles over time. I also noticed that I had to use less makeup and it lasted much longer because the cream also seemed to act as a primer on my skin (win/win). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the l'oreal Revitalift Volume Filler I got from SheSpeaks. I have used it all and ready to buy some, thats how well it worked.

"The serum was so easy to apply, just a little dab is all it takes. After using it for about 2 weeks, I noticed more volume in my face. It did cause me to breakout a little, that's the only negative. I would recommend to anyone who is aging [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. It's very light, easily absorbed, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and looking the same.

"I found that the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum felt wonderful on my skin, it had a nice soft scent, no burning or stinging. Just lots of moisture. My skin plumped and in 2 weeks I did see a very slight difference in some fine lines, but I think that with a longer time to use this, I would begin to see more changes. I would recommend this product to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. While I di not see improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, I did notice more volume. this was especially true in the area under my eyes. I also felt like my face was very moistured. Overall, I am very happy with the products and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer worked great. It made my skin feel soft, smooth and hydrated. I wasn't really a fan of the scent. I don't like putting perfume scents on my face. It has a nice texture and absorbed really well without any greasy residue. My face felt nice and smooth all day. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. After about 1 week or 10 days, I noticed the fine lines around my eyes were filling in and plumping up. I also noticed a difference in the smile lines I have by nose and mouth. Thank you for allowing me to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the L'Oreal Revitalift Serum for several days, my face had a more youthful and smooth appearance. It absorbed quickly and my face felt moist while wearing it. It was very easy to apply makeup over the serum and it was easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum went on easily and absorbed quickly leaving my skin feeling smooth not greasy. I noticed a relatively quick tightening affect around the eye area with in minutes the puffyness i wake up with was gone. I found the applicator easy to use but no way to rally tell how much is left. Would definitely purchase would like to try combined with the other related products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Volumizing Moisturizer. Almost immediately after the first use, my skin felt so much more hydrated. I have extremely dry skin and Revitalift is wonderful. I love the thick richness of the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really really liked this lotion. While I'm not sure the ""volume filler"" was the perfect match for me, I did find the lotion to be really nice in regards to texture and moisturizing. I found that my make up went on incredibly smoothly. I'm now interested to stop using it for a short bit to see if I notice any more difference in lines, etc that the volume filler may have been helping. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed the opportunity to try the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Moisturizer. I was very surprised at how soon I noticed some of the fine lines on my face diminish. I have VERY oily facial skin and this product did not help with shine I experience, so I only used it at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Revitalift serum! It is a product that actually WORKS!! After just a few weeks of using it, I noticed that the lines around my mouth and eyes were visibly less noticeable! The serum absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy film, just nice soft skin. I will be definitely be trying more products in the line plus getting another tube of the serum!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first time I used this product my skin looked healthy and dewy.After using it for a few weeks I could see an improvement in texture and my skin looked more plump.My wrinkles are still there but less noticeable because my skin looks so good.The only thing I did not like was the packaging I thought it was a little clumsy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Revitalift volumizing lotion worked for me in about two weeks. I used it twice a day, and the pleasant scent and non-greasy texture worked well as a moisturizer under my make-up. I'm in the sun a lot, so I have developed fine lines around my eyes and mouth. After two weeks these lines began to soften and diminish. I will definitely continue to use this as a part of my daily beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was just okay. The serum felt nice on my face and absorbed quickly. I'm just not sure if it really made a big difference. Maybe I need to use it for a longer time? I really liked the packaging and thought it was easy to apply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I RECIEVED A FULL SIZE SAMPLE OF L'OREAL REVITALIFT IT WORKS BETTER THEN ALL THE OTHER FILLERS I HAVE TRYED AND PLUMPED UP MY SKIN AND UNDER THE EYES HAVE FILLED RIGHT IN ALSO THX SO MUCH WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product, it is very easy to apply. It does not feel greasy nor leave your skin feeling tacky. I did not notice as much of a change around my mouth (fine smile lines) but I did see a noticeable difference around my eyes. My skin looks fuller, more hydrated. No more fine little lines that give away my age. The fragrance is very nice, subtle and not overpowering. Overall I am very satisfied with this product, a good value for the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was beginning to see the changes from the Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer provided by SheSpeaks. The lines were slightly diminished and the skin a little smoother. The texture was thick, but when on the skin, it did not feel heavy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed that the wrinkles on my forehead diminishes some when I use this product. I like the way my skin feels when I put it on and it smells good not too overpowering. It also looks like it firms the skin some. I had to use it one time a day instead of 2 and every other day. It made my skin itch sometimes so I cut back on it and it helped some. Thank you for the opportunity to try this. I will definitely look into more L'Oreal Paris Revitalift products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try this since I've been noticing more fine lines on my face. Although I liked the way it felt as far as moisturizing my face, I didn't really see any improvements in the fine lines. I will, of course, continue using it, thinking that maybe it will take a little longer to work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loved this face cream! It was so thick and creamy to the touch but went on without a heavy feeling and without leaving a sticky residue. I do think that 4 weeks is probably too short of a time to see skin improvements (although my skin FELT great immediately) but I do think after almost 6 weeks in beginning to see a difference. I'll continue using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the feel of revitalift and they way my skin looks and feels when I use it. It makes it glow and look fresh. I have already planned on purchasing another jar of it. It really seems to be a great product for a great price [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed this product. It makes my skin really soft. I'm 58 years old so do have some deeper wrinkles that it didn't improve, but fine lines and skin texture are amazing. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I have gotten to try this product my skin is so much softer and feels very smooth although I have not noticed much difference in fine lines yet, I still think it is a great product! I love the creamy texture and the fragrance is papmering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Came in a very cool looking dispenser. The serum absorbed quickly which I appreciated because my face can get pretty greasy sometimes. Did not see any difference around my eyes, but I did notice that my skin looked better and felt better. My skin was softer and looked hydrated. I would like to continue with this serum, but I will add the moisturizer too. My skin gets drier in the winter so I feel I need a heavier moisturizer in the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my product quickly and was impressed with how it was dispensed. Like others, though, it would be nice to see how much I was was using. It went on very smoothly, absorbed quickly and did not make my face feel stiff. My cross feet seem to be smaller in size and my face feels great - overall, I would use this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved it, the serum absorbed well into my skin did not leave it feeling greasy but left it smooth soft and supple. My face felt and looked hydrated. I was skeptical at first but after using this product, I am sure I will be purchasing it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do not always use L'Oreal products so I was happy to try the serum. It came in a very modern type tube/canister. It was easy to use, but there was never an indication of how much I had left. I felt like I used it very quickly. It did make my face feel softer and more vibrant. Some lines seemed to have disappeared. Overall I was happy with the product and will look for the cream to try it out. Worth a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the L'oreal Revitalift Volume Filler Serum and it was just wonderful. It reduced the crows feet in the corners of my eyes dramatically. My skin had an overall softer feel to it and now that I have ran out of the product I am already noticing a big change in the texture of my facial skin. So I will be purchasing it again asap to avoid those pesky crow's feet coming back in full force and to keep my skin feeling softer and more beautiful.

Receive the product thought another moisture going to leave skin grease. Actually the loved the texture of light and smell. It gave my skin a glow and not so grease that need to wait to dry up to apply my make up. This product is fabulous and does leaves skin glow and firm. I will definitely buy and recommended it.

"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Moisturizer is a great moisturizer! I noticed a difference in my skin in a week of using it. my skin felt softer, and the lines seemed much less. my neck also was visibly improved after just 2 days. This actually does what it claims-firmer skin, plumps up and moisturizes! And for me it did work quicker than the 4 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Revitalift volume filler for about 4 weeks thanks to SheSpeaks. I am pleased with the results I am seeing thus far. I have seen a reduction in the fine lines around the eyes. I do apply it daily all over my face and neck. It does not seem to make my face feel oily or gooey. Very little of this product does go a long way and I'm very pleased. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Light serum absorbing super quick. Improved hydration over entire face. Slight improvement in skin tone evenness. Also a very slight improvement in cheekbone area fullness. No noticeable affect on fine lines. Under eye area also had no noticeable reduction in hollowness. Overall, I liked the feel of the product and the affect it had on my skin tone and cheekbone fullness. I will likely recommend it to friends who need the same benefits I experienced while using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had high hopes for this....but unfortunately something in it irritated my face:( I started itching so bad and had to stop using it...maybe I can try one of the other products for sensitive skin :) I would still recommend friends to try just because it bothered me it may be a perfect fit for them:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the feeling of this product on my skin, although I really haven't noticed any improvements in my fine lines and wrinkles. Perhaps, I need to use the product for a linger time. The applicator took a little while for me to get the hang of using, but once I figured it out it worked great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I like most about this product is the consistency and the way it immediately absorbs into my skin. The scent is also pleasant and not overpowering. The fine lines around my eyes seem to diminish after using this product. Overall, I am pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given this product to use for 4 weeks from SheSpeaks. I have enjoyed using it and have seen results in my skin feeling and looking better. My fines lines have minimized and my skin feels firmer. The only negative is how oily my skin feels after applying the cream. It does gradually soak in, but it does take a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the way this product felt on my face, but I did not notice a real improvement in the appearance of fine lines. I was looking for a non-invasive solution to small lines and wrinkles, but this did not do the trick for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It has a very pleasant fragrance and easy to use container. It's clear and goes on with ease and doesn't make your face feel greasy or feel heavy on your skin. It only takes a little bit to apply and goes a long way. My skin felt tighter and my pores seem to diminish with daily use. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family and I see myself purchasing the product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the aplicator, I could apply it easily to the areas that needed it. It soaked in quickly and didn't leave me with a sticky feeling. The smell isn't overwhelming like many products. I will definitely be purchasing this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is just wonderful. You don't need a whole lot just a few dabs on the cheeks, forehead, and chin. Just rub it in. It make my skin so soft and vibrant. My fine lines look as if they are disappearing as well. And there was no over bearing scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really wanted to like this product. I have used Revtalift red jar before and liked it. This product burned my face after showering. Even without exfoliating. It also made me breakout which I haven't had happen in years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Excellent product for sensitive skin! Not oily at all. After using this product for several weeks it did make my skin smoother. I have never used this type of product but really did like it! Would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ater using this product for 4 weeks.. I could really tell a difference, My face looked and felt younger.. I love how it felt on my face and made my face feel soo soft.. it had a slight scent to it, but didnt bother my sensitive skin. I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the Loreal Revitalift Volume Filler in my daily morning and night moisturizing routine and in two days noticed a huge difference. My wrinkles were diminished and as a Mother of three, that's all I need to know. But I will also mention how well my skin retained volume and fullness while I used this product. It is a beauty staple now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked that the product went on smooth and didn't feel heavy on my face. I didn't notice a difference but may if I give it more time. I will keep using and will update should anything change! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product! I stopped using a much more expensive department store brand during the trial period and was amazed that this product worked just as well, if not better. I did find that the fine lines around my mouth/cheeks were softened. Also moisturized beautifully without feeling too heavy or greasy. Smoothes on easily and absorbs quickly. I will definitely be using this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Excellent! I have an anti age regimen that I have used for years and have been happy but after using this I am making a switch! It got rid of a lip line that was starting and a few fine lines around my eyes. This really does work! It made my face feel smooth from the first application. It is not greasy or oily feeling and has a nice fresh scent that goes away fairly quick. Highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was really good. The only thing I don't like, and this is no exception, is the fact that all the anti-aging cremes I have used tend to have a filmy residue on your face, almost like a rubbery feeling. Again, this pertains to all anti-aging products that I have used in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the lightweightness of the Revitalift Daily Voluminizing Serum and the coolness it brought to my face every morning when I woke up and every night when I went to bed. All you needed was a few drops to hydrate your entire face. The only thing that I didn't see in the 4 weeks that the product stated was reducing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product has a nice texture and made my skin feel soft but I had to discontinue using it within the first 10 days because it made me breakout. I can not properly review the effectiveness of this product because of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how this serum feels on my face. It absorbs really quickly and my face feel smooth after applying. I also really love the scent of the serum, it isn't overpowering. I noticed some smoothing of my skin, it did make a lot of my fine lines disappear and my face looked smoother. I do wish it would do something for skin tone, but other than that I think it really is a great product, that I would definitely buy again and recommend to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After trying this product I can honestly say I don't see the need to buy the more expensive department store brands. This lotion does the job nicely, reducing fine lines while keeping the skin soft and fresh. It goes on easily, isn't a heavy cream and absorbs nicely. The scent is fresh and pleasant, not at all over powering. I haven't priced it yet but I am sure it is also less expensive than the product I currently use. Great product that I will be using in the future for certain [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the fresh clean scent of this and the consistency of it. It goes on and makes my skin feel so much more hydrated and it feels more 'plump' if that makes any sense. It keep my skin feeling soft all day and maybe just maybe my fine lines aren't as noticable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm really loving this product! I have been using it for three weeks now, and I can really see a difference in my skin already. It is smoother, softer and I don't notice my fine lines as much. I love the clean, fresh scent, and love how it feels when I put it on my skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave it feeling greasy. I really love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked how light and non greasy it felt. It had a pleasant fragrance. I didn't see improvement in the lines around my eyes or mouth, but I did see an improvement on my neck and chest. I knew I wasn't going to look 20 again, but I did hope for more on my face. Maybe the wrinkles are just that deep and using the product longer might show some improvement.....I haven't decided yet if I am going to purchase more and give it a little longer.

"i used the revitalift volume filler.it did seem to hydrate my skin, and was great to use before i applied makeup,i have told several friends who have purchased the product to try for themselves,great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have deep wrinkles yet--although I know the day is coming. However, after trying the serum, I am so impressed with what it did to my fine lines. They seemed to disappear and I could tell a difference right away. A great solution to a problem that all of us will deal with sooner or later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Daily Revolumizing Moisturizer is a great moisturizer! I've been using a brand from my dermatologist for several years, and was skeptical about trying something new from SheSpeaks. I felt like I noticed results the very next day! The scent is nice and light, and the moisturizer is creamy and provides great coverage without feeling heavy. I will definitely keep using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This amazing product made my skin luminous and fresh looking. My skin is super soft, sexy and feels wonderful. I actually glow! I haven't looked this young in years! Thank you She Speaks for giving me the chance to provide feedback. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a nice scent, absorbs quickly and does not leave a sticky or tacky feeling on the skin. Great delivery system easy to use. After 4 weeks I really didn't notice much difference in wrinkle depth but my skin does feel hydrated so I will continue to use the product until gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this product didn't come in a jar, though the delivery system was a bit awkward at first, the product is easy to dispense, and you can control how much comes out. Do I believe that this product will give me back lost volume, no, not at all. Great marketing, but lets be real. I also liked that this product didn't cause any breakouts or other unwanted reactions. Nice serum for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've enjoyed my experience with this product. The packaging is convenient, the texture light, and the scent pretty. I've used it morning and night for nearly a month, pairing it with a retinol moisturizer, and I'm noticing a slight reduction in my elevenses and laugh lines. I'll probably continue to purchase this serum and incorporate in into my skincare regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked how quickly this absorbed and how smoothly it goes on; there was no oily or greasy feeling after usage. The scent was pleasant and it was moderately hydrating to the skin. After four weeks, I haven't noticed any changes in the look of feel of my skin. I am still using the remaining cream to see if after it is gone there will be a change or not.

"I received the L'Oreal Parus Revitalift Daily Revolumizing Moisturizer from Shespeaks to try. I absolutely love this moisturizer and it is my new moisturizer! I use it in the a.m. and the p.m. after I cleanse my skin. I usually have a problem finding a moisturizer because I have oily/combination skin, but this moisturizer does not leave my skin oily at all. My skin looks so revitalized and feels amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oreal Daily Re-Volumizing Moisturizer after receiving it for free from SheSpeaks. I was initially concerned about the fragrance, but it did not irritate my sensitive skin and helped with the dry areas. It's not greasy and feels good going on. After using it for a few weeks, I haven't notice a reduction in the lines on my face but I have recommended this product as a skin moisturizer/softener.

"I received L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Moisturizer free to try and all in all, it's pretty good.

"I was excited to try this product to see the result. Although it was a nice product, I was not very impressed with the results. The serum moisturize your skin and feels smooth after application, however, I did not get visible difference after applying for 30 days. The box claims ""cheekbone fullness [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The container it comes in is gorgeous, I love seeing it on my sink each day--it looks so chic and expensive. The scent is so pretty, like a beautiful rose. It feels so silky on my fingers and my face. But do I see a big difference in smoothing out my lines? Not necessarily. My skin feels soft and moisturized so far but I feel I should use it for a couple more weeks for the full effect. Overall a great product from L'Oreal and I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very moisturizing. Since I started incorporating prescription strength Retin-A into my nightly skincare, my skin has been flaking in spots. This moisturizer is perfect to combat the dryness that my Retin-A use is causing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did notice a difference near my laugh lines and the hydrating feel of it on my skin when I applied it. I'm very particular about what I put on my face and this is a product I plan to purchase in the near future as a part of my skin care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Revitalift Daily Volume filler works so well that it actually replenishes my skin to make it look younger and more natural. It is very easy to apply on my face in the morning and in the evening.

"This is the only Loreal product that I was using before this assignment came along so I can give a review for about 6 months worth of use. In general, I like the product and definitely think that it is good for the money. I use it under my eyes and where my dimple creases are every morning. It does a good job of relieving the fine lines by adding moisture. I like the packaging, very cheeky to make it look like a hypodermic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the product! It makes my skin so smooth, and it stays moisturized all day without feeling at all greasy. I haven't noticed much improvement with the fine lines, but I still really like the product as simply a moisturizer. I would continue to purchase this.

I like the feel of it when I put it on . I also like the fragrance of it. It went on smoothly. It also gave me a cooling feeling on my skin. I have not seen any difference in the fine lines on my face but it seems to make my skin feel softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using this cream, it felt lightweight on my skin and not greasy when I applied my makeup. The fragrance was not overpowering and light. I can't say that I notice much improvement on my fine lines although I think it moisturized nicely. Will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this morning and night I have to say that while my face seemed more hydrated I didn't notice much change in the fine lines around my eyes. I'd like to have tried this with the matching moisturizer, maybe I would be seeing better results. I love the dispenser, just the right amount delivered for each use. The scent is pleasantly light to me. I plan to continue use while adding the moisturizer to my AM / PM skin care routines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Fast absorbing but very silky on the skin with no strong scent. I applied it morning and night, the applicator made is mess free and easy to store. I did see a mild difference on those thin lines I have around the eyes so I will continue using this product with my daily skin care routine. Great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I tend to have dry skin, but sometimes it can get oily in the summer months.

I really love L'Orel product and l this would be something I could use in my everyday routine. This product had a nice creamy constancy with a very nice light scent which I very much liked. I tried it for approximately 2 weeks both morning and evening. I did notice that it left my face feeling very hydrated [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This isn't the best moisturizer I've tried, and it's far from the worst. It's much more fragrant than my normal product, which took some getting used too. I liked the thick consistency of the product. It did a great job hydrating, but I didn't see a ton of difference in my fine lines. I think for me, this will be a better product once the weather turns cold and harsh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very diligent with this product. I enjoyed the applicator and application. While I did not see any real change or improvement....I would consider trying it again, along with another of the products in the line. Not certain it should be sampled as a stand alone product. Thank you for allowing me to participate. LDS10 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing! It is so silky smooth like silk! My skin loved it...i used it as directed every morning and evening and i noticed results in as little as two weeks!

"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift filler is a product I enjoy using. It does make my face feel more hydrated, however I haven't been using it for very long. I stopped using all products for a little while because my seasonal allergies were bugging me so bad that my eyelids were swelling up. I am trying to use it more often now and hope to try the other products in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer did not work for me. It caused me to break out, so I had to discontinue using it. I also did not care for the smell. Unfortunately, I was not able to use it long enough to judge its effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After 2 weeks of use, my skin was much softer and definitely more hydrated. After 4 weeks I could notice a difference in my fine lines, but not really the deeper ones. I think if I had started using this when I was younger, the improvement would have been more dramatic ( I am 53). Very good product with a thick consistency that absorbs quickly. I would recommend this product for keeping the skin hydrated and improving the finer lines you may have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this product and would recommend it. I love the way the serum is dispensed and the way it made my skin feel so soft and smooth. I did not notice any change in my wrinkles yet but I am going to continue to use this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is a little hydrating and my skin absorbed it right away. I did notice a difference in my skin. It looks smooth and glowing but my little fine lines are still there. I am hoping that I will notice more changes the more I use the serum. Overall I am happy with it and I loved the smell and the ease of use of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the texture of this cream and felt it absorbed well. The results on my skin were subtle but I did feel there was an overall improvement to my wrinkles. IMHO, the biggest drawback was the strong, and overwhelmingly floral scent. I would much prefer a fragrance-free option. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This item was great in making my skin very nice and smooth. My skin was very soft to the touch. Unfortunately I found his item to be a bit too greasy and it did cause me to get acne and large bumps in places that was undesireable. I could only rate it 3 stars as a result of the acne side effect. Overall it is a great product excluding that result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
For a product available in the mass marketplace I think this product is awesome. I have used it twice a day for 14 days and really believe I see an improvement in my smile lines. For the price and these results I will try other products in the Revitalift line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the thickness and the rich feeling of the cream. I liked how quickly it absorbed and I felt that my skin was hydrated. I do feel that it does smooth out wrinkles but I do not think that it is a true volume filler. I think if you use it for a moisturizer it is good. But if you are expecting this product to fill and lift your skin then you will be disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cream is thick but once applied does not feel heavy at all. My skin definitely is much softer after a few weeks of using this product and I love that. I am not sure that I have noticed any line disappearance but as long as it keeps my skin feeling soft I am a fan. Plus the scent is nice and light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried loreal revitalift for 28 days and did notice that my skin was getting fuller around my eyes and cheeks. ..it didn't irritate my skin. It absorbed quickly and wasnt sticky or messy...I liked the tube it came in made it easy to use. Was a great product but did realize it stopped at that little lift. ..skin was a little fuller but never went beyond that. .. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was really glad to have been chosen to receive the full sized L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer to use and review. I've been using it morning and night like I was supposed to. I haven't noticed a significant change in my lines or wrinkles but my skin is much softer and the cream absorbs quickly. The scent is very pleasant but was very cautious using this around my eyes especially with as hot as it is I was afraid of it running in my eyes and causing irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product day and night, I'm not sure I have noticed any difference as far a lines go. Perhaps it may be because I am not using the recommended serum prior to putting the cream on. I do like the cream, though it is a bit thick, so a little goes a long way. My face does look and feel more hydrated and soft. I will keep using it day and night in hopes of a more noticeable result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal rivitalift faithfully for 3 weeks I saw a small difference was hoping it was like a mini lift without the surgery.lol but my face feels smooth, my light wrinkles are fading my face looks more alive. I will continue to use as I see and feel a difference. I like the thickness of the cream went on smooth no greasy feeling, the scent was a little strong for me. Over all I like my face as it is looking better everyday [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product consistently for the past month and fine lines around my eyes are disappearing. I haven't seen any improvement underneath my eyes. I am pleased with the results so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm loving this serum! I've been using it for a couple weeks and it makes my skin glow. My skin does look fuller and it feels great. The applicator is so awesome and unique. I'll definitely continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the texture and fragrance. My skin felt soft and smooth. I did not notice any change in my wrinkles. I did not notice any increased fullness. I do like the container and the way the product is dispensed. I will continue to use the product until it is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a bit skeptic but from the day I tried to the last 3 weeks I have noticed a difference in my skin. Now I am 46 years old with sensitive skin that tends to still get acne. So I use this product as part of my night time routine. But it has not caused any reaction or acne. I notice my skin is more supple and my lines less defined. I will continue to use this product once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the ease of dispensing of the serum. The smell was not overwhelming and it seemed to absorb quickly without a sticky feel afterwards. I did not notice any visible improvements in my skin or wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a decent serum to use, but I did not see any effects from it. I liked the container and the consistency of the product...it was fast absorbing and pleasant. However, I do not see a diminishing in any lines or wrinkles so I am hopeful that my use of the product is at least preventing future wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this brand, the cream goes on smooth and feels great on my skin, the scent is great too. I love the technology that goes behind the products in this line. My skin feels soft and smooth and the cream is so rich and thick, a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this cream. It spreads evenly however a bit thick for the summertime. After two weeks I notice smoother skin and some lines fading. I will purchase this item however would use during the fall/winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is now one of my favorite serum. I wash my face then I use toner and I put on my Revitalift volume filler serum and I am loving the way my skin feel and look. It just sinks into my skin with ease filling in those pesky pores and fine lines for a more radiant complexion. I use it with and without makeup according to what kind of day I'm having. looking forward to trying the whole line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never used a serum before and was excited to receive the Revitalift Volume Filler. I kept my expectations low and so was not disappointed. After 4 weeks I cannot tell that anything was accomplished. Hope does spring eternal and maybe someday a product will come along that really does result in fuller cheeks and less hollowed eye area. As for wrinkles, the fight continues! Thank you for the opportunity to try this product SheSpeaks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was interested in this serum because I am always trying out new things to help with my wrinkles and skin. I was pleasantly surprised! After 4 weeks I noticed a different in my skin and my wrinkles. They are less noticeable and my skin feels softer. I will be buying this L'Or√©al Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum. I have told so many of my friends about this product too. Thanks L'Oreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was sent to me for my honest review. I thought it would be greasy and make my face oily. However after using for a period of four weeks, my skin was satiny smooth and I did notice lighter wrinkles around my eyes. The smell was nice and not overbearing. Overall this was a great L'Oreal product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this made my feel soft and did not leave me with a greasy feeling. It was creamy causing me to have great coverage. It helped with coverage of the fine lines that I know have since I am in my 40's. If you are looking for a moisturizer that will fill fine lines/wrinkles and keep you skin feeling soft and subtle then this is the product for you. It would have been a 5 stars if it contained a SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is amazing! The dark circles are gone and my face just looks more youthful. I have already given a bottle to my sister who equally loves it! I will absolutely buy this again and again and I have already ordered another product from the same line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Using a serum is new to me and with a brush to target even newer so I have to say I LOVE this stuff! I could see it working on fine lines after the first week and I love the scent. It is so easy to use. Trying it taught me that serum should be an integral part of my facial care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked for me. I specifically compared it to the Clinique All About Eyes which is my go to for around my eyes. The serum formula absorbed very well into my skin and I got the same results as the Clinique lotion/serum. This is a great product! So glad I tried it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This treatment feels clean and fresh when applying. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and not sticky. I really would like to try this with the recommended products to see the full effects. I do absolutely love the container, very premium looking and easy to dispense exactly what you need without dipping your fingers into a jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this creamy formula. It went on so smooth and immediately blended my flaky skin in. I did notice less wrinkles even over this short time. It even seemed to take some of the red out of my skin as well as give it a glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I actually received REVITALIFT VOLUME FILLER to try . . . I LOVE IT! After just a few applications, my skin looked and felt softer and more youthful! I have used many L'OREAL products for years and have always been amazed at how wonderful the products are at such great bargains! Thank you, L'OREAL, for continuing to produce quality products at reasonable prices! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found it very easy to use. I liked that you can use a very small amount to do numerous areas. The results are minimal, but i will continue to use until its gone to see if I get what Im looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received a nice sample to test out. The texture is in between gel and cream; the fragrance is just right , slightly similar to lancome tresor; skin looks slightly fuller following application but requires continual usage. No dramatic change in fine wrinkles though. It works as a effective summer moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer gave me plump ""cushiony"" baby skin. I just love the improved texture. My foundation looks so much better now. I have stopped buying a high end moisturizer, which was triple the price, because I like the L'Oreal moisturizer so much better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Got this as a full sized free product for which i am grateful.This is a thick rich cream which is good for night time use.I could not use it during the day as it was too thick and oily.Have not seen much change in elasticity, volume or wrinkles.The fragrance is soft and subtle, not overwhelming [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Loreal products and use them all the time in many forms, skin care, cosmetics, and hair care. I found this serum to not make any noticeable difference in filling in lines around my nose, mouth, or eyes. I have in the past used Youth Code by Loreal, serum, and liked its consistency better, however, I have yet to find a product such as this, that really works as a filler or a firmer. I only hope they can come up with one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the pleasant smell and how it was light and absorbed quickly. A little went a long way. I do see a little difference and I am sure with continued use I will see more. Over all a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the mild scent of L Oreal Revitalift serum, its so light and absorbs really well and its not sticky or greasy and leaves no residue on face after usage. Very ease to dispense, my skin feels smooth but so far i didn't notice much change in my fine lines. Over all its a good product and i would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the Revitalift Volume Filler. It is a light serum that absorbs quickly. It has a pleasant scent and does not leave a film or a feeling of stickiness on your face. After using it for 4 weeks I did notice that some of my fine lines were less noticeable and my skin looked a but plumber. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the packaging , first of all. Very clever. The product itself had a wonderful scent.. and went on very smoothly. It absorbed on impact. So, it sure never felt like I had to kill time before I applied my moisturizer. BONUS ! I would definitely recommend to a friend and re-purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this product so helpful for me, it helped with my wrinkles around my mouth, sagging in my eyes and wrinkles. I wish I had a smartphone to upload a before and after picture. It did wonders I went out and even got a new haircut and change now I look ten years younger, thanks so much LoReal Revitalift volume filler, you definitely have a future purchaser.

"I tried this product when I received a free sample to review it. I used it twice a day at morning and night. The smell is not super strong which is what I like. It is not too oily either. As far as relifting or reducing the lines I have not seen any noticeable difference. Pros: Nice smell, not too oily, good moistrizer Cons: Does not reduce lines noticeably which is what the product's main purpose is [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really enjoyed testing out this moisturizer! I didn't notice any reduction in fine lines, but the moisturizer did leave my skin feeling super soft and refreshed. The fragrance is also very nice. Some may find it a little strong, but it is not overwhelming and does not last long enough to bother anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After trying this product for 4 weeks, I noticed some small lines fading away. My deeper ones are a little better, but still there. Regardless, I love how my skin feels. It's very soft and looks healthy. I also like how the serum absorbs into my skin, right away, with a very natural feel, to the touch. There is a slight scent to the product, which is not overwhelming and dissipates within a short time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum is lightweight and non-greasy with a nice scent that absorbed quickly. I didn't notice much of a difference in my forehead lines but did notice some change. I like how the product is dispensed from the tube but do not know when I'm running low to purchase more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given this to try and I've really enjoyed it. While I haven't noticed a significant change in lines or wrinkles, my skin is noticeably softer. The scent is pleasant and the cream absorbs quickly. I could see myself using this from now of if it offered some sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"really like it. i have noticed a great improvement in the tone and texture of my skin, i like that the product feels creamy , absorbs well , and does not feel heavy, i will be using some of the other products from this line and highly recommend them [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tiiming wise, this could not have been better. It came in on my 60th birthday. I started using it immediately, not really expecting much to happen. However, not only does it work, its almost magical. Within a few days, my skin felt and looked better. And now, it no longer has that tired and old look. I didn't stop at the jawline either. I used it on my turkey neck as well. And that even looks better. This is definitely worth the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked how easy it was to dispense the right amount of this serum. It went on smoothly and did not feel greasy. I have not noticed much difference in the lines on my face but I have only been using it in the morning so far. I am hoping it will improve my skin the longer I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As with many moisturizers, although I have been using this for several weeks I see no noticeable difference. Maybe it's because I (thankfully) don't have any deep wrinkles yet? Anyway, it's fine as a moisturizer but my biggest gripe is that it doesn't have SPF. When I buy a cream to use during the day I need to have a built in SPF since I am fair and sun-aware. I also have a sensitive nose so appreciate the pleasant scent of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am a member of She Speaks and received a free jar of L'Oreal Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer and wan't to give my feedback. Within a week and a half I could notice my skin was fuller and more radiant. It is easy to use and feels very silky on my skin. It also has a very pleasant smell. I use this every morning and night which makes it nice. I am excited about my future use. I will be buying more of this product in the future and would highly recommend this to all ladies!

"Light scent-didn't overwhelm or cause irritation. Product is absorbent and lightweight-worked well under other makeup. Skin is softer after use. Skin also seems plumper, more moisturized. Easy to dispense without waste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how easy it is to dispense and use this product. It easily absorbs into the skin and is not greasy on the skin. It only took a few seconds to apply and I was able to immediately continue with my make up routine. There was no skin irritation or redness that other products have produced on my skin. I did notice wrinkles around my eyes decrease and felt the overall texture of my skin felt smoother and softer. Thank you for the oppy to try this product.

"Thanks for the opportunity to try L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum. It was so easy to use and apply where you wanted it. It absorb quickly into the skin, and did not make my skin greasy . I used on the fine lines around my eyes as well as all over my face. I loved how soft my face is and how the fine lines that i have are filled in. This is something that everyone needs to try . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the Revitalift Daily Volumizing Serum for the past four weeks although I use it only at night and not twice a day as recommended. I concentrated on the area under my eyes and it does seem that they are no longer as deep or defined as prior to using this product so it did work. The product was easy to dispense and then applied easily and absorbed quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS A GOOD FEEL TO IT AND A NICE TEXTURE. I HAVE USED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND HAVEN'T SEEN ANY AMAZING RESULTS YET BUT I EXPECT IN A COUPLE MORE WEEKS, I WILL NOTICE MORE RESULTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND REVIEW THIS PRODUCT. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been pleasantly surprised by how well this works! within just a few days my face did appear luminous, skin firmer my few wrinkles/creases seemed less noticeable to me. I really like that a small dab goes a very long way on the skin, and it didn't make my oily skin oiler or greasy feeling. The only downside I had is that with firmer skin, my big pores looked even bigger to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried to use this morning and night if remembered. I really liked the design of the product. It reminded me of a syringe that shot out the right amount. My skin was plumper after a few weeks and lines were not as noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The first few days I liked this product. It's a lightweight serum that doesn't have a strong scent. By the fourth day it was burning my my skin and making it peel. I might do better with the cream. Honestly can't say that I would make a recommendation on the serum but would share my experience with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the serum and I really like it. When applied it quickly was absorbed into the skin. I also noticed the deep lines I had between my eyes has almost disappeared. This is a good product. As always Loreal provides an extensive anti aging line that is affordable to all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I've gotten older, my skin has become much more dry, so this product was great for adding moisture to my face! I love how my skin feels so smooth. I haven't noticed that it has added volume to it but I will continue to use and see if that happens. I thought the smell of the product would be too strong at first but once I smoothed it into my skin it was fine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so glad that I was able to test this product, as I really like it. It is very moisturizing, particularly around the eye area, and helps the little wrinkle around my eyes look better. I use it right before applying makeup, and I don't have to wait a long time to do so. I am going to try some of the other products in the line as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the best daily and nightly moisturizer I have used at this time. It is super silky and ultra light with a pleasant scent. I have noticed in the short weeks of daily use, much firmer skin and disappering fine lines. I highly recommend this product. I will be a frequent consumer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the way L'OREAL Revitalift Volume Filler moisturizes! It's easy to apply, has a great fresh and clean smell, and more importantly, it has made my face smoother and it just feels wonderful! Thank you so much for allowing me try this!

"I've used this serum twice a day under my regular moisturizer. I can see an increase in smoothness and it does seem to decrease fine lines, although I haven't seen a change in deeper lines or creases. I also thought my skin felt like it retained more moisture. It had no discernable scent at all to me and I really liked the consistency. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked how quickly this absorbed; there was no oily or greasy residue after usage. The scent was pleasant and it was moderately hydrating to the skin. After four weeks, I can see some lessening of the fine lines around my eyes. No doubt that using the accompanying cream would have enhanced its effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. First of all, the light scent is very calming and pleasant. Then, it provides excellent moisture, especially for the eyes. I am outside in Phoenix regularly so, I love the hydrating properties of this product for our desert climate. The applicator was nice too, so you don't get out more than you need-just 3 or 4 pumps. It absorbs quickly and works well with my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Recieved a full size bottle free from shespeaks.Was expecting it to work, but after using for more than 3 weeks have really not seen any difference in elasticity or wrinkles. Hydrates a little, but other than that no effect.Goes on smooth, not irritating to the skin and has a fragrance which might irritate some people.There is no way of knowing how much product has been used up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although this product has a smooth and non greasy feel to it, I did not see any physical results or changes in my skins appearance. I think Loreal makes high quality products, but this one did not deliver for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the way it made my dry areas feel and look but it was to heavy for my forehead, it felt greasy. There was plump look to jawline rather than sagging/drawn look I had. I would definitely recommend to my friends and purchase for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this product. My job requires me to be outside and Ian am not seeing the greasy shine that my previous moisturizer was causing. I also see a marked improvement in my visible lines on my forehead and around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using my full size sample as directed; twice daily. I like the simple routine of this product and a few drops goes a long way. I will keep up the routine because it's easy to follow. I have noticed smoother and softer skin and that's a plus so far. I like that it leaves no residue or odor. A huge positive in skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a full size sample of this product from SheSpeaks. It goes on clear and absorbs really quickly. I noticed after a couple days that it reduced my fine lines and dark circles. Overall I liked it and would probably buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the product; after 4 weeks of using it twice daily, I noticed softer lines, and fuller cheeks. My skin feels smoother and softer as well. The container is super cute, though it can't sit upright. The only downside to this product, was the scent. It's a bit too perfumey, especially before going to bad; though I got used to it in the 4 weeks. I liked the results, and based on the price would probably recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked how the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift made my skin plump and smooth. It made fine lines disappear and my skin looked smooth and youthful. On the other hand it also made my sensitive skin breakout with acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the way my makeup went on nice and smoothly with no tugging or pilling. The scent is nice but as far as any wrinkles, I really haven't seen much of a difference. I do wish this product had an SPF in it because my nose actually got a bit red when I was out in the sun for a little while. I realized this and had to use a moisturizer with an SPF in it in addition to the day cream. Overall, its a decent product if your wrinkles aren't too deep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Fabulous Product! I am definitely going to keep using this product. Skin seems softer, plumper, brighter and firmer! Easy to apply- not messy. I used under my eyes and above upper lip areas. I feel good, I think and my family thinks I look younger! I am thankful to receive the full size sample from She Speaks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really nice cream. I noticed my skin was totally hydrated. No flakies or dry spots that I sometimes get. I cannot say it helped with my wrinkles that much. I avoid the sun and drink a lot of water , too. I would buy it again in the future for the great moisturizing benefits the cream provided. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was very excited to review this product. I was in need of a serum anyhow so why not?! The first week I had minimal breakouts after that my skin felt hydrated and soft. I have oily skin and this definitely helped with oil control. I did not notice a significant difference. The crease between my brows firmed up slightly but that's about it. Not enough to repurchase again . Maybe I use ad high expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I reviewed the Revitalivt concentrated serum. This product made my skin soft and more hydrated. I did not notice a significant change in skin firmness and minimal decreas in fine lines. However, I have only used the product for a few weeks and plan on continuing use to see if I notice any other changes. I did like that the product goes on smoothly and has no odor. The product container is awkward at times. It does not stay upright well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum and when I first started it made my skin look brighter. Closer to to about the 3rd week of use I noticed the lines around my mouth were not so noticeable and that is awesome! I will definitely keep using this product because I feel with longer use I will hopefully see greater results! Thank you for the opportunity to try this because I may not have otherwise!

"I only have giving it 4 stars cause I have not been using it for a whole month. I have notice my skin seems a bit tighter now, and it has a ""dew"" to it if you will. It's incredible! I even can see my dark circles getting lighter. And areas I had red patches at, are now fading away, if you will. I do see my wrinkles are not as noticeable as before, there still there, just softer.

"I received a full size sample L'Or√©al Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum to try from She Speaks. I feel that is made a difference in my skin's fullness and texture. It did not feel greasy or heavy at all. Overall, I like the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the product, the way it feels going on, and that it almost feels as if my skin as tightening as it sinks it. The only thing I would say negative, is that it smells like rubbing alcohol, and that bothered me a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer went on smooth and felt silky on my skin. I did not like that it did not absorbed into my skin. I could not use any foundation or BB cream on top of it. It caused them to roll into little balls. I only used it as a night cream After using this product for about four weeks I did not notice any difference in my fine lines. I would not purchase this product or recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The serum is light and goes on smoothly. There is not a strong scent which I like. I experience a little tingling sensation at times. I'm assuming that is from the active ingredients. After applying, I follow with my daily sunscreen. It goes on easily over this product. Overall, I like the way it feels on my skin. My only dislike is the packaging. Dispensing is cumbersome. They were trying to incorporate the idea that it is inject-able. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good moisturizer. It absorbed quickly and wasn't greasy. I think it has helped the lines on my neck look a little better, but not as much as it says on the package. I will probably keep using it to see if there is any more improvement [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I felt the product made my skin feel soft, I didn't see any noticeable difference in firmness or appearance of wrinkles. The product was easy to apply. I liked the applicator with just the right amount of product being dispensed. It absorbed quickly into my skin and didn't feel greasy or anything afterwards. I just noticed my skin felt softer even after the first application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A good every day moisturizer. It goes on very smoothly and is non-greasy. Make-up goes on very nicely after giving the moisturizer a few minutes to absorb. I don't feel like it, or any other product, did anything special to diminish the look of fine lines and wrinkles. But I still moisturize every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed this moisturizer as a nighttime product. It felt a bit heavy for my liking during the daytime when wearing under makeup, but if I'm just staying home and it's a ""no makeup"" day, it's great. It is very moisturizing and makes my skin very soft. I do notice that it helps with the fine lines around my eyes. I would try the serum version or lighter version for daytime wear. Overall a thumbs up! Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product! My skin is super soft, my fines lines have diminished, and my face looks radiant. Moisturizer goes on smooth and feels great instantly. I look forward to continuing the use of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for an acceptable drug store alternative and was so happy to receive the Loreal Re-Volumizing Moisturizer from She Speaks. I don't know what it is but my skin looks and feels super smooth when I use it. The fine lines seem smoother and I feel my skin's fullness. I've been using it twice a day and my foundation goes on effortlessly .What is really exciting, is that I have a better looking complexion even on days without makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a very fancy container, but the actual serum does absolutely nothing. At the end of the test, I saw no increase in fullness or firmness, no reduction of lines, absolutely no change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! I used it everyday since I received it! I noticed my fine lines getting harder to see and almost invisible after makeup was applied! I also felt a softer skin over the time I used it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the feel of this! I think I'd have to try stacking it with the other products to really help with my huge deep forehead lines, which is what I was worried about. I was breaking out a little on the forehead when I was using it, so it's probably best as an eye cream for people who are sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical that this would really make a difference on my face but i was pleasantly surprised, from the first time I put it on I felt like it gave my dry skin a nice drink of water, it seemed less dry and over a couple of weeks , the area around my eyes seemed more plumped and the wrinkles less visible, I have to say this is a product that I will keep using because I SEE a difference! I did get to try the product from SheSpeaks but that makes not difference in my opinion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the L' Oreal Paris Revitalift Serum through SheSpeaks. I used it every morning . It feels really good while applying. I noticed it absorbed fast and left my cheek feeling soft and smoother. My skin felt dewy after a few days. I think it really helped"" plump up"" my cheeks. I didn't apply any near my eyes, but still it irritated them a little. Other than that, the product was good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product re-texturized my skin. It feels smoother and more even. The fine lines seem to have diminished as well. It feels very silky going on, and while there's a slight fragrance, it goes away quickly and isn't bothersome. I am going to try the other products in this line so I get the benefit of ""stacked"" products that are supposed to work and interact with each other. Will be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product for free through She Speaks, and I am SO glad that I did! I love the way it makes my skin feel and I have already noticed an improvement around my eyes. They no longer look tired and the fines lines around my eyes and lips are fading! The scent is nice and the shape of the bottle is innovative and easy to use. This serum is my new favorite serum, (and believe me, I've tried many of them). I absolutely love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This moisturizer makes my skin feel and look so smooth! I don't have a lot of deep wrinkles, but I have fine lines, especially around my eyes and mouth. Before applying my foundation I used this as a moisturizing base and my face looked younger!! I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.

I got the opportunity to try L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum through She Speaks. I like the feel of the serum which was not oily and easy to spread. The container that dispenses it is a great idea as it only pumps out a little at a time and is so much more sanitary. My face does feel softer and not so dry. I will continue to use it in hopes it will help my wrinkles after long term use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this L'Or√©al Revitalift free from She speaks for my feedback. I have used it for almost a month. The directions are for twice a day, but I could only do it once a day. If I used it twice a day my skin got to oily and greasy. I loved the scent and the creaminess of the product. I do feel it helped with my crows feet and minimized some fine lines. Overall I was happy with the results of this product and would buy it to use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer made my skin feel really soft. I am not sure if it really made a difference on the fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead. I will continue to use it to see if I see any further results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this moisture. This first week my chin broke out but that went away and now my skin looks amazing. The moisturizer is so silky soft and has a beautiful soft scent.

L'Or√©al Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum is a great product! It contains Hyaluronic Acid which is has proven to be an effective anti-aging ingredient. The scent is pleasant and the product moisturizes nicely. I have noticed my skin looks smoother as a result of using the serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a very smooth and moisturizing cream. It has a really nice texture, and leaves my skin feeling really soft and supple. The only thing I would change about this cream, would be to add an SPF factor for daytime wear. I do think the cream plumped up my skin a bit around the lines between my mouth and nose. I would certainly recommend this cream to someone looking for a great moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Nice moisturizer .It filled in my pores but not very firming. This product does have a strong perfume scent since I think could be a little weaker or unscented would be even better. It does on smooth under my makeup. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product free as part of she speaks panel. The tube is good and the product is dispensed in a clean way.It has a good fragrance and goes on smoothly and feels very light and is absorbed fast. I havent seen much improvement either in elasticity or in wrinkles, maybe i need to use it for a longer time. One thing i am not sure of is how much product is left as there is no way of knowing that. I give it 3 stars for ease of use and fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have acne prone skin so after using a few days, my chin and nose started to break out. I then used it solely on my neck and it was wonderful. Skin was softer and smoother. I'd purchase this but would only use on my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Moisturizer is an excellent moisturizer. It really made my skin look smoother and feel softer. I loved the consistency of this moisturizer. It wasnt too thin or too thick and it didnt have an unpleasant or too strong of a scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the L Oreal Paris Revitalift serum! I couldn't believe how smoothly it went on without drying out my already dry skin. I noticed that the slight wrinkles around my eyes seemed to smooth out some and seem plumper and smooth. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"About a month ago I received a free bottle of the loreal revitalift moisturizer. I used it twice a day and loved it. I gave it a 5 star because I like the consistancy, the fragrance and the way it hydrated and moisturized my skin. My skin looks more glowing now. The moisturizer absorbs into the skin quickly and it's not greasy. I can apply my makeup right after applying the product with no problem. I recommend this product and will buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried using this product morning and night but my skin broke out. Using it just in the morning under my makeup seemed to work very well though. I liked the scent and it was moisturizing and helped my makeup go on more smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer, L'Or√©al Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer ! Hydrated my skin very well leaving it feeling soft and smooth. Fine lines looked plumped up and less visible. Scent made it pleasurable to use. Moisturizer was quickly absorbed leaving skin moisturized but not greasy. No piling and didn't cause any breakouts. I plan on buying this again.

I have used L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum for about one month my face definitely feels softer and more moisturized and it also looks smoother. It slightly softened the lines around my mouth and on my forehead. I am planning on buying the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Daily Moisturizer to compliment this serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the feel of this on my skin. Smooth no stickiness, spread evenly and well. I noticed a difference in my skin after two weeks. My skin looked smooth and healthy, even glowed a bit. Some moisturizers can irritate my skin this did not. Was pleasantly surprised at how well this product worked! I would highly recommend Revitalift Volume Filler Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this Daily concentrated serum. It did a good job of making my face feel smooth and soft, but I did not notice a difference in the appearance of my wrinkles, and for that, I am a little bit disappointed. I really thought it could make the wrinkles less noticeable, but nope. It did make my skin feel good though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this serum a few weeks ago and I can say it's done my skin a world of good! I have lupus and sjogrens, which drys out my eyes, mouth and skin so I really needed a product that would put the moisture back in my face and neck areas. My face and neck feels as moist and firm as it did when I was in my 20's. I love it and will be buying it again... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Even though I did not see any notable difference in lifting my skin I did think it was a nice thick moisturizer that absorbed well and made my face feel soft and smooth. It felt good when applying it and rubbing it in, there was a slight tingling sensation afterwards that made me feel like it was working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this moisturizer. It absorbs into my skin quickly and I love the way my skin looks poreless and smooth. This product works better than the department store brand I have been using and I plan on switching. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. The serum goes on smoothly and left my skin markedly softer. I noticed the softening of lines around my mouth and eyes.

"It goes on very easy, and my skin does feel smoother. As far as the fine lines go I really can't tell! I will continue to use this until all the product is used, and then I'm hoping that I will be able to see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the first product I have used where I can see a significant difference. It gets rid of fairly deep wrinkles between my eyes and the hollows under my eyes. Even after I wash my face I can still see the difference - it's not just a filler that washes off. My eyes don't look so tired when using this product. I put this product on under my eyes then put foundation make up on and it's a big difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was thrilled to be asked to try Revitalift Volume Filler as I'm always looking for something new that works and I really like L'Oreal products. I wouldn't say that this is a ""miracle"" cure for my aging skin but after a month it did make my skin look a little more youthful. It doesn't erase wrinkles but it did make my skin more hydrated without looking greasy. I wasn't overly keen on the fragrance but it wouldn't stop me from purchasing this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the container of this product and how much of the serum was deposited each time I used it. It absorbed really well; quite a bit better than my usual serum. My skin felt a lot smoother using this serum. I actually noticed a small difference in some fine lines. I didn't notice a huge difference overall, but definitely saw some fine lines reduced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to try this product. I have severely dry skin and have tried every moisturizer under the sun with nothing really working for me. I am happy to say that I have finally found a product that works. I used this faithfully day and night and I could see a change in my skin a week into using this product. My skin went from dry and rough to silky smooth. I will continue to use this product daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i really liked the packaging and it's scent, it had a rich, creamy texture but it did not weigh down my skin, it didn't make me feel greasy either, i didn't see any plumping on my face but it did fill in some of my fine line, overall, i really liked the product and definitely would recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nice scent, felt smooth on my skin, how ever using it as directed (2x a day) I didn't feel it did want it was suppost to do, I still have fine lines and didn't ""plump"" , I do like it for a moisturizer but that's it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
wow I always love Loreal products and this one does not fail . Loreal Paris Revitalift not only removes fine lines and wrinkles but it makes my skin so soft and smooth .

"I love the texture and the way it makes my skin feel, smooth and soft. I'm not crazy about how you get it out of the container. I have large hands (for a woman) but I would think it would be a challenge for a woman with smaller hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the smell but did not notice a difference at all. I can say I would not buy or recommend as I do think there are better products out there. It is very creamy and it does blend into your skin great. I did not feel greasy or ""weighed down"" my it at all (I liked that part a lot!!) I will continue to use the jar till finished for this reason. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked how soft my skin looked and felt after using this product. I didn't notice a lot of difference in reduction of wrinkles but I just have fine lines on forehead and around eyes. Maybe if my wrinkles were deeper, I'd notice more change. I did think it improved my skin overall and I will continue to use it. I like this line of face care anyway.

I really liked the moisturizer. It had a great scent and very creamy and perfect to use under my makeup. Although I didn't really notice a difference as far as plumping or volumizing my skin. But it did work great fir dry patches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had very high hopes for Loreal Revitalift Volume Filler. I was hoping for plumper skin, softening of lines and wrinkles. But...to be honest, I had a hard time even putting it on my face, the scent was over powering!! I used in for a week straight and it was moisturizing, but did not live up to the hype. I like the brand, but not this product and its overwhelming smell! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer. Besides the fact that the cream is a little on the heavy side (it doesn't go on smooth), it feels really good on my skin and my face doesn't feel tight or dry all day. I use it morning and night and it keeps my complexion looking great! I apply foundation on top of the lotion and it doesn't affect the makeup. It has a pleasant scent too! I would recommend it to my family and friends and will definitely purchase this moisturizer again once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing! I have only been using it for less than a week and I can see dramatic differences in my skin. I have also been asked what I am using on my skin because it seems so much clearer, brighter and younger !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the product, especially the packaging and how it is dispensed. The serum absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly. No complaints, but honestly I don't see much difference in my fine lines or plumpness of my skin, so no rave review either. I don't mind using it, and am grateful to have tried it but I doubt that I will buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I was very excited about using the product hoping I would see improvement however there was no difference. My face looked temporarily good but no long lasting results. It does not have any sunscreen so I had to wear a hat when in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to say, I was impressed with the silky texture of the cream. It absorbed quickly into my skin and did not feel greasy or sticky. My skin definitely felt more hydrated after using it. However, I honestly did not notice any change in volume or fullness over the 30 days....not that I honestly believed that could happen from a creme anyway. Overall my rating would be a 3.5 because while it was a great moisturizer, there wasn't anything special about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Loreal Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated serum and I absolutely love this product. It made my skin oh so soft, and I noticed a difference in my cheekbones, they looked more rounded and fuller. my husband and my friends also noticed a change.

I will most certainly never be out of stock of the Loreal Paris Revitalift Daily Concentrated Serum, thank you Loreal for this great wonder!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this for a few weeks now and haven't really noticed much of a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. As a moisturizer, it works well enough, but the scent was a bit strong for my liking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this moisturizer. It didn't seem to have any harsh chemicals or a strong scent. It just didn't moisturize my skin like my usual moisturizer though. I do have very dry skin so it takes a very strong moisturizer to keep my skin soft. This product would probably be good for women with normal or even normal to dry skin.

"After using this product for several weeks I'm happy to report that my skin feels soft and moisturized. I feel that it does reduce the appearance of fine lines, especially around my eyes, pretty much immediately, but I don't think they've actually disappeared; it's more that the product is something of a filler. Either way, my skin looks good and even more importantly is feels good. I'll be sad when the jar goes empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer from L'Oreal is a joy to use.

"I really enjoyed using the Re-Volumizing moisturizer. It made my skin feel very smooth, and hydrated. At my age (56), my skin was staring to become dull, and sag. In the 4 weeks, it seem more lifted and not as many wrinkles. I also like the fact it doesn't weight the skin down, it's very light. My makeup even last much better. I will continue to use it and have already shared with several friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used L'Oreal Revitalift Voluminizing Serum for almost 3 weeks and LOVE it! By Day 2 my frown lines had soften and the fine lines under my eyes had smoothed out. I have some crepiness on my upper lids and that has smoothed out too. I did not like the applicator, I kept accidentally pushing the bottom button and wasting the product. I will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a very pleasant to use, I love the scent. It is a very good moisturizer not to greasy and left my skin feeling soft.

The last several years I've noticed tiny little lines starting to form around my eyes and between my eyes. This product helped reduce the appearance of those lines in as little as 2 weeks.

"I love love love the way this feels when applied, it sort of feels like the make up primers you can get, feels velvety and super smooth, it does fill I. Your pools and fine lines.

"Thank you very much for letting me try this. The smell wasnt that great, and it broke my chin out, I really couldnt tell it helped the fine lines, maybe I just need to use it longer. However loved that it had spf in it. Again Thank you for the chance to try this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It only takes a little bit to make my skin feel silky. The serum goes on smooth and easily. After using for a while I did notice that the little lines by my eyes were not as deep. I think the container helps to not have waste since it doesn't dispense a lot at once. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoyed this cream. I noticed some visible changes in my skin right away. It feels and looks much better. The only downfall of this moisturizer is the scent. It was too overpowering. It would also be better if it had SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer did a nice job hydrating. I didn't notice a huge difference in my wrinkles tho. Just a little. I did have an issue tho. I have rosecea and this product really flared it up. I couldn't use it on my cheeks at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very good moisturizer.I love the way that it filled in my pores and blurred my fine lines.

"I have been using this face cream for about a month now , I have notice that my skin is smoother and my face is softer. I notice some lifting in my cheeks and they are more define. My whole face seems to look younger and more firm. I really did not think that this would work on my skin, since I am black but I see now that skin cream do not discriminate. I love it thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The smell was very perfumy but not a good perfume. I used this faithfully every day and night. It did keep my face from drying but it did not plump or fill any lines. I'm 38 so my lines are minimal but I did not see any difference. My skin isn't sensitive to product either but for whatever reason my face broke out a lot more than usual. Would have been better in a tube because if you have long nails digging in the jar is a pain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love the pump at the bottom that just gives you the right amount to do the area you are concentrating on.I used 2 pumps per eye area.It's a gel like substance that soaks into the skin easily.After using it for a few weeks now I can see a difference.The areas I applied it to do feel smoother and the lines aren't quite as prominent.I would recommend it and will continue to use this.Thanks to L'Oreal and She Speaks for the chance to try this product for free.

"I really like this so far. I love that it makes my skin feel moisturized but not greasy, and the fragrance isn't too strong.

"This product is great, after a few days of use a saw a noticeable difference, my skin feels soft, hydrated and with added volume. I use it before I apply a moisturizer, and for a few seconds after I applied it, there is a slight prickling, (it must be the hyaluronic acid), but my wrinkle and fine lines are much much less visible. All throughout the day it keep my skin smooth and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product did absolutely nothing for my skin. I didn't feel any voluminizing effect . The wrinkles around eyes and elsewhere didn't diminish. The cream itself feels nice, smells nice, applies nice, but unfortunately i didn't see any positive effects. After applying, felt little stinging but it went away fast. I would not buy nor recommended this product only because i didn't see any results that were advertised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In love isn't the word for what I feel about this product. I'm so glad I was chosen to review this product. I have been looking for a serum that would start to get rid of some of my crow's fee and plump up the area around my eyes a bit. Well this is the product for you. It makes my skin supple and I have definitely noticed a difference in my fine lines being almost non-existent. This product I will be replacing the minute I'm out.

"I used this on one side of my face to compare to the other. My face feels soft, but no difference between sides. I cant really tell if there is any difference in fine lines, MAYBE a bit better on the trial side, but nothing I am sure about. I don't think I would spend extra money on this, but I will finish it off (just using one one side) and see if my opinion changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for a little over a week. I like how the product goes on and feels on my skin. It doesn't feel sticky and makes my skin look refreshed. I will definitely continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have not noticed a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. The serum itself does go on great and is not sticky or heavy. I am not a fan of the actual tube it comes in though. It reminds me of my daughter's toy syringe that came with her play doctor kit. I would recommend other people to give it a try though since what may not work for me, may work for another [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly I cannot tell a difference. It would have been very helpful as part of the trial to ask us to take a before and after pic. Usually we cannot see ourselves the way others do, so a pic would have been helpful. That being said, the texture of the product is smooth, goes on easily, moisturizes well and feels great on my skin. Cannot say that i would recommend product to others since I cannot tell if it works or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found it goes on smoothly and isn't at all sticky. It has markedly reduced the deep furrow in my forehead from frowning as well as frown lines near my mouth. The fine wrinkles I had at my eyes have been reduced as well. I have sensitive skin, but found that this did not irritate it in any way. I think this product works and would recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for a few weeks now and must say it goes on nice and smooth and not greasy. I've been in the sun and this has helped to keep my skin moisturized and feeling smooth. The smell is a little to perfume like for me, I would like a cleaner sort of smell. But besides that I really like this product and may continue to use/purchase it after this jar is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't sure what to expect using this product. It smells nice and is absorbed well into the skin. Some serums leave a reside or tacky feeling but this was nice to use. I broke out a bit but u sure what the case was related or not. I have not noticed a difference with using this product and this is my reasoning with the 1 star rating. I got this product complimentary to try and give my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the smell. I use it primarily on my neck. I have a thin neck and it is wrinkling even though I am not that old. I wouldn't say the product has made me look like I am twenty again, although I didn't think it would.. Maybe I need to use it a little longer to see better results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank you SheSpeaks for sending me the product to try out. I felt like it was hydrating enough for my skin. The scent was a slightly strong but not too much. I didn't enjoy the fact that it was in a container which you have to dip your fingers into. I haven't noticed any reduction of wrinkles but I am sure that takes some time (or at least more than 2 weeks). I really enjoy L'Oreal products and this one is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely love the scent! It soaks right into my face without me rubbing it in. I did not notice anything the first week, but after that I am noticing my skin is smoother, and less redness. It also feels like velvet on my skin, and did a great job around my eyes where there are fine lines. I am really looking forward to using this in the winter, when my skin is drier! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many facial products and this is the first one that I actually thought I saw a difference in the lines on my face. Not a huge difference, but definitely a difference in the appearance of lines and wrinkles on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just got back from vacay and upset at my skin so this was just what I needed. My skin is starting the downwards motion so I have started the test run. So far so good, I like the feel of the lotion , not too icky it just gives my skin a soft feel. I am still using so the results can only go up. Stay tuned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the design of the product was awkward, but finally got used to it. Loved the feel of the serum. It was smooth and absorbed quickly. I noticed an overall smoother appearance to my fine lines and wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not impressed with this product. First of all, the packaging is much too gimmicky for me. I understand it's supposed to look like a needle that would be used to insert fillers, but it's must too large and clumsy to use and store. The serum itself has a nice texture and fragrance and feels good upon application, but within a few hours the residue is flaking off of my skin. After a month of daily use, I don't find any difference in the look of my wrinkles, skin texture or tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have noticed a definite improvement in the overall condition of my skin while using this product. It is extremely light-weight and non-greasy, which is very important to me. I live in Florida and tried this product during July and August and had no issues at all with it during the day. I've even been using it on the backs of my hands with great results. I will definitely keep using this product! Loved it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OMG!.....Love, Love, Love this product!, been using is it for two weeks and its the best skin has looked. I will continue to use this daily and already going to purchase it again to continue in my daily skin routine. I highly recommend this to women who are looking for a healthy younger looking face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The definite pro was that it worked quickly to substantially reduce my frown lines. However, it did not cooperate with my very sensitive skin. I considered continuing to use it in specific areas, but it caused my skin to breakout. I found it to be effective, but unfortunately not a good product for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started the product a week ago. It goes on smooth and not sticky and I do feel some tightness around the eyes which makes me feel like it is starting to work already. I will continue and check back in another week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This serum with hyaluronic acid. It has a light texture like most serums. It has a strong fragrance but that goes away quickly. Product contains not only hyaluronic acid, which is the best moisturizer for the skin, but also capryloyl salicylic acid, a fantastic exfolilator which also builds collagen. The packaging is interesting, I'll give them that. It works like a syringe. It would be great product if they did not add a very high amount of alcohol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super cool product! Love the pencil like design. Easy to dispense perfect amount! I couldn't get over how soft and subtle my skin felt. I definitely could see and feel plumping effects! I'm so glad I got to try this for free! I will definitely continue using and recommend to my friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm going to be honest, I was hesitant at first because I've used the same moisturizer for years but as soon as I opened the jar and applied this cream to my face my face fell in love! The smell is amazing and I have been using it for a month now and my face is clearer it evergreen looks fuller and the fine lines are barely there, amazing product. It's my new moisterizer for ever! I'm in love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this cream. I could tell a difference in a few days. I like the way it smelled as well. It didn't have a strong perfumey smell like most products. It went on smooth and made my skin so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a pleasant smell and goes on really smooth. Have been using for over a week now. I feel the skin smoothing properties are evident at this time yet waiting on results from continued use. I received this product as a free sample yet would purchase and recommend the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Revitalift Volume Filler for a couple of weeks now. I love how it makes my face feel. It seems smoother and some of the fine lines and wrinkles seem to be fading. I absolutely love the scent! It's very pleasant without being overpowering. Thank you SheSpeaks for letting me try this!! I will definitely buy when mine is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. Its a really nice consistency and feels good when you apply to your face. It makes my skin feel moisturized without feeling terribly greasy and doesn't have an overpowering scent. I would definetly reccomend this product and even switch using another name-brand product to use this product. I love - love - loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After receiving this product to try and test, I've used the product now over 2 weeks and have notice my facial skin healthier. I have used the Revitalift products in the past but not in a while. L'Oreal Paris Revitalift¬Æ Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum is easy to use and affordable. My fine lines have softened enough to notice, I also liked the pump delivery system. My only concern is the list of ingredients, I wish they were more natural !!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
LOVE IT! After 2 weeks my skin is very noticably firmer and my laugh lines are half gone! I am 57 years old and do not have many wrinkles but my goal is to have none. I will be buying this as soon as it runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Just what I needed for my face! I'm happy to say that I have been using the LOreal Paris Revitalift Daily Volumizing Moisturizer from the day I received it in the mail. I can see a more fuller look to my face and I see some lines have a ""filled"" in look. I have faithfully applied it in the morning and have seen results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I must say I was surprised by this product it has surpassed my expectations ! I was shocked to see my results and I have shared with everyone how awesome this product is! I have only been using it 2 weeks and I can already see drastic results and I must say I am happy! I would compare this to the high end brands and this is even better ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only been using this product for a week or so but it has impressed me so far. It goes on silky smooth and sinks right into my skin. The smell is a little strong but that is my only complaint. My skin is soft and smoother already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Its really hard to say whether or not this product is working. Ive been using it religiously for a week and a half, morning and night, and I really haven't noticed any change. But I'm giving it 2 stars because I think it needs more time. At this point, I'm not sure I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product since receiving in the mail, I really wanted to like this product but I never saw any good results and irritated my skin, I will continue and see if the results will change. The pump is really easy to use and no harsh smell, actually smelled nice [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the product for a week now and have good feelings toward product. I have noticed my skin is a little brighter and fuller. Some lines at eye area has diminished and smoothed out so that is a plus! Maybe, after another week of using product I will see more results. So far it is going pretty well. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product. After only a couple of days, there was noticeable improvement in my skin. It looked smoother and firmer. It also had a more youthful appearance. I wish I had discovered this product a long time ago. I highly recommend this product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product totally free via a review program . I've been using for 2 weeks so far and my skin does seem to look a bit brighter and I'm noticing less pores . In 2 more weeks I'll submit my final review as I am required to give an honest opinion after 4 weeks of use . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I recently received this this product to try out. I have used the Revitalift products in the past but not in a while.

I liked the easy to use pump delivery system. It seems like it keeps the product cleaner and fresher longer. I will continue to use this and purchase again.

"I really wanted to see some measurable results with this product but I'm not noticing any improvements in lines or wrinkles. The positives are...the he serum is easily absorbed and applied,the scent is barely noticeable and the product doesn't irritate my dkin. If in mire time I see some results,I will update my review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just got mine and this is day #2 I like how it is not greasy or heavy under my makeup. The fact that is a sun blocker as well is a plus. Will keep reviewing as I go and keep you updated on how it makes my skin and me feel til the end of the trial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the applicator because it distributes product in the appropriate amount. Serum is soft and smooth and makes skin feel extra silky. I like the results so far and will continue to use. Makes me feel like my skin is going back in time. (Yay!!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like how this product goes on and feels once applied. I agree it is hard to see into the packaging to see how much product you have and what is left. I cannot say that I see any huge changes currently, but I do love the feel of the product on my face. I hope to see more noticable changes before I finish the product in testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product and think it really works great. from the first day I used it I could notice a difference in my face. It felt smoother and looked younger. Could not believe the difference in my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Only using for a week so it's hard to give a rating at this point in time. Very easy to apply. Light fragrance and non oily. It does make your skin smooth feeling and soft, but that is all I have noticed so far. Will check back in as the time goes by. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I have been using the Revitalift Volumizing Serum for a week now and although I love the ease of applying and the scent I can't say that I have noticed a difference in the fine lines just yet. I will continue to use this product daily and report back at a later time. Big thumbs up in regards to the packaging-both attractive and useful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really don't know what to say. It smells good. Am I supposed to notice some difference? Do I need all the other products to get results? So it smells good and it goes on nicely without making my face feel slimy or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Loreal Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum is really easy to use and apply. It feels very silky and has a soft floral smell after using for the last week my skin on my face feels amazingly softer and smoother. I rally enjoy applying every morning and every evening. I would recommend this product to my female family members and friends. Thanks SHESPEAKS! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I opened the jar this morning to use it for the first time and when I removed the inside plastic cover, I found that at least 1/4-1/3 of the product is missing. (I uploaded 2 photos to show what I received, however they did not attach for some reason). So, this comment is just about the physical product received. However, I am very excited to try it and report on my actual results. And then I can rate the product on my skin and not on the package. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started to use this item. In 5 days I have noticed a great improvement in my skin. Areas are fuller and more radiant. I can hardly wait to see what else happens in the coming weeks.THANK you for a wonderful product, I will be buying the other items in this line."
I never write reviews but I love this product! It was the perfect texture and the smell was amazing. My face felt instantly hydrated and was super smooth and soft. I've only used it for a week but I do feel like my lines and crows feet are smaller and I just look younger overall. Definitely would recommend!
"I just started using this product and I think it is one of the best products I've used in the revitalift line. It's great for filling in fine lines for the whole day. I especially like the fact it is for day and night. Along with the revitalift serum, the two products make me look great!"
I was expecting more from this product. Will stick to the regular moisturizer with spf

At first I was excited to receive this product along with a few others in my influenster vox box. I received a few L'Oreal skincare items from this collection to try out. I could not use this however. My skin is sensitive to high levels of alcohol in skincare products so I stayed away! The product does smell good though almost reminded me of a higher end skincare line in terms of scent. My opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I honestly can't believe skincare companies still use jar packaging. It is widely known that jar packaging allows far too much of the product to be exposed to oxygen which rapidly breaks down the ingredients in the moisturizer. Instant dud! I was sent this product to review by influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using L'Oreal day/night moisture's for years. I have been very disappointed with this particular product. Within several minutes of applying (typically fresh out of a shower) it peels and flakes off.
I can't use any of these products. I have dry skin and they all contain alcohol. Gave them all to my mom. Received the line from Influenster to review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It really works. I would define toy recommend this to a friend, I already told my mom about it."
"Works best when applied at night. Shipping was delayed, but otherwise I enjoyed my purchase."
It works!
