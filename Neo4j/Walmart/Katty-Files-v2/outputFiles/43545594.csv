"Olay Products I have been using for years like mother like daughter. But since then the new products Olay has been coming out with are beyond my expectations. This cream is lightning my dark spots, within time they will all be gone."
"I've been using this product for a few years now. My skin looks 10 years younger than I am, and being a senior, that is greatly appreciated. People comment that I have a glow about me. About the flakiness, I periodically get that also, and have found that it just takes a tiny amount of the product to work it's magic. Love this product!!"
I have tried my different skin care products over the last couple of years and none have made my skin look so healthy looking as the Luminous line. I have tan and red spots on my cheeks for a few years and in the last two months of using the Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream my spots have faded considerably. My skin is firm and glows. I highly recommend it. My only issues is I can only find it in one store in our area.
I like Oil of Olay skin products. This is a great cream; my skin feels smooth for hours after using it.
"OLay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream is wonderful. It evens out the skin tones, moisturizes, and gives a somewhat youthful glow to my aged skin. Wish it was easier to find in the stores. Love it."
Light and lovely. My skin looks better already. Great product.
I like this cream because it's light for my skin which happens to be oily so I definitely don't need a heavy consistency.
"I was excited to try it to see if it would improve my dark spots. I used it in the morning then applied my makeup, about an hour later, I looked in the mirror and my makeup coverage had become blotchy. I washed my face and applied the lotion again, and I noticed that my makeup was blotchy because the lotion peels off of my skin. I only use it at night now."
I love the way this cream provides a healthy glow to your face.
it is nice but does not cover imperfections
"I love this is so nice, I would recommend it."
"I have dark acne spots on chin and tried this hoping it would lighten & improve their appearance. It blends/absorbs on forehead but turns into a white flakey globby mess on nose, chin & cheeks! I tried again using less but same result. I noticed some reviewers had similar experience while majority had no problem at all. I'm curious as to why (skin type, age, application error?) . Very disappointed & still searching for a product that will help."
"The best product, my skin feels and looks silk smooth like never before."
I had used the skin advisor multiple times and decided when my usual night cream was gone I would purchase this. When I got it I thought it smelled nice. When I first put it on it does feel velvety but only feels like it's workin on the surface of the skin. If I try to rub it in it starts to flake and ball off. After using this my fingers feel sticky like gum. Have not noticed any difference for dark spots.
I am 43 years old and never been a fan of moisturizers. I was using Netrogeon for a while and thought it was finally a moisturizers I actually like as I have combination skin. I tried luminous-tone-perfecting-cream-moisturizer and LOVE IT!!! It makes my skin feel like velvet. And the tone of my skin has improved. I can't stop touching my face. Please continue making this forever.
"No pros, only cons. Left a matte finish. Had the same experience with peeling as other users. Left my skin feeling dry and lonely. Decided to keep it and use it as hand cream, but it even made my cuticles sad. I like the Regenerist microsculpting cream with SPF much better, and that's the one I would recommend."
"I've been using this product for quite a while now and never had any issues, always loved it! It has faded my acne scars quite a bit. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I recently bought a new jar and I too have been having the flakiness issue as other people. I'm not sure if something changed, or if it has to do with other products I'm using (which never was an issue before) It's definitely odd, but I will continue to use it because it works so well for me!"
I will be hesitant to buy this again as I will only use it at night time now because it does flake off if I put makeup on over it after it's dried it actually makes my makeup look very dry and Flaky very disappointed because for the money I was hoping I could wear it under my makeup I will only use it at night now. I even tried using Less on my skin and it still flaky
"I was very excited to try this product to even up my skin tone since I am a fan of the Oil of Olay Regenerist moisturizer, however after application, I noticed it was flaking off unto my clothing and a white residue on my face. Due to opening the product, I did not want to throw away my money so I have opted to continue using the product at night, but I will not be purchasing again after this product is depleted. It appears this is a common problem with this product for many users."
"Began noticing dark uneven skin around right eye after I turned 37. Decided to try Olay, my grandmother used this brand my entire life, after 3 weeks i began to notice a lightening of the skin, continued to use it, nights only, and in 7 weeks skin tone is even and looks great. Absolutely works!!"
same as the problem of other people every time i use it ..it has this flaky residue that peels off from my face.. i bought the miracle boost and the luminous tone moisturizer used it together and follow the direction carefully . the flaky residue still there but i like how it feels on the skin. so just use it at night i guess and not during day time unless they can suggest something to prevent this from happening
And I'm amazed that it delivered results in exactly a 2 week time frame. I wanted to test the strength of it so I applied it only to my under eye dark cirlcles and it worked! Lighter dark cirlcles and those tiny little crystals my concealer look more effective. I'm African american and it's hard to find products that work for me. This stuff is the real deal!
I tried the Luminous Tone product when I couldn't find my regular Micro-sculpting Olay product. I could only use the Luminous Tone product for three days. It has a sticky feel to it and did not have the pleasant smell that I'm used to with Olay products.
"I use more of this product at night and less in the morning. A little goes a long way!! I think anyone who might review it as ""gummy"" might be using too much? I'm in my mid-40's and have combination skin with multiple dark spots. It soothed my dry skin immediately (thank you!) and my skin is finally evening out. I love it and it is worth every penny!"
I was stressed when my skin started breaking out monthly the past 3 months leaving scars and my skin very uneven. I have been using product for almost 2 weeks now and am blow away. I'd say about 80% of my marks and spots have already faded. I can not wait to see my results after 8 weeks. UNREAL! Love it ! Would love to try more of the regenerist line in time .
I've had some dark age spots on my cheek that I tried everything on them. I am a light skinned red head in my 50's and I never should have used tanning beds when I was younger because my skin is paying for it now. The dark spots have faded a lot after using this for a month. I just use it at night. I wouldn't recommend it under make up.
"Deep cleans my body and face,leaves my face feeling fresh and looking young again .making me feel like im young again. It massage my skin making it smooth and soft, this is the best product that i've tried so far and i recemended to everyone..enjoy this product evrytime i step out of the shower"
"Works perfectly on my bumpy face! I have a ton of acne scars and this thing smoothes up my face like never before, I wish for everyone who has acne scars to use this makeup product to help smooth out their beautiful faces. Also there variety of color help match my skin so it looks like nothing is there. Please buy this amazing product because it help me and it'll help you look beautiful every day, at work school even just going out to the store I'll look amazing Every day!"
Goes on smmooth.not greasg...smmmels good.would xef. Recommend..the container is small and compact and easy to carry..the feel on your skin is amazing and it last all day..the feeling ur skin gets after u have been using it for weeks is the very good feeling and i love the samples you guys give out and would hope u guys keep it up..
"The products feels devine, evenly tones the skin and leaves a velvety touch thats good to the feel. When accompanied with other olay facial washes and toners, it gives remarkeble results best facials product i ever used, i gaurd it jelously, cant afford to waste"
This product is very good for your skin. I highly recommend it to anyone who has problems with their skin. My Sister has used this product for years. She is the one who told me to use this product. She's even told Her Daughter and Her Nieces about it as well.
This product is so light yet very moisturizing. My skin looks so much better and brighter. I am almost 36 years old and yet I am told by many people that I look like I'm still in my 20s. People say my skin looks great and ask me what I use all the time. This is also the first product that's not oily and doesn't break my skin out. I highly recommend this product.
Looks and feels luxurious to fingers and face. It goes on smoothly. Gives a fresher look to the face while I experienced the cream soothing the fingers while applying. You can notice a smother complexion and feel plus a slight firming of the skin. Made me feel polished.
"I am a 38 yr old w/dark spots...not cute! I decided to give this a try. I did some research and didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money. I have been using this for a week now and again..""THANK YOU JESUS!"" My dark spots have gotten so much lighter in just one week."
"I love this product! I have been using it for about 4 months now, and I kid you not, ever since I have received so many compliments on my skin looking younger. People don't believe me when I tell them my age (31), they are shocked because I looked like I'm in my mid 20s. And I attribute this all to Olay!!!"
This stuff works so we'll! I'm 29 and get dark spots from acne and sun damage. When I get them I put this cream over them and they disappear within a few hours! I've had my jar for over a year and I'm surprised at how effective it still is. The only thing I don't like is that it is a little on the heavy side but for what it does I think it's worth dealing with!
"I put the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream on right before applying my makeup, and it made my skin glow (in addition to feeling silky soft!). It really helped keep my skin hydrated and saved me from patchy skin and dryness. I would definitely recommend this to those who have trouble finding a day moisturizer that is non-greasy and will actually have your skin looking its best.

"I absolutely loves this product. Must admit that the sample was too small, lol, but hey, I can't complain for being able to try this amazing product for free. Loved it so much as soon as I finished the sample, I went and bought the full size. Love how it not only hydrates my face, but over time it evens out my skin tone as I've had problem areas around my nose and cheeks with redness. My favorite thing about it, is that it's non greasy. My face is looking great and I could t be happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have dealt with uneven skin and hyperpigmentation for a while, so naturally when I recieve a product that is intended to correct tone, I am excited. This product has a nice scent and goes on pretty, even. Its not caky, it moisturizes the skin. I found that it was a great primer to put on prior to application of my makeup. However I did not notice a significant change in the evenness of my skin. Perhaps it works well for minor tone issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"While Olay's Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream does soften the areas in which it is used, I can't say that it does so more than any other regular face lotion and, as far as it's main purpose, I, personally, didn't see a difference (after a month of use). I give it credit for it's moisturizing properties, but I'm afraid it falls short elsewise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried the tone perfecting cream moisturizer by Olay i thought it was okay. It says to use it over our face and neck morning and at night. I didn't like to use it in the morning..because for some reason my make up would roll up with it..making it look like my face was peeling. So i just used it at night before bed. I did its job though moisturized..but im not sure on the tone part. But i would use it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is the best face cream I've ever tried & I would suggest it to anyone looking for a good face moisturizer...it smells great, it's fast absorbing and unlike most face moisturizers I've tried it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy and best of all when it's hot outside it doesn't start to come off when I sweat and make me feel like I'm covered in goop!

This is a great moistuizer it leaves my skin soft and isn't greasy. It helps even out my skin tone which is exactly what I'm looking for in a toner cream. Since trying this campaigns I have purchased this product myself to help even out my skin tone especially now that it's summer time and that's when I need a toner the most.

"I recently burned my face while using essential oils. I actually forgot that I had a sample this coming. I was so happy to see it in the Box. It was the first thing that I use. My scar is barely visible now. I will definitely be purchasing this for future scars and blemishes. It didn't burn, itch, or irritate my face. I applied it every day for 2 weeks, after washing my face. It worked well on my African American skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This product felt nice when it was applied but honestly the sample was too small to tell if it was helping or not. There is absolutely no way to know out of one use if a skin care product is doing anything for you. All I can tell you is it didn't do any harm after I used it. I'm giving it three stars because I have no way of knowing how it actually worked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This cream is perfect! I love it so much! I did improve the dark spots on my face. After a couple of days of using it my skin was clear and glowing. The cream itself is very lightweight. It's not greasy or oily; it's very sheer feeling. Some face moisturizers are too thick and make my face really greasy; not, this! This was perfect!

"I think it made a improvement since using. Im a sceptical on trying new facial products. But since using. My dark spot that appeared a month ago. Is fading. Which i can say the only thing new I've tried, is the tone perfecting cream. No irritation, no peeling. I haven't broke out. So far so good. I just wish it was just a little bigger size. Other than that i will continue recommending it to people! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think people with sensitive skin would be better off avoiding this product. It left my skin red and patchy after the first use. Once the redness died down it seemed alright. But after a few days use I broke out. The texture of the cream was nice, but I can't report any positive changes in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I enjoyed using the cream. I used it daily to make sure i was getting the full benefit. I did notice a differene in my skin after a while, however it was not such a major difference that I would go out and buy the product. However it was nice to use while I had it. If I was a bit older I could see myself potentiojally using it. I really liked the texture of the product and it did not leave my skin feeling greasy.

Just beautiful natural skin is all I desire and this product delivers. I highly recommend it for all skin tones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am definitely going to keep using this product and will be purchasing a full sized bottle as soon as I can find it in stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed using the Olay Tone Perfecter. And that's saying a lot as I rarely use any product on my face. But, this product was different. I loved the way my skin felt after using it - soft and smooth The product itself wasn't too oily, like others I've tried. The consistency was perfect. A small dab goes a long way. This has become a staple within my daily regimen. Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me the opportunity to try another great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think the Olay tone perfecting cream was good. It left my skin feeling soft with a pleasant fragrance. I have combination skin so with its light weight it did not provide sufficient moisture to dry areas causing me to need to use additional moisturizer but it did keep my skin feeling and looking less oily and even.

"When I first used the olay, I didn't care for the texture. It was slightly sticky on my skin and I didn't think I would like it. However, after a few minutes the cream absorbed into my skin and it left it with a silky feel. Other than the initial texture, I enjoyed my experience with it. The fragrance was nice and wasn't overpowering as some creams can be. There wasn't enough of the cream to really tell if it made an overall lasting difference in my skin.

"I think this cream works well as a moisturizer but I'm not so sure about correcting my blemishes. I have dark spots under my chin from folliculitis caused by ingrown hairs and have been hoping to find something to lighten that skin. So far, I haven't had great results. My skin feels smoother and I can see some of the exfoliating properties working but nothing to write home about in regards to the hyperpigmentation.

"I started using the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream as soon as I received my BzzAgent kit. The first thing that I noticed was the smell. It smelled really good. I love that the formula was not super thick it was a nice lotion texture that didn't leave my face feeling heavy at all. I used it in the morning and at night. And I like how my makeup applied after using it. Depending on the price, I might be purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have lots of battle scars from acne and am always searching for a magical product. The smell of the product is alright. I think it's brightened my face but my skin doesn't seem repaired. I think I'm hoping too much for better skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"As a person that doesn't really use many facial products, I was more than pleasantly surprised by this product. It has a very light clean scent and did not feel like a mask on my skin. I've been blessed with pretty good skin but this definitely left my face/neck feeling softer and smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think that the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is a good product. It moisturized my face, but I feel like it left my face sticky. It was hard to apply makeup straight onto the face, so I had to mainly use it at night. It did improve my skin's tone, but the stickiness was a turn off. I am sure they have many great products, but I would say this one is just a good one, for me. I would try their other products without hesitation; this one just isn't for me!

I have extremely oily skin and this moisturizes and seems to keep my skin a bit less oily. I also have some acne scarring that seemed to lighten up over the course of a couple weeks! I would highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think that the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone perfecting Cream didnt work as much as id like for me. It smelled great and it was very creamy but after using it i felt it left a Residue On my face. I have darker marks just from uneven skin tone and i was hoping id see a difference but after a week and a half of using it i didnt see any changes. Im going to continue to use until the trial size runs out just give it time to actually hopefully work. But for now im not too impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think that this product is something I will continue to try. I never have tried the Olay brand hair products so I can not compare it to the other products from the brand. I like how the brand is for all hair types and can be used for any age. I have thick hair and this works very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This cream is very moisturizing, i noticed a difference in my skin in about a week. My skin was softer, and my pores minimized a little bit. The con about this cream is that you have to put it on right after you wash you face. If you let you face dry and put it on, it's still gonna feel dry.

The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is great! It is not too oily and it moisturizes my face really well.

"I think this cream was very good to use because it didn't leave my face feeling oily or ""heavy"". A lot of creams or lotions can leave my face feeling dirty almost, especially after you go outside and the sun starts causing sweat, the creams and lotions can start to cake and make it worse.

I know with products like this its hard to sample because the sample was so small and you could only apply once so i didnt see a difference in my face. Tho it smells great i dont think it works well on makes ur face feel funny when your in the sun. So nice but its not for me plus its a tad costly. And would have to go to a retail store to by it in most cases. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I opened this cream skeptically and thought, ""No way is this going to work."" Carefully I applied the cream to my face and thought, ""What can it hurt?"". The next morning, my face still felt incredibly smooth. The texture, the tone and the touch of my skin were greatly improved. So, if once or twice made that much of a difference, why not stick with it?! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I'm not a big face screen person. I've been using loreal for many years now. I do have olay daily moisturizer that I also been using for many years now. I like to stick to the ones I'm used to because I'm afraid of breakouts and alergic reactions. This cream was okay and didn't amaze me to move to continue it or buy one.

"I've never liked any of the creams I've tried, until now! I LOVE this cream!! It feels silky & smooth! Like a satin finish on my skin! It takes very little to cover my face & neck. And it smells wonderful! Not too strong, very light & clean smelling. No chemical smell like others I've tried. I received this in a sample size, 0.24 ounce. I've used it almost a week now, day & night, and still have plenty left! I will definitely be purchasing the full size! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"My beautiful mother- in-love just revealed her secret after all these years! She gave me a bottle of Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin she had in her medicine cabinet. I didn't know if this product worked well on African American skin.I can't wait to try more products, I have dark circles around my eyes and I'm looking for a good skin toner to use. My daughters are 19 and 23 and I will encourage them to start using Olay from now as well"
"I actually like the Olay Regenerist Luminous cream. I only use this at Night because I use a sunscreen cream along with a primer and it would've been too much. Well after cleansing my face at night I applied the cream and it sank right in, not leaving me a greasy residue. It moisturized my skin while not being too slick. I am hoping to get rid of these hyperpigmented marks on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I absolutely love this stuff the first day I put it on I was a little skeptical on how it would react to my face since it's a little sensitive. It was the complete opposite my face felt so soft throughout the day with no breakouts or oil skin. The smell of the Olay tone perfection cream is great and glad it wade by a dull scent.

So I tried the olay tone perfecting cream and I must say it had made my face feel wonderful at least. Unlike other creams that leave my face dry.

"I have been using the Olay tone perfecting cream before bed, and before I put on my makeup. I even use it alone sometimes. I absolutely love it I have noticed quite an improvement with my skin, I have dark marks on my chin and those have been slightly disappearing. I am excited about this because it will make so much difference once my wedding comes in 2 months! I like it, I wish the sample was bigger!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I didn't think it moisturized very well, and my face was a little red after. It will probably be good for someone that doesn't have very sensitive skin!!

"I have been an Olay consumer for about 5years now. I have always been pleased by Olay quality. The luminous felt good when applying and gave my face a nice matte glow.I have oily acne prone skin which is a decent moisturizer but it doesn't prevent lines, wrinkles and crows feet. I washed my face like normal, it burned a little when I applied it to a pimple. But overall I have only positive reactions for oil of Olay reginerist luminous.

"I love how smooth the cream is and how the smell is pleasant. My skin feels extremely soft. This is only my first time using it so I am not sure how well it works, but, based on Olay's reputation, I can imagine it will be a great product and I'll need to buy more.

"I am so in love with this free sample I got from bzzagent! The product is smooth and creamy. It's not oily or greasy at all, my sometimes acne prone skin sucks it up so quickly but has not caused any breakouts. I have been using it for about a week and notice that my skin tone is more even. I wash my face and apply the product once my face is dry and then apply foundation! #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really do like the cream. I suffer from very oily skin and this product does not make my skin feel oily at all. At first I would only put it on in the morning to see how it did with my makeup, which it did good! then I started putting it on at night and i woke up with my skin feeling good and refreshed in the morning.

This cream was nice and lasts a long time but it made my skin peel.. I'm not sure if my skin was just dry or if the oroduct is supposed to do that. It goes on better after you exfoliate.. Still would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I really like this product. I could do without the scents just because I feel like those are not good for my skin, but I am not sure. It makes my face feel really nice after I shower.

I think that the Olay Tone Perfector is a great product. The smell is very fresh and it absorbs into skin very nicely. It reminds me of a primer. Pores appear dimished and makeup goes on flawlessly over it. No oily residue! If the price is right I will definitely buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've been using the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream for about a week now. I'm not impressed with it. The product leaves a residue on your fingers, and it makes my skin feel sticky.

"The Olay Perfecting Cream is amazing. If you looking for a correcting cream that isn't greasy or thick on the face, Olay Perfecting Cream is the one, I don't normally moisturize my face when I'm done washing it, because I have oily skin, but this cream made me reconsider it. I love the consistency and texture, when applied correctly. This product deserves a round of applause!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I loved this! And I didn't expect to. I usually don't use products like this but I did for the sake of this review. I am so happy I did!

"The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream worked wonders in just my FIRST use! These past few months I've been battling dry, flaky skin, but when I used the tone perfecting cream, my skin was evenly moisturized and supple. There's no greasy feeling, and it doesn't break out my skin. This is definitely going into my regular beauty regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I absolutely love this Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. I washed my face with just warm water and let it air dry. Once my face was dry I used the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream and it made my skin so soft and smooth! I wish the sample was a little bigger though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This stuff rocks! I have pretty difficult skin so to find a tone perfecting cream that actually helps has been beyond amazing. I'm actually looking my age (23) and not 10 - 15 years older! I'll definitely be making this a part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this product is great because it's for anyone who wants to look younger. I usually don't know what to apply to my face after washing it so I use lotion. However this is specifically made for your face. My face felt fresh and looked less tired after I applied this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product feels so nice on my face. I used it for the past week after I got out of the shower and it didn't make my face feel dirty . It is light weight and a little goes a long way. I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like this tone perfecting cream. I feel like it moisturizes my face without being too oily. I've used this sample for 7 days so can't really say if my skin looks younger but it does seem to give my face a glow! It seems comparable to other anti-aging/rejuvenating creams.

"I really enjoyed trying out this product! I applied it to my face night and day for a couple of days and I must say it made my skin feel very soft and healthy. Very moisturizing, it didn't feel heavy nor did it clog my pores. The consistency of it wasn't too thick or too thin. One thing I really liked is that it had a pleasant smell, something most creams I've previously used didn't have. I would like to know how others felt about this cream. It is something I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using this product for about four days. I love that it makes my skin feel really smooth and also has a nice smell. I clean my face with a wash and then apply this cream before I apply my makeup. I haven't used the product long enough to see the toning change but I will continue to use this product.

"I think this is a good product. It glides on smoothly, has a pleasant smell and was absorbed quickly. It didn't leave my skin needing more, it wasn't to much, and it wasn't greasy. I would definitely purchase this product to see what the long term effects on my skin would be. The sample size is the only reason I had to give it 4/5. It just wasn't enough to see any long term benefit. I must say though that the short term benefits were great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really love this cream! I have been using it on my face the past few days and really like how well it moisturizes my skin. I have naturally pretty dry skin, so I have to moisturize daily. This cream really blended in well and did not leave a greasy feeling on my skin at all! It wasn't watery or too thick. It had such a nice consistency to it. My only wish is that I could have it in a bigger bottle- I will be sure to get a refill at the store once my tube is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This cream is a bit heavy for the consumer with combination skin. I was shiny on the places of my face that are normally dry. The fragrant was subtle and that's the best I can say in regards to the ""positives"" of this product. What was so disappointing is that I saw no change in my skin appearance after two weeks of usage. The claims of ""luminous"" skin and skin perfecting benefit were not evident in my use. This at best is a decent moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I never knew a moisturizer could be this light and moisturizes your skin so well. It feels silky on your skin and goes on smoothly. It also smells amazing! I definitely see my self purchasing the full sized bottle. I do recommend this to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. A little does go a long way.

My skin is combination skin this product didn't make my skin feel too oily certainly helped in the dry patch areas of my face and went on nice. I don't think my skin is very uneven but there are a few areas that could use some smoothing I'll post a better review after I use it a bit more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product every morning and I can say I do see a difference with my face. It seems to keep it hydrated and it doesn't seem as dry as it has been.

"I was skeptical at first to try the tone perfecting cream from Olay. I am 30 and never thought about face creams, I have changed my mind! This product left my face so soft to the touch, and it toned just where I needed it to, it defined the apples of my cheeks, I never noticed how they drooped, after trying ONE time I noticed a big difference in my complexion, my husband also noticed! One more positive it smells great as well, doesn't smell like your ""grandmother's face cream"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think I had really high hopes for this product, but it was okay. I read online it takes 2 weeks to even skin tone out, but as of this moment, it doesn't really moisturize. It smells lovely and all. I will continue to keep using this product and hopefully I will grow to like this, but I'm not sold on it.

This product smells amazing and has a nice creamy texture but I had an immediate reaction to it. I rarely get acne and I ended up with patches on my face a few hours after using this product.

"I think this is a great product to possibly add to my skin regiment. I have been on a mission for the past few months to even out my skin tone. I use this product after my nightly face wash and toner application. I love that this product isn't heavy or overly scented. It leaves my skin hydrated but not oily. I think I will give it the advertised 8 weeks and see what kind of results I get. For now it's too early to tell, but so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I loved the fruity smell of this lotion and the way it felt so velvety when I put it on my face. I'm not sure about tone correcting?

"I have been using this product everyday for a week now and so far it has kept my skin moisturized but not oily. I already have oily skin so I only use just a dot of this stuff in certain areas on my face, for example, under my eyes, nose, and chin. These are my problem areas so after I wash my face in the morning and evenings, I apply a little in each area and my skin gets softer and smoother in those areas.

I already have oily skin so I only use just a dot of this stuff in certain areas on my face, for example, under my eyes, nose, and chin. These are my problem areas so after I wash my face in the morning and evenings, I apply a little in each area and my skin gets softer and smoother in those areas. Time will only tell if this product will hold up but so far I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved this product OMG I have dry skin but after I apply this product on my face it instantly felt 1000 times better and looked better too my face was soft, smooth and radiant I loved it so much I already purchased the product in full size also I invested in other Olay products.

"I think the cream has a great feel and scent, but I don't like that it doesn't rub all the way into the skin. It seems to have a slight bronzer tint and if that is the case then it's more like makeup than correcting the dark spots. I hope all of Olays products aren't just a camouflage for real correction treatment. Maybe I need to have a larger sample to truly see how effective it is over a month or so period of time.

So far I have been using it for the past three nights... I have an uneven skin tone with red cheeks... So far I haven't seen too much of a difference. The pros: it doesn't cause further irratatation. Light smell Not greasy not he skin Cons: haven't seen much of a difference though it has only been 3 days. Will continue to use to see if there becomes a difference. Fingers crossed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this product goes on smoothly and has a pleasant scent. I only tried the product for a couple of days and haven't notice any changes in my skin tone yet. I like the fact that the product does not leave any residue or white streaks on my skin. I do which maybe the cream was a little bit thicker. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I feel in love the instant after I applied it to my face. Softening and very light. I raved so much about it my boyfriend applied it to his face after shaving and was amazed as well.

"I have never liked putting lotion or cream on my face because I felt it made my face oily, but this cream makes me change my mind! I use it every morning when I get up, and before I go to bed, and I have noticed a change in my complexion. It's very light on the skin, it moisturizes my skin without giving me the oily feel, and it smells great also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Love the creamy texture. Very lightweight. Your pores don't feel clogged. Gives a nice healthy glow throughout the day. Ive used this for about 4 days now in the mornings after showering on clean face and usually apply a little Olay firming cream over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love the sample of the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. It went on smooth and had a pleasant smell. My combination skin felt moisturized all day. The only thing I wish is that the cream also had sun protection. I'm busy in the morning so I like things that have a dual purpose. Less time in the getting myself ready would be nice.But overall I like the quality, texture, smell and effectiveness of this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think that Olay will always be great with moisturizing creams.The tone preferctor was absolutely wonderful when using after washing my face for a fresh moisturized feeling.I know that it is a toning cream but I didn't see any difference in my skin with toning correction maybe because I had a really small sample size.Yes,I will be purchasing this product in the future.

"Love the moisturizing cream! It almost seem as if my face did not become dry for most of the part of the day. I apply the cream each night after i shower and just a tad bit after washing my face in the morning.

I've been using it for a few days now and I can already see a difference. I feel like my skin is more even toned and brighter. It's also a lot more hydrated. I love applying it after I cleanse my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've heard good things about this product so I was really excited to try this out. I was really disappointed. I have acne scars and uneven skin tone. This didn't really improve either of them. I put it on every morning after I washed my face and put on toner. I didn't see any changes. None of my acne scars even looked slightly faded. This product didn't even work as a moisturizer. My skin was still dry after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I fully expected Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream to have a vitamin like smell similar to most moisturizers I was so wrong it smells heavenly and it doesnt have a nasty residue Plus it leaves your skin soft to the touch i can't wait to see how my skin reacts to it it's so hard to find a good moisturizer especially one that smells Great #gotitfree #MBIB # ageless #buzzagent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've only been using Play Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream for a total of 4 days now, once in morning and once before bed.But so far it has been leaving my skin smooth and soft! The cream has a light content so it doesn't weigh on your skin like other creams. I'm definitely going to continue using this product to clear my face, it's really works.

"I recently tried this product and at first i was really impressed and I liked how it was a cream moisturizer but wasnt greasy or anything.

I'm very content with this product it definitely leaves a luminous tone and results are very noticiable!

I don't ever use stuff on my skin beacuse of the fear of money wasted and false hopes. Of buy the olay toning cream beacuse I saw results in one days use! Not only did I feel like I had the glow I should and made my sub spots on my nose less visible. even my husband noticed it too.i just applied it after washing my face in the morning and like lotion let it dry and sink in. Went about my normal routine.Made me feel more confident in my natural skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think only regenerist lotion makes my skin feel much better and better than it did before. You should no that it makes your skin much softer and clear.

I haven't been seeing any tone perfecting yet but that might been cause I haven't used it as long as months. It says its also suppose to be moisturizing but I face didn't feel as moisturize when using it so I used it in addition to another face lotion I used. It did give my skin a bit of a matte finish but still not that moisturizing. It did smell nice I must admit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've never liked any of the creams I've tried, until now! I LOVE this cream!! It feels silky & smooth! Like a satin finish on my skin! It takes very little to cover my face & neck. And it smells wonderful! Not too strong, very light & clean smelling. No chemical smell like others I've tried. I received this in a sample size, 0.24 ounce. I've used it almost a week now, day & night, and still have plenty left! I will definitely be purchasing the full size!"
"It works wonders! I love it so much. It really does the trick! At first i wasnt sure if it was working but just give it a couple of weeks, youll definitely see results. Im so happy i decided to just get it. It I give it 5/5 stars!! I hope youll get the same results that i did! :)"
I think that this product does make your skin more picture perfect. The reason I say this is because it actually is blending my skin to match the rest an that's only a weeks use. Its incredible I'm most certainly going to buy this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Usually when I go for a moisturizer or face cream I go for the unscented fragrance . I don't like how this made my face smell extra perfumy! I usually use my rose petal toner and a moisturizer. But this cream made my face feel tingly. For anyone who prefers more natural smelling products this is NOT FOR US! But I like the idea of the product! Because of the smell alone and the tingly sensation I will NOT use this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It didn't burn or irritate my skin, as I tend to have sensitive skin towards new products. I only applied a dime sized amount and dotted it on my forehead, cheeks, nose and chin and then rubbed it in. So far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"First thing first . The first thing I do when I first tryout a new product like shampoos or lotions is to SMELL. If it doesn't have a decent scent, I probably wouldn't want to use it. The Olay regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream smells great. It's very light and airy. Once it was on my face it glides on easy and doesn't feel greasy . It's been a few days so no visable changes to the skin. But it does feels nice once it's on. I think that this Olay product is worth the try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This morning was the first day I tried the Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream and only using a little dab on my finger I was able to use it on my entire face. I paid close attention to my problem areas around my eyes. My face is oily naturally but this product did not add any more additional oils to my skin at all. As far as changing or perfecting my skin tone I'll report on that once I've completed the tube. I'm liking it so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I just started using the Olay Tone perfecting cream so I am hoping that this will be my new wonder cream. I am getting married in July and it would be wonderful to have glowing radiant skin. So far so good, it feels really silky and smooth when applying and it doesn't dry my skin out. Here's to you Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

So I want to start off by saying I wish I had more of the sample to give it a thorough review but so far so good. I love the smell and consistency of the Olay Tone Perfecting Cream. Tonight after I washed my face I applied this cream and I will say that the finish to me is similar to a primer. It didn't leave the hydrating feeling I was looking for but I will try again in the morning under my makeup to see if I feel a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I used the perfecting cream after my facial scrub and in all honesty, I have never had my face feel so soft!! the smell is wonderful and you can definitely feel your skin firm up after using. I recommend this to all who have a daily skin washing routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"So upon receiving my Bzzkit I was super excited about this moisturizer because I've been looking for a good one. So the day I was supposed to go take pictures I used this after my cleanser and before I applied my makeup, then again that night before bed. Now I have these red splotchy bumps on my face! I'm obviously not happy at all. I will say my skin was soft and makeup went on smooth and the smell is lovely but I had an adverse reaction and that's just my experience thus far.

Love the results. I've always had insecurities with my uneven skin tone and this toner is fixing it one step at a time. It's lightweight and doesn't feel caked on. 10/10. I feel like you should buy this if you have an uneven skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I washed my face in my dove bar soap and pat my face dry with a paper towel them applied the Luminous Tone it went on fine I saw a slight difference but it leaves my face dry.

"I have very problematic, very sensitive skin. I get acne even though I'm in my early twenties, and I tend to look like a high schooler even in the most professional environments. I've tried every moisturizer I can find, and all of them have made me break out more. This cream has been the only product that hasn't made my skin act up. I'm so glad I found this cream!

"I love this product. Smells amazing. It goes on very smooth and lightweight. It somewhat turns into a matte touch after it dries. I will definitely buy this in the near future. So glad Bzz sent me this to try, only wish it was bigger lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have never used a toner in my life. Boy was that a mistake! Thanks to BzzAgent and Olay I got the pleasure of being able to try something I never thought of buying. What a difference this product made for me. Today as I got out the shower I was eager to put this on. I usually apply a small amount of lotion on my face but I put the toner on and it is so light and not greasy! After I use it all up I'm going tothe store and getting more.

I think this product is super smooth and makes the skin feel well hydrated and young. It's crucial in a cold climate like here in Michigan. This time of the year is hard on the skin and this went on nice and light and spread really evenly. I've enjoyed using it and found it to be very refreshing though I believe it will take consistent use to see visible differences in the brightness of my skin.

"i am really impressed with the Olay Regenerist Luminous tone perfecting cream. I usually skip facial creams due to having excessively oily skin, especially before applying makeup but i applied this to my face as a primer underneath my foundation and i love it. i noticed that it moisturized my face without leaving an oily residue. i can see this being a part of my daily skin care routine.

I think the Okay Regenerist Luminous Tone perfector is a great product! I rinsed my face then applied it. I noticed my skin brightened a little to add a glow to my skin. My face looks even and no makeup is needed. My face looks like a bronzer was applied except the skin is all natural. I am so happy to try this product for free. I love being a BzzAgent! I can't wait to spread the word to my friends and family. This product is a must have beauty product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First i want to start with i don't have a problem with olay products by they don't work. The only problem i do have is the texture. It always feels powdery. Second the product smells great. Besides the powdery feel it goes on smooth. Its light weight. Doesnt give off the feel of clog pores. Just one use my skin feels hydrated and soft. Can't quit judge any toning till i give this product 1 full week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream Moisturizer feels wonderful. I have sensitive skin and there is no itching or caked up feeling after applying the cream.

The Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream is amazing. It made my skin feel soft and smooth and most importantly moisturized. It had a subtle smell to it thats not too overpowering and i like that i didn't have to use much for full coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My skin baseline is good. Adding this moisturizer to my daily regimen just made my skin soft hydrated and smooth finish. I substituted my usual moisturizers with Olay. It feels good when applying foundation on it. On my 3rd day of application that's my conclusion. It's supposed to remove age/sunspots but I haven't given it enough time. So I will keep you updatef. #gotitforfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think that this moisturizer was pretty good. When I put it on my skin, it felt like silk afterwards! I was pretty impressed with it. It was lightweight and didn't make my skin oily or greasy. The reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because about an hour after I applied it, my skin was dry again. It didn't feel like I put anything on my skin! I do have dry skin, so I'm sure that's why. If I had more normal skin or even oily skin it would work better for me personally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I normally don't use face moisturizers with fragrance, because of my sensitive skin, but this product was an exception. When I first opened the cap, I was intrigued by the delicate smell. After washing my face and applying, it instantly caused my face and neck to feel smooth. I will purchase a full bottle in the near future, and wished that I receive a full sample, Thanks.

"I am not an avid user of Olay products but this tone perfecting cream caught my eye because I battle with uneven skin tone. It usually takes up to a month for a product to start showing any signs of effectiveness but this product does show potential. I quite frankly have only been using this product for the past couple of days. It hasn't been up to a week but like I said earlier, this product shows potential.

The consistency is not to thick and it has a smooth finish, The product is light and not greasy. After using Olay tone Perfecting cream i did notice my face was moisturized and it felt smooth. Olay also has a slight fragrance but it is not irritating. I do believe i would by this product based on how my skin felt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I've only had the product for 2 days now and I've only got to try it out for two days so far...

I like this stuff. It works well enough to make my skin soft and smooth. I love how it blends into my skin well and I don't feel like I have to use a lot of it to see results. It has a light scent which is pleasant and not overbearing. It's also moisturizing but not overly. The only thing I don't like about the product is its consistency. It was a bit runny to me. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry skin or dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think the product is awesome. Works really well with my type of skin. Because my skin is super sensitive, certain products either don't work or break my skin out. This product actually helps. My skin is usually dry so I didn't know of any good products that kept it moisturized until I tried this one. It works really well and I'd recommend to anyone with dry skin that needs a little moisturizing! It was a pleasure trying out something new! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think this cream has a possibility of being great but the sample I received was so little I got 1 good wash out of it . It did foam up nicely & left no film on my face after & felt nice on my face . Too bad I couldn't get a better feel of the product . I did price it in stores & for the price I would not get it again since I couldn't even tell if it would work [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried this cream for the first time when i got the sample in my Buzz kit. My skin is fairly normal, but i do suffer from sun spots and I am always searching for a cream to help minimize the appearance of my dark spots. I used this cream and my skin felt amazing afterwords. It gave my skin a beautiful glow and kept me very hydrated overnight. It smells amazing too and did not irritate my skin at all. I am definitely going to get a full size of this product to test it further. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The top of the cream container is peeling off, sometimes it gets into the cream and gets on my face. Should I call the manufacture of this product and let them know what is going on with it? I use this product everyday and love it. I ordered this from Sams Club online auction and it arrived right on time."
no other product is as good as olay ive used product after product nothing will never stand before olay products try them there the best thanks olay keep them coming if you use just one time you will ee what i mean olay makes your skin feel baby soft i love feeling soft as a new born baby so thanks olay
"I tried to put less product on my skin, like I've read in some comments, but, I still having issues with some white residue. I'm trying less expensive products like nivea moisturizer now and it works, no matter how much product I put on, no white stuff on my face."
"I am so disappointed by this! I used more than 10 jars of this and my dark spots are still there. I live in CA, so I think, this face lotion needs a high SPF protection in its formula... because without it, it is actually useless! I spend money on this for nothing! The sun still does some damage!"
I love this product but not sure if anyone else is experiencing the same effects. After applying just a small amount of luminous moisturizer it leaves a white residue all over my skin..almost like flakes..very disappointed. Not sure if am using too much but doubt it..other products like the pro x line does the same thing to me?? Probably won't buy again
I am writing this review to let Olay know I love the Rengenrist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream! Please do not take this product off the market. I can tell a difference in the freshness to the look of my skin. My skin looks vibrant. This product does not cause breakout as most other moisturizer do. The scent is show and appealing to the senses.
"Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream made my skin feel rehydrated and seemed to me to smooth out my skin tone. I felt it was much more affordable than many department store creams I have used and I felt it was a product well worth repurchasing.. At my age, I feel I am searching for the impossible, the illusive ""fountain of youth."" Time takes its toll, but this product made me feel as good as possible and that is probably the best I can expect.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product. I tried this perfecting cream at a store and immediately felt the smooth silky feeling. I have always used OLAY product but by far this one is my favorite. After washing my face with Olay bar I smear this cream all over. My face which feels dry and tight immediately gets this smooth silky feeling and if I can say I feel younger! When I forget to put it on and leave my house I don't want to be seen by anyone cause I feel old tired looking! Love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream goes on so smoothly and feels light and airy. As the summer months approach, a lighter touch is comfortable and quick to apply. As women age, the skin requires a bit more maintenance to keep skin moisturized, natural and vibrant looking. Olay does a beautiful job in smoothing and evening out irregular skin tones caused by age spots and sun exposure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the regenerist luminous tone sculpting moisturizer as part of a free box from a product testing website and I instantly fell in LOVE with this moisturizer. I used every last drop of it. It made my skin feel so healthy at the end of the day. I will definitely be repurchasing this product and including it in my daily beauty routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olalla!! I really love this cream,I used it everyday. I noticed a good result the first week I was using it , my skin is really smooth and gentle and a lot of my friends notice it so I told them this product,my skin is glowing and it makes me more beautiful and confident!! So what are you waiting for?! Grab one now!"
"Been using this cream for almost 2 years,This last May I was 76 year old,and do not look 1 day older than 60. my Son tells me that i look younger than some of his friends :-) he is 54, I have used Oil of Olay from the age of 21 and I know that this product worked well for me!

I am a 2nd generation Oil of Olay user. My Mom started using this product in the late 60's and was the only product she used until 2009. I have used different Olay products and love them but I found Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream creates a luminous texture to my face and neck. It's light but penetrates my skin making less small lines and plumping up my skin. I love the dewy glow and at 58 and looking 48 it's all Oil of Olay!

I had used micro sculpting cream forever but felt it a little heavy for daytime use. The tone perfecting luminous does just what is says and yet is creamy enough for use at night also = double blessing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
leaves my skin hydrated. My skin feels smooth. Helps to slightly fade dark spots. Moisturizers and helps keeps wrinkles away. I would surely recommend regenerist luminous tone perfecting cream to my relatives and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have religiously used Oil of Olay every night for many years. It leaves my skin moisturized and glowing. I don't like going without. People always ask me what I use on my skin and are shocked when they find out my age. It definitely makes a difference. I even use it on my tween daughter's skin. It's never too early to start!""

"I love the Olay Regenerist cream because it makes my skin look so much better and the moisturizer sinks in to help with small lines. It doesn't take very much to cover my whole face either, which is nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the Complete line for moisturizing for the last 10 yrs. My sister gave me a jar of the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream to try. (she is older than me ;o)) The first time I tried it, I immediately fell in love with it. It made my face and neck feel sooooo soft. I cannot be without it. I recommend it to all my friends, even the younger ones! Thank you for making it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product goes on and feels amazing - not sticky, or smelly. It makes my skin feel so nice. The only issue I have had is that sometimes my Olay CC cream does not go on well over it, it doesn't stay on. I have solved this by turning this into a night cream, or using it on my neck and decollete only, and using the Regenerist SPF 50 lotion under my make up, which works very well.

"I love the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, so it's very easy to put on, and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth, also it smells great, I sometime likes to put it on my hands, because it makes my hands feel super soft, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I saw results in the first month. I had a lot of dark marks left behind from horrible acne. In the first 2 weeks I noticed the dark marks were lighter. By the end of the first 30 days most of the dark marks were gone. By the end of the second month all the dark marks were gone. I was over joyed, and very satisfied with the results. I was so impressed I began using it on my neck and chest. Very impressed with the results. I have a clear, glowing, youthful face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so happy to see the positive results in my facial skin within 4 weeks! I have always been a 'sun worshipper' and I always will be. The product does what it says, and because of my first hand positive experience using it, I will continue using this product knowing that I will receive it's great results! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
We will want instant gratification and the thought of actually trying something and sticking with it for more than five days 10 days or even 30 days it's hard to do. I actually can say I noticed a difference in the product almost immediately the next day my skin felt better look better and had a different look and texture. I'm excited to say at 45 I feel like I got my glow back and it's all because of this product thank you for giving proof in a package and making it work.

I have enjoyed using this product for several months. My face has several sun spots or darker spots that I believe are blending in better with my regular skin tone and getting lighter the more I use the product. Also it feels so soft to my skin and has such a nice consisitency that I also feel better moisturized as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product! After only one week of using the Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, I saw noticable improvement in both the tone of my skin and even less wrinkles and was complimented on how young I look by my husband! It's definately a keeper in my daily beauty regiment! I am anxious to see more fabulous results in the continuation of using Olays Regenerist products!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product provides the results it says it will. I have sun-damaged and chemo stressed skin. I have been looking for a product to turn back the hands of time along with being gentle enough to manage my aggravated chemo skin. Olay products fit the bill perfectly. So happy with my skin looking better and better all the time. Thank you Olay for making gentle yet effective products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product does exactly what it says it will. I am 68, so spots have been appearing all over my face and the color uneven. This evens it out and makes my skin even toned. It also gives your skin a soft, smooth hydrated feel. I love all of the Regenerist products and use them. I find they are the best at keeping my skin the way I want it to be. I would be lost without them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the new line of Luminous products! The tone perfecting cream makes my face feel so soft and moisturized. Most important for me, it really has faded my age spots. This is the first cream I have tried that really reduced the darkness of my age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In my younger years I didn't protect my skin from the sun like i should have. I gave this product a try and after about 2 weeks i did notice the sun spots diminish. While i do still have the spots, they are lighter in color and my skin is silky smooth. It is a staple in my morning regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a creamy, lightweight feel to it. I've received several compliments on my skin after using it a few weeks. Not that my skin was in horrible condition, because I've used Olay products since I was 16, but there is a difference, healthy look to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just a drop of this cream makes my skin feel alive,soft and youthful. Regenerist soaks in and blends with the skin. Others feel like they coat the top layer but do not penetrate. You don't need much, therefore, it lasts a long time before having to repurchase. There is nothing else like it and i have tried many. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product gives spectacular results! I had a large ""age spot"" on my cheek and in a few weeks, it disappeared! Finally a product that keeps its promise! I have been using this product on my hands to make them look younger too. I'm hoping Olay will develop a formula for hands and body.....Are you listening Olay?..

I've been using the Regenerist for about 4 months and the cream seems to be the finishing touch to getting smoother looking skin. Your face seems to get a gentle polishing/smoothing look. it also hydrates and moisterizes at the same time without being greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is just what I was looking for. My mother has been using Olay since I was a little girl and I grew up using it for a while (Oil of Olay). Now it is a treat to have such a vast choice of Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had a very rough patch on my face and I began to use the regs deist pore sculpting cream and after about 2 weeks the pores got smaller and the rough patch disappeared and makeup was a pleasure to put on. I looked great and my face feels great! Love regenerist! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a few sun spots & freckling on my face. I used the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream for about 3 weeks. I was able to tell that the sun spots & freckling had noticeably lightened. It's a great moisturizer too!! I highly recommend this product for anyone who desires luminous skin!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am into my six weeks using this product and I already noticed that some of the dark spots on my face have disappeared.

"I've always loved the Olay skincare line, but I LOVE the Luminous products! Since using the tone perfecting cream I've noticed my skin looking younger. It not only helps exfoliate dead skin, but hydrate and brighten my face, even the dark circles under my eyes! Thanks Olay for this skincare line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been searching for a product to tone and revitalize my brown skin. This product has done wonders to fade my dark spots, while improving my entire complexion.

"I've been using this product for a couple of months now and it is by far the best product I have ever used. After cleansing each night, I apply this product and my face feels velvety smooth instantly. No greasiness, no irritation and great results. I've seen a definite change in evenness of tone and smoothing of wrinkles & lines. My skin loves this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the tone perfecting cream. I have a sensitive-combo-oily/dry skin type. I use this in the morning and before I go to bed; after I've washed with Olay Age Defying cream cleanser, and closed my pores with the toner. Trust me; this product is worth every penny! The product is not oily nor does it irritate my skin. Furthermore, it brightens and illuminates my face. I feel 100% more beautiful when I use it! Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At almost 37 and with a very sensitive skin, I have always had issues with getting a cream that will not make my skin break out and that will help reduce the dark spots on my face. With Olay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, my skin is incredibly soft and brighter, it does not make my skin break out and it helps my skin look great. The best part is, I started seeing positive changes in less than one week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay products for a long time. I started when the only Olay product was the very basic moisturizer. Since that time I have used many of the different categories of product. Currently I am using the Regenerist line and just love the luminous tone perfecting cream. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I use it under makeup and it is never too oily. Just want to say I have been in love with Olay for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this since the product came out in the stores.It fades out the dark spots,age spots and evens out the skin tone.It is non greasy and you get healthy looking skin in about eight weeks.It is worth the price you have to pay for it.Your face looks so much better.

I used regular Regenerist moisturizing lotion for years and was very happy with the results. I have been using Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream now for almost a year.

I have been using Regenerist products for many years. Recently I decided to try Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream as my moisturizer and I am loving this product.

"I have blotchy, sensitive skin and the Olay Regenerist Tone Perfecting Cream is the best product I have tried (and I have tried MANY!) Is NON IRRITATING, goes on smooth and silky and feels GOOD and NOT HEAVY on my face! Also I have noticed it actually IMPROVES the look of my uneven skin! I only wish it had a SPF in it so I don't have to wear 2 moisturizers when I go outside. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one product that lives up to its press. If it had sunscreen it would be perfect. I could actually see my face get brighter as the days progressed. It goes on easily.

This is the absolute best product that gives my skin a luminous glow. I truly fell in love with the results. My skin looks so bright and beautiful. I have now even tried the overnight mask and what a pleasant surprise. The both of these together are marvelous. The look and feel of my skin is truly wonderful.

"Been using Olay lotions & creams seems like forever. Have switched off here & there, but always come back to Olay. Seems to be the brand my skin reacts too. Love the feel of the hydrating creme after washing my face. Feels refreshed & smooth. The tone perfecting cream great after a shower. Makes my skin clearer & it's not greasy. The night moisturizer seems to calm the dry flaky parts of my skin. Love these products, wouldn't leave home without them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using the usual regenerist microsculpt on the red container for a while but needed a little more 'oomph' to help erase the dullness that had set in. The Tone Perfecting cream really lived up to its promise - even out the skin tone, minimize small discolorations and fine lines, especially around the eyes and mouth. My skin feels healthier and fairly glows even if I don't use face makeup, only the cream. I use it at night, too. An exceptional product at an affordable price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I super love it! I was using the regenerist micro sculpting cream but the luminous is so much better. I've been looking a product that can minimize my pores & can brighten my dark spots. I can tell that this is the one. Thanks luminous! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The luminous tone perfecting cream makes your skin so soft. I have not noticed all that much difference in tone and if you are looking for a wrinkle reducer you should probably go with the regular regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Regenerist Luminous Collection has been amazing for my skin. The Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream has evened out my skin tone making it so I don't need a heavy foundation to look polished.

I have used Regenerist for years and decided to try the Luminous Tone Perfecting to see what it would do on some sun damage to my cheeks and foreheads. I was pleasantly surprised at how much it lightened the dark spots! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since using this product (and any other of Olay's products) there is no place I go where someone doesn't tell me what beautiful skin I have. I always proclaim with boldness that it is because of Oil of Olay. As a matter of fact, I am going to be 63 in a couple of months and people I meet or have known for years comment on how I don't look much past 45. The few wrinkles I do have are invisible unless I use a magnifying mirror. I say ""Ole"" to Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I switched to this product after having terrible results from a high end store brand, and it repaired my skin in no time. I will always use it. I have tried lots of products, and though some work, usually they are so highly scented my eyes react badly and I have to discontinue. Not so with this Luminous product. Just wish there was a version with SPF in it."
My skin used to look so dry and old from acne medication but Olay has turned my skin around to a younger and brighter complexion. I have tried so many face creams trying to clear up my complexion from dark spots due to acne scarring but with my skin being so sensitive I would always have a breakout. I also have not had a acne breakout since I've been using Olay. I am so pleased with this product!!
"I cleanse n then apply this cream generously it's moisturizing then later in half hour skinn is very dry , I cannot again use this cream it comes out a white soft flakes ..I have been using nearly 3 weeks trying to experiment different methods to apply alone or with other moisturizing cream but no use..the smell n colour is awesome plz suggest some ways to apply ..I want this to work for me.."
I have only been using this moisturizer and the oil that I bought with it for a few days and people are asking me what I am doing because I look younger. I have always used the UV moisturizer and been satisfied but these two products together appear to work miracles.
"This moisturizer saved my skin! I use it when I wake up and before I go to sleep. If you have a breakout monday, and continue to apply the product daily, by friday your skin will be glowing!!"
"I have used Regenerist for a year since my friend gave me a sample. My face looks smooth. However, my skin looks dark and want to try this. However, My Mom is using this product and says it is not effective. Do you have any sample for this product."
This goes on smooth and feels really great on my skin. It seems to be helping with my washed-out look I naturally have. I use it twice a day and it feels great
While applying the moisturizer it started flaking everywhere on my face. It seem to dry out quickly and a white flakey substance appeared. Not sure I will use this again.
"I love how you this cream isn't only for toning your face but it also luminizes your face to have a beautiful glow, plus it helps moisturize your face"
I have been using Olay cream for years now. It was not what I expected for this long period of time. I now changed to another product ' I really see the difference in this one.
"I hate the new formula. The old formula gave me smooth silky skin, and lightened scars from acne. I am disappointed that the old formula is not available anymore."
"This product smells great, amazing actually...but after 3 weeks of continued use, I saw no change in dark spots on my face. I wanted to love this product considering how pricey it is, but I didn't :("
This product is just amazing!!! I had my mom video calling me and the first she noticed was my glowing skin. She asked what kind of cream I am using to my face.
Greate products only the price is high for those of us who don't have much to work with. I'm lucky If I can afford one price every 3 or 4 months. Just because I am disabled I still want to look okay beautiful.
"I bought this to try to fade old acne scars, and I noticed a difference overnight. After a week, I feel confident not wearing any makeup. While it says it is for morning and night, I have only been using it at night."
"I've use this product before and it works real good,i would definitely recommend this, my mom been using it for over20yrs she looks beautiful and the smell great"
"I have always loved oil of Olay products. I have tried alot of different brands but none of them ever measured up to Olay. It brings instant relief to my face, I just cannot say enough good things about this product line."
My grandmothers used this and I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel. I use Okay anti-wrinkle cream and body wash . My skin stays youthful and I am 45.
IIT good and works. The feel of it is really well. I love how Smith it feelsbon my skin. My skin feels so much better after using this product. I feel refreshed after using this project. I tell people to use this because it worked for me .

I know that Olay has great products. I wasn't disappointed when I tried this product! I live in a high altitude and dry climate town. I needed to protect my skin and this worked wonders!
