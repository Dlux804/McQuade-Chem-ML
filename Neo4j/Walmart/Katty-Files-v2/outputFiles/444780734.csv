"L'OREAL PARIS AGE PERFEC CELL RENEWAL Rosy Tone Mask is a product that little by little helped to make the appearance of my skin improve. Upon applying I felt how my skin felt with a sensation of coldness. After using it my skin felt fresh, hydrated and with a radiant appearance. I recived this product in #influenster #voxbox # l'orealparis #rosytonemask #ageperfectcellrenewal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow - I'm so pleased with this mask. This will be the mask that I buy from now on! I buy too many masks and treatments and so many of them are a waste of my money. This rosy tone mask makes my skin feel incredible and ready to use my rosy tone moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin has been drier this winter than most and this mask has improved the appearance and feeling of my face almost immediately. It's subtle scent is a great addition to an effective product that I feel I can use liberally since I'm able to purchase L'Oreal products most everywhere. I did receive this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes but have provided an unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wow! This has really helped my skin. I've noticed how much brighter my skin looks. The dullness has been replaced with fresh rosy skin. Loving it! The product itself is super pretty; a sheer pale pink and it smells amazing. It feels gritty which is the exfoliate. I use twice a week as directed and it works. It also hasn't irritated my very sensitive skin. Thank you to Influenster and LOreal Paris for this free sample for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love its soft creamy texture. It feels like silk on my skin. The fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing and I love that.

I thought I was buying the Rosy Facecream. When I opened it and saw the gel I thought it was odd. When I put it on and felt the scrub I knew I had made a mistake. I wouldn't have bought the face mask if I had read the label correctly. I have used it for 2 weeks now and it has been a pleasant surprise. My skin does look better.

I've been using this several times per week and my skin has never looked better. I usually use masks that harden as they dry but this takes 5 minutes and remains wet. It definitely has an exfoliating effect but is very gentle. I receive this complimentary for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this fo a few weeks, the Cell Renewal Rosy Tone Mask seems more like a creamy light scrub than a mask to me. It's nice to use once a week I don't feel the need for a few times a week. I'm not expecting any positive long term lasting effects from this product but I think it gives your skin a little boost during the week. It leaves your skin soft and smooth ready for your regular skin routine. I received this complimentary from influenster for an unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am not sure if I would buy again. Not a huge fan of the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This scrub did wonders for my dry winter skin. 5 minutes is all it takes then I messaged it into my face to slough off the dry skin. Afterwards my face was visibly brighter and softer. I use it twice a week and I am so pleased with the results. I received this product for free for testing purposes.
"I got a full size sample in my Influencer VoxBox and it's nice, feels good, light, not overly scented, just honestly do not have time for a 5 minute morning facial. I don't see how it helped or improved anything in my skin, so I stopped after three uses. But honestly, during the week I do not have time for a 5 minute facial, I gotta get my butt to work! I'm not impressed enough to ever purchase or recommend."
I have mature skin already aged. I used this product for about 20 days twice a week. A little goes a long way and I will continue using this until the jar is used up. I am not really sure this is doing anything. I gave it 4 stars because it does make my face feel a little nicer after using but I also use retina so the cell turnover is a bit manipulated because of that. It does not irritate my skin or turn it red. It has a nice cooling effect when applying but soon goes away. I did receive this complimentary from Influenster for review. #influenster

I have used this product for 3 weeks. After realizing I was using it wrong and followed the directions I really enjoy the product. It is a mask and exfoiliater so it soften and exfoiliates. It uses pumas to exfoiliate so it can be intense but my skin need a good exfoiliater in the winter. It leaves the skin softer and brighter.

I received this product complimentary to review. The mask has a fair amount of grit in it which I need. The best part is you're not drying out your skin in the process since it has hydrating properties. My skin feels soft after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a complimentary jar of the L'Oreal Age Perfect Rosy Tone mask from Influenster. I am very impressed with this product both in how easy it is to use and the results. I like that it only takes a few minutes and my skin feels so soft and fresh after washing the mask off. It also has a nice smell. I will definitely purchase this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this. The smell is very pleasing, it goes on like silk. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized with out feeling oily or over moisturized.&nbsp;<br>The only issue is, I have very long acrylics and I get the product under my nails. The option to buy with a pump would be great. If not, though I would still buy it this way I received this product complimentary for review purposes.

"I received this product complimentary to try. I have acne prone, very sensitive skin. After months of trying different products, I had settled on a few products that worked great for my acne and sensitive skin. I used this product twice in a week on clean skin per the directions. It did not irritate my skin nor did I have any breakouts. My skin felt clean and refreshed after using. Great product and will continue to use."
Absolutely love my free sample of the renewal rosy tone mask - my skin feels so moisturized and good and leaves a beautiful tint after I use it. I don't feel greasy and I feel refreshed and adds a firmness to my skin - I will be adding this to my skin care routine even though it says twice a week I would love to add it everyday ; I received this product complimentary for review purposes.
It has a nice fresh fragrance and leaves your face hydrated with radiant skin. The rosy tone adds a youthful glow. It only takes five minutes for those of us on the go. The mask consistency is like jelly and you will not feel the exfoliate until removing the mask only then will you notice that this product is non-stripping and leaves your skin hydrated with a wonderful glow. I love this mask and truly look forward to using it many times in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This Rosy Tone Mask was easy to use and it left me with glowing skin. I like the fact that I only had to leave it on for five minutes and after rinsing it of my skin immediately glowed.

"I decided to try this out in the shower-my intensive conditioner had to stay in 5 minutes so I decided to multi task and use the madk at the same time. After I got out of the shower, my skin felt so smooth and I thought it had a nice glow to it. After smoothing the mask on I could feel it tingling in a good way. It felt luxurious and sort of decadent rinsing it off and I felt and difference in the texture of my skin. I received this free for testing purposes but now I'm a fan!
