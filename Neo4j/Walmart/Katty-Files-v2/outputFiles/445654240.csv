What more could you ask for then a make up remover and hydration all at the same time! I would definitely recommend for all skin types that are looking for that special glow! #soakitin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this Micellar cleansing water. I received it free from Influenster and this stuff is life changing. I has been using it morning and night and even after my mid day work out for 2 weeks straight, I went to have a hydrafacial a few days ago and the girl giving me my hydrafacial said my skin is the best she has seen in a long time!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product last week and have used it every night since! I absolutely love it and how great it makes my skin feel! I was lucky enough to have it mailed to me as a free sample, but I'll definitely be purchasing it in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my facial cleanser about a week ago, complimentary from influenster! I absolutely love it! I have naturally dry skin and this product did not dry it out at all. It managed to take off all the left over makeup left on after using a wipe, better then any face wash I've ever used ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this product makes my skin feel hydrated and clean. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't burn. Perfect for removing makeup. Mascara comes off easily and it doesn't irratate your eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is absolutely something to rave about and super easy to use! It helped my skin feel so hydrated after a couple uses. It also helps get rid of make up left over on your face so it has multiple purposes which is always a great thing! It really helps my skin feel refreshed and it's so soothing and effective! Thank you @influenster for this complimentary Water Boost Micellar Cleansing Water by @SimpleSkincare! #Soakitin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm so happy I received the Micellar water. It didn't leave any residue and my face was noticeably hydrated in the mornings after using this product!
I received this product free for testing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free testing! After only using it for a few weeks, my skin already feels more hydrated than ever. I would totally recommend this product to anyone that feels like their skin is too dry and needs a pickmeup!"
"I had been using an oil makeup remover by Simple that worked great, much better than prestige brand makeup removers. It doesnt look like they sell that oil anymore so I decided to buy this water. It had been a big disappointment. I have to go over my face with two cotton pads to get most of the makeup off and then I have to wash with soap to get the rest of it off. This product does not work as advertised."
I bought these by accident. My aveeno wipes were out of stock so I grabbed these wipes. My face looked so refreshed in the morning. Clean feel. Will try other products.
My face hasn't felt this pure and cleansed in years. This name fits the product perfectly as it's both super cleansing and simple. No fancy smells or dye yet my face is left feeling like I just visited the spa. Everyone needs this in their skincare routine.
I got this a month ago - my skin is usually very easily irritated. Even regular tap water will leave it red and splotchy after washing my face. I used this as a pre-wash cleanse to take any excess make up off before washing my face at night. It worked well on my skin. I stuck with my usual oil based eye makeup remover because I've never found a water based on that will remove liquid liner and mascara in one swoop. Never the less the simple micellar water was great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am super lazy when it comes to taking care of my face. With this product I can remove makeup, cleanse, and moisturize all in one step without the hassle of rinsing off my face in the sink and getting water everywhere. Thank you Influenster for giving me the opportunity to try this great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A friend recommended this product to me but the ""for all skin types"" formula. I've used it with okay skin results. I loved the dirt and grime removal. Last week, out of desperation, purchased the dry skin formula! After the first application, my skin was photo-shop flawless! My chin has never felt so smooth! I checked after 4 hours, skin stayed beautiful. End of day, my skin still felt smooth, no re-visit inflammations on my chin or my cheeks. I love this product. And this from a 30+ years Oil of Olay buyer!"
I received this for free and ended up loving it. There are no harsh chemicals so it cleared up my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product! Highly recommended for a freshly washed face feel. No strange odors, fragrance free, and great for sensitive skin. (Received this product free for testing) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that it does not dry my skin. Also has no strong aroma.
One little drop is enough to wash your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely sensitive skin and this did not irritate or break me out! It really does remove all your makeup! I love this and highly recommend! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this because I tried the original simple micellar water with the green cap. That one is wonderful too but....my skin during the wintertime gets so dry that my skin gets raw and bleeds. I wanted something that packed an extra punch. I was not disappointed. I used it along with my normal moisturizers and my skin improved. Less patches and no rawness. Best micellar water I have tried ever.
P.s I also used it to clean out my boyfriends new tattoo and it worked and even made him feel better. :)
I am so impressed with this product! I have used the face washes and face lotions by Simple and decided to give this a try. I LOVE it! I have a tendency to get dry peeling skin of my face and this cleared it up right away. Feels clean and moisturized after using every night and morning. These are great products and great prices!
I absolutely love this product. Not only is it a great makeup remover but it's also good at moisturizing . I love that it is a clear product because it makes me feel like it's safer for my skin.
"* I did receive this product for free from Influenster, but all thoughts and opinion are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have the drysest most sensitive skin. It drives me insane so I'm constantly doing research and on the hunt of new products to save my skin from this dehydration. Luckily I came accross this product thanks to receiving it for testing purposes. So far I love it. I like the way it makes my skin feel. After I clean my face and take my makeup off I use this with a cotton pad to remove any leftover makeup and it works wonders.
"I absolutely love this product, I use a small amount on a cotton round and it completely takes off not only makeup residue, but it takes off all of the oil that build up during the day or while I'm sleeping. This product leaves my face feeling soft and fresh and it donsent make my eyes burn when I use it. It also gets off waterproof makeup! This is by far my most favorite makeup cleansing product!"
I have been wanting to try this product for awhile as I heard it was good for use as a toner. This product does work good to remove dirt brought to the surface after cleansing my face and still leaves my skin hydrated.

"I received this complimentary from @Influenster and love how it feels when I put it on my face. However, I still feel after applying that I need to use a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary bottle of the cleansing water from Influenster. It is easiest used on days I do not wear makeup. It takes off the daily grime and leaves my normally dry skin moisturized. I was disappointed it doesn't take off my waterproof mascara, but overall it is a good product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free from influenster. I used it a few times and I have to say that it really is hydrating! I hate products that are oily on my skin because I get naturally oily in the summer time. I applied the product on my skincare and face and both felt super hydrated. Would definitely purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Tried the Simple Skincare micellar cleansing water and loved it. I couldn't believe how much dirt it removed from my face at the end of the day. And I wasn't even wearing makeup. My skin was a little irritated in the spots where my skin was already red and dry but that's to be expected. Besides that my skin didn't feel irritated like some makeup wipes leave my skin feeling.
I received this product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free from Influenster to try out for reviewing purposes and I'm pleasantly surprised on how gentle it was and how effectively it cleaned my skin. It was a pleasant surprises. Definitely will be purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have had terrible hormonal acne since getting pregnant and it has not went away. I have tried it all, you name it-- it's somehow found its way in my cabinet somewhere and nothing has worked. THIS stuff is GOLD! You guys, my acne is clearing up AND I have actually had less dry skin than I've experienced in 5 years-- no exaggeration. Also the bottle is huge and may last up to a year, seriously! Cannot wait to try the creams as well to see what magic happens to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure about this product when I got it in my voxbox (free sample) but I actually love it. I can feel such a different in the texture of my skin when I use it, and it seems to take off makeup my remover couldn't get. Will definitely buy when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this product free for testing purposes and I loved it! It's definitely something I would have paid to try on my own because I have dry skin, especially after being out in the sun all summer. I applied this moisturizer to my skin after peeling from a sunburn and it moisturizer so well that all the itching stopped and my skin healed in days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free as part of a product testing service, but my opinions are purely my own. This works like a dream! I can use it to take off my makeup easily and it feels so light. Would highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this entire lineup of products! I received the hydrating booster free, and ended up buying the water myself! This cleanses my skin quickly and gently, and my face feels fresh after every use! I highly recommend this product! (I purchased this product myself, but am reviewing this as part of a contest for Influenster!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has been great, I've been using it for about 2 weeks and so far it's great. I have pretty sensitive skin and it hasn't irritated it at all. It leaves no residue or heavy feeling. It's gentle and I think it's cleansing my skin too (hard to tell) it's really weird not having to rinse it off. I am very pleased with the product, I did get it free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just got this product free for testing purposes, and I woul have To give this 3-4 stars because it's not the best. It's really just water it seems like.... but it did hydrate my face a little big it seemed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free to review, I have sensitive dry skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all. Using it as a makeup remover works very well because not only does it take away all excess residue but it replenishes at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the product was pretty good and my skin felt good after using it. I still felt like I needed a cleanser at night but as far as hydrating, I think it did pretty good. ** Received product free for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for an inexpensive micellar water for a while now and I think I finally found one! It takes of all of my makeup, including mascara and stubborn eyeliner! This leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Miscellar Cleansing Water is all of the hype now a days. I was happy to try out Simple Water Boost Micellar Cleansing Water! I used it with a cotton pad and it worked absolute wonders. My skin felt clean and refreshed after using this product. I'm officially a believer! Also, I received this product free for testing, but I will definitely be purchasing another once I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the second Micellar water that I have tried out and it works pretty well. I pour a few drops on a cotton round and gently rub it on my face to remove extra makeup. The only thing I wish I could change is the cap, I wish it was connected for a quicker use. But the product itself I recommend!"
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I reciecved this product free from Influenster for testing and it met my expectations. Very hydrating, no harsh chemicals either. This is great for cleaning the skin or removing makeup while delivering a refreshing sensation to the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The miscellar water was a very unique product for me. It took off dirt oil and makeup off my face. The only thing I don't like is that after I put it on it makes me face a little sticky for a couple minutes but overall I really like the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like using this to remove my makeup at the end of the day. It's very light weight and non-oily. I love the fact that it's pretty much fragrance free, which makes this great for very sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this cleanser for people with really sensitive skin. Doesn't leave skin feeling irritated or red after use. I receive this product for free, but all of my opinions are honest and from my own experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product because it cleans my skin without leaving it feel dry or oily. It takes off makeup pretty well (I havnt tried waterproof makeup so idk about that.)
I got this product for free to test from influenster and I couldn't be happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product as a trial for Influenster and would one hundred percent buy it. This product leaves my face feeling moisturized without feeling too heavy on my face. I believe it works just as well as more expensive products and the Simple Micellar Cleansing Water will not leave you shelling out tons of money. I highly suggest trying this product as I have not any problems with breakouts and it has made my skin glow with health.
This was such an amazing product! I was pleasantly surprised at how hydrating this cleansing water was on my skin! And it doesn't irritate my skin at all! I find myself reaching for this product daily to cleanse my face. I received this product free for testing.
"I received this product free for testing purposes! My honest thoughts are that us does what it says and cleans very well, hydrates and is gentle on skin! I did have a couple breakouts but also I am very very sensitive skinned! I use it in the morning for a quick cleanse and moisture before applying my makeup! Also, it doesn't leave your ski feeling weighed down or sticky, it's very lightweight! Overall great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product for free from the Influenster program. I really like this product! I washed my face and then I applied the Micellar water to remove leftover traces of makeup. It removed traces of concealer that I thought had washed away. It also really helps hydrate skin and made it feel smoother and cleaner! Would recommend anyone to try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product free to try and I'm so glad I did! I absolutely love it! It cleans my makeup off with ease (including heavy eyeliner and mascara ) and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean and hydrated. I love that I don't have to use face wash and get the entire countertop completely soaking wet and that this product is used without water. I'd totally buy this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't never go to bed without removing makeup and sometimes I'm so tired I need it to be practical. This micellar gel removes it as well as a micellar water but could be more practical (removing with cotton pads is easier but takes more time). I like how it's hydrating though. It takes all my makeup off without irritating it. I got it free from Influenster for testing but I'll probably be buying another one when it's over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoy using this Simple Water Boost face wash at night to cleanse my face after a long day. I like that it doesn't have any added fragrance and it makes my skin feel hydrated. I love being able to give my skin an extra boost of hydration before applying moisturizer.

"This micellar water is like no other!! It's perfect for us girls or guys with sensitive skin. I use this around my eyes and whole face everytime I get out of the shower, during the day and before bed. I've noticed a drastic difference in my skin lately!! I can't say enough good stuff about this product!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
I received this product for testing but that does not change my opinion on the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Usually projects dry my extra dry skin out even more but this product did not do that. It is light and not oily on my face either. It does leave a slightly tacky (sticky) finish but better than dry/peely or oily! I use it as a makeup remover and it works well with my other facial products.
I received this product from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love using this after washing my face to get my skin ready for my moisturizers. I got this product as a free trial and would definitely try more products in this line because of the way it makes my skin feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free trial of simple skin care hydration water and I love it. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and prepped for my moisturizing lotion! Most of the time I find myself needing multiple layers of lotion to feel like my skin isn't dry but I only have been using one layer with this product!
"Lately, I've been using my facewash to take my makeup off and it's been stinging my eyes. This product is good for that. Very gentle, good to pour on a cotton round and remove my makeup with."

This product is easy to use and makes my skin feel clean and hydrated. The next day my skin is glowing and I can apply my makeup without my skin being so dry the makeup flakes off. The only con is that it makes your skin a tad sticky when it dries. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this in my voxbox and I was so excited! I love this brand and I was BLOWN away at how well this worked! I did a full beat glam and it took off stubborn metallic glitter eye liner and stubborn mascara! Nightly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product as a sample from influenster and I love it! I have combination skin so it's hard to find a product that doesn't leave my face feeling super dry or overly oily but I love the way my skin feels after using this. I like the easy squirt bottle and the fact that you can use it and let it dry without having to rinse it off. Left my face feeling soft and fresh. I was even able to remove my mascara without rubbing my eyes raw. Love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is EXCELLENT for taking off makeup. It's quite gentle and doesn't burn my face like some other micellar waters that I've tried. It also doesn't leave any sort of oil residue on my skin. I like to use this as a substitute for washing my face when I don't have the time or if I want to avoid over-drying. (I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this before my skincare routine to wash off any make up or dirt. Its so easy. I just squeeze the water onto a cotton ball and then wipe it on my face. I like that I dont have to remove it after application. It make my skin feel bright, smooth and soft. I have used it 3 now. I received a free full size bottle from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an amazing product. Whether I'm using it to take off my makeup, or just refresh my tired face, it's awesome! I revived this product free from influenster to test, but I would buy this a million times over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm really impressed by this product it really helps to quickly moisturize my dry skin. The season of summer really causes my skin to dry out and this product has been really helpful in keeping my skin healthy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Overall I think this product will be very beneficial in the long run! It allowed my face to feel hydrated and smooth while also making it feel tight and even managed to dry out my pimple/oily areas!! I can't wait to see the long term results of this product.

"This isn't meant to take your makeup off, and I don't understand how people don't realize that. This is meant for getting dirt & bacteria off of your face. I use the Burt's bees facial wipes, then wash my face with Burt's bees sensitive facial cleanser. After, I use Simple's millecular cleansing water to remove any dirt, makeup, or soap left on my face. This being the last step, it really makes my face feeling clean afterwards. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
honestly I'm very picky when it comes to my skin and what goes on it! I absolutely love hydrated formulas and this one is a winner
"This takes off waterproof makeup, doesn't irritate my eyes or face ! I love this product . Thank you influenster for letting me try this for free."
I received this product via Influenster and I seriously love it!!! So moisturizing.
