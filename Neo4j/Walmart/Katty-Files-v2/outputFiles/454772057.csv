"It's a nice spray and doesn't have a strong scent, I love the packaging of this."
This spray works great with the new OrganicWear line or if you want to bring back a little moisture after setting your makeup with powder. It is very refreshing and lightly moisturizing. The spray mist is pretty fine but hold it about 12 inches from your face to start so it can be evenly and lightly dispersed.
