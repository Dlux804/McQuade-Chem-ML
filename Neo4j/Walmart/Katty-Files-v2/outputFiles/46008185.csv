"I was already using their moisturizing cream, as a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommended it as being the best moisturizer. This redness reliever cream is also a great product. I've only been using it for a few days and I can really see a difference. It evens out skin tone and cuts down on roseacea."
"This is the only cream that helps the redness on my face and doesn't cause any stinging or additional problems. I was so happy to be able to find it online, and for less than it sold in stores when they used to carry it."
I would highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.
"Out of all the lotions I've tried, this one had been the best. Skin looks better already and it does not feel dry."
Product was recommended by my dermatologist. Not greasy and has a SPF 15
"I have horrible rosacea. This is the only product that gives me halfway normal skin. I wear it alone, or under powdered foundation. Well worth the money."
"It does help with redness, but not as much as I hoped. You have to apply it very easy with gentle pats and rubs if your face is like mine and gets red with any touching. It doesn't really do anything to keep redness away it just ""relieves"" some of it. Overall, I would suggest this product for those with minor redness. I do enjoy the texture of it and it lasts a long time. I'm sure there's another product out there that works better than this but I'm sure it's a lot more expensive. You can't beat the price."
"Does not help my redness. It's green and thick and hard to fully rub in. Leaves my face feeling gross, like a gross film on my skin. It's not a nice lotion kind of moister feeling. It's a mess."
These products have proven to be very helpful in reducing my redness .
Works great
