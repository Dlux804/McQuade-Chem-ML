I am allergenic to the chemicals is most sunscreens. My eyes swell and my neck begins to itch and turn red. My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Healthy Defense years ago and it is the only sunscreen I have used on my face ever since.
"I've been using Neutrogena since I came to the US 13 years ago they have what I need for my face skin n I love it, thank you Neutrogena!"
"I was looking for a mineral based, fragrance free sunscreen, and this exceeded my expectations. No burning when applied, no white cast (though I have very pale skin), no pilling under makeup, no weird smell, no breakouts. It's reasonably priced."
"I have been using this product under my makeup everyday for over a year . I originally tried your helioplex moisturizers and kept developing a rash but the sensitive skin has caused none of these issues. I am having trouble finding it in stores recently, please tell me you haven't discontinued it."
"I bought this a week a go, I really like the sunscreen protection that can avoids skin damage if I am outside for too long. But the only problem that I don't want is too shiny and greased after I applied. If they can make it with less grease then it will be great!"
Product is great the company cancelled production and my order even though it is available on their website.
"I am allergic to the strong chemicals used in sunscreens. After a melanoma surgery, my dermatologist gave me a sample of Healthy Defense with zinc oxide. I have used it ever since and appreciate the knowledge that my eyes won't swell up from using this product and that it protects my face and neck from the sun."
"I was skeptical that this product would moisturize my 71-year-old skin. I knew it would protect me from the sun but moisturize all day? Having used it for about 3 weeks I can now say, ""Yes it does."" It is a very good moisturizer lasts all day. It is very gentle on my extra sensitive skin as well. It is better than products costing 2 to 3 times as much. It is a real value."
"Just had a dermatological skin peel to remove skin cancer precursors, caused by sun damage. Because of sensitive skin I already use a shaving balm, and I wanted something to use on my whole face and ears, not just my shaving area. The Health Defense seems to be ideal. Goes on well, not greasy, and makes my skin feel good. My skin looks good, at 69 for someone who has eczema and dry skin , this is outstanding. No perfume, easy application, no greasiness, and a SPF of 50, it's terrific!"
This is the only moisturizer I want to use on my face. Have been using consistently for several years. I'm allergic to chemical sunscreen and this is one of the few that has a physical sunscreen and it doesn't cause a reaction of any kind. My dermatologist recommended it. Please continue to make this.
"Like the previous reviewer I am really crossing my fingers that this product isn't being discontinued or changed. (Please don't change it!!) It is perfect for my sensitive skin and has really helped keep my skin even and bright. Please, Neutrogena, keep making this product forever!"
"I have been using this product religiously for several years now. I am super allergic to any of the helioplex products, but this version is perfect. Goes on smoothly and easily, I have no issues with my skin absorbing the lotion fully. It is an excellent daily sunscreen protection without being oily or heavy. I have not been able to find this in stores in my area. I was hoping to order direct from your site, but see that it is out of stock. Please please please don't stop offering this product."
"I have tried everysingle sunscreen out in the market and they ALWAYS break me out. I suffer from severley oily skin and cystic acne. I'am on Clyndamicin, Retin-A, and 10% Benzoyl Peroxide! So I need something that will not irritate with chemicals and will not break me out, this sunscreen has been my life saver! PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.S. My mother and I both use this and she sufferes from really dry skin, she loves it as well!"
Love this light weight moisturizer. Great for my sensitive skin. No breakouts! Not heavy. I use it everyday before my make up goes on and it's been wonderful. Couldn't find it anywhere but on line for the past month. Hope it's just a demand shortage and not discontinuing it!
I have tried tons of facial moisturizers with sunscreen. It works just as good as all the expensive equivalents. I have acne prone skin and recommend this product if you are looking for a good sunscreen/sunblock for the face. It has recently become more difficult to find this product in the stores :(
"I'm an African American woman whose skin get's super oily in the summer. As my skin matures (I turn 30 this year) it is definitely changing. I have been searching for a daily moisturizer with SPF in it that will not break me out and that is NOT greasy. I've tried Aveeno, Oil of Olay, but I think I have found my preferred favorite in this Neutrogena product. Funny thing is Neutrogena face washes break me out, but their moisturizers are EXCELLENT. Wish I got more product for my $, but I still love the product."
"I love this moisturizer a lot. For starters, it has a higher SPF (50) and it is great for sun protection. The lotion is creamy, smooth and absorbs easily and quickly into my face. The best part is it leaves no white residue and it is great to use under makeup. The only flaw with this is it has no or minimal antioxidant, which is so beneficial to the skin. Since it is a physical block, it is safe to use around the eyes and never burns."
"I started using this product this year when my doctor recommended a SPF. It works really good under your make-up and is a great base/primer. It does't have a smell which i like because i was scared it was going to have that strong sunscreen smell. The only bad thing i have to say about this is that it's very expensive. The bottle is very small, but lasts you a good amount of time. I used it every day for a year and just ran out. (You only need a little bit or your face will be oily). I will for sure be buying another bottle of this."
"I started using this product around a year ago and haven't looked back since. The smell isn't overpowering and it applies beautifully. It reduces the redness on my face (a good thing) and I keep on getting compliments on how beautiful my skin looks because of this lotion! The high SPF is another BIG plus, and I love that Neutrogena now has a Purescreen as an option instead of Helioplex (which irritated my skin)."
Works better than any moisturizer I have ever used and I am very big on what I use to make my face look as good as possible! Totally recommend it if you have ever had a problem with any other moisturizer. My skin is the softest it's been in a long time and the moisturizer has a awesome scent!
"I have very sensitive skin, I am African-American, and I am a melanoma survivor. As you can imagine, an effective sunscreen is a must. This product meets all of my requirements with flying colors. I don't burn, period. It blends in very well (no 'chalky' look) and I have not had any reaction (rashes, etc) whatsoever. I hope it's not on sale because it's being disccontinued! I have tried many, many sunscreen products, but this is the only one I'll use."
This moisturizer/sunscreen never makes my face feel oily or clogs my pores. It makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I have used very expensive sunscreens that didn't work as well and made my skin sting. This product does what it says it will and is affordable so I'm not afraid to use the amount that I should without thinking about how money I'm slathering on my skin.
I have melasma and dry skin so I have to wear sun protection and moisturizer daily. This is the only moisturizer with SPF 50 sunscreen that I have found that I can wear daily that does not irritate my skin. I love how it is lightweight so I can wear it under makeup or alone. I keep a tube in my purse and in my gym bag so I can re-apply it as needed throughout the day.
I have sensitive skin and need to choose my skin care regime carefully. I am glad Neutrogena came out with this type of SPF moisturizer. It is easy to apply and does not make my skin break out. I live in a place with hot summers so the SPF50 is a must have. For some reason it makes my skin tone look more even as if I am wearing foundation. Needless to say that I will keep on buying this one.
"I received a sample of the Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer spf 50 from my dermatologist. I absolutely love this product. It makes my face feel so smooth, non-greasy, lets my foundation glide on just perfect and all of the above and protected by the sun too!! I'd recommend this product to all."
"i've used the 30 health defense for over 10 years and found this formulation in the store. since i'm getting older, i thought i could use more sun protection and more wrinkle protection. they've been able to remove most of the sunscreen smell for this formulation and i use it exclusively now, even around my eyes and when exercising and playing sports!"
"Finally a sunscreen/moisturizer with only titanium dioxide and zinc. All the other sunscreen ingredients made my skin look horrible. Not this one. I have dry, blotchy and sensitive skin. I am also 42 and must use a daily moisturizer. This one does the job, it makes my skin glow and the white stuff evens out my skin tone. My face is protected enough from the sun and I have been getting a lot of compliment on my radiant looking skin."
I picked this up over the summer since it was a combination moisturizer and sunscreen. One thing I like the most is that it didn't sting my eyes when I sweated. Very few products out there that can truly claim this. I've been trying to locate another tube as I have just run out and will keep looking. Have tried [...] without luck now on to [...]. If you can find it definitely try it.
"I finished a bottle of this product by using it over a serum and under makeup every morning since I bought this in September last year. I don't feel that it hydrates enough for my dry skin, but it spreads well into a thin layer and is not sticky, so works really well under makeup. I'm literally repurchasing it right now."
"I've been coping with oily, sensitive, acne prone skin for over thirty years. Recently I was diagnosed with eczema (not fair!) This is the only sunscreen that is soothing to my skin. I hope Neutrogena makes this forever!"
"After I put this on my face, I literally look like I've put on a white mud mask. It doesn't get absorbed into the skin. Even after I tried to cover the white film with make up, I still walk around looking like a geisha."
"Need a sunscreen every day however I just can't get rid of the ""white"" filmy look especially towards the hair line. Just can't rub it in enough. Friend had the same issue. Also, too thick to wear under make up. Do NOT recommend."
"This product is alright alone, but when I applied it under my makeup it made my skin look like a flaky mess! A couple hours later I also felt really greasy and my makeup did not stay on well."
"I was looking for a daily skin moisturizer with sunscreen after shaving. When I applied this to my face, it left a white film on my face all day."
"I love the idea of it having ""natural ingredients"" ...BUT it leaves my face with a white tint. I hate to wear it."
"I have the sun protection, it is very smooth to put on and does not make my face white like other products I used. The smell is very fine, decent."
"I had been using only 15 spf in my daily moisturizer. I am so pleased to increase the spf at a reasonable price. I love Neutrogena products,"
"I'm satisfied with how the product absorbs into my skin, is not too heavy, and has no irritating fragrance."
I love this product! I wear it everyday & have it in the chemical formula and it is not as good at all! I am so glad this product exists.
"this doesn't make my skin sting like chemical sunblocks do, and it's light and not greasy. definitely will recommend to friends!"
I have very dry skin so I thought this would work but for some reason when I apply the lotion it pills up or rolls on my face. Any suggestions on how to fix this problem?
great for people who don't want to use toxic chemicals on their skin
"Love this product, after starting to use this, have not used any other facial moisturiser.!"
Every other sunscreen irritates my face - can't find it in many stores - please don't discontinue!
I have very sensitive skin and have been using this product for years. Great moisturizer and sunscreen with absolutely no skin irritation.
"I Really like this product, and I feel protected now when I go out. And it doesn't feel heavy, and no irritation. Thank you!"
A fact: I simply don't leave my house without using my moisturizer with sunscreen. It makes my skin softer and younger and it's not greasy.
"I love the light tint daily moisturizer. Its easy to apply, not greasy and absolutely love the light tint. Even though I see it on the website, its very hard to find anymore. Are you still making it? PLEASE DO NOT discontinue this product!!!!!!!!!"
"My dermatologist recommended this specific sunscreen/moisturizer for sensitive skin. The creme is silk, applies easily and soaks in immediately with no visible residue. And it is not oily. I use it on my face and neck area."
I have used this product for many years with light tint and I have not been able to find it. Have you stopped producing it with a tint.
"Even with very little application, the product leaves a ""white"" film on the face."
This product is awful. I've been using Neutrogena SPF 15 Moisturizer for years. There is no comparison.
