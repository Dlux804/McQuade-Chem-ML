Great sunblock. About 15 years ago I had a dermatologist recommend this sunblock and I've been using it ever since then. I use it under my makeup like she told me and it has kept my sling free of sun damage. Highly recommend this product.
Best stuff around especially for sensitive skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great sunscreen for face and body. My dermatologist recommended this brand and it works well for me. Walmart.com has the best price and free shipping!!!
