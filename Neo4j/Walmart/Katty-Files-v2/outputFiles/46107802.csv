I HAVE BEEB USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER A YEAR. IT IS EXCELLENT! WALMART OFFERED THIS PRODUCT AT A PRICE ALMOST HALF OF WHAT I WOULD PAY IN A SPA. THANKS WALMART!!!
The product is very moisture rich. I am very satisfied with the product.
"I'm absolutely in love with this moisturizer. I have combination skin and been looking for the perfect moisturizer for years, and Obagi Hydrate Luxe Crea is one of the best products I've used. The texture is rich, but it's not too heavy- it is just enough to keep my skin glowy and soft all day and I use it day and night. I highly recommend this to people with dry or combination skin."
"My friend (46 yrs old) was using this and her skin looked smooth and velvety so I (78) decided to order me some also. I really like it. It hydrates well and also makes my skin look smooth and velvety. I noticed some reviews mentioned yellow vs white color. Ours is yellow, but works very well and I am fine with it."
Great night cream
"I ran out of my Obagi Hydrate Luxe Moisture Cream. Never again.. My complextion felt it, I was so unhappy... Received my replacement and stars in heaven I see and feel the difference. It was like over night. Love how my complextion feels, so smooth, not greasy at all. Love love happy happy!! Alice"
"This product is amazing, my skin was usually quite dehydrated and this was just what I needed to keep it hydrated!!!"
Obagi Hydrate is an outstanding moisturizer. Walmart has the best price and I will order from them again and again.
"Have been using this product for a couple of years now and continue to receive compliments on how healthy my skin looks. I am 68 years old, so these kind of compliments are very well received. I would recommend this to all ages. Gail"
"I'd give it five stars, but I'm a little skeptical if it's the legitimate product. I had bought this moisturizer from a high-end spa and it was a white cream. This one (at a more reasonable price) is a yellow cream. I would love to know if this is the real deal."
Obagi is one of my favorite skin care lines---I use this Obagi Hydrate Luxe Cream as a night moisturizer-- it seems to really hold moisture in my skin creating a barrier at night so moisture isn't sweat off or evaporated. I'm no scientist but that is what this particular product seems to do. Great night cream and very affordable from Walmart.
The product is OLD and yellow. It should be whitE! I have used this product for a year and it is white. Will not order again .
"Was having trouble with dry patchy spots on my face and after just a few days, this has cleared them up"
The best moisturizer I have used. Great for 50+ years old. I use every night as the last product I put on (over any other treatments you might use) Great product! Obagi is excellent.
Great product and almost half the cost compared to Amazon - will definitely purchase again
excellent product and great experience dealing with Walmart on line shopping
"Wonderful hydration, was recommended by my dermatologist. Much less expensive here then from the office."
"At the recommendation of my plastic surgeon, I use this product on my face nightly. Moisturizes my skin and minimizes facial lines."
"This is my second bottle. I had been using La Mer and La Prairie, but find them too expensive now. I also have been using Obagi product, which I swears on. I read up on Obagi's moisturizer and decided to give this a try. It is very smooth on and not greasy. The next morning I wake up with hydrated skin. And, it costs only a fraction of those moisturizers I have been using, so it's definitely a keeper."
Keeps me moisturized longer than most other moisturizers I've tried.
This worked better than I had imagined! Glad I switched moisturizers!
Great feeling cream
Its great. I use it when my skin gets dry and the regular Obaji moisture cream does not work well. My Derm recommends this brand.
Five stars (replacement)The shower head is very easy to install - you just need to follow the directions. My family loves it. I am buying one for my brother's house.
