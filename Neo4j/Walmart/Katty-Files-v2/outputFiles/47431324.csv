"I have been buying this product for over a year. Go on so smooth, and refreshing. Keeps my skin soft and have noticed other companies starting to copy. I'm staying with Neutrogena."
"I have oily skin and I was never 100 percent happy with my previous facial moisturisers because they never seemed to absorb the way I would like and just sat heavy on my skin. Finally this moisturiser feels amazing! It absorbs nicely and feels refreshing. I'm on my third round of this stuff, love it!"
"I just bought my second container of the Hydro Boost Water Gel. The first container lasted a long time, I think 6 months or more. I love the gel consistency, it feels cool and soothing on the skin and absorbs more quickly than cream-based moisturizers. I typically use it at night on my face and neck after toner & serums. I always apply this gel around my eyes as well and haven't experienced any irritation at all. My face always feels smooth, supple, and hydrated after using it!"
"I searched everywhere for a product that wouldn't cause me to breakout and leave my skin greasy. After some trial and error, I came across this and I will never go back to anything else. My skin is soft, hydrated, but not sweaty or greasy looking after applying this product. And I haven't had any breakouts!"
I purchased the Hydro Boost Water Gel because my skin reacts badly to thick lotions and I don't like strong smelling creams or lotions I am very sensitive to a lot of things so I tried some and it was like putting water on my face with no heavy scent and my face is so soft and fresh looking and I'm 54 my daughter also uses this product and she 29
"I've been using this product for about 9 months and am very pleased with the way it keeps my face hydrated and soft throughout the day. My skin is very dry and I am a wrinkled senior. I used to have dry cracked patches that were painful, no matter how much moisturizer I used, but no longer have that problem since I started using this product.."
"I bought this product because I tried a different water-based moisturized and loved it. I have used other Neutrogena products and loved them. Unfortunately, I have to use a ton of this product to get the minimum desired results. When I used the recommended amount my skin was still dry looking. I do not have dry skin so I was surprised. I was a little disappointed."
"This product did not work well for my sensitive skin. As soon as I applied it (after getting out of the shower) it burned my face. Once it calmed down, it felt fine. A few hours later, I noticed that my skin was extremely dry and flaky. Not a good fit for me, despite the wonderful reviews I read before purchasing."
"This is the second time I have purchased the Hydro Boost Water Gel with SPF and I really love the product. It does have a light, fresh fragrance but I like it. I use it daily and am very happy with it. I made this last purchase on-line at Neutrogena.com and got a wonderful price so I will be checking back next time I need it."
"My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena Hydraboost Water Gel, and I'm certainly glad she did. It absorbs completely and leaves my 72-year old complexion looking years younger! My skin is soft, moisturized, and radiant. Living in the desert, maintaining moisture in my skin is crucial. This product really delivers! People say I look at least 20 years younger than the calendar indicates. I'm SOLD."
"I love the hydro water gel, I've been looking for a moisturizer that doesn't break out my face and moisturize it. And this definitely works for me. My face is less dry and doesn't break out from it. Most moisturizers are too heavy and this is light and your skin soaks it up perfectly. Will never buy anything else!"
Been using this product for over a year and like it very much.
I have been using this product for several months now and I would not change it for the world. When I started to use it my face was peeling and I have not had an issue since. Smells and feels great on my skin.
I have been purchasing expencive lotions till I got hydro boost now my mom who is 78and my daughter who is 22 are alway looking to see if I have hydro boost for them to use. Love this stuff can't live without it thank you for making this line
"My skin is very dry despite daily use of moisturizer and sunscreen. Since using Hydro Boost before bed, my skin glows as well as feeling so great, supple and smooth, not like I'm going to crack."
I wanted a light weight moisturizer for the summer months and stumbled across Hydro Boost and love it. It does not weigh your skin down like many moisturizers. Glad I came across it. Great product.
I've been using this for almost 3 weeks... I'm very pleased with the results and I'm 70 years old. My skin is smooth n supple as Neutrogena promised it would be. Thank you Neutrogena! And its affordable too!
"I have been using this product for a couple of years and I love it. It's so cool and soothing for my face. And it's moisturizing without being heavy or greasy, which is a plus for my oily skin."
"I purchased the face, hand and body gels. All work great and they're not greasy like other products I've tried. My dermatologist recommended the face gel and I'm glad I tried it!"
"Bought this product when I tried the serum, and I honestly love it just as much as the serum. It smells nice and is super hydrating. Most importantly to me, it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin! I use it every morning before I apply a BB cream!"
I bought this about a week ago and so far so good. It smells really nice and it definitely hydrates my skin without being oily. I love it. Makes my skin feel good.
I have been using this product for one month. I have sensitive acne prone skin. This product does not cause breakouts. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin moisturized.
I've been using this for a little over a month now. My skin feels much less dry and looks better. Midwest winters are hard on 60+ year old skin but this helps significantly!
"Smells great and dries quickly without leaving oily residue. My skin cleared up, not sure if it was because of this product or the Healthy Skin Boosters Facial Cleanser. I've been using both and they both work and smell great!"
"I've been using this product for a little over a week. I find that this cream is light as a feather, penetrates almost immediately, and keeps my skin moist for hours. Light fragrance, too."
I have been using Hydro Boost water gel for almost a year now after using several other age/wrinkle creams and this one actually shows me the positive reduction of lines and wrinkles!! I love it! I am going to try the other hydro boost products.
"So happy with the results of Hydro Boost Water Gel, the cleanser and the cream. Unbeatable combination for fine lines and not so fine lines! Makes my skin look Young and healthy. Thank you Neutrogena!"
I have been using this product for 4 months now and I can really tell a difference in my skin. It is hydrated and silky soft. I love the way this melts into my skin and feels cool and refreshing. Everyone should be using hydro boost gel.
"tried many other products over the years, keep returning to Neutrogena due to its performance. Have very sensitive and dry skin as well as age related issues, Neutrogena delivers!"
"I have been using this product since it first came out. It is refreshing, hydrating and is also a great base before your morning and nighttime beauty regime. I am addicted and cannot function when I have run out. Seriously the best product ever."
I bought this because I am 68 and need a little hydration in my neck and face areas. I recently lost 25 lbs and needed the extra boost. This is a great product and it really helps!
"This was recommended to me by an employee. It is very creamy, never greasy and my make-up never cracks; my face is smooth all day. I am 70 yrs old. This is a great product from Neutrogena."
"I love this lotion for my face! I had been using the Healthy Skin face lotion with sunscreen and I would get a burning sensation when I applied it. Not the the Hydro Boost Water Gel with sunscreen! It applies light & smoothly, and no burning sensation!"
"This new moisturizer is light, non-greasy and absorbs quickly. It also has an spf of 15, which is very good for me. I have oily, but sensitive, skin. Many moisturizers that I have tried with spf irritate my skin. This hydro boost water gel is light and does not irritate like so many others I have tried. It also does not have the strong fragrance usually associated with sunscreens and suntan lotions. I highly recommend!"
"I bought a few weeks ago along with the cleanser and lip treatment. My skin feels tight, not supple and soft."
"I've been using the product for a week now and I'm very happy. It's hydrating, but very light and absorbs quickly."
I really believe this product has help my skin. I put in on my neck and face am and pm. No turkey neck for me. My husband even uses it.
I bought this a month ago. My skin in moisturized and looks young and dewy. I am a young looking 65 year old.
I have been using for a year and love how it makes my face and neck feel. Great gift for friends and family.
Light and moist. Just the right about of moisture and never feels greasy or heavy. Dries quickly so you can do make-up soon after application.
"This product is exactly what I needed. It absorbs instantly, leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, and never feels greasy."
"This entire product line is amazing, especially spending so much time in the sun, my skin is renewed!"
"I bought this products a month ago and they did the job right , Hydro bust body gel,"
"Hydro bust water gel, Deep clean gel scrub and men shave gel."
One think to say they are the best I buy strait on line great price free shipping
"This daily moisturizer does what it says. I only have to use one pump and that covers my whole face. I bought it mainly for the SPF because I live in Arizona and have to have sun protection everyday. There's hardly no smell and it feels really nice on the skin. The only issue I have is with the packaging. The pump is small and if you stand it up with the plastic cap, it has a tendency of being too top heavy and tipping over."
I love the water gel finally I found something that doesn't make my face itchy thank you.
Finally tried this and it's is so worth the money...
I love this cream and buy the sunscreen for first time and is the best!
"I bought this long time ago and keep using, shared with my mom and she likes it too."
The product is fine but I was surprised there was no inner seal when I opened jar.
The fact that I bought five should tell you all you need to know.
I bought this product a few months ago and won't stop reordering!
This is very hydrating. I used Retin-A and this hydrates my dry skin very well.
"It recommends the new product, one of my new favorites."
This is great. Not too greasy. Applies evenly and my skin feels so soft.
"I like the soft feel on my face , not drying , last through the day"
its good but need long time to absorb，im oily skin
The nongreasy feel and good performance is a plus. I will buy this again for dry winter days
"I've been using the Hydroboost line for over a year now, and I'm in love. It has made my skin so much softer. It has seriously worked wonders for me."
Product definitely hydrates. Skin hasn't loved it though. Some breakout is occurring.
Product does what it claims. Not perfect for my skin.
"If you have even slightly dry skin, go for the extra-dry skin version. I don't feel this one is moisturizing enough for my skin. I have to apply it twice in most areas to feel I'm getting the benefits."
"I have tried so many face products and this is my favorite. Provides continuous moisture that is OBVIOUS, it doesn't leave you wondering if it is still working. I can actually see and feel the difference."
This is a good product.... absorbs fast into the skin making your face feel super soft. I don't recommend this for people with severely dry skin though. This tends to work better for oily skin types.
"My 4th order. Great moisturiser and not greasy, great absorption"
With just a couple of uses since I recently bought it and it works really good
Absorbs quickly cool feeling love it skin feels hydrated
Love the way this cream makes my face feel and it smells so good!
I have had this product for 1 month I love the product
I like the way the hydro boost water gel feels to my face. It is not oily feeling and my skin doesn't feel dry.
Awesome product I can recommend to my friends and family I been using this product last couple weeks and I can notice change
I have used this before and absolutely loved the feel of my skin when I use it. Never feels greasy or heavy and moisterizes my face very well.
I love the way my face feels after applying the hydro boost water gel. I use it under my BB cream and foundation.
I've been trying to use natural products but nothing seemed to work on my forehead wrinkles . So I saw this on sale and thought why not try. I used it and went to bed woke up and couldn't believe the difference just with one use. My pores also were smaller on my nose to . I will definitely be buying again and recommending to others
"I have always been a Neutrogena junkie and have used many different moisturizers that fit within my combination, acne prone skin made within the skincare line. After buying Hydro Boost, I will never go back! And now it comes with SPF so that I can wear it everyday. Thank you!"
I'm on my like 4th jar of this and I can't get enough. Most moisturizers clog my pores and I have tried various different kinds. This was recommended by a beauty guru on youtube (Lauralee if wondering) and I have been using it ever since. I have got many others hooked on this product as well.
"I have been using Neutrogena products since I was in elementary. This product Hydroboost is the most amazing product there is. I never had skin problems, but I love the cool feeling on my skin and it does keep it hydrated. I have oily skin and this product is SPOT ON for my skin type. I wish i could order a case. Please do not go off the market. I don't know what I would do if I could not get this anymore."
"This is by far the best moisturizer I've used. Many moisturizers break me out because they're too oily, but this one is perfect!! I've been using this for around a year, and I will probably never use another moisturizer. The only thing I will say is that the blue dye is kind of annoying. I get that's it's trying to imitate water, but I think that this product would be even better if the harsh, chemical-y dye was taken out."
I have repurchased this cream multiple times. I enjoyed using it but the ingredients include fragrance and blue dye. It would be a really great cream if it did not include these two unnecessary ingredients. I have tried the extra-dry skin version to not have fragrance and blue dye but it is a bit too much for my skin. Please come out with a new version without fragrance and dye. I would buy it again if this change happened!
"I had the same problem as reviewer NayB. The first time I used it my skin felt a bit dry. After 3 nights of use my face felt burning as soon as I put it on. I do alternate between retin A and a mild glycolic acid cream because I have extremely oily skin. I thought this would help with the dryness that occurs in the winter when I use these products. The retin A and glycolic acid cause no issues in the summer, but really needed a moisturizer for the winter. Will be on the search for something else."
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Neutrogena, for this incredible product! I can't tell you how many products I have tried in an effort to rid my 83-year-old face of flaking skin due to life in the Californa desert. At last, you have provided everything I have been searching for in facial skin care! I am in love with my new look and will no doubt try the eye Hydo Boost version as well. So grateful!"
"I have always been a Neutrogena junkie and have used many different moisturizers that fit within my combination, acne prone skin made within the skincare line.. After buying this moisturizer, I will never go back! It's so lightweight and instantly absorbs into your skin, it's like you can actually feel your skin becoming hydrated at the tips of your fingers. I love that it does not leave my skin feeling oily"
"I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and I ordered this because it is one of the only moisturizers I've ever found with zero comedogenic or irritating ingredients (nothing over a 1). It doesn't break me out, but when I put it on it stings and leaves my skin red. Nothing else on the label is an irritant, so I have to assume it is attributable to the fragrance, which is pretty overwhelming. Bummer. I would try the unscented hydrogel, but it has synthetic beeswax, which is comedogenic : ("
Hydro Boost Water Gel is simply the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have had oily/acne prone skin my entire life and have tried everything from dermatologist recommendations to high priced department store moisturizers. Nothing has kept my skin soft and oil free until now. I use it twice a day and my skin never feels oily.
I recently purchased this product at my local drugstore and decided to test it on my face right away. I washed my face with the Hydro Boost gel cleanser and rubbed the water gel all over my skin. It felt very light and didn't make my skin feel oily. My skin is sensitive and a tiny bit dry and most lotions burn my skin as I use them but this one did the complete opposite! My skin has never felt smoother and is very soft to touch. I would totally recommend this product. Thanks Neutrogena!
"I have been a staunch Chanel skin care product user for years. After paying hundreds of dollars for creams, serums etc.. I decided to try the Neutrogena Hydro line and purchased the water gel and eye cream. My skin is sensitive so I tend to be careful with eye creams since watery eyes is a problem reaction at times. I have been using both products for a couple of months, finishing my first tube and jar and I love the results. My skin never looked better and the value is amazing! I am now heading out to restock my supply."
"I love this product. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I wish they didn't put any scent in it. If a person has asthma, this will bother them and they don't need to add more stuff to good stuff already. The least amount of added stuff, the better. It would cost the company less to add less with wonderful results. I would be happy also to have it clear instead of using dyes. Clear like water is good, no added stuff. Company, please consider this."
"I got the serum, eye cream and hydro boost gel and I love the 3 products! They are awesom! Some reviews said about the fragrance, but I think is a very pleasant one is not offensive at all. By the way I am 60 years old and have used very expensive products throughout my life and these are my number 1 products now!"
So I purchased this product because I heard such great things about it and I wasn't disappointed.
It applies very easily and a little goes a long way. I have super oily skin and my skin just loves it. It does not leave any oily residue and it absorbs quickly. Doesn't leave your skin feelings rubbery or heavy either.
I also love it because make up is easy to apply with it. Im very satisfied!
"My dermatologist recommended the Neutrogena Hydro Boost line to me and I have purchased the serum, water gel, and eye gel cream. I like the eye gel cream, which seems to have no scent, and the serum, which has a little scent. The water gel, however, is unpleasant to wear because is too strongly scented. It would be great if Neutrogena would reformulate the water gel with less or--better yet--no scent."
I've been using this for about a year and love it. It works on my middle age skin and equally as well on my teenage daughter without causing break-outs. We live in a very dry climate so it is a real statement to say it keeps our skin soft and moisturized. My comment is that the package uses SO much plastic! I'm certain there is a way to cut down on that waste. I'd feel better about how many we've purchased if it didn't put so much in the trash or recycle bin.
"I don't usually write reviews, but everyone needs to know how amazing this is! I have really dry skin in the winter and I was looking for a morning moisturizer. This product works wonders. It completely soaks in and leaves no sticky residue. It is perfect for under makeup and keeps your face moisturized all day long! You only need a small amount for your entire face so it is definitely worth the money! It lasts for a very long time."
I love this as a daily moisturizer. I live in the WashingtonDC area and it's beastly hot and humid in the summer. This product weathers all. Never makes my face breakout. And helps keep your foundation smooth and fresh. Please never stop making this Neutrogena. I've even given this as gifts.
"I daily use the Hydro Boost with SPF !5% in the morning, and the Hydro Boost Water Gel w/out sunscreen at night. I'm 73, but my skin is very moist. I don't need those heavy creams anymore...my skin is too thin now to absorb most of them. I will stick with Hydro Boost Water Gel!"
"I can't even begin to say how happy I am about this moisturizer! I've never found a moisturizer that was light enough for my skin. I have very oily skin and I feel like my pores clog easily. This moisturizer isn't a heavy cream at all. It's a really light gel and it gives my skin such great moisture while being so light on my skin! Not to mention, it smells FABULOUS. So pleased and I'll continue buying."
"I love this stuff. I only tried it a couple times, but I am already in love with it. I do have a question though. After you apply Hydro Boost, can you apply another daily moisturizer? At night is it OK to apply my night time wrinkle cream? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks Neutrogena for making such a wonderful product. Love all your products!"
"I'm 65 and spend weekends in the Florida Sun (Flea Market Vendor) and for this in spite of using spf 100 have developed seriously deep wrinkles... Have used every product in the market and have found that Hydro Boost Gel is the only one that works instantly leaving my skin supple, wrinkles disappear and the scent is soft and quite lovely.... The value is excellent... Thank you for finally producing such a wonderful product....."
"I have oily skin and dry skin and I am sensitive as well, am oily in the T-zone and dry on the cheeks. It's been hard to find a moisturizer that would fit my skin needs, this not only moisturize the dry spot it doesn't over moisturizer the oily ones. Not only that it doesn't irritate, living my skin softer, smother and hydrated."
I have been struggling with skin issues from my medication I need to take for medical conditions. This product is the only thing that has helped. My skin is no longer dry and blotchy and it is amazing. I also adore the cool feeling when I apply it. I wish I could soak my whole body in a tub of this every day. THANK YOU NEUTROGENA ! YOU HAVE MADE THE BEST PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.
"I am a senior citizen (age 65), who doesn't like putting greasy products on my face. This is so light, and absorbs so easily. Keeps my face hydrated all day. Love it! I just learned that they have an unscented version, and since I am allergic to fragrance, I can't wait to give that a try."
"I have combination oily skin. I bought it few days ago, I was shocked about how my t-zone not getting oily like my other moisturizer. I'm wondering is it because this moisturizer is so hydrating? Because face producing oil because it lack of hydration. The only con was I don't like the scent. But will definitely continue using this product."
"I have always suffered with dry skin on my face due to having eczema, and also very sensitive skin. I find it hard to use any sort of face creams, even the sensitive ones with out it stinging my face for at least 5 minutes or making me go red and hot. This cream doesn't do any of that, it smells amazing and my skin is so soft to touch now. I have only been using this product for 7 days and I love it! I apply every night before I go to bed, or before applying makeup."
"This product smells great! I have been using this product for over 6 weeks now and although initially, I loved the lightweight, hydrating feel of it, I now recognize it might be what is causing the burning, irritating sensation on the skin under and around my eyes. I might give the gel cream a try but am a bit skeptical, given the price. The product feels great on the rest of my skin!"
"In the summer of 2016, I was searching for a face cream but stumbled upon and consequently started using Hydro Boost Water Gel - and I loved it right away! The moisturizing effects coupled with the sheer lightness of the product was perfect for me and I was fairly impressed with myself for 'discovering' it. After using it for a few weeks, a friend came to stay with me and couldn't believe that I suddenly looked to be in my early 30's. I'm 48! This product is my forever friend!"
"This is a great product, but I can't use it daily like I would like. My skin is sensitive to fragrance. Usually I can always find neutrogena products fragrance free - but can't find this without fragrance. Works so well on aging combination skin, but have to limit use."
My overall skin texture has improved and my skin feels and looks wonderful. I gave been using this product for the past two months and am anxious to see how it works in the winter. I also have very sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate it at all. Compared to other moisturizers it relatively economical to use and works very well with makeup.
"I have fairly normal skin and I've been using this product for a little while now. It keeps me so hydrated and supple. Also this sinks into the skin so nicely, it's perfect for under makeup. I hate things that sit on your face but it absorbs so quickly and has a very pleasant scent."
"I have very oily, acne-prone skin, so regular moisturizers usually leave me looking like I swam in Crisco. This gel was a welcome relief as it did not leave me looking shiny, absorbs well into the skin (providing you don't use too much) and smelled heavenly. My face was left moisturized minus the oil slick. I would definitley recommend this to my oily-skin ladies. I got this product complimentary from Influenster for review and testing."
"I'm obsessed with the hydro boost gel cream, but was looking for something similar with SPF. Unfortunately, as someone with many skin sensitivities, I can't get past the fragrance in this. PLEASEEEEEEE make a version of the gel cream (which I LOVE and is fragrance and dye free), with SPF!"
"I'm nearing 40 and my skin is getting dryer, especially just under my lip. This product has been the only thing that has worked on it. Also... it. Smells. Incredible. I usually don't like scented products, but this scent is so crisp and clean, I love sniffing it before applying. It's the highlight of my morning get-ready routine"
I bought this product after watching a skin care video by a beauty influencer on YouTube. I have been using different neutrogena products since I was a teen and besides the makeup removing wipes this is no my FAVORITE! I'm on my second jar now and it has brought so much moisture of my skin and I never had a break out which is huge for me. It's affordable and the smell is an added bonus. Overall i would recommend this product for sure!
"This moisturiser is very hydrating and leaves my skin soft. My skin is smooth, not greasy. Because it has SPF in it, it smells like a sunscreen, but the smell goes away rather quickly so that's ok. I also use the Hydro Boost Gel Cleanser, and combined"
these two work beautifully on my face.
"I purchased this product in Jan 2017 in search of a good moisturizer. Didn't think it would work because it said hydrating, instantly making me think I would look like a GREASE SLICK. Boy was I wrong. I am very oily and with this product I not only hydrate my skin, I DON'T have to touch up my makeup due to oil breakthroughs. It's the only moisturizer for me."
"Many products claim to give you ""visible"" results in a few weeks. This one does. I truly believe my skin looks better and that I look younger. I wasn't sure I would like a gel, but this goes on great, smells wonderful and, most importantly, it works!"
It's been such a difficult struggle finding a moisturizer that balances the oil on my T-Zone without making my cheeks oily and after buying and trying dozens of moisturizers I started to lose hope that I would ever find one perfect for my skin until now. This was actually recommended by my dermatologist and I am so thankful it is. This gel is super hydrating without feeling tacky and makes my skin feel incredibly soft.
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! I have oily combination skin and this one doesn't make my skin more oily or greasy looking. Also, this is the only moisturizer that doesn't clog my pores. Some of the moisturizers that I have used leaves something like a residue on my pores and makes me break out. So I was so happy I tried this one. I hope this doesn't get discontinued!"
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer!!!! At 64 I still have acne prone skin. I've tried several of the ""high end"" skin care lines. All work great for the first 30 days (i.e., during the time period for returning them) and then my skin will start to break out again. I've been looking for a moisturizer for my face and neck that was not a lotion or cream and this is the only product I've been able to find. Easy to apply, absorbs quickly, and my face feels so smooth and soft!!!"
"I absolutely love this product! It's everything I've been looking for in a facial moisturizer... And more! It soaks into the skin in about 30 seconds (or less), leaves my skin moisturized all day long, and smells amazing! I recently got a sunburn and have been using this to moisturize my burnt skin (once the irritation went down) and I've barely peeled my skin's so moisturized! My only hope is that Neutrogena makes a body lotion with this formula... That would be amazing!"
"I've finished using the hydra boost extra dry skin and loved it because it was simple, fragrance-free and dye-free. I thought the normal version would be the same... Turns out it has a strong fragrance and a blue tint! Why do you have to put in all that extra useless"
ingredients Neutrogena ?!?!? I definitely will not repurchase but will repurchase the extra dry skin version
"This product is just amazing! It absorbs so quickly into the skin, doesn't stay greasy and it's perfect for use under make up as it keeps your skin hydrated and dewy looking and not super oily, even in the T-Zone! I used this twice a day (morning & night) and I can say it shows results very quickly. I wake up looking refreshed and my skin doesn't look or feel dehydrated. 10/10 would recommend this product."
"How refreshing! I wish someone had thought of this sooner. No more gooey creams for me. My face drinks this like cool water, feels soft and smooth, and there is no residue or pore-clogging. It's the very best thing I have ever put on my face. Thank you!"
I have tried nearly every type of moisturizer for dry/ combo 45 year old skin. This stuff is amazing. Smells great and leaves my skin feeling velvety soft. Hydration lasts all day and wears very well under makeup. So happy to have finally found a product that actually works.
"I saw this product advertised on television. I love and use Neutrogena products, so I decided to buy the Hydro Boost Water Gel. I loved the way my skin felt after one use. I am on the end of my first week and I will be ordering this again! It is light and not greasy. You will not regret this purchase!"
i tried this water gel hydro boost and at first thought the texture was wrong and the smell reminded me of a product i used i the 70s (nice & Icy) hey did you make that. well honestly i thought rats i can only use this at night but oh my gosh it melted into my skin and puffed my face or infused my face with skin fullness i could feel with my hands when i washed my face. my problem now can't find water gel in stores had to buy cream . it works too but so prefer water gel version seems lighter
"I received a sample at my local Target and loved this product from the start. I have combination skin and it is just the right amount of moisture. It is so soothing to use at the end of the day after I take off my make up. This cream has such a wonderful scent. Usually scented creams bother my face, but not this one. Nice job!"
"This would be perfect if it were fragrance free. Neutrogena, you have a fragrance free version of the hydroboost for very dry skin; why not make a fragrance free version of the sunscreen so that those avoiding fragrance, like me, can complete their routine?"
"I was about to buy the product. I had a research on internet, and was sure about it. Then I read the cover. I would like to know why methylparabene is indicated on the box but not here on the website."
I would like to decide according to your reply.
Thank you.
"This product does absorb well and feels soft on the skin, but unfortunately within 2 minutes of application my face turns red, and 20 minutes later my eyes are red. That's never happened to me with any product ever!!! Not sure what the problem is but I'm guessing it might be the fragrance... wish there were fragrance-free options in this line:("
"At the risk of sounding dramatic, I can't rave about this product enough. My skin has become extremely dry, flaky and tight-feeling as I've gotten older and I couldn't find anything to help. This product is like water in the desert for my skin - I feel instant relief when putting it on, and it keeps my skin feeling smooth, soft and hydrated without the greay, heavy feel of so many other products. I am 100% sold."
"I've been using this product along with the hydro boost serum for just over a month. I have always had extremely dry skin, especially on my forehead. I experienced immediate hydration the first time I used it, and continue to love it. This is the first product that has consistently worked for me (and I've tried LOTS of products). THANK YOU NEUTROGENA!!"
"Purchased this because I turned 26 and decided that just putting milk on my face with a cotton ball once a day for 15 minutes is not enough anymore, but I didn't want to get cream/lotion that would be too chemically for my relatively good skin. This stuff is perfect; I don't even want to explore other options."
This product is great but I wish it was in a different package the jar is good but I would prefer a bottle or squeeze tube. Overall product is amazing my skin feel hydrated and supple. I have a bunch of moisturizers on my dresser and everyday when I need to moisturize I always reach for the water gel wouldn't use anything else.
I think this product is really good my skin type can change from dry to greasy so a moisturiser that hydrates without a greasy look is just what I needed! I originally picked this product up as I had seen a review. It did say that it had an SPF 15 but I did not see this on the package... does it have an SPF15?
"I absolutely love everything about this product aside from the smell and the strange blue dye. This product does everything it says and more, doesn't cause break outs, lasts a long time, but has the worst fragrance added to it. I'm normally not very sensitive to scents but this product smells like a cheap air freshener to the extent that it makes me cough when it's on my face. I'm going to switch to the cream-gel simply because it is fragrance and dye free, hopefully it won't be too hydrating for my oily skin."
"I am not a moisturizer type person. I received this as a sample (walmart beauty box or sample source). I decided to try it last week and what a find!!! I love it. As soon as I put it on, it wakes up my face. All the other samples I have tried of other facial moisturizers leave me feeling, blah. Not worth my time. I can't wait to get a full size tube and start using it over and over."
"I have very reactive skin that breaks out almost every time I try a new product. This moisturizer is the best! It's lightweight, absorbs quickly, feels like water, doesn't smell heavy and doesn't have unnecessary ingredients. My skin is so much smoother and less irritated since using this. I'm on my second jar and have already bought a couple backups because I never want to be without it!"
"I am 73 and inactive ,have lung cancer, asthma, and arthritis. I have finally found something that works for me. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I use the hydro boost water gel in the morning and the hydro boost cream gel at night. It last about 1 mo. and then have to renew. I did and still love it. I am having trouble finding the pump makeup Healthy skin enhancer Lt to Neutral SPF20."
"I love that with just a little bit I can moisturize my entire face & neck without leaving a sticky residue like other moisturizers. This works perfectly under my Neutrogena concealers and really helps keep my face from getting too dry in the winter! Thanks Crowdtap & Neutrogena for the free sample. Disclaimer: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"This is hands down the best moisturizer i have ever used. I have normal to dry skin and this instantly soothes and hydrates my skin. I have also noticed since using this product, my skin has a natural glow to it that i didn't have before. My skin looks and feels radiant. I even got my dad using it, he loves it."
"I'm a 64 year old white female. My skin began to feel rougher as I aged. I could really tell a difference in the feel and look of my skin after one use. It was one of those ""wow"" moments. I was using the product every night but cut back to 4 times a week. Still getting fabulous results."
"I received this product as part of an Influenster package and was really surprised that it actually worked. I do not have extremely dry skin, but I do think I would benefit more from the gel, which I will be trying since this did help quite a bit. Overall, a good product, but the price is a bit steep. I say start off with a sample and go from there."
"I received this product through Influenster, but all opinions are my own. In fact, I have been using this product for years now, ever since I found it in Hong Kong. It is amazing! It says gel, but it is perfectly moisturizing - goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving your skin hydrated and feeling refreshed all day. I have sensitive skin and live in a very dry climate, so I am always looking for serious moisturizers that can I go under make-up, and this is the perfect product. I can't wait to try the eye gel!"
"Influenster sent me this complimentary product for testing purpose and I completely fell in love with it. Don't let the word ""gel"" scare you, this gel does hydrate your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and supple, and you don't need to apply a moisturizer afterwards. I definitely recommend it!"
"Would you please consider making a fragrance free version? Great lightweight moisture that goes on without feeling sticky (like competitors) and so far has kept my skin quenched all day. This was my first return to Neutrogena in 8 years, after switching to more expensive products, and this one impressed me. While the smell is sweet, for sensitive skin I would prefer no fragrance- to the point where I'd consider switching back."
"After using Hydroboost moisturizer for a week my skin feels smoother and is noticeably more even in tone and texture. Also, my liquid foundation (which I am using less of) looks better on now too - pores, fine lines, and redness all show less now. Thank you Neutrogena!"
"Purchased a couple of months ago and fell in love!! Used it all up & just purchased a new jar - the scent is SO STRONG that i can hardly stand to use it and it burns my eyes. SO DISAPPOINTED! I can see no “scented/unscented” options, so what happened? Please help!"
I had a place on my face that I just couldn't get a handle on. I exfoliated with a 2 part product that heated up when mixed. It worked great everywhere but this one place. I almost gave up until I saw this. It worked the first time. I told all of my friends on facebook about it! Thank you for a great product and keeping it affordable.
"This is a great product, it does Not leave a greasy film. It fully absorbs fairly quickly and plumps up my skin nicely. Feels great. I have tried other products and they do not absorb and leave a film. This is a great product, I would highly recommend."
"I love the blue jar, as it is cosmetically appealing. However, this product is too lightweight for my Normal to Oily skin. I much prefer the ""Extra-Dry"" formula to this one. I still recommend this product to those of you who reside in humid climates or possess Oily/Acne skin types."
"I'm a CPA and obviously have stress during tax season. Every tax season I would suffer from my face being so dried out it hurt and I was having a hard time staying focused on work. I read about your product in People magazine and decided to give it a try. After a month, my face felt normal again. Thank you!!"
"I've been using this for a couple weeks and I am obsessed! It smells fresh and makes my skin so soft. My pores get clogged really easily, but they have already started clearing up since I started using this. I have also noticed I don't really get oily throughout the day anymore. I think this is because my face is already hydrated so it's not overproducing as much. I never write reviews but I was super impressed by how well this is working for me. Would recommend!"
"I completely dried up my face using tea tree oil and other acne products for a breakout. My face was peeling and flaking and was quite embarrassing. I bought this and the overnight hydro boost mask. Both are awesome products. I use this daily now as my. Moisturizer. I haven't broken out, it feels so refreshing, and works well alone or under makeup. My skin isn't flaking anymore and someone even commented saying my skin has a nice glow!"
I've been using this product daily for 2 months. I definitely agree with the claim that it doesn't clog pores. Finally I found a moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts. I live in Massachusetts where it gets really cold and dry but this product is super moisturizing and I rarely have dry skin with this product. I struggle with acne and get really bad breakouts at times. My breakouts haven't been as bad since using this product.
"This product is terrible. Whether you order online or buy in store it comes in a jar without a plastic piece over it to peel off. It's very smooth, but it dried my skin and left dry patches all over. I would put it on after my moisturizer and wake up with a flaky dry face. It also made me break out. DON'T BUY THIS."
"My skin is very sensitive and so is my nose. Most scents cause allergy-like symptoms, watery eyes, runny nose, itchy, or sore skin. I hesitated to buy this product, fearing more of the same, but I do trust Neutrogena. So glad I tried it. My skin is soft and smooth, the scent is light and pleasing, and no part of my body reacted badly to it. We have a winner! I moved from a moist climate to desert and my skin was not pleased. This is a game-changer. Thank you for such a great product!"
"I'm so bummed about this product. I bought this and the serum a few days ago after deliberating for weeks. Beautiful, enticing packaging. Everything feels nice in the bottle and on my fingers, but when I put it on my face, it gets very itchy. I just wanna wash it off! It's a shame because my skins does look very fresh and glowy, but I can't stand the itching! Also, the scent is strange, it reminds me of laundry soap. I feel bad because I love most Neutrogena products I try, but this one was a bust."
"I've tried a few moisturizing products, but all leave my skin feeling heavy, clogged, and oily. Neutrogena Gel face moisturizer is the only product that I can use, and my skin feels great! I can even wear my liquid or powder foundation too, and my face can breath!"
"I have used Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for years, and when the Hydro Boost came out I thought I would give it a try. I first tried tha Hydro Boost water gel and it was Ok, then I tried the Hydro Boost Water Gel with sunscreen and had an itchy, hot, red rash. Never having an allergic reaction to anything, thought I would give it another chance, again, having the same red, hot, itchy rash that covered my whole face and neck! I don't know what ingredient is causing this but I am done! Going back to Rapid Wrinkle Repai!"
"I've been using it at least once a day, if not two times a day, depending on how often I wash my face- it's so refreshing and light on my skin, I've only been using it for a week and I've noticed a huge difference already in my skin's tones and textures. Totally in love with this stuff."
"I've tried Neutrogena products and I love most of them. I've been looking for hydrating products since lately I've been suffering from acne and the medications are drying my skin. I saw the reviews were great and was hoping to have a good review but after using it, it leaves me a burning sensation, I thought it could be the acne medication but after just applying the hyroboost on its own I realize it was the moisturizer. I have no idea what ingredient makes it burn but I'm shocked that not everyone experiences this."
"This is the best moisturizer for my combination oily skin. I used to skip moisturizer in the morning because they all led me to get the ""greasies"" later in the day. But my skin was suffering without an AM moisturizer. This is perfect. It hydrates my skin without leaving a greasy, slick feel or making my t-zone oily as the day wears on."
"I loved this product! It smelled amazing and was so soft. After a few weeks of using it, my skin started to burn. It became hard to let it be exposed to wind, I'm from Boston our winter was horrible. So I swapped to just once a day, still nothing. i stopped using it and my skin immediately recovered. I loved the product and will still tell people it just wasn't for my sensitive skin."
I love the results I have received from the hydro boost water gel! I experienced slight irritation the first couple of days but after that everything was great! My skin is smooth and breakout free and I have even noticed a slight reduction in my laugh lines. Definitely worth a purchase! #gotitfree
"After one week of trying this product day and night, I did notice my skin being much more supple, smooth, and hydrated which was much needed considering we are in the middle of Winter here in the US. I wasn't sure if this product would dry quickly but I'm happy to report that it dries to a touchable finish."
Wow! I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately even though my skin looked and felt great the fragrance was OVERWHELMING! I smelled it from the time I put it in in the morning until I washed it off at night. I can't understand why they would put a fragrance in a face cream. I can't believe I read about this on a dermatologist blog. Almost great product. But ultimately an epic fail.
"I wish this product was available in a fragrance & dye-free formula for sensitive skin. There are a lot of things I liked about this product: the consistency was great, very hydrating, did not clog my pores, worked VERY well with my oily skin (most moisturizers leave my face looking/feeling greasy). Unfortunately, the fragrance & dye were very irritating-very disappointing."
My skin has never been drier since starting to use this product. It seems like the gel almost dries out my skin so that I have to keep putting more on. I really want to love this product and I may try and push through it a little more but it just isn't working for me. My skin is so dry now! I think I will go back to what I was using before with more hyaluronic acid.
I can't say enough great things about this moisturizer! I have such sensitive skin and have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't irrate it. I have photosensitive skin due to having Lupus and have tried so many moisturizers that have caused irritation. This is so gentle on my skin and hydrates it beyond belief!
Thank you so much! ❤️❤️❤️
I love Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen! Originally I was skeptical that anything labeled a &quot;gel&quot; would work well for me and that it wouldn't be sticky. Let me tell you I was wrong on both accounts! This product moisturises beyond comparison
but it doesn't leave any type of film or stickiness behind and yet is completely light weight on the skin. I definitely recommend this.
"This gel is remarkable! My dry, diabetic skin is so much more comfortable than before. Thank-you for Hydro-Boost. The only drawback is the price! It is frustrating to find a quality product, but understand cosmetic markups mean it might not be available to all who would benefit from its use."
"I was hoping to find a really great moisturizer, and this product felt nice right when I put it on, but absorbed so quickly and left my skin feeling dry. I had to apply another moisturizer on top of it. My skin is not overly dry, but not oily by any means. I had used a gel moisturizer in the past, but the product was discontinued and I could never find a replacement. I was hoping this was the one. This product is packaged very nicely and smells great, I wish I wasn't disappointed."
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer!! I have terribly dry skin, more so in the winter, and this has made an amazing difference in my skin's appearance and texture. I used this every morning and plan to purchase when I run out. I received this as part of my Influenster membership; opinions are strictly my own. This will become a part of my daily skin regimen!"
"This product is fabulous I have been using neutrogena products for at least 20 years,and this is wonderful I just turned 62 last month and I always have taken good care of my skin been told I don't look 62 so I'm keeping my Neutrogena and this Hydro Boost is everything they say it is!"
"I love this product so much! I have been having really dry skin and the Hydro boost Water Gel has helped my face feel less dry! I apply it on my face and wait about fifteen minutes before I add any face primer or foundation! My face feels amazing now that I have been using this! I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."
"I have been loving the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel. I was able to try it out courtesy of Influenster. It hydrates the skin without that greasy feeling, which I'm a huge fan of. Also, it dries extremely quickly so you don't have to wait forever to start putting on your makeup or getting on with your day. It's really a consistency that I've never experienced before. Overall, it's a really great drugstore product that I would definitely recommend! ‪#BehindTheGlow‬ ‪#Neutrogena‬"
"It leaves my skin so soft and smooth and it never feels greasy. I am not sure what the other reviewers are referring too but mine has virtually no scent at all, no blue dye and it does not sting or tingle. I use the cleanser as well and love that too."
"I have been using this in conjunction with the gentle facewash for over a year and it has done wonders for my skin. Even during the cold and windy Michigan winter, my skin did not chap! Keeping it moisturized has evened out the oil production for my face too and my normally acne prone skin cleared up so nicely! I never thought I would ever get compliments on my skin, but I have since using the hydro gel! I would highly recommend giving this product a try."
"I fell in love with this product the minute it touched my face! I have combination skin and usually the skin around my cheeks and specially my forehead gets super dry! Every moisturizer i tried felt too heavy on my face, but this one feels so soothing and light! It's amazing."
"After a week of use, i noticed my skin around my forehead was no longer dry or flaky."
"This product is amazing ,but I have a question is it normal that when I used it I get like a burning sensation on my skin than is redness in my chin after 2 minutes is gone and ot looks normal , and the next morning on my chin I see dead skin , I need to know if this is normal .. I really love the product I just need to know if this will not affect my skin .. I also wish that you guys recommend me more products for combination skin , Thank You."
I bought the gel-cream version first and that one broke me out which is weird because it doesn't have the fragrance in it..I guess cause it's heavier. The water gel only one so far has worked SO much better. My skin just soaks it up and it makes it feel nice. But it does have a scent which doesn't bother me . I have combo skin w dry patches. I recommend the water gel
I just found the Hydro Boost Water Gel today and am already in love with it. I had my skin moisture level checked before and after using this product. I went from 25% to 55%. It is so silky soft and it smells so fresh. I can't wait to see what the hydration levels show after using this product for a week.
I bought this item last week. I have oily skin and wanted a moisturizer that had no oils in it and was light weight and thought to give this a try. On my skin it feels so cooling and light and the smell is great I think. I have sensitive skin due to eczema and this did not irritate it at all. My skin is the most hydrated it's been.
"I really like this product! I received a small sample with a purchase and instantly liked the feel, the coverage and it being non-greasy after application so I bought a full sized product. I'm now on bottle number two. I have constant acne so have never"
been able to find a face cream that doesn't aggravate it. This is the one!
"OMG!! and my husband made comments, which he hardly does. And the scents are heavenly, so refreshing and well scented."
Been using them now for months. I have introduced tenths of my friends. NEUTROGENA MIRACLE!
"PLEASE DONT EVER CHANGE. My only problem i cant find''EYE CREAM AND BODY LOTION"""
"I've been using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel at night after my normal skincare routine. My products tend to dry my skin out, and this moisturizer is the perfect remedy for my flakey skin! I wake up looking refreshed! It smells great and it really works instantly!"
"I was so excited to receive this as a member of Crowdtap. I tried the product right away and I loved it. My skin felt so soft. The scent was a little strong but not bad. The day after I used this product, my face broke out, it looks like a burn/rash. I have never had sensitive skin and I didn't change anything else in my routine, there is just something in this product that didn't agree with me."
"We women tend to look for miracles in our face creams but this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Face Cream is pretty darn close. In fact, I like many of the products in this series, particularly the hand cream. I prefer not having to dip into jars, so I appreciate the tube dispenser and suspect that it prolongs its potency?"
I found this when I ran out of my old lotion. This is far better and my skin is not dry any more.
I bought this a year a go and am so happy that I did
"I bought 2 weeks ago and so in love Whit this cream so light, absorb very fast, my skin feels so hydrated and fresh in so short time, amazing."
The product broke my face out in fine bumps and fried it my skin even more. I am so upset and had to go and see a Dermatologist. :(:(
"Hydro Boost Water Gel has a nice smell, felt good putting on, and absorbed into my skin quickly. I love that it doesnt make my face oily like most sunscreen products, but I dont think the 15 is enough."
I received this product in my allure box this month and I was very excited to try it. I love how light it is when applied but it quenches my dry winter skin. This is my go to night moisturizer now!
"This Hydro Boost Water Gel is a fantastic product! I have used it for about 4 months, and it really makes a difference in the look and feel of may complexion."
"Please offer fragrance free options for all of your products. Or better yet, just don't add fragrance to anything. Really don't need perfume on my face."
"I use the whole hydro boost collection. I start my cleansing my face with the gel cleanser then use the serum, eye cream, then top it off with this moisturizer. My face has never felt or looked as clean as it does now. It's amazing."
Love it but for some reason it burns my skin when first applied. I will continue to use it as I haven't found such a good moisturizer for my oily/dehydrated/acne-prone skin.
My skin is very oily and I have to watch what I put on my face because it makes my skin oily but not this product. My skin has truly gotten softer and looks younger. I love it.
"Why put fragrance in this product? I love the version without sunscreen but I wanted the same thing without fragrance, especially an extra dry version with sunscreen, no fragrance."
"Hi, I don't care what color it is as long as it works. I don't want to slather a chemical dye all over my skin or a uanessacry fragrance. You could pick up so many more buyers by being fragrance and dye free."
"This is a nicely textured hydrating gel that leaves no oily residue. I really wish they would make a fragrance free version though. This smells like febreeze and gives me a headache. For this reason, I had to stop using it."
This is a great moisturizer it makes my skin feel smooth but also i have oily skin and it doesn't create that extra shine. Its perfect and for a good price compared to other moisturizers ive tried in the past.9
"My dtr and I like your product, however we feel there is only a small amount of product and that we are paying for excess packaging and unnecessary thick jar. Very wasteful and not environmentally wise."
I thought this would be a great product since it's water-based. I've been using for a week and my skin is more dry and flaky. I am also breaking out a bit - red bumps. Very disappointed.
Product dulled then burned my skin. I was really disappointed. I expected soft skin but it dried out my skin. I searched the internet to see if I was the only one
"OMG!! I bought this product almost a month ago and really really i can't stop love it. is so fresh and make feel my skin so well, stop shinning almost all the day. I really recommended this gel for all of you. NEUTROGENA YOU DID IT AGAIN!!"
Xoxo
"Because I am a swimmer, I have really dry skin. Since i've been using this product my skin is really soft. I am acne prone and because it has no oils it works amazing on me. When i use it, my skin immediately became soft. I love it!"
I bought this online. It was described as fragrance and dye free. When it arrived I realized the product had fragrance and dye in it. I'm so disappointed.
Ive bought the serum many times and loved it. This time i tried the gel. I was surprised by both the strong scent and the blue dye. They are both unnecessary. Im going back to the serum.
As soon as i put this product on my face and neck it started tingling and burning? Is this supposed to happen? I like how smooth my face feels but not the burning feeling and tingly pricks im getting ....
My skin has started getting drier as I pass 35 but most moisturizers are so heavy that my skin feels gross. This is the first product (including expensive options) that has hydrated my skin and left it feeling clean and fresh all day.
Great moisturizer - pleasant scent - better than much more expensive products. Skin absorbs immediately and feels soft without greasy residue. I use it day and night on face and neck.
I love how this feels on my skin and how my skin looks but the scent is so strong it gives me a migraine. I've tried it a few times but each time I've had to remove it because of the smell.
I bought it few months ago for the first time and I love this cream! My skin is very soft after first use and I just ordered another one (3rd).
It's perfect under makeup!
I'm 78 years old and have been using Hydro Boost Water Gel for Extra Dry Skin for about one year. It is just the very best!!! I do not use any other makeup but would just love to have a formula that contains sunscreen. Any chance?
"I loved it. The product smells really really good. I use it day and night. The most important part which I loved it most is, it can be used under make up. Awesome. Very refreshing :)"
I am very happy with this product. It plumps up my skin so I don't notice the fine lines. It lasts all day and makes my skin look younger! When I use makeup on top of the cream I have no complaints about how my skin looks.
I've been using this product for a while now. In the summer it worked great on my skin. But now that it's winter I notice it dried out my face and left it flakey.
Hydro Boost is a blessing for my problems. I use it daily to help with those expected problems. I highly recommend it for those of you with similar issues.
I've been using for 6 months now and this is great. It does exactly what it says...and it's a great primer too. My skin is so soft and my make up glows it's sets real nice.
Skin feels smooth and soft but it smells like fabric softener. And it strong. I don't know if I can continue using it because of the smell. Works well under make up.
I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and absolutely love this product. I have combination skin and this is the only product that I have used that moisturize my face without leaving it oily or shiny. It's the best ever!
"This product made my skin really soft and it keeps me feeling hydrated all day long. You just have to apply it twice a day, in the morning and at night. This is one of the best skin creams/gels I've used so far."
"I have very sensitive skin and am 43 years old, my skin was so dry until I tried this it is one of the best products I have ever seen. It did not irritate my skin and I noticed a difference immediately. You must try it."
"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used! My dry patches are gone and everything. Though I wish they sold this in bigger jar so I don't have to keep repurchasing so often. Other than that, it's amazing I am highly impressed!"
I have tried so many products (wasted so much money) over the years for my sensitive/oily skin and finally money well spent!!!!! I love this product so much and I'm on my 3rd round. Please don't ever discontinue
This product is more than amazing. It is perfect for my oily/dry skin. I love that it absorbs so quickly and wears well under make-up. My face feels smooth and supple.
I bought this today after carefully searching for a moisturizer with no oil and suitable for older skin. The perfume made my eyes sting and the moisturizer made my face itch. Another $20 down the drain.
This is very good moisturizer. It absorbs quickly with no sticky or greasy feel. In the summer I keep it in the fridge to give my skin a cool feeling after a hot day
"i was looking for a new moisturizing daily cream with spf and something for fine lines prevention, i love neutrogena and i bought it. it is very light feeling, i like the sensation and texture."
I just received this item and it feels amazingly lightweight. I love that I can wear it with light makeup and mine came with 30 spf protection for the hot Florida sun!!
"My boyfriend bought this for me about a month ago and I've been using it everyday. I love this product but for some reason, it burns a little. I get a great cooling effect, but it burns just a tad."
"I love how this product goes on the skin, how it absorbs quickly and feels great! As someone who has to be aware of sun damage I would sure appreciate a higher SPF percentage as this is typically a product you put on once a day."
I love this stuff. I get told I'm 20 and I'm really 35. I actually got my cashier where I bought it at to purchase it. I will definitely recommend this to people. I use it in the morning and at night
I like this product. It really helps my skin. I recently stated it was diffult to get product from tubing. I was wrong. I was attempting to squeeze the tube rather than pushing the top of the pump. I recommend this product highly.
I am absolutely in love with this moisturizer. It is not greasy and has a pleasant scent. I can really feel the difference in my skin as it hydrates it very well.
"I am 44 and have very dry and sensitive skin. This gel is so soft and rich, just a touch of a finger is enough for all my face, I'm so happy with this product. Thank you Neuteogena!"
Has a Very nice fragrance that when dries you don't feel it anymore. Boost your skin after 30 minutes in a way many other expensive creams have not done before for me. Price is reasonable. Very much recommend.
I have rosacea with sensitive skin tending toward dryness. This product does not irritate my skin and feels wonderful. I don't notice any odor with the product so don't understand what others are saying.
"Was looking for a substitution for Clinique Dramatically Different gel and tried this. LOVE!!! Cheaper and yes, better! So glad I tried it and will definitely buy again."
"I bought this 3 days ago I use it after shower and after washing my face at night and my skin feels like is going to break, I have a rash and itchy face."
It did what it said the very first time I used it. I rested my face in my hands hours after I put it on and could not believe it was my face I was touching!! It's so plump and soft.
I wanted to try this but I'm confused because it claims to be non comedogenic even though dimethicone is the second ingredient and doesn't that clog pores ?
I have combination oil dry skin and this is my new favorite moisturizer. It absorbs really st and I think it smells good. My only issue is that it's a little pricey but you get a lot of product which is nice.
"Love this product, it feels good on my face/skin and I love the gel formula. Also the fact that it is a SPF product is a bonus because I can wear it during the day when I am outdoors to protect my skin from those harmful rays... Great Product!"
I suffer from extremely dry skin and this product answered all my prayers... A little goes a long way! I am amazed at the condition of my skin and all of my friends are pleased as well. Awesome product
"Moisturizes and won't break my skin out, even in high humidity and heat. Perfect for summer. I wish they'd make a giant tub of this for all over the body."
I love this product and after using it for just two weeks i can already tell that my face is staying hydrated and not dried out. I especially needed that during these cold winter months.
"I've seen so many good reviews about this product; I was so excited to purchase it. After putting it on, it burned my face so bad. I was so excited to use it, but I just cannot. It physically makes me think my face is on fire. I'm so disappointed."
"I really like this product, i use it by chance and I have to say that I will buy it again, i can feel the difference when i don't use it, I highly recommend to apply the cream in the morning..!"
I have been using this product since it came out and I love it. All of the Hydo Boost products are excellent! They leave my skin feeling soft and clean. I try other brands once in a while but always come back to Neutrogena!
LOVE but I want a higher spf and better Packaging. If the Spf was higher it would be amazing! Also the packaging is very hard to use/maneuver when there is little product left. Please come up with a better packaging!
Bought for my daughter because this product disappears off shelves everywhere!
I have been using his product for over a year and love how it makes my skin feel
"I've been using Hydroboost Water Gel for the past 3 weeks and it's amazing. It goes on light and it's a great moisturizer. It doesn't make me feel oily at all. I would highly recommend it I !tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I received this for free from Influenster for testing purposes, and while I was SUPER excited to receive a full sized jar, I was disappointed when it BURNED after applying it. I have sensitive skin that is very dry from winter, but I use several other moisturizers that do not burn, so I'm not sure why this one did, but I don't want to use it again!"
Bought this a month ago... I have suffering terrible dry skin and I thought it would help. My dry skin began to rash and burn... It took me some time to realize that the dry skin was not causing the Burning Rash... It was the hydro-boost... I later confirmed it by testing it on my arm which immediately had the same burning rash though without the dry skin present on my face... I liked the feel smell and packaging of the product... But I will be finding something else and avoiding Neutrogena products in the future...
"I've been using the Hydro Boost line, and I absolutely love it. It goes on smooth, cool, not greasy, leaves smooth soft skin, they stays moisturized hydrated through out your day. I sometimes reapply because it looks and feels that good. Would highly recommend the Hydro Boost line."
This product instantly absorbed into my skin and felt great. I could feel my skin feel smoother and plumber and it felt like i had nothing on. It also didn't interfere with my makeup. I have dry skin and it kept me hydrated all day..I do think I need something richer for nighttime though.
"I recieved this product from influenster for review. I have been using this for 3 weeks now and absolutely love It. I have either oily skin or really dry depending on the season, this is great for the warm days when my skin is just too oily. I highly recommend it. It smells great. The price is a little on the higher side but you don't need a lot, so the jar will last you a while."
I am loving it this moisturizer. I have extra sensitive skin which is dry and flaky and this has helped so much. It goes on so nice and soaks into the skin nicely. It doesn't leave a sticky film and the smell is amazing. It is refreshing to my face and calms my skin when I have any irritation from the day.
"I have purchased this Hydro Boost SPF moisturizer for the 4th time. Yes, the FOURTH time! It's just perfect for my skin. It has a light scent, it goes on smooth, it doesn't irritate, and it's a decent price. I have used the cleansing gel, serum, eye cream, the water gel, the exfoliater, and most recently the mascara. And I have LOVED all of them. There is just something about this entire line that works beautifully with my skin. I'll continue to repurchase these products until I die or they no longer make them."
I just bought this product along with the exfoliating hydro boost wash and regular gel wash and I'm blown away! For years I've been looking for a product that would relieve my extremely dry skin. The exfoliating wash is great because it scrubs off all the dead skin cells and left my face so smooth. This gel cream is incredible because it doesn't feel greasy and it's cool on the skin while hydrating. I'm so grateful this product exists!
"I received Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for free, from #influenster for the purpose of my review. I must say, My skin get pretty dry around this time of year. And this water gel instantly quenches my skins thirst. I automatically feel smoother softer and all around healthier looking. I believe the word is ""supple"". I recommend this for all who are looking for something to stop the dry itchy face... #influenster #neutrogena #hydroboost"
"I love this gel because it is so super refreshing! It's hot in CA and this feels great when I apply it. It lightly moisturizes my skin without getting greasy. I only take away one star because it is pretty heavily fragranced like a clean linen candle. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I loved this product. I used it in the morning and at night before bed. I arose with fresh feeling soft skin and went to bed with the same. I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, and all opinions are my own."
"I���m a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I have been using this product daily for about a week now and I have already noticed a huge change in my skin. My skin feels softer and truly has a natural healthy glow that I have never seen before. My favorite part of this product is that once you put it on, it is almost weightless and feels so natural. I highly recommend this to everyone!"
I bought this product a week ago and it's horrible! It mad my face drier. I would never recommend this.
I've been using this water gel for over a year. Could not live without it. I'm 59 but my skin looks so much younger. I get many compliments.
"Now it has started to burn it went apply, even I feels burning after my makeup, I know it is caused by hydro gel cream."
I want this product to be fragrance free. I also would like to know the percentage of Hyaluronic Acid.
I bought this under the recommendation of my dermatologist and love it!! It smells so good and makes my skin felt silky and soft
Love this product. It feels so cool and light and leave skin smooth. I wish there was a product that feels this way for the whole body!
This is my favorite product. I use it daily and since I have started using last year I have no had any issues with dryness.
A woman complimented me on my good skin. It was so moist and healthy looking. Wish you would make a body lotion like it.
"I'm using the second one. My skin feels a little hot and burns, especially when i used exfoliating products on the same day."
"I got a sample from my Dermatologist, and it makes your skin smooth immediately like a primer and softens!"
"This is the best facial sunscreen, particularly for wearing under makeup. It's better than some department brands!"
I got this in the mail and used for the first time and it made my skin so hydrated and soft . It wasn't dry for 24 hours . I highly recommend this
"due to having sensitive skin, I was a little afraid to try it, but I'm glad I did! Moisturizes nicely; a little goes a long way, too."
This is the best product for my oily skin. My skin feels great. I use in the morning; my makeup last super good all day.
I love this product. My skin feels hydrated for 24 hours. I am over the age of 60 and found my new face cream.
"This has got to be the best moisturizer ever,I have tried many high end top brands,but this is definitely amazing."
I bought this item about two weeks ago and since then the texture of my skin has gotten worse it made my face dry and made me break out like crazy!
I only use Neutrogena products and have for years. My dermatologist recommends them too. Imagine that!!!!
Neutrogena hydroboost nourishes my skin like nothing else.....Gives it GREAT moisture....skin feels smoother and looks younger.....Worth the money...
I have been using this product for about a month now and I absolutely love it!! Thanks Neutrogena!!!
"Better than the department store gel moisturizer, and more affordable. I will keep using this forever!"
"Works well, even in humidity and feels lightweight but substantial at the same time. Really does plump out fine lines and I love the sunscreen."
Its the PERFECT product for this harsh winter weather. My skin stays hydrated for the whole work day. I'm completely obsessed with it. #GotItFree
I've incorpoated this product into my regular routine for a few weeks. I haven't noticed a dramatic change and prefer a lotion over the gel.
Great moisturizer with sunscreen and is non greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best day time fact cream that there is!!! It makes your skin so soft and it has spf 15 to protect from the sun.
"I bought this product about two to three weeks ago and so far, it kind of tingles/burns when I apply it and my skin has a few more bumps than it used to. I""m still trying to hold out hope for it, I'm just not sure if it's meant to burn."
"I was trying this review in hopes that it could be a great oily skin moisturizer, I was so wrong. It literally burns my face and makes be break out in a rash all over my jaw and cheek area. SOO AWFUL. Scent is overpowering, not happy!"
"I have very dry skin, especially on my face. The first day I used this product the difference was noticeable. The feeling of my skin as well as visually, an added plus was the great way I felt about me. After a week others noticed. I was hooked."
Great product!!! Has a fresh clean soap like scent that's smells great!! Love the cool gel texture of this product! Very different from other moisturizers. Left my skin soft and hydrated!!
"I bought this product on 3/9/18 and have been using it now every day since. In the morning after I was my face , I spread a little all over , I notice a huge improvement under my eyes and my skin looks younger ."
"I just started using the Hydro Boost moisturizer gel-cream and I love it. I have blushing rosacea and what a difference in my skin. My skin is soft, no dry spots and lot of the redness is gone. I will be getting the serum tomorrow."
I used this moisturizer for a while and loved that it was a gel with SPF in it so I could use it during the day. It worked and gave me light hydration that was good under makeup but it is a little pricey so I haven't re-purchased since.
"I love this so much!! I have combination skin, and acne. My skin was very dry and flaky so I got this and after the first use my skin felt smooth hydrated, but not greasy at all!! didn't make me break out!! I love this so much!"
Received this to try out and I must say it's amazing. Never had a moisturizer quite like this it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth even my husband commented on the feel of my skin. I would recommend to anyone.
"I bought this approximately two weeks ago. First it was really good, but that was because the temperature was warmer and my dry skin wasn't that bad, so it fixed that. As the days went by and the temperature got lower, it did nothing for my dry skin. I have to constantly be reapplying this 3-5 times a day. It also made me break out near my cheek area."
"The ingredient list is full of preservatives, one example is Methyl Methacrylate, extremely irritating to the eyes. One more for example, Pentylene Glycol, is used in many skin care products and may aggravate one who has a skin condition known as dermatitis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product only for night. Because i need my spf in the morning. I noticed when i mix spf with this product it makes my skin oily. I would love to try the one with spf in the hydro boost line. I know neutrogena released it in Hong Kong (I think). Waiting for the product to be introduced in USA. All are pros for this product only the no spf part.
"I really wanted to like this product. Out of the jar, the fragrance is pleasant but as the day progresses, the fragrance makes my eyes burn and sinuses ache. I used it twice with the same result. Because of this, I have no idea if the product is effective as a moisturizer. Too bad it's not offered for sensitive skin or unscented."
This moisturizing sunscreen was a good lightweight sunscreen to wear underneath makeup-does not leave an oily or greasy film on your face. I also noticed it did not leave a white cast on my face like a lot of other sunscreen moisturizers. I only wish it
came in a higher SPF for summer usage.
"I got a sample/trial size of this in with my neutrogena makeup remover wipes. I was skeptical, but then I tried it! I love how soft and smooth it makes my face feel. I have oily skin, but this product has actually helped with that! Now I'm on the hunt to find where I can get this product for the best deal!"
I received this from Influenster for free to try. I must admit I love it so much. It makes my skin feel replenished with moisture and it feels so soft. I highly recommend this. The best part this is extremely affordable and works just as well as the higher end products.
"I absolutely love this product. I have sensitive skin and live in a coastal area--so I am pretty picky when it comes to skincare products. This moisturizer is lightweight, doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or dried out. I received this product for free to test and review, but these views are all mine & I will purchase another jar when my current one is empty."
"I am always afraid to try new things when it comes to my face. My skin is so sensitive and I worry it will break out. But this stuff is magical. I put it on and my first thought was ""oh this is going to look so greasy"" but to my surprise it was very light and gave my skin the perfect glow. I was able to try the product for free and I have already convinced my sister to buy it! I can't wait to try some of the other products. Thanks Neutrogena!"
"I was pleasantly surprised how long my skin stays moisturized after using this. I was at first hesitant that it would cause my face to feel a bit oily after using it, but that wasn't the case. It has a soothing feeling, and I imagine it will be perfect in the summer time after some extended time in the sun. I was able to test this product after receiving it for free from Influenster, but all opinions are your own."
"I bought this about 2 days ago , and when I say it's amazing I mean it. It glides right on, and after about 15 seconds of drying, your face feels hydrated,cool,and refreshed. My skin is very VERY sensitive and breaks out with everything it touches. It's also very dry . This water gel has moisturized my face, without breaking me out.!!!!!"
I just bought this recently because it was recommended to me by a friend. I have sensitive combination skin. I couldn't believe how smooth and hydrated my skin is! The dry spots are no longer dry without feeling like the product is just sitting on top of my skin and the oily parts aren't greasy. I love it!
"I purchased the Hydro Boost Gel about a week ago based on all the great reviews and was looking forward to the same positive results. While it did feel wonderful going on my skin, I suppose the fragrance was an irritant and caused redness after a few uses. Disappointed. I do love the Ultra Gentle Hydrating cleanser though!!"
I was recommended Hydro Boost water gel moisturizer by my dermatologist because I have very sensitive and combo skin. I have tried lots of products but this moisturizer is by far the best thing to happen to my skin! It feels amazing while and after applying without that greasy feel afterwards! Love this product and I hope it doesn't go away because my skin feels and looks better than it has in a long time!!!
"This product is so smooth and feels great on my skin. It has helped immensely with my winter dry skin, and even a dry, irritated nose from being sick! I love this product and would definitely recommend it for dry skin. It doesn't irritate my skin like some other moisturizers I've tried in the past, and the hydration lasts all day.I received this product free from Influenster for testing, however these are my own opinions."
"I really like this product. I have tried many facial moisturizers and lots of them just make my face break out. I'm happy to say that I've been using this product for over a month with no breakouts. It makes my face feel soft, but not greasy. And, it smells nice and fresh too :) I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."
I recently received samples of this. and I am highly impressed! its ultra light weight. doesn't leave a nasty residue on my face. and my skin is noticeably soft. i have always been a huge fan of neutrogena. and they have really out did themselves with this product. I have really oily skin and i wear it in the morning under my make up and i apply it at night. and its such a rich moisturizer it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily at all. this is one of the best moisturizer i have used.
"I received this item for free through influents for a review and I have fallen in love!! So much so that I purchased 3 more jars for myself! My skin is SUPER dry, especially in the cold winter months. I used this night and day on my face in place of my typical moisturizer and felt quenched immediately. Within less than 7 days my skin completely changed and is now dewy and plump. Will use this product forever!"
"I recently received this to try. I normally have dry skin due to facial cleansers, been on a search to find a facial moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin oily. I was pleasantly surprised by this product, my skin is close to matte with this product. The fragrance is a bit strong, could do without the fragrance. Doesn't interfere with my makeup routine. Will purchase in the future!"
"I have been using this product for about a week now. I absolutely love it! My face is very dry after I wash it, as soon as I wash my face I put on the water gel and i feel an immediate difference. My face is refreshed and no longer has that dry rough feeling. It is truly an amazing product. I also love the smell of it."
"The thing I most love about the Hydro Boost Water Gel is that while leaving me skin moisturized it doesn't leave it greasy and shiny. I have combination skin and most moisturizers make my t zone shine like crazy. I will be using this product from now on. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I use to hate winters not just because of the freezing cold.but because It made my already dry skin that much drier. Not anymore! My skin has changed, I can feel the difference after a week and I do not forget this step in my skin care. Well worth the money."
"I have been using this product for two weeks now. We have had so many extremely cold days here. I really like how moisturizing the Neutrogena Water gel is. My face gets pretty dry in the winter, this product helps my face stay hydrated. I received this product for free to write a review."
"This winter has been a season full of frigid temperatures which makes for terribly dry skin. I began using the hydro water gel and my face has never been softer or more hydrated. I use it each morning and night and the results were almost instant. This is a great product that did not clog my pores and evenly moisturized my face! I would like to mention that I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I have tried numerous moisturizers. Since I have oily skin I have yet to find one that suits my needs.... until now. The Hydro Boost Water Gel does exactly what it states. It does not contribute to my oily skin but instead has balanced my skin while keeping it soft. It smells great also which is always a plus. I use this every night before bed and wake up to refreshed, hydrated skin."
"I absolutely love this product. I received this product free for testing. I have never tried any Neutrogena products before, but I will be continuing to add Hydro Boost to my daily routine. I have used so many facial moisturizers and I have not found one that has made my skin feel so fresh. Hydro Boost has a light fresh clean scent. It leaves my face feeling so soft and not greasy. I use this product each morning and night, I will defiantly recommend Hydro Boost to family and friends!!!"
I received this product for free to test it. I have very dry skin and couldnt wait to give this a try. Im really surprised how soft my skin feels now. It also leaves a refreshing feeling on my skin. I will continue with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel
"I LOVE Hydro Boost water gel. My skin feels so nourished and refreshed. I have recommended this to my girls and anyone I see. It works without your skin feeling greasy. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
"My skin has been very dried out due to the extreme cold we have had this winter, and so I was happy to receive Neutrogena® Hydro Boost Water Gel for free to review. My skin feels much smoother and is definitely more hydrated. It was flaking and patchy and now it has a nice glow to it. I love this product and will definitely buy it in the future."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. My skin is somewhat dry and the Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel hydrated my skin and made it very soft. It went on smooth and was not sticky. My skin looks brighter and has a nice glow. I would recommend to anyone looking for a product for dry skin."
"I received a free product to try and I absolutely fell in love with it after my first use! The Hydro-gel goes on smooth and creamy moisturizing your skin, brightening dull skin, and making your skin feel smooth and soft. I absolutely would recommend this product."
I got some of the Neutrogena HydroBoost from Crowdtap to try and I absolutely love it!! I've had really dry skin lately due to the wind and winter. Using this new HydroBoost makes my skin extra soft and feel so hydrated. I've even been using it on the backs of my hands and it's making them even look younger! Absolutely love it and would definitely recommend!!
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I thought that this product absorbed well and it wasn't tacky or sticky. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. It's great for dry flaky winter skin and smells very nice. It has a pleasant floral fragrance. I used it on my neck,face and hands. This product is more like a serum then a cream since it's water based. A little is all you need to make your skin feel soft and smooth."
"I LOVED the neutrogena hydro boost water gel. It really made a difference in how soft and moisturized my skin felt. Winter makes every inch of my skin super dry, and this was the perfect amount of moisture to revive my dry flaky skin. It was lightly scented, not heavy, or sticky and just perfect. I LOVED it. I received my sample free, but the review is 100% my own."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review after using the first time I was amazed how fast it absorbed into skin leaving a cool feeling to skin ,soft,non greasy,and a feel of skin renewed amazing.so happy with results and hooked love it. will recommend for sure."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.” Overall I would recommend this product to my friends and family. I received it as a free gift to try so I am not sure the overall cost. Using the product it was cold like most creams are, but it was light and it seemed to work well without leaving an oily residue on my skin. After a few applications my skin seemed to glow and become clearer."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.” #HydroBoost is an AMAZING product, I am 47 and my mom is 67 years old, our skin is so soft, unlike anything we have ever tried. My mom always stops using a product because she doesn't see a difference, she faithfully puts this on everyday. Our aging skin looks healthier, and feels hydrated, I am so thankful to get to try this product for free to try and review, LOVE IT."
"I have very dry skin and I really liked how hydrating this was! It absorbed quickly but lasted all day! My skin is definitely in better condition now that I've added this to my routine. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review"
"I love the new hydro boost water gel! I have such dry skin, and this refreshes my skin filling it full of hydration. If you have dry or uneven skin tone, then this is a great product to use. I usually have to put on a moisturize 2 to sometimes 3 times a day to get it not to peel or flake. With this however, I only have to use it once a day. I would highly recommend this product if your skin is in need for hydration."
"I've been using this product for a week and usually I have some dry patches, but since using this my skin is so soft and looks hydrated. I also really like the smell of this and it doesn't make my skin look oily at all so I can wear it day and night! #gotitfree"
I bought this about a month ago and I love the way it makes my skin feel.
thought this product would make my skin feel moisturized makes it fell dry instead
"Burned my face, left it dry and flaky, disappointed."
"Would have rated this product as ""5 Star"" if it had included an SPF 15 (or higher) sunscreen."
Love this product for my skin I sooooo wish it was spf 30
I have tried just about everything on the market and this is by far the BEST product ever
i love this product its the best and my skin is hydrated
Absolutely love this product. Keeps my skin looking/feeling amazing!!!!
"Impressed! Just started using it, and I love it. 10/10."
"I have just started using the product, it feels good and soothing"
So far so good. It really feels very hydrating and good on your skin.
"Did not provide nearly enough moisture, and I don't have dry skin."
"I just started using this Hydro Series, and so far Loving it!!"
I have been using this product for approximately 3 weeks and my normally dry skin is now even dryer and turning flaky. I am extremely disappointed
Wow! Used it for the first time last night. My skin feels so soft this morning. Only one day use and I'm very pleased with this product.
I absolutely love this cream. I've tried a lot of products on my dry skin and none have worked until now. Highly recommend this product.
I got this because I was dealing with dry skin and this fixed it after 3 days!!! I love this product.
"I bought this a few months ago and I use it everyday.. I'm impressed how fast my skin changed, it's amazing!"
"Excellent product, best moisturizer for oily - dry combination, my only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger jar ! I always need more ! Can you please make a supersize jar so I can use it morning and for night? Love , love love this product!"
"receive my #HydroBoostWaterGel 2 weeks ago and I am totally in love with it! Before my skin was a little dry, but after 2 weeks apply it! , It feel so hydrated thank you so much for this great gift! #gotitfree"
By far one of the best moisturizers I've tried in a long time. It's very cooling and refreshing and keeps my skin moisturized and smooth all day and night. I will definitely recommend!
"cooling, feels refreshing, smooths and hydrates. Good value. Wish it could get rid of my wrinkles but I do feel it helps. If I had only stayed out of the sun!"
I've been using this for over a month now and the difference in my skin is wonderful. It is so soft and all of the dryness from a very cold winter is gone. Lots of moisturizers have made me break out in the past but this has not at all.
"This is not what I had hoped for. After using for one week, i was left with dry patchy skin and multiple blackheads! I needed a light weight moisturizer that didn't clog pores. I'm so disappointed."
"I started off with samples, and I took them everywhere with me. The refreshing feeling you get when you put just a little amount goes a long way. I had to upgrade to the actual product. My favorite facial product by far!"
"I've been using this product after my morning cleanse and I have noticed that my face does not produce oil all day! I've never had any luck with moisturizers until now. I have combo, sensitive skin so this product has been life changing for me."
"Light, non greasy feeling product that seemed to improve the overall look and feel of my skin with just a couple days use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face has been feeling very dry so I switched to the new Hydro Boost. One week later and my skins is soft, and feels plumped with moisture. No longer feeling shriveled!"
I absolutely love this product! My skin tends to get very dry especially during the winter. I moisturize my skin with neutrogena boost water gel before I apply my make up and it leaves my skin silky smooth for the rest of the day.
I received this product for free from Influenster to review and try out. I love the way the gel smells and feels on my face. I have been using this product for weeks and would definitely recommend this to friends and family.
"Hydro boost water gel is amazing! Fast absorbing, lovely smell, since it's a gel there's no oily or stickyness! Leaves my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated and amazing."
"I love using this water gel from Neutrogena. This feels very light on my skin, and goes on smooth and nicely. This lotion is not expensive and works great."
"I got the product for free from Influenster and was excited to try out a product. The gel goes on easy and adsorbs quickly. After a few minutes, my skin felt smooth. Has a great smell - not overly powerful."
"Before this product my skin was very dry, and now using Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel my skin feel so soft and hydrated, and the product smells great!"
"This is one of the first times I have ever used a gel on my face instead of lotion, and I was really skeptical at first, but it was so awesome! It went on smoothly under my makeup (a huge bonus) and moisturized my face the entire day!"
"This is the one product I have found that gives my very dry skin some much needed hydration, while not causing my sensitive skin to break out! Love, love, love this product!!"
"I switched from Neutrogena Deep Moisture Cream to this and my face has gone backwards and is irritated, broken out, sore. It's worse than it's been in years. I gave it time to adjust to this but can't use it anymore because it's only getting worse with time."
"I have only used this product 1 time and my face was on fire, red and itched. I have used the Hydro Boost Gel prior to using the one with sunscreen since I have extremly dry skin and that works wonders. I thought I would try this since it had sunscreen in it and I can say that I will not use again because the pain it caused was worse than sunburn without using sunscreen."
"I purchased because of some of the great reviews. I was hoping this would work for me. I don't have very sensitive skin but this stuff made me break out on my forehead, temples, around mouth and nose. My cheeks were the only thing that could handle it, lol. So, I will not be buying this one again, especially for that price. A waste of money."
"This product was awesome! My dullness went away. My skin is more hydrated than it has been in a long time and is soft to the touch. I've been using this for 2 months now and has not come even close to breaking out my sensitive skin. It is amazing, it absorbs quickly and smells great. I love it!"
I love that hylunronic acid is being added into more drugstore products! This moisturizer is light but does it's job very well. The scent is very fresh and not too overpowering. Great for normal to oily skin! If yo have a dry skin type I'd recommend something stronger and thicker. I was lucky to test this product for free so my opinions are my own!
"I've been using Hydro Boost Water Gel for 2 weeks along with Fresh Foaming Cleanser. My skin feels 10x more moisturized and smooth. This has been extremely beneficial given the harsh winter the Northeast has been experiencing, leading to dry skin. I'll continue to use this product as part of my daily routine and recommend it to anyone experiencing dry or fat looking skin. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free through Influenster, but all opinions are my own."
"I'm in the Neutrogena Crowd on CrowdTap and I got to try this product for free. I didn't expect this product to be as good as it was. Overall it's great, my entire face feels hydrated all day long! My favorite part was the scent, it smells amazing! Best smelling face product I've ever used! Highly recommend this stuff!"
"Neutrogena Hydro Boost is a game changer for my dry winter skin. The lightweight formula seems to lock in moisture without over-moisturizing; in fact, it seems to disappear into my skin, leaving it plump, supple and younger-looking. The light scent is refreshing, and the texture is smooth for easy application. How can an oil-free formula be so moisturizing? It's a skincare miracle!"
Just bought this recently as a friend recommend it to me. Water gel sounded like a great way to hydrate my face. Even tho I think it's working in that way I don't like the burning feeling and redness it gives me after I put it on. I'm thinking it might be the fragrance because I usually don't use very perfumed things on my face. I also didn't like how it didn't have a seal when I bought it therefore it makes it easy for people to possibly dip in it before I buy it. I really wanted to love it!
I have been using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel for a couple of weeks. I like the way my skin looks and feels. It absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn't have an overpowering smell. I try to only use lightly or unscented products that I wear to bed since my husband is scent sensitive.
"I had already tried other products from Neutrogena's Hydro Boost line and was impressed, so I was excited to trial the Water Gel with Sunscreen. Overall I liked this product. I really liked the texture of the gel and felt that it absorbed nicely into my skin. I would have liked the SPF to be higher (SPF 30 would be ideal), but I do appreciate the fact that this product does provide some broad spectrum protection.

"I do not like the way it smells. Also, I have combination skin, however, I found this product dried my skin out below my nose as well as I had a few pimple appear on my forehead and nose. I do not typically have any issues with acne and found this product to aggravate my skin. I currently use oil of Olay and will continue with that product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer goes on easy leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft with no greasy feeling. I love that it has SPF because I'm lazy and don't want to apply that separately. I have sensitive skin, I've been using this for about 2 weeks now, I use it on my face, neck and eyes and haven't had any adverse reactions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this lightweight gel. It was easy to apply and did not leave a greasy feeling on my fingers. My skin feels smooth and doesn't have an oily sheen. Overall I enjoyed the soft feeling, however I prefer a higher SPF in my products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"smooth, flawless finish. This really helped even out the rough dry patches around my nose. It didn't take but a couple of drops for all day moisturizer. Having the SPF is an added bonus. I don't have to worry about putting on sunscreen on top of my face cream or make-up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with Neutrogena®Hydro Boost Water Gel! It goes on so nicely and soaks into my skin without feeling greasy or heavy. It makes my face feel fresh and clean too. My skin feels smoother and looks younger, and I've only been using it a short amount of time. I love that it has sunscreen too; it's awesome to get the benefits of sunscreen while improving my skin. Overall, I give this product a big thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product was very good at moisturizing my face. Whenever the seasons change I have very dry skin and this will help tremendously with that issue. It does not leave a heavy feeling the skin and smells amazing . Helped so much with keeping my skin soft and hydrated. I [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did not find the sunscreen to be moisturizing enough for my skin. The gel was light in texture, but I did not feel it completely absorbed into my skin. My skin still felt a bit dry and tight underneath the top layer of skin where I applied the gel. My skin became oily about two hours later. The product just did not feel comfortable on my skin. I would not recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Neutrogena®Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 is not greasy. It's lightweight and absorbs easily into the skin. It is a water based gel that doesn't leave any oily streaks and doesn't irrtiate the skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Anybody who has oily skin has a difficult time in summer, it's an internal conflict; do I wear sun protection or do I appear like an oil slick. This Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF, is the answer. It's a nice thin gel that absorbs into the skin easily without that white residue that inevitably increases oil production. I was happy to find that this had no effect on my natural oil production while providing sun protection that is needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 and thought it was ok. The packaging is weird. It is a pump and squeeze bottle. It makes it awkward to get out the Gel. It felt nice going on my skin, but it doesn't have as much thickness as my regular lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for a week and was overall impressed! It has a light texture and goes on well. It's fairly moisturizing, which is nice because I live in a dry climate. The scent is light and I thought, smelled nice. I didn't break out, since it's a gel and that added to the lightness of the product. It didn't feel heavy on my skin, but it felt good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this is a really nice moisturizer that also contains a broad spectrum spf. it goes on easily and is not at all greasy. it is very gentle on the skin causing no irritation. hydro boost replenishes the skin with a gel moisturizer. it is not heavy at all and does not clog your pores. i love the way it feels on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"the texture was different than expected but felt nice. When it went on my skin, didn't feel sticky or tacky at all, which I expected. When rubbing it onto my skin, I didn't need to use a lot, it went a long way and felt like it absorbed into my skin just fine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the way the product went on as it didn't leave any white or flaky residue after being worked into the skin. It went on evenly and wasn't sticky feeling at all. It's a lighter feeling product then I thought it would feel on my skin and I liked that my skin could still breathe with it on plus the fact that it is protecting my skin from the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this cream! Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF is exactly what I have been looking for! A lightweight moisturizer with sunscreen that goes on well under my makeup, isn't greasy, and doesn't smell like sunscreen! It gives me just the right amount of sun protection, and I just love the way it feels on my skin! I have loved all of the other products in this line, and this one is just as great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product, overall, worked well. The Hydro Boost Water Gel applied easily, and thankfully, did not leave behind a whitish cast on my face. The only problem which I had with this product was oiliness. Sometimes, the product caused a little oiliness, although, not too much that would deter me from continued use.

The Neutrogena®Hydro Boost Water Gel with SPF 15 is so light weight and blends into you skin leaving it so smooth and hydrated all day. Love that it has SPF 15 which I need especially in Florida summer days and the blue tint and smell remind me of the beach. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel because it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. My skin stays hydrated throughout the day and, as a result, looks so much healthier and refreshed. It absorbs quickly into skin, so there is no leftover residue. It has a nice, refreshing scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I often forget to apply sunscreen before leaving the house so having a moisturizer with SPF is something I love using. I liked this Neutrogena Gel as it kept my skin feeling hydrated for a long time without causing any breakouts or making it sticky. The only thing I wished was that the SPF would have been at least 30.
I received a sample product for free to facilitate my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like that the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 keeps moisture in my skin with the added benefit of sunscreen. I like to use it at the beach and for everyday. I would try this product again in the future, especially during the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a sunscreen it worked great. It did its job of protecting my skin from the sun well. Unfortunately it made me face break out. I have sensitive skin and probably shouldn't have attempted to use it on my face. However my teenage kids used it with no problems [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so impressed with this face moisturizer! It's a lightweight, super hydrating sunscreen?? Yes please! Any time I want to apply a facial moisturizer, it's usually filmy, heavy and greasy, but not this one! I'm totally sold on this stuff! It feels like a typical gel moisturizer but with the added bonus of sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just tried Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 and I just love it!,I liked that it was light on my skin and it left my skin hydrated and protected, this is just great for dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this gel! It was easy to apply and not greasy. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Not having to add an additional product for sunscreen makes my morning routine so much easier. I recommend this to anyone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This water is gel is so light and fresh. It smells very clean like soap. I love the way it smells. It goes on nicely and absorbs into my skin quickly and doesn't leave it sticky or tacky feeling. My skin does feel very moisturized and hydrated and fresh. I love that it has SPF included. It does not smell like sunscreen or leave a white haze either. Great product!! I will get more for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found that this sunscreen had a very light, pleasant scent, and works well under foundation. My skin felt soft and dewy whip using it. The ONLY reason I personally wouldn't buy more to use is that I prefer a higher spf than 15 on my fair skin. For those who find an spf 15 to be high enough,I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Enough hydration for the skin. In the summer light and moist. Just the right about of moisture but not greasy or heavy. I hope the SPF could be a bit higher, like 30 or 40 so it provides more sun protection. The hyaluronic acid will also be great at anti aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall I was not very happy with the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel with Sunscreen. After two days of use I started to get very dry areas on my face. That is the main reason I was not happy with the product. The smell of the product is pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is a nice product. It goes on without the greasiness of a typical facial moisturizer, and the sun protection is an added bonus. It is certainly not meant for dry skin, as it is a light moisturizer. I really like the gel for summertime, but it may not be able to do the job for the dry winter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as part of influenster but all opinions are my own. I'd been wanting to try this moisturizer since I saw an ad for it in a magazine. The moisturizer is uber-hydrating without being greasy. Heads up though it did make my skin burn the first few times but I didn't notice it after those initial uses.
I received Hydro Boost Water Gel free from Influenster to try and review on my own. I was happy to get this and try it. I have very dry skin and with this cold winter I needed something. and this worked great. I apply it every night before bed and wake up with smooth healthy skin. Its so light on your skin and has a nice clean smell
"I received this product complimentary to test and I was a little skeptical at first. However, after using it, I love how it moisturizes my skin without making it feel greasy. My skin can go from dry to oily in one day, but this product has not made me break out like some others have. Definitely try it yourself if you can be super dry one day then breaking out from your moisturizer the next. Neutrogena products are definitely the best for my skin!"
"My skin is so dry and VERY sensitive that I am always so nervous to try a new product, especially on my face. But, I am so glad I risked it! I love this moisturizer. I've used it for about four weeks now. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized without feeling oily or heavy. As I mentioned my skin is so sensitive I have a hard time using any kind of face lotion. But, this one I am definitely going to keep using! Disclaimer: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."
"I've been using this moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and I'm seeing and feeling a difference. I've got combination skin, oily forehead and dry cheeks. I use the gel daily and I feel like my cheeks don't look and feel quite as dry as before. The smell can be a little overwhelming if you're sensitive to fragrances. Disclaimer: I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I've always had dry skin, and I've tried countless products to hydrate and moisturize my skin. This product is on par with the only other product I've found that keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long. The other plus is that this product is much cheaper than my other favorite product! I will definitely purchase it in the future. I received his product complimentary for testing and review purposes."
I put this on my face after cleansing and exfoliating at night and woke up to reduced lines and bags around my eyes. The best my eyes have looked in a long time! My face felt more hydrated and looked great! I put it on under my day cream and makeup in the morning and it is amazing! Highly recommend it !
"I am in love with this product! No more dry itchy skin! This product makes my face glow and feel so soft. Instantly after washing my face and applying this cream , my face feels relaxed and at ease, not tense and irritated. I love how you only have to apply a little not much and you can feel the tingle and how it just makes my face feel amazing. I received this product for free , for testing purposes"
"I was born with a skin disease that makes it very dry & flaky. I had been paying twice the amount of money for a product that I found on the internet, until I found this one.

I also love the fact that it doesn't leave my face shiny ! Great product & the price is right !"

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I am glad I did! My skin is extremely dry, especially during harsh winter months. Using Hydro Boost has decreased the amount of large dry flakes I typically have. I love the lightweight gel texture and that it doesn't leave any type of residue. It has a wonderful refreshing spa smell, but isn't powerful. Also, since it is a gel, less is more! It isn't heavy and is absorbed quickly into the skin leaving it feeling very refreshed!"
"In the winter months, I am always looking for a lightweight face cream to use daily under my foundation! Neutrogena Water gel left my face feels rejuvenated and soft without causing my foundation to cake on! Wonderful product! I was excited to get the chance to try this product through Influenster!"
"I've been a regular user of Moisture Surge for several months. The Neutrogena water gel is a great dupe for it. It is light, absorbs fast and doesn't make you look greasy. Love the pleasant scent too. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I seem to have a problem with moisturizing creams pilling up when I put on my foundation. I bought this last week to give it a try. First of all, it had made my face and my neck feel wonderfully soft. The product absorbs and no more problem with my foundation. I wish you would make this for full body use"
"I've been wearing my Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for a week now and I love it. The gel holds up to 1000x its weight in water so your skin feels replenished which is a nice feeling for this wild winter we are having! It's an easy application and absorbs quickly without leaving behind an oily or greasy feel. This is a new part of my routine and one of my new favorite products! #BehindTheGlow Thanks for sending, Influenster."

I applied it after showering and it left my skin feeling nourished and well hyrdrated for hours. I definitely recommend it. Although I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, all opinions are completely my own."
Hydro boost makes the skin feel smooth and soft. Hydrates without making the face feel oily. Love that the skin doesn't feel greasy or filmy. I was lucky to get to test this product for free from neutrogena and influenster but have already pursched more products in hydro line!
"I have been using this product night and day and it has transformed my dreadful winter skin. I am typically oily in the T Zone and dry in others. My dry, flaky skin has now been transformed into smooth softness. I also love that this product does not leave my face greasy after application, it is soft and cool. I received this for free as a promotional testing item but I will 100% be purchasing this for future use once this jar is gone. I am VERY pleased with the quality. I would highly recommend the Hydro Boost Water Gel!"
"I was sent Neutrogens Hydro Boost Water Gel for testing purposes and I am head over heels for it. I have very dry skin, especially in the winter. Most products don't work for me and I have to moisturize multiple times a day. I started using this product about a week ago and I am hooked. My skin is glowing, hydrated, and soft. I only need to apply once and the moisture lasts all day. I also love how it absorbs quickly and has s fresh scent. If you're looking for a great moisturizer, look no further!"
"This product is very effective and provides smooth, silky hydration that isn't greasy and this doesn't irritate my skin. I can't wait to see the long term how great its going to make my skin. being in florida my skin is so dry but this is a total refreshing glass of water for your face! I'm a member of the influenster and they sent my my neutrogena vox box and sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review."
"This stuff is just, WOW! I was a little scared at first thinking it wasn't going to be very moisturizing...but I have been pleasantly surprised! The texture is wonderful and when you rub it into your skin you are left with a soft/supple feel! I wasn't oily/greasy or sticky! It also has a pleasant smell (which is sometimes an issue with products). I can say I have always been a fan of Neutrogena, and this is just anotehr thumbs up on my list!!"
"The lightweight,fluffy texture sinks in to your skin locking in moisture without any greasy residue. My skin was softer,fine lines plumped and brighter within 7 days. I've also used HydroBoost on the back of my hands. The difference is dramatic! Fine lines and dryness have almost been eradicated. Having HydroBoost underneath my makeup each day is my new secret beauty weapon!"
"New Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is a new refreshing light weight water gel that instantly quenches and continuously hydrates skin and is formulated with hyaluronic acid that delivers vital hydration which is the source for glowing skin so it will leave your skin hydrated, smooth and supple with a healthy looking glow."
"I love Neutrogena. It is one of my favorite drugstore brands. If you have dry skin or a mixture of dry and oily skin this water gel works like magic. I absolutely love the results. The gel absorbs pretty quickly into my skin. You can feel the hydratation effect on your skin throughout the day. I feel my skin moisturized, smooth and radiant."

It foesnt smell like chemicals are everywhere. Its quite refreshing. Leaves your skin smooth and wanting more! A definite must have face wash!!"
"I'm in the middle of my first winter back east and this has proven to be a lifesaver. It smells great, goes on like a gel, and deeply moisturizes my dry face. My skin is adjusting from mild Southern California winters to bitter cold and my overly heated office, so this has really revolutionized my face. I've used it for a week now, and can really tell a difference in the way my face looks and feels. *all opinions are my own--I was able to test Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but will 100% be adding this to my normal routine."

Some friends were able to try samples of the product and they all had positive experiences too!"

I love this product & recommend it to anyone looking to hydrate your skin. It has a cool touch to the skin & my face feels so moist & overall healthy. Other products are too greasy or leave my skin dry. This gel is very light & has a beautiful smell. My skin gets so dull & dry so this gel gives my skin just the perfect amount of moisture.
"For many people with combination skin we have to search for something that works all over.. well i believe that i have found what i was looking for..

I have combination skin so finding a moisturizer that solves both dry & oily skin problems is challenging . This gel was perfect because it helped my dry areas and left a fresh oil -free feeling on my skin. It absorbs easily and is perfect for wearing under sunscreen and makeup. Even though it's a gel I didn't experience drying or tightness. (I received this product complimentary of Crowdtap for the purpose of reviewing. All opinions are my own)
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.” I'm pretty picky about my skincare but I absolutely love using Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel! It instantly quenches dry skin- which is great for winter months. The unique formula dissolved into my skin quicker then similar products. I also love the fact it's oil free. I will be buying this product again."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I have been using this for the past week and I just love it!

Once it was on I didn't feel like anything was caked on my face. I absolutely love this product and look forward to using it long term."
"This is am excellent product. I have never had what you would call good skin. Since using this Hydro Boost water gel my skin looks better and feels better. My acne seems to be better and also my facial pores. It has not irritated my skin at all. I have to be careful using certain products because they tend to break me out and make my skin worse.

"I wasn't sure what to expect, but i've always had good results with Neutrogena. I applied this as per the instructions, and I was left with some pretty good results. My skin was mega-moisturized, and I didn't break out (which is always a fear when trying new skincare products). The fragrance was so/so, I wasn't crazy about it, but it wasn't awful, either. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena rewards program, and Neutrogena sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review."
"Immediate relief for tight,dry skin. It smells fantastic. It dried right into my skin quickly. I tend to rub it all over my face and did not irritate my eyes. It's very lightweight and not oily at all. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I've been using this for about a week now and I notice my skin's feeling a little softer and less dry. Not a huge difference, but how much can you really expect in only a week? Goes on easily, a little goes a long way! I didn't notice any smell. It's not greasy/oily; you can barely even tell it's there. Dries quickly. Recommended."
"I really really like this gel and use it once or twice each day. It definitely looks interesting being light blue, immediately reminds me of water. The smell is fresh and light, again it reminds me of water and the ocean. The gel is very easy to apply and moisturizes my skin well for hours! You can even use it right before you apply your make up. ""I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"

"I love how lightweight but moisturizing this Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel is. Its goes on smooth and absorbs into my skin very well. It left my skin feeling very moisturized and soft. I would definitely recommend it to others especially if you don't like thick and heavy moisturizers.

"I received this to try out from Crowdtap and I am so happy they sent it to me. I live in the desert and my skin dries out so quickly, especially in the cold and wind.

I use this stuff more then once a day it leaves my skin so hydrated. I have combination skin and this works amazing for all skin types. I love that it smells good and refreshing. At first I thought oh man this might be sticky but its not at all. Its made my skin look a lot more refreshed and soft. I love it and when I run out will be purchasing more!!
"I was a little skeptical to use the Hydro Boost Water Gel when I first received it. Sometimes I can break out from new products but I did not with this.

I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review."
"I use this not only on my face, but all over! I love it! It's an instant cooling sensation followed by a tightening and firming feeling. I've used it for a few days now and already notice a huge difference. My skin isn't as dry and flakey as it usually is thanks to Hyrdoboost! I've been searching for the right product, and thanks to Crowdtap and Neutrogena I have found that. I got this free to try from Crowdtap, and I'm in love! Defintely will be buying more! My husband even likes it!"

"Usually this kid of product doesn't smell very good, I am glad to see this one has a pleasant scent and it makes my skin feel so soft. I am glad I got to try this product.

"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I've only had it for about a week so my testing period isn't very long, but I've been enjoying using it. It doesn't feel greasy (can't stand that on my face) and smells good! I will be happy to purchase more of this when I'm out!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I tried this gel for about a week. The first thing that I noticed when first applying the gel was how light the gel was. A lot of other facial moisturizermoisturizers feel so heavy on your skin, not this one. The product really does make your face look hydrated and refreshed."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. It was great to be able to try out this product because I could see it being something I might want to incorporate into my routine. I love that you immediately feel the effects after putting it on — my skin felt soft and smooth. There is a very light scent, which might not be for all."
"This gel is so lightweight and instantly absorbs into my skin. I was amazed at how well my skin stayed hydrated. I have super dry skin this time of year, and I expected to have to use this along with a heavier moisturizer. But no need for that, it works great on its own. I like the light scent of the product also. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. This gel immediately gave me a pleasant cooling effect.

It reminded me a lot of a department store brand I used to use, but this stuff is a third of the price!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review....I love this stuff. A lot of time a product will say non oily only to leave my skin feel just that. Not with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water gel! It leaves my fave feeling soft And healthy! I recommend thia 100%!"
"I definitely wasn't expecting this gel to be as amazing as it is. I used it immediately after my bath as I do regular face cream, instead using the Hydroboost water gel. I was suprised at how little I needed to use. A little goes a long way. In the morning when I woke up, my skin still felt super moist, and hydrated. I had to tell my hubby to feel my face. I'm seeing less red spots, and no dry skin at all. I'm absolutely blown away at the results I'm having with this product. And for the price it's at, it definitely blows away high end brands."
"I have been battling dry peeling skin this past few months and nothing helped. I was sent this to review and I am absolutely amazed.

"I really, really like this product! I always moisturize after my shower at night, and normally in the morning when I wake up my face feels kind of tight and dry, but with Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Water Gel I didn't get that feeling! My face still felt moisturized and nice, and I didn't break out if I used it every night! Loving this moisturizer! “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of it's Hydro Boost Water Gel to review """

The scent is subtle and not overpowering. After only a few days of using the product, I could tell that it keeps its promise: nicely hydrated skin. I also love how quickly it gets absorbed by my skin, works great under make up too."
"This product is very effective and provides smooth, silky hydration that isn't greasy. For extremely cold winter months, I still use some thicker creams in my ""trouble"" dry spots, but I think that this would be enough on it's own during warmer months. I have very sensitive skin and eczema, and this doesn't irritate my skin.

"I love it!! I have dry skin and the moisturizer makes my skin feel amazing!

I love the product but NEUTROGENA please take away the fragrance!!!!
I was recommended to try this ans i obsoletely love this product
Love this stuff. Goes on clear. Hydrates my skin. I only wish it was SPF 30+.
I have been using the Hydro Boost Water Gel on a nearly daily basis and my skin feels soft and hydrated!
This is a really great product for people with normal to dry skin. I have oily so I felt as though it made my skin even more oily.
"SPF, hygienic container, keeps my skin moisturized, what's not to love?! PLEASE never discontinue!!!!"
"This moisturizer is amazing! It does things for my skin that even very expensive creams haven't been able to do. Plus, it smells so good!!"
"I don't understand how my skin is MORE dry and flaky after using this! Tried it in winter to not over compensate for lack in moisture, outcome still dry. Tried in summer because my skin is typically more oily, outcome STILL DRY!"
"I love this moisturizer! It smells great, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin hydrated and refreshed. I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but all opinions are your own."

"I am very picky with my facial products and I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I received the product for free to try, so I was skeptical but I ended up loving it and will be adding it to my skincare routine. (all opinions are my own)"
"Ive been using this product for about 3 months and it definitely helped with my dry skin, but after a while it started to burn my face when I put it on. Not sure why all of a sudden this happened, but its not working out anymore."
My husband and I are loving this!! Perfect for our oily combo skin and doesn't leave our face feeling greasy. Really light with silky finish. Wish I would've found this product sooner.

I love this line but am unable to use because fragrance breaks me out.Please make a fragrance free option for those of us that cant or dont want to use fragrance.
"I love this moisturizer. I received it through Allure to try out. It goes on wet, but sinks into the skin so that your skin does not feel oily. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I've noticed my dry patches are starting to go away."
I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I am so glad I did! My skin feels soft and smooth. It's very refreshing when you apply it and it doesn't make you feel like you have cream on your face.
"I absolutely love this product. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, and so soft. The product has a fresh scent to it, and I love it! I highly recommend this to anyone considering it!"
This product has really helped improve my dry winter skin. I love using it after I cleanse my skin with my Clarisonic. It also smells wonderful! I was able to test this product for free. All opinions are my own.
I have been using this product this Winter and it was so good at moisturizing my skin. Even better is the smell. My husband thought I put on perfume even though it was just the Neutrogena Hydro Boost that he was smelling.
I live in Miami so traditional cream moisturizers always feel a little thick. This gel consistency was perfect for warm days while still making my skin feel quenched. I used it twice a day for two weeks and have to say I'm hooked.
The gel is lightweight and absorbs so quickly leaving my skin soft and supple. I'm so in love with this product. The quality of the gel is very similar to HYDRA BEAUTY GEL CRÈME by Chanel. Love. Love.Love
"I received this product to review from influenster and I couldn't be happier with it! After washing my face, I apply this gel to my entire face. It is so light and smooth and I just love it!!"

"I received this product for free for testing, and I love it. It has a great scent and goes on smoothly. I love how my skin feels after using. I definitely recommend."
"My winter dry skin absorbs this almost immediately, I love it! I use it as a night cream on its own, and with a serum during the day. I love how soft it makes my skin feel. (I received a free sample thanks to The Vogue Influencer Network)."
I have searched so long for a moisturizer that actually balances my skin and this is it! I received it in the influenster voxbox and I am so happy I did! Thank you so much for this product!
"I love it! It makes my skin feel smooth and cool and lasts all day. It even smells like cucumber. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
I have been using the product for about a week and I love the way my skin seems more hydrated. I tend to get dry skin during the harsh winter months and this is a refreshing way to keep my skin soft and supple.
this product is my holy grail to my skin now I just love how my skin feels after applying this to my face I can totally feel the hydration on my face which I love.
this lotion is amazing. and gives my skin the perfect boost. i was very pleasantly surprised how well this feels and smells. long lasting as well. crowdtap let me sample this amazing product.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I loved it! it made my skin really soft and smooth."
I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I can see the difference in my skin. My skin feels soft and well hydrated even during this cold winter. I recommended this product to anyone that suffer from dry skin
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena rewards program, and Neutrogena sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. This product moisturized my skin and gave it a very nice glow. It was not greasy and made my skin feel so smooth"
"I have been searching for a long time for a suitable moisturizer to wear at night. After the very first application, I was sold. I'm very excited for finding the perfect nighttime routine that includes this moisturizer!"
I really need a high level moisturizer with my skin but am concerned with it being too greasy. This hit right on the spot for me. It was super intense but no greasy sheen or icky feeling. LOVE
"I am in love with this new neutrogena face cream! I like the cooling texture and the instant absorption, no greasiness or oiliness. Also my skin feels very smooth after the application, great base under makeup!"
"Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel is non greasy and does not leave your face sticky, this water based gel blends smoothly into your skin leaving it feeling refreshed and moisturized. My skin is quenched and glowing."
I loved Neutrogena Hydroboost Water Gel! It made my face stay moisturized all day. My face did not look oily like some products do to me. I use this before putting on my makeup and it made my face look awake and refreshed.
"I received this sample from Crowdtap for free, for my honest feedback. Awesome Product, the way it made my skin feel was great. Soft skin and smelled great who can beat that."
"This product is great to use day and night, or after washing your face. It immediately made my skin softer. I kind of wish there was less scent, but it didn't seem to bother my sensitive skin."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I absolutely how it hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling smooth. I love it."
I got the Hydro Boost Water Gel through crowdtap for free to try out. I have enjoyed using this product a lot and would recommend it to friends and family. I have used this product both morning and at night.
I received this product to try from #Crowdtap and #Neutrogena. It left a great feeling on my skin the first day! Not a greasy or wet feeling. Well worth buying and trying for yourself. I will be purchasing another jar for myself.
Neutrogena facial water is a very good product to have on hand. It relieves your face of the every day dirtiness. You find yourself with a smooth face every day. I highly recommend this product.
This product is amazing I've only been using it a week and I can already see and feel a difference. My skin just drinks up the product and feels super refreshed after.
"I usually use oils on my face since my skin is so dry. The Neutrogena Hydro Boost was a lighter alternative, but still left my skin hydrated. It made a great base for my makeup."
"I have VERY DRY SKIN and Hydro Boost Water Gel added much needed moisture, absorbed quickly, went on smoothly, and smells HEAVENLY!! I definitely recommend this stuff! I'm in the Neutrogena Crowd on CrowdTap and received a sample product for free."
I thought the texture of this moisturizer was really innovative and left my skin feeling hydrated without being sticky however I found myself only applying at night because it was missing sun protection as it has no SPF. Would prefer to wear this during the day because it feels so nice but its no the product for me because it doesn't meet my basic sun protection requirement.
"What I found most unique is the texture! It doesn't have that lotion-y feel to it and instead felt so clean as it just melted into my skin. I used it everyday all over until I ran out! I tested Neutrogena Hydro Boost water gel for free, but my opinions are my own."
Ive been using this product for about a month now. If your over 55 and your skin is dry it does not work. It is not moisturizing. At first when you put it on it feels cool and good then it drift and all the moisturizing is gone so your cover up looks dry.
"I baught this product after so much review. I got pack of two as I was too much excited to use this product due to my dry Skin. I applied after cleansing my skin , and its start burning . I was too much sad as I baught 2 packs. I'm 28yr old and my skin is dry. And I m really sad. Tell me about my dry skin as I really want my skin hydrated and smooth."
"I heard wonderful news about this product and gave it a try. My skin is sensitive and I should have noticed the jar did not read for sensitive skin. In my head.. it's got to be good, it's Neutrogena. I have used this product for over 4 weeks and now my under eyes have turned red, swollen and burning. I'm assuming since the gel is scented it caused my skin to have a reaction. Please make a sensitive formula for us girls who break out."
"My biggest pet peeve with heavy moisturizers is just that, that they feel heavy. I hate the feeling of having something on my face that feels obvious that it's there, whether because it feels greasy or heavy on your skin, but this feels like you've got nothing on at all while really doing what it promises!"
"I love this new moisturizer. Love the blue color. But I hate that it comes in a jar. The jar is beautiful in design--very appealing, reminds me of water. But it is just not sanitary to dip your fingertips into a jar. I transferred it to a squeeze tube right away. But that is not easy and I'm not sure that I want to have to do that every time. Please change the packaging!"
I've been using it on my skin after my regular skin care routine and my skin so incredibly soft after using it. I have also been applying it to my son's face and arms. He has keratosis pilaris and it leaves his skin extremely dry. Since using this water gel his skin has become softer. He loves to put it on after his bath. It smells light and soft and the texture is the best consistency. I love that a little bit goes a long way. I got to try a jar of this Hydro Boost Water Gel for free from Influnester for testing purposes.
"First off I had never tried neutrogena hydroboost water boost until I received it in the mail. The product is absolutely amazing in leaving my skin moisturized and feeling light. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
"This product is great. I am always skeptical of facial products because they always leave your face feeling wet, or slimy. When I opened the product I first noticed how great it smelled and how light it felt on my fingers. I rubbed in into my skin and almost immediately noticed that it left no unpleasant residue. My skin feels amazing. Would reccommend this product. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review.”"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. I love using this moisturizer after washing my face in the morning or before bed. It goes on smooth, and isn't greasy or shiny at all. It also has a really nice, subtle scent to it. It prevents my face from feeling tight or looking flaky. Now that I see how much it retails for, I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it, but I do enjoy the product."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Neutrogena® rewards program, and Neutrogena® sent me a sample of its Hydro Boost Water Gel to review. This is not just another facial moisturizer....it's the one for me. I LOVE it. I love that it is a gel and not a lotion. It's very light and has an amazing scent. I love how it leaves my face so soft and it absorbs very quickly. This is one moisturizer that I will continue to purchase. It's wonderful."
Great product for wearing under makeup. This is better than the gel cream version for dry skin.
