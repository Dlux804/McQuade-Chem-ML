"I am a 53 yo grandmother of 12 who still likes to look younger than my age. As I have aged, my skin has become dryer and I am constantly looking for the right moisturizer that is not greasy or too thick or won't clog the pores but minimizes wrinkles and is lightweight and goes a long way. Well, I have at last found it! I love how soft my face is and I love the scent and wrinkles are minimized after using 4 days. #walmartcontest"
I have use Aveeno Positively Ageless for many years now. Then I trusted my baby's skin to Aveeno. Thats the kind of trust I have with this brand. Recently I received a sample of Aveeno Absolutly Ageless Moisturizers thanks to Walmart Beautybox and I was amazed. I did not thought Aveeno could out do them self. This moisturizer is very rich and gentle at the same time. I woke up with the most soft and glowing skin ever. #walmartcontest
"By far this is the best face lotion that I have used. I am 74 years of age, I started using the Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer about four months ago and have seen a marked improvement in the over all appearance of my skin. Less lines and color spots and an overall even of skin tone. Thank you Aveeno."
I was very excited to try the Aveeno moisturizer with the SPF 30. The product made my face feel very fresh and soft. (and safe from the sun rays as well)
"Finally found a moisturizer I love. It is wonderful, will ALWAYS have, thanks Walmart and Pharmapacks."
"My face is not sensitive to anything. I've used this and after 1 week got really bad results. Super itchy, red, burning, dry skin I had to stop. There is definitely something in the ingredients that's too harsh! I wish I read the reviews before buying. Very disappointed!!"
I have used Aveeno products for some time .......never had a problem. I was glad to see they have come out with a new moisturizer that has blackberry. A great product and was very satisfied with the results.
Love this new moisturizer. Really absorbed well into my skin. Love that it has spf 30 and wasn't to thick and heavy on the skin. Highly recommend this product.
"I just bought this and my skin has been steadily getting worse. The first use seemed ok, but after 4th use, I just stopped — redness, rash, and stinging. I was hoping to finally find a decent moisturizer that hydrated my skin, but I haven't."
"I have been using this for 3 weeks, but I have to quit. My skin is red, raw, itchy as heck and my eyes are so puffy I look like I am wearing balloons under my eye. You can definately have an allergic reaction to this"
I've used Aveeno products for a long time and never had any adverse reactions until this product. The Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer made my face break out in a bright red rash and my skin is inflamed. I will not be using this again and I would not recommend it to anyone. The fragrance is overwhelming and awful. Do not buy this product!!
"years ago I had an astringent with a berry fragrance and this has a similar scent that I really like. I use an SPF product every day and this spreads easily, absorbs well and does not get ""waxy"" and rub off or leave white streaks on my face. It is a bit $$$$, but you really only need a small amount to cover your whole face."
"I love all Aveeno products for myself and the whole family but after 2 days of trying this cream my skin reacted in a bumpy rash all over my face, feeling warm and red. I've never reacted to any other Aveeno product like this. Nothing else in my diet or routine changed, so I'm condiment it's the cream. Sad, because I liked the feel and smell of it."
"Although I used the product every day on my face, and it felt good to the skin, I didn't notice any improvement to my skin. I thought maybe ""Absolutely Ageless"" suggested something for my older skin but it doesn't really with this particular product. But it does feel good without being greasy."
"I loved, loved, loved the Positively ageless line and saw huge improvements from using it. When I discovered it was discontinued , I saw this Absolutely Ageless cream and assumed it was the same thing. Boy was I wrong! It makes my skin extremely oily and within one use had a major break out. I tried it again and same results. I am sad that I will have to ditch Aveeno products and go with the competitor, but I cannot afford to have massive break outs on my face."
I've been using this moisturizer since August (now November) and could not be more pleased. It doesn't feel too heavy for warm weather and now that it has cooled I feel like it is keeping up with the dry air. Every morning I apply it to my neck and face. My skin used to be oily but as I've aged I would say my skin is more combination.
"Tip - it comes in a pump form, but you do not need a full pump to cover neck a face. Just a half pump."
"I purchased the Aveeno Absolutely Ageless cleanser, day moisturizer and night moisturizer. After a few days of use I got redness and terrible itching on my face & neck. I stopped using it for awhile and then tried again. Same thing happened. I've used other Aveeno products before without any problem but something in this line doesn't agree with me."
"The smell is amazing. Aveeno absolutely ageless daily moisturizer is made with blackberry complex, and has SPF 30. The product absorbs quickly and the skin feels smooth and soft after applying. Unlike other products, this moisturizer did not feel greasy and slick. I used it daily and saw how radiant my skin looked. Skin looked healthy and fresh."
"Four days ago I used this product for the first time, and noticed my lower cheek areas feel a little itchy. The next day, however, my whole face was swollen, red and extremely itchy, especially along my jaw line and upper neck. I went to urgent care and was given a shot of cortisone and a 5 day pack of prednisone. I am still having the redness and itchiness. I've been taking snips of my aloe plant, and squeeze the juice onto my face, which really helps, besides applying ice packs. This is miserable."
"I had borrowed this product from my sister while on vacation. Within a day my skin started to feel tight and dry, a week later and I am still feeling the affects. I have actually lost skin on my chin and lower cheeks because this product practically burned my skin off. DO NOT USE. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES."
"I will only use a daily moisturizer that has a minimum of 30 spf so I have found that my choices are limited. I was thrilled to see that this new Aveeno product meets my standard and contains many other ""good for my skin"" properties. I have found this light, thin lotion to go on smoothly with very little drag or leftover whiteness. The price point for this moisturizer is a little higher than other Aveeno products but it is different. So if these ingredients are important to your skin health it is worth the few extra dollars."
"This stuff was horrible. After only about a week my eyes and the skin around them were flaking and peeling. My skin became drier, not better. Will NEVER recommend this product to anyone. Thought it was supposed to be hypoallergenic. What a waste of money. Don't buy this unless you want to look worse."
"When the Aveeno product that I used was no longer available, I was very disappointed, but this product is a great replacement. At first, I was unsure if my skin would tolerate the new cream, but I am pleased with this product. I use it each morning before applying my make up. My skin looks healthy and feels smooth."
"I bought this on Thursday, 1/24/19 and used it Friday and Saturday morning. Before use on Saturday my skin seemed dryer than usual. After the second use, my face started burning and became very inflamed. Its the next day and my face still looks like I got a chemical burn. I've used many Aveeno products and this the first time this has happened with any product."
I use a number of Aveeno products and am generally very happy with them. But like a number of other users I experienced dry and itchy skin within a couple of days of using this product. As it appears that most people don't have this reaction I'd say the product is probably fine. There must be something in it that my skin doesn't like. I stopped using it and within a couple of days my skin was feeling better.
"After using this for a week or so, I realized it was aggravating my allergies. I didn't really realize it until the scent transferred to my make-up sponge. It caused my eyes to run. It's really too bad because I loved the results and price. Please make a fragrant free version."
I bought the daily moisturizer and night cream and after 2 days of use my skin got really bumpy and dry. I stopped use but now my face is red and hot and burns when I put other moisturizers on it. Wish I had of read these other reviews before wasting my money. I use many other aveeno products so this is disappointing.
"I bought last week and within two days of using, my face is entirely covered in a rash. Insane that something that is supposed to be good for your Skin does this and costs so much! So disappointed in you aveeno, I use other aveeno products and never had this issue."
"I have only been using this lotion for a few days but I want to note that I have experienced no burning or redness at all. My skin feels soft and smooth, and I noticed I have a glow as well. This lotion smells great, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I will see in a few weeks if fine lines diminish, but so far so good."
Goes on so smooth. Not heavy or greasy. I have sensitive eyes and I have no trouble with this moisturizer. I really love it
great product..makeup goes on really smooth after using..nice smell. would recommend..all aveeno products are good
"Like all Aveeno products, this is terrific. My skin feels softer and it has already made some dark spots on my face completely fade away. A little goes a long way and it's a light weight lotion. The fragrance is light and fruity. Great product."
I am a member of Crowdtap and received this Aveeno Daily Moisturizer complementary for testing purposes. I love this moisturizer an love the SPF factor. Happy to receive and try.
"I have used other Aveeno products without issue and liked them but had a reaction to this product. I started using it Sunday, the rash showed up on Monday and has become progressively worse requiring a doctor visit. Discontinued using the product."
I used the intensive renewal serum last night and the daily moisture this morning for the first time and had a very bad reaction. My face is red and burning. It seems to be swelling as well. What can be done???
Tried this product for a few days last week and had to stop. It caused my face to develop a warm red rash and feel itchy. I will never use this product again.
I am also someone who had an allergic reaction to this. I have used other Aveeno products without a reaction. It felt very nice and I wish I could continue to use it. m
i absolutely love this product. it's not sticky. it's very light when applying it.
i've attempted to used other anti aging products and they break out my face.
aveeno is amazing for my sensitive skin.
"I bought this product because I use Aveeno's Absolutely Ageless Eye Cream and liked it. This moisturizer, however, gave me a red, itchy, burning, rash. I've never had a product do this so I was disappointed. I do not recommend it."
"Purchased this item over a year ago and it was great, however, this most recent purchased has been down-sized considerably. What happened to the larger, yellow package?"
Left my skin feeling very oily. I already use the Aveeno daily moisturizer with spf and thought this would be a good alternative to help with aging skin but I guess it's not going to work.
"I bought this product two days ago and my face feels severely burned, tight ,itchy amd inflamed."
Im very disappointed due to the high price I expected great results.
"After only 4 Days of use, this product made my skin red, horribly dry and itchy. It burned whenever I applied it, and now I have red, itchy patches all over. I've done discontinued use but assume it'll take a week or two for my skin to recover. Disappointing because I use the Absokutely Ageless face wash with no issues."
"After one use my face is swollen, itchy and red. I am honestly shocked to have a reaction to an Aveeno product. I use Aveeno on my baby so I thought their moisturize would be a good choice for me also. I bought the absolutely ageless daily moisturizer and the night cream. I will not even be trying the night cream."
Love this moisturizer. it's light and not greasy at all. Makes my face feel smooth and satiny.
"I like it, The price is good."
"I have been looking for a new anti aging moisturizer now that I'm getting closer to 40 and after one use I have a red itchy angry rash all over my face. I've never been allergic to anything in my life, so I can only assume it was this product. Very disappointing."
"I got a sample of this moisturizer in the spring Walmart Beauty Box. I have tried several different brands of moisturizer with SPF30 or higher and nearly all of them are greasy or feel more like sunscreen than a facial moisturizer. The Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF30 Sunscreen was not greasy and absorbed into my skin quickly, leaving my skin moisturized and protected. So happy I got this sample -- I will be buying more."
It's a product that multi-tasks and is good for you. Gives your skin a silkiness that helps minimize fine lines and wrinkles. It's a lightweight formula that felt great on my face. I was genuinely happy that it didn't make my skin feel greasy and it accomplished what I needed from the moisturizer.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. I've been very pleased with this product. Dry winter air can be rather hard on my skin, so it's important that I use a moisturizer at this time of year. It absorbs quickly so I don't have to wait long to apply foundation, which is critical for me to use a daily moisturizer regularly. It's also very reasonably priced, so it's a great value."
"My face is bumpy, itchy and dry. Face burns. I highly do not recommend this product. Horrible product."
This is the lotion I use when I am heading out on a hike or any other outside activity for a long time. This has a great feel on my face. I don't feel like I have SPF 30 on my face. Great product - great SPF protection!!
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO�� sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. I was very happy with the awesome results my skin looks and feels healh."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. I discovered that I really like Aveeno products. This daily cream moisturizes my skin, spf protects it, and also smells amazing. Thank you Aveeno and Crowdtap!"
I usually love and recommend AVEENO products to friends and family but this is 1 product I would not recommend. I was expecting to see healthier younger looking skin but instead this product would burn when I applied it and made my face breakout really bad. A complete waste of money.
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.” I love this moisturizer. Not only does it smell good but it has a SPF of 30. This is part of my daily routine to help me keep my skin looking younger. It goes on smooth and is not greasy. Will continue to use everyday."
Aveeno absolutely ageless daily moisturizer is absolutely wonderful! I love this blackberry complex line. My skin is usually dry this time of year. Since using this moisterizer combined with the other products my skin looks and feels great. ( I received my sample from crowdtap as a member of The Aveeno rewards crowd)
"I have to say my face feels great since I have been using Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30. It does not make my face feel greasy like some products do and I have noticed a difference in my skin looking healthier. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.”"
"I love this moisturizer. It leaves my face feeling great, soft and fresh. It is a keeper."
Been using this product for years. But Walmart is the only one that offers a nice discount price
This is the only thing that helps my face when it gets dry. I love it. Keeps everything moisturized and feeling soft
"I always like this product, Aveeno is a good skin product! Doesn't clog pores and make skin feel sticky."
Love this product . Been using it for about 2 years now and always get compliments that I look younger than my age .
I brought this because after using a sample I thought it would be good for my skin and also of all the rave about Aveeno brand. I'm sorry to say I was not impressed. it broke me out badly and made my face super oily. Really disappointed ;(
"Love this moisturizer it helped a lot with my sensitive skin l received this as a sample in Walmart beauty box glad to have Ben able to try before buying defiantly buying full size, my skin just feels so nice now.❤️"
This product is absolutely awful!i would apply this moisturizer after apllying benzyl peroxide and when i would my face would instantly BURN AND ITCH matter of fact it left my skin this way.It even has made my acne worse it left my acne even irritated and bright red.i have since switch moisturizers and its better than aveeno! This new moisturizer doesnt make my face itch and burn.if i where you I recommend geting the cetaphil daily moisturizer.This product needs to be taken down!too many complaints
"I had very high hopes for this product. My 40+ year old skin is extremely fair and sensitive and I must always wear sunscreen when not in my house. This product smells great and feels great going on, but then it changes. My skin becomes extremely greasy/sticky by the end of the day and that's even after I started putting translucent powder over it. After using it everyday for a month now, there has been no change to the fine lines and wrinkles around my mouth, eyes, or forehead. The sunscreen does work very well."
"I used this product for 3 days, and the only thing good was the smell. My face is dry, itchy, flaky, and feels tight. I went back to my other lotion and my face is so raw it burned like crazy. I am trying to repair my face, and it is so embarrassing going to work with my face flaking everywhere. Threw it in the garbage."
"I received this in my Walmart Beauty Box. I loved this at first but about two weeks in it started to feel greasy to me. I usually stick with SPF 15 moisturizers to avoid the greasy feeling (I have combination/oily skin) and use makeup that also contains an SPF. Overall, the smell was fantastic and for the time that it did work I loved it and was considering it as a potential new moisturizer because of the higher SPF. If your skin can tolerate SPF 30 and you can find this in a sample size it is worth trying."
"The smell is very pleasant. Aveeno absolutely ageless daily moisturizer is made with blackberry complex, and has SPF 30. The product absorbs quickly and the skin feels smooth and soft after applying. Unlike other products, this moisturizer did not feel greasy and slick."
I used it daily and saw how radiant my skin looked. Skin looked healthy and fresh.
I am 34yrs old and started using the night cream. My skin is softer ad healthier looking after just 1 week! My fine lines are smoother too. The day cream is awesome! This stuff will not clog up pores or cause you to break out. Light smooth and non greasy. I love and recommend this stuff!
"For me personally, this does not make my face feel moisturized at all. I did not care for it, and it really doesn't have much a a scent. I am glad I received a sample as opposed to buying it outright to become dissapointed. It may work for you though."
"I'm always hesitant to try a new facial moisturizer with SPF in it, most of them make me break out. This feels smooth and gentle, and hasn't given the slightest reaction. The fragrance is pleasant, although maybe just a bit too much for my tastes, but not so bad I wouldn't keep using it. Overall I'm happy with this lotion and thrilled it's SPF 30 and doesn't cause me to break out!"
The Aveeno absolutely ageless daily moisturizer went on light and easy. The formula is non-greasy and long lasting. I noticed an immediate reduction of fine wrinkles and appreciated the SPF 30 protection. Will definitely purchase the full size product.
"I love the aveeno unscented body lotion because it works wonders on my sensitive and used to be prone to eczema skin. This product feels nice but I am skeptical using on my face since nowhere can I find the ingredients online (I received a sample in the winter beauty box) and this product is scented. I will probably use on my neck, but definitely not on my face to avoid a reaction. #walmartcontest"
I received this Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer in my Classic Walmart Winter Beauty Box. I didn't know that Aveeno made a face cream and I floored with how well it worked. It has a wonderful smell to it to begin with. It applies very smoothly without having to use alot. This means it will last a very long time which is a plus. There was no irritation at all and you could see the results within days. Thank you Walmart Beauty Box for giving me the opportunity to find this great product. #walmartcontest
Bad product. I applied after showering and my skin started to react with heat and itching so I immediately removed it but my face felt weird all night and today so far it hasn't really gone away. Hope it doesn't become more serious. How can this be hypoallergenic? I couldn't find anything on the label that said there was perfume or some fragrance in it. Why can't it be without a smell at all? Can't stand it. Threw it away.
"I liked this product. It was not greasy, as so many with SPF can be. Great under makeup for a day outdoors. Would like to try more to see if it helps with wrinkles as 2 days is not long enough to form opinion. Does not smell funny, has pleasant, subtle scent"
My skin felt good after using without any greasiness or acne/irritation problems. I saw no miraculous changes to my fine lines and wrinkles but I believe in using SPF in my skin cream and keeping your skin healthy and moisturized overall is what helps with minimizing lines/wrinkles.
I replaced the olay complete that I used to use with Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer. I got a sample of this moisturizer and liked it a lot more than my typical Olay moisturizer. It is thicker and richer and just makes my face feel softer and less dry. The only downside is the cost as it is 4 times as expensive for less product. I did find a sale on it and bought it then
I love aveeno products and this moisturizer is no exception. I used it daily and ended up buying a bottle of it. It's not greasy at all. I have very dry skin on my face and hands and I used it a couple of times a day and it kept the dry spots and flakes on my face away. Will definitely continue to use.
I like this produce. It absorbs quite nicely and with out any greasy residue. This is really good for sensitive skin. Not sure what the price is because I got this in Walmart's Beauty Box for spring (which I highly recommend). It's got a nice little benefit that it includes a sunscreen also.
"I've tried an Aveeno product before, and I wasn't very impressed. But, this was a great daytime lotion! It absorbed very quickly. It left my face feeling like silk.The sunscreen was a great bonus, considering I have roscacea. Also, it did not irritate my roscacea! I think I found a new daytime moisturizer."
"Doesn't leave my face oily, I really liked this product and it has a great scent as well, I received a sample of this in the wal-mart beauty box, glad I was able to try.I will be buying this from now on. I tried the Roc wrinkle correcter which for some reason flakes when I add primer to it, this one works well with my makeup routine no flaking and goes on smooth."
I tried this at the same time as the Aveeno nightly restorative cream and I am just as happy with the day time moisturizer. It has a pleasant smell and did not break me out. I have used this daily and the small sample size I tried lasted a month. Although priced on the high side for me it is worth the money. I will be repurchasing this along with the night cream. I really like this moisturizer.
"I was a little hesitant to try this as my skin can sometimes break out with a new product, but that did not happen and I found this to be a great moisturizer. I love that it has sunscreen in it, no need to add another product to my face. It left my skin properly moisturized, not greasy, so makeup application was easy."
Was a little skeptical to try something new on my face as I am prone to breakouts with certain products but this is some good stuff. I also tend to have very oily skin with certain products and this is so nice to be able to use and not worry about that shiny face coming out. No bad smelling moisturizer just nice and a little goes a long way.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO Daily Moisturizer to review and I have to say that it is really good. The first thing that I really like about this product is the consistency. It is a very light cream texture that doesn't feel heavy on the skin. I also love the fact that it really works great as a foundation before applying any make up to the face. I also love the scent which is very light and soft. Overall my skin feels soft and looks absolutely great!!!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. From the first time I used this product, I could feel the difference in my skin. After using this product for a few weeks, the difference in the softness of my skin is unbelievable. My skin is so soft and the dryness is gone. I also love the fact that it has SPF 30 sunblock in it and I love the smell."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO rewards program, and AVEENO sent me a sample of its AVERNO Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. This cream is silky and rich. I like how it went on my face. I also like that It contains sun protection so I won't get more age spots as I age. This us a product I would buy. My least favorite thing is the flowery smell. I would rather have a clean smell but I know it's a personal preference!"
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.” I have to say my face feels great since I have been using this. It does not make your face feel greasy like some products do. I will be purchasing this. Thank you for letting me sample."
I have been using my sample of absolutely ageless daily moisturizer by Aveeno for a little over a week now and I can tell a difference in my skin looking and feeling g smoother. Has a light but pleasing scent to it. I would recommend. Thank you Crowdtap for my free sample. #sponsored.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.This moisturizer is very nice.I love the feel of it on my skin and love knowing that my skin is protected from the sun with the SPF 30.This is a light feeling lotion that makes my skin feel smoother and well protected.It has a light pleasant scent that is not strong."
"I'm definitely enjoying the product I received. The lotion is surprisingly light and easily can be used on a daily basis. During the day, I can definitely feel the softness later on, hours well after it was applied. I would most definitely consider purchasing more of the Aveeno Daily moisturizing lotion in the future! “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Intensive Renewal Serum to review.”"
"I really like this product, it works really well with my skin which can sometimes look dry especially around the nose. I think the product is great I will be using it a lot.

"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.” I am somewhat familiar with the Aveeno products but i have to say this is one that I will surely keep in my fight against aging .. its non greasy the smell is awesome and its so light on your face its like your not wearing anything on it .."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program and Aveeno sent me a sample of its Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Miisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to review. I loved the wonderful blackberry scent when I first opened the product and I was excited to try it. This went on smooth and left my skin feeling smooth, not dry or sticky. My skin felt and looked great all day long. What a great product!"
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.” But my opions are my own.

I really like this product a lot. My face feels so smooth and soft."
"AVEENO® ABSOLUTELY AGELESS™ DAILY MOISTURIZER WITH SUNSCREEN BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 definitely made my skin feel younger, mouisturized and protected. I loved that this moisturizer has sunscreen built in because I can use it in my day to day in my outdoor activities. It is not heavy or greasy. Smells wonderful! I received this complimentary from Crowdtap to test and review. Opinions are 100% my own."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program, and Aveeno sent me a sample of their Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30. It's so light and airy, and leaves my skin silky soft, while protecting me from harmful sun rays. I love it!"
"After trying the intensive renewal serum, daily moisturizer and restorative night cream, my skin feels and looks amazing. I have always loved Aveeno's products. I've used it off and on for many years. What I like best about it, is that no matter your age, their is a product for your skin."
"I am a regular Aveeno user so I was pretty confident that this product would be great. I have sensitive skin and often times when starting a new product my skin goes crazy but not with this. My face is hydrated and looks healthy. It has definitely evened out my skin tone a bit. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review"
I am a member of CrowdTap and was able to sample this product. I live the way my skin eels after using the Aveeno daily moisturizer. My dermatologist has always recommended Aveeno for my skin because he trusts this brand as much as I do. You will love the way your skin feels after just one use you can tell the difference.
I received this product free for an honest review. This is great for all day wear. Works well under makeup. Last all day. Great for even sensitive skin. Fragrance is strong when first applied but it does fade. Creamy texture. Absorbed well. Hydrates skin. Helps dry patchy skin and fine lines. I do recommend this product.
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review.” I really love this product. I love the way it feels and smells. I have dry patchy skin and I have used this product for 7 days now and can really tell the difference on my face. Love it . Lives up to the Aveeno Brand."
"AVEENO Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 leaves my skin softer and younger looking. It did not have the heavy, greasy feel and like that it had SPF 30. I'm a member of the AVEENO rewards program, and AVEENO sent me a sample of its AVEENO Absolutely Ageless Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review."
"Love layering this with Absolutely Ageless Intensive Renewal Serum. Such a great way to battle those little wrinkles during the day!!

I've always used Neutrogena products but this Aveeno moistsurizer is lighter weight and works wonderfully! Great product.....I totally recommend it.
"A little greasy for my oily skin after having it on all day, but it feels great going on and has a nice light scent."
Used the daily moisturizer as well as the night time moisturizer for 3 days and my chin and neck broke out in itchy red bumps. Did not work for me.
I have being using this cream since I received my box and i can tell it is great. My skin feels softer and isn't a heavy cream excellent to use under makeup.
This product smells amazing. It's quickly absorbed into your skin and it leaves it so soft and smooth. Thanks for letting me try such a great product.
I received a sample of this in my Beauty Box and I loved it. I used it on my hands and they felt a lot softer and it smells great. I will certainly be buying another one when my sample runs out.
I use this in the daytime. It is so lightweight. I use it under my foundation. My skin feels so soft. Definitely one you must get. I use this and the night cream. What a dynamic duo!!!
I was excited to try this Aveeno moisturizer with the SPF 30. This product made my face feel smooth and soft without a greasy feeling. Nice moisturizer with an added bonus of SPF 30
Really like this moisturizer. It's a little expensive compared to others in the drugstore. I will still purchase it once I finish the one I have. Love the way my skin looks.
"This moisturizer/sunscreen has a pleasant, light fragrance and does not look odd on my skin. Some sunscreens leave white in the lines on your face or look shiny/greasy/tight, but this disappears into your skin."
"I am really impressed with this moisturizer, it makes my skin so smooth and feels so hydrated. It is great for under foundation and use it after makeup comes off at night. Definitely recommend."
"This was creamier than I had thought it would be. I was expecting a low value cream because the retail price is not excessive I was surprised, and will purchase this."
"I've never tried this brand and was pleasantly surprised . I liked the feel on my skin and the fragrance was minimal, which works for me. Nice bonus to has a moisturizer with built in sunscreen."
I loved the way it went on smooth and it felt nice and soft. The sample wasn't enought to get a clear picture of what it could do. I would be willing to buy a bottle and try it since I liked the way it felt.
"I really enjoyed using this. It's lightweight, yet effective and has SPF 30. It did not irritate my sensitive skin or contribute to any break outs. Excellent product."
"This facial mousterizer is wonderful. I put it on after my morning facial cleaning and my skin was vibrant, soft, and smooth. No oily or greasy texture. Lasted all day."
"I really like this product. The only thing that would make it better is making it a more natural product with less chemicals. But, it does a great job and I love the added sunscreen."
This is a very nice feeling and smelling day cream. I have only used the sample but will buy the full size item once it is gone. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy.
I was thrilled to receive this sample. I love the Aveeno brand and use many of their products. This moisturizer was not too thick and made my skin feel smooth without feeling greasy.
"I received a sample as part of Walmart Beauty Box. I have sensitive skin. Experimenting with new products usually equals a break out for me. No break out occurred. Aveeno went on easy, absorbed well, and made my face feel soft."
"I was curious about this new product, as I have seen the ads on tv. It smells good and the day cream worked well to avoid sun damage. The night cream is harder to tell right away, but it does feel nice going on the face."
"I'm 39 years old & have just in the last few years really started paying attention to moisturizers. This product is amazing! It's non-greasy, smells nice & does its job from morning til night. I also love the SPF30 included."
"I love this product , works well on my dry sensitive skin, and last all day. Keeps my face hydrated under my make up. I found out about it by subscribing to Wal-mart beauty box. It is a good way to find out about new products and trying them out ."
I really liked this moisturizer and the fact that it has sunscreen just makes it so much better. Seems to soak into my skin quickly leaving it soft and smooth.
Aveeno is a great product. The daily moisturizer with sunscreen goes on smooth. It blends into your skin without leaving a greasy feeling. It doesn't have the 'sunscreen' smell. A little pricey.

"#WalmartContest, I tend not to like the smells of most facial moisturizers. It is like you can smell the ingredients or chemicals in the. I was pleasantly surprised by the great scent. The night cream has become my new favorite. I am sometimes somewhat lazy to put on night cream before bed. I like the scent, it didn't come off on my pillow and I woke up to hydrated instead of dry skin."

"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Daily Moisturizer BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 to review. What I liked best about this product is that it's a 2-in-1. When I use this, I don't have to use a separate sunscreen followed by moisturizer.

Aveeno absolutely ageless daily moisturizer with broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen- I like the light nongreasy formula.
Lotion perfect for my oily skin as it was light. I could use it and not have too much moisture on my face.
