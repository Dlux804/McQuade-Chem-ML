I noticed an increased radiance to my skin. My friends and colleagues also remarked that my skin seemed to be glowing. I did notice some firming.
I HAVE TIRED LOTSOF FACE CREAMS OVER THE YEAR AND WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THEM BUT THIS PRODUCT DOES JUST WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO WILL BE USING THIS FROM NOW ON!!
This is a wonderful product and has removed several wrinkles and starting to correct the double chin. My problem is it works only on light wrinkles and not the deeper ones. But I like it very much.
It's made a big difference in the texture of skin on my neck. It's so much smoother. Didn't expect it to take all the wrinkles away but it's done a much better job than I expected!
"I started using the multi correxion five in one chest neck and face cream And could immediately tell a noticeable difference. It was nice to know I could use it in the morning and have protection from the Florida sun. Are usually reapplied after lunchtime and feel confident that I'm not getting more wrinkles. The lotion doesn't feel greasy and although I have sensitive skin, I haven't had any reaction other than my skin looking fabulous!"
"I used ROC Retinol for about a year and loved the results! I ran out and thought I would try the 5-in-1 cream. Used it one day and woke to my face being tight, and red with an itchy chin and neck. My eyes are swollen too. So sorry to read others are having the same issue and that I must be having an allergic reaction!"
"I tried the 5-1 night cream as well the 5-1 eye treatment. I woke up the next morning with a swollen, red, inflamed face that got more itchy as the day went on. I'm on day 2 and the swelling around the eyes have gotten worse as well as the itching. I've been doing cold compresses, ibuprofen and an anti-histamine to help me. This is a terrible product and should come with a clearly written, easily visible warning about side effects. If I had the option, these products would have no stars at all."
Broke out in irritated rash on neck where product was applied. Rash dEcreased in severity five days after stopped using product
"Love this Roc 5-in-1 day cream. I have seen good results after using for the past two weeks. I use the night cream as well. It really does make my skin look more radiant. I'm a 67 year old woman that was a sun worshiper when I was younger. I use the cream on my face, neck and chest daily along with the night cream. My face looks more radiant. I have received compliments since I started using. I highly recommend."
"I was not sure to purchase this cream...but decided what do I have to loose..just might as well try it, long story short..I was super happy with this cream. It's not greasy, glides on comfortably, it honestly leaves my neck, chest and face smooth and feeling non greasy...which I hate to feel like that when I put on a cream. I highly recommend and it does make my fine lines and wrinkles seem less visible. Which is a huge plus for me, and also well moisturized. I really liked this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, I used this product once and ended up with an itchy, red neck which lasted a couple of days even though I washed off my neck. Returning this product today."
"This has been my daily morning go-to for years. It smooths and tightens the delicate décolletage, and has a 30 SPF, which is key to keeping your neck and upper chest protected and youthful. It's light, smells nice, and is worth every penny."
I use this cream everyday after bathing. Best neck cream on the market. Use consistently and you will see results. Not greasy but softens skins and diminishes the lines in the neck area. I love this cream and will use it forever. A plus is that it has a great but subtle scent that does not interfere with your perfume and it has sunscreen. You cannot go wrong with this cream. Fantastic product and well priced.
I bought this with high hopes but I can't get passed the smell. It has a very strong smell and I can't wear it long. I had to wash it off. I wish it came unscented because I would really like to try it since the Roc products always get such good reviews.
"I've been using this for 5 days and I now have a red rash around my chin and it has dried out my skin. I typically don't purchase much for myself and while the product is affordable it was still somewhat of a “splurge” for me. Needless to say I am disappointed. I do like the way it smells and it doesn't feel thick but the rash almost feels like a burn. Therefore, I will not be able to continue using it."
"My 50-something face really disliked this product! I used it for only a few days before I had to stop. I applied it at night before bedtime. In the morning I discovered my face was red and blotchy. And the cream clogged my pores causing breakouts. I always try new products for a few days to give my skin a chance to adjust to them. But after a few days, I simply couldn't stand the discomfort and irritation this product caused."
"I love all of the Roc products. This one is great if you're starting to have issues with creping in your decolletage. But the price makes it difficult to justify the purchase on a regular basis. A normal sized container lasts about one month because you really need to use it twice daily. If you stop using it, you can expect to see aging signs start to return after about two weeks of non-use."
"I've been looking for a neck/chest cream for awhile now because those areas show your age before your face does. I was so pleased to see this cream on the shelf. Allure Beauty recommended the cream so I knew it was good. It's not too thick and it does smell of the 30 SPF that it has in it, but I don't mind the smell. It absorbs after a few minutes, then you're good to go."
"This has really helped my dry skin. It makes it feel very soft and smooth as well. What I really hate is the strong scent. (The reason for docking it one star) Please, please remove the scent! I left the lid off for awhile in hopes that some of the smell dissipated. I think it helped some. I think the scent did cause some bumps on my face initially, but this has gotten better."
You can actually see the difference within days of using this. I had received a sample and ended up buying the full size which I very rarely do. Best decision ever! Couple years later and I'm still using it. Plus it leaves my skin soft... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this for some time and notice some reduction in fine lines. The scent of the cream is nice and I feel like it firms my face and neck up nicely prior to applying make-up. And the price is great compared to other more expensive face creams, and I don't notice any difference between the more expensive creams and the ROC cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed softer skin and less noticeable lines in just a few days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It seems to be a nice cream, not sure how well its working on my wrinkles, but Roc is always a good product. Good price as well."
ROC has one of the best skin creams and serums on the market at an affordable price. Use them and your skin will thank you.
"Woke up in the morning with my face all red and rough.Used it just once. Did not feel anything right away.,until the morning.Face is red and very hot.Never have I had a reaction like this."
I really love this cream help me for my wrinkles and my face looks shine clean I will buy this cream
"When it became time to replenish my ROC skincare , I opted to try out the Chest, Neck & Face Cream. I love how it makes my skin feel! I've been using the 5 in 1 Multi Correction line for for a couple years and love the results!"
"I have tried several products.....and these are simply THE BEST in my opinion. I used Roc years ago and will NEVER change again!! What a tremendous difference in feel, quality and results!!"
"I purchased the NEW Multi Correxion 5 in 1, but see after active ingredients the Purpose is Sunscreen. I already use sunscreen every day, so would like an opinion about keeping and using this."
i LOVED this tiny sample!! and i ran to get a proper sized one because it has been incredibly hydrating and softening! i LOVE this product and recommended it already to others!!
"I had been wanting to try this product & was excited to get to sample it. I only used it for about 3 days, it burned my face too bad. I have sensitive skin but I usually don't experience burning like I did with this."
I wanted a rich cream with Shea butter and sunscreen and without retinol for use during the day as my skin is very dry. This has worked great so far. Leaves my skin very soft and moisturized. What I don't like is the strong scent. Wish they would just leave it out or make it much less intense and maybe more light and citrusy-not so flowery smelling. Scent eventually subsides and I can put up with it for the good benefits.
"Feels nice on skin, really like it on my old neck"
"ROC MULTI CORREXION 5 IN 1 CHEST, NECK & FACE CREAM I WOULD RECCOMMEND TO SOME PEOPLE, BUT NOT ALL PEOPLE. THIS FRENCH BRAND IS PRESTIGIOUS AND THE CREAM IS OF GOOD QUALITY. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY HAD A PROBLEM WITH IRRITATION ON THE FACE FROM IT."
"I've used Roc products before, and this didn't disappoint. Although I would have liked a bit more to sample than the minute sample that was provided. It's hard to really see if a product make a difference unless you have a few applications worth. But the lotion absorbed well and had a light scent. Not greasy at all. Love it"
"Saw ad in magazine. Purchased on a whim, fantastic results in 1 week. I noticed and my husband who had been out of town noticed. I love it!"
This product helped to improve the appearance of my skin and helped on the areas of dry skin. Reduced the look and feel of the skin.
Third day of use and my cheeks and chin have a rash and are very itchy. Wasted my money on this product. So disappointing.
"Received this as a sample. Applied one night, woke with itchy and hot rash covering much of neck and chest. Tossing this product!"
I have been using Roc products for the past 10 years and have always been told I look much younger than my age. I rate this cream right up there with the others.
That it doesn't have a lot of oils. I got a small amount in my beauty box from Walmart and tried what was sent and like it a lot. Works great for the time I used it will look into more of this brand. Had never used anything from this line.
ONE THING I KNOW IS THAT ROC IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY. MY SISTER & MY MOTHER TRIED USING IT AND HAD PROBLEMS WITH BREAKOUTS ON THEIR FACES. THEY SAID THEY WILL NOT USE ROC ANY LONGER. SO I'M RELUCTANT TO USE THIS PRODUCT.
I tried the sample size and did not feel that it was a large enough sample to truthfully make an honest judgment.
I did like the way it felt when putting it on. Not to greasy.
I discontinued use of this product as it smelled horrible. I wish it smelled better as I wanted to see how well the anti-wrinkle abilities turned out.
So nice to have one cream that does it all. I just apply it to my face down to my chest. I think it works as well as more expensive creams I have used.
This formula is smooth and non greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a pleasant smell. You can feel it working on your face. I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate it.
"I have used several Roc products, due to the good reviews. Unfortunately, I can NOT use them long enough to tell if they actually work, because the scent is way too strong! PLEASE, for the love of all beauty products, make this unscented!"
"This is a great product, with a multi- purpose use. It targets your face, neck, and chest, and has a nice silky texture. No cream is perfect, but this does a good job with moisturizing and softening wrinkles.."
Love all Roc products.
Great producy
"This cream is versatile for using on the face, neck and chest. I like how creamy it is and smooths on nicely and absorbs quickly. My skin felt nice after using it and I like that it is spf 30. It did improve the feel and appearance of my skin, but I only tried it a short time with the sample I ordered, so I don't know how it will be long term. I love the scent! My only criticism is that it could moisturize a little better."
"I tried ROC 5 in 1 cream. I felt like it sat on the skin and didn't penitrate. I don't tend to have a problem with dry skin, maybe it would work better. I prefer to use a product that actually goes into the skin instead of sitting on it and then washing it off at the end of the day/night."
"I rec'd a very small sample in my Walmart Beauty Box, very small. I was only able to use it a couple of times but it is not greasy and felt good on the skin. If I had a larger sample and could use it for a couple of weeks I could give a better review."
Excellent moisturizer
I love it
Exceed my expectations
Recommended products for anybody younger looking skinis
"Like feel of product, but smell is over powering and gave me a headache have to return"
This gave me a bad headache because of the strong smell
I wish it came in unscented.
Smelled heavenly and felt so good on
I've also use this product for 2 1/2 years. It's great. Thank You.
"Makes your skin smooth. is SPF 30, and very reasonably priced. Have only been using it for a week, but can see it's making a difference."
Worked wonderful on my aged & dried skin. Would love to try more products from RoC in the future. The RoC product rocks!
"Used this on my neck -within about 8 hours my skin was itching, broke out and did not get better for over a week"
"This product goes on soft and light on your skin, not greasy, just moisturizing. Great for neck and chest, areas which sometimes we neglect."
"I've used this product for a week or two and have not noticed a difference. Maybe it takes longer than that; I don't know. As of right now, I would not purchase it."
"I received the ROC Multi Correxion 5 in 1 in my Fall beauty box. The little bit that was in the tube was nice. Goes on smooth and creamy, non-greasy and best of all you can use it all over face, neck and chest. I love that it has an SPF 30 rating. The only disappointing factor is that the amount provided was so minuscule I didn't have enough to use over a longer time to be able to make an educated decision about how well it worked for me. Therefore, I did not purchase the full-sized product."
"I have used a few creams on my face and because I have oily skin, I can't just use any product as I break out instantly. What I noticed 1st was the great smell, the thickness and non oily. The sample was very small, but it was enough to want to use it again."
"I got two in my box. I have used them both. But I really am not sure what is so exciting about it. There are plenty of other sunscreens that work just as well but do not cost as much as this one does. I found that when I was working in the sun and sweat, it ran in to my eyes and burned like heck!"
"Such a tiny sample. Used to use ROC products when I lived in Montreal. I loved their Gel for puffy eyes. This cream is nice - feels nice, makes skin looks nice and smells nice (barely no smell) I am very sensitive to smells, they trigger my allergies and asthma, so this one is a winner for me."
"ROC is the best line of anti-aging skin care that is actually affordable. I literally saw a difference in 2 days. I have been using the pump moisturizer for years, but this one is even better. I have already noticed that my brown spots are less visible and my turkey neck (from weight loss) looks smaller. PLUS, this one can also be used as an eye cream which saves me $15 (I use the ROC version for that too). This stuff is great. I'm ordering more when I get halfway to be sure I won't ever have to go without it."
I recently received a sample of this product in a beauty box. I tried this product during the summer months and it was thick and made my face greasy. It might be better in the winter when my skin is super dry. If you have very dry skin then this would be a great face cream for you. I would recommend this to my friends with really dry skin but not to ones with normal or oily skin.
I love ROC products. I have received the ROC serum in a previous beauty box and it has become one of my favorite products. I was happy to try this since I am needing to make some changes in some of my moisturizers as my age increases. I used this with the serum and love it! This cream is light weight and has a very mild fragrance. Thank you Walmart Beauty Box for finding me another fantastic product
I was looking forward to trying this product from ROC. I am 58 and continue to look for good skin care products that I can also afford. This sample was enough for a week if use on the face alone. I used this each morning and evening after washing my face. It moisturized lightly but that is all it did. I have seen better results from lower priced products. Everyone is different but this product is a no go for me.
The Roc Multi Correxion 5 in 1 cream is really good! I think it has such a nice scent and it works very well to hydrate my dry skin. My face and neck feel noticeably firmer right away after using and feels very smooth as well. I also love that it has spf 30!

"Since using this cream, I have seen visible results. I started a regimen of nightly use as an experiment, not expecting any results, but boy was I surprised! Where once the skin was dry and saggy, I began to see a softening firmness on my neck. Yes the product is a little pricey, BUT what is good skin worth? I've decided.... I'm definitely worth it! Highly recommend."
"ROC Multi Correction cream did what it said it would do, which amazed me!!!!. It's not greasy... Your skin drinks it up quickly, which is what you want to happen, when you apply moisturizer. It doesn't just sit on your skin... It melts those small wrinkles away ;). I highly recommend this moisture. It's not expensive and it works... however, it can be difficult to find."
"I received my wonderful sample of Roc Multi Correxion 5 In 1 Anti-Aging Chest,Neck & face Cream with spf in my Wal-Mart Beauty Box and I am in LOVE with this product.So glad I was given a nice sized sample to try.I put it on my freshly cleansed face,neck,chest and my skin feels so hydrated and healthy.I love how my skin feels after each use."
"I had been looking for a replacement for my current anti-aging moisturizer when I received the Roc Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Anti Aging chest, neck and face cream. After the second day of using it I was hooked! I could tell a difference in my skin texture that quick. I have a new favorite!"
Ive been using this for a long time. I'm almost 44 and this has helped me feel fresh and young. The key is regular every day use. I truly believe it helps reduce fine lines around the eyes and my neck still looks like it did when I was in my late twenties. So I'll keep using this.
"The scent of this is too perfume-y, especially since it is a facial product. The SPF coverage is nice. It leaves skin slightly greasy feeling, which may not be an issue for dry skin types. I doubt I'd buy this again, however, since I didn't notice any results whe I was through with it."
"I love a product that has multiple uses and it still looks beautiful. I hosted a ROC your age party and I was given a wonderful assortment of ROC products free for my guest and myself.The Multi Correxion 5-in-1 works to smooth out the skin on chest,face&neck and it has SPF 30 spectrum.Protection from the sun is a beautiful thing! It feels light going on and leaves skin smooth on the Chest, Neck &Faceis serious skin care that leaves me feeling lovely! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for the last four weeks. I am diligent about putting it on before bed and when I remember I use it in the morning as well. I can see a difference in some of the fine lines that I had around my chest area. I will continue to use it and see if I see continue improvement. The texture is wonderful. So creamy and I feel it really sinks into the skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using RoC Multi-Correxion Face Neck and Chest Cream for a few weeks after receiving a free sample through House Party. I had noticed a difference in my skin especially my neck area. After a recent 4 day trip where I forgot to take my 5-in1 cream.... I noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my skin without the 5-in-1.... I will never travel without my cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for a month. I received this product for free through House Party. I would give my honest review even if I paid full price. This stuff is amazing. My skin feels amazing and looks younger. Love that it has an spf in it too!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is one of my favorites because I have dry/discolored neck and chest. I use it every morning on my neck and chest for added SPF as well as it makes my skin color more even. I'm literally obsessed with this product, I will definitely buy this one when mine runs out, it's so SILKY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I definitely saw a difference after a week of using RoC chest, neck & face cream!! I'm 47 and have starting of wrinkles and loose skin on neck and chest!! But this cream helped significantly!! Thank you RoC!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thnks To the House party I got this product RoC for free and I am lucky enough to use Cream with Broad Spectrum SPF30, specially in Arizona we need to protect our skin against the sun, and as a first time mom my skin change and I was able to stop the spots in my cheeks the KS to ROC multi correction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Roc product is just so versatile! I love that it can be used on so many areas - chest, neck, and face. I also love that it contains SPF 30 because I need it on more than just my face. So often I've forgotten about my neck and chest area and gotten too much sun there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has only been about five weeks since I started using the RoC Multi Correction but I already feel like my skin, especially under my chim, feels better. The skins uneven tones are slowly becoming less noticeable. I received a sample to try, and these are my thought! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"You know, first I thought this was just for my neck and decolletage, Then I did a little bit more research and this is my final step in my morning and night time routine. I love the way it feels on my skin, silky, soaks right in makes me feel look very hydrated period I am now in love with the ROC skin care line [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never thought about my neck and chest until I got this product to try. Then I honestly looked at my neck and chest to see if I really needed a product. Boy was I surprised, I was starting to get a turkey type wattle, and my chest was definitely showing sun damage and my age. So I tried this product. Within 3 weeks my neck tightened back up and my chest smoothed out. I actually look 5 years younger or so because of the difference. I'm thrilled! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm all in for saving time and this is truly a great multi purpose product. The cream has a great texture and doesn't irritate my face or neck at all. My only problem is the SPF; it's definitely a necessity but the scent is a trigger for my migraines. I'm sure it's a winner for most. ** I received this product for free but my opinion is my own ** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream feels very moisturizing. The SPF is a wonderful addition and this product does not have that sunscreen smell that so many others do. It just smells like a cream. Skin feels moisturized for many hours after applying without being greasy.
I received this product to try for free and this is my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked using this product while I was on vacation in Mexico. Such a difference than the Pacific Northwest winter I was experiencing. I knew I needed a different product to protect my skin. This worked very well, although I would only use this during the summer months here not all year round. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would highly recommend this product! I was able to notice a difference in my skin after a few weeks of using it. I love the fact it included SPF which in turn equals one less product I have to apply during my morning routine. Another GREAT product from ROC! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My neck has always been a trouble area for me - showing my age way more than my face does - so i was super excited to get a chance to sample this item for free. It worked better than i even imagined it could! my neck looks so smooth and the age spots on my chest are definitely diminished. This is my favorite new skin care product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Prior to receiving my free product I was not really acquainted with Multi Correction 5in1 Chest Neck and Face Cream with Broad Spectrum SPF 30. I admit I was a bit skeptical as how could one product do so many things. I am a skeptic no more. It truly works and works well. I love what it has done for my skin and having SPF is an added bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product went on smooth and has a pleasant scent. It is helping with the lines on my chest and neck. I love that it has the SPF in it also. I had some excess so I put it on the top of my hands and they look hydrated. I will definitely continue using this product. I am trying this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was my least favorite of the ones I was given to try. I did not see the results I was hoping for. However, it has only been a few weeks and I may start seeing more visible results as I continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in a free House Party Host pack and have been using it for about 4 weeks. I am using it along with the Deep Wrinkles Serum as my daily moisturizer and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I also got my husband to try it as daily face sunscreen. Can I admit that I like the name because although its obvious that you can use it on your neck and chest as well...it reminds me to do just that! lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free and will definitely be purchasing this when I run out. This stuff really, really works. It has a thick consistency because it is a night cream but it spreads very well and leaves no greasy feeling. The packaging is good and a little goes a long way. It's nice to use one product for 3 areas versus having to purchase 3. Your neck will definitely look smoother, firmer and moisturized! It's awesome! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really needed some help in the chin and neck area what's really great is it's a all over face cream and it's luchess it's creamy soft and my face drinks it up I've never had such results any time with any product I love this neck and face cream I get great feedback everyone loves it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream is very absorptive, has a lovely scent and the bonus is that it has a sunscreen in it. I use this under my foundation (if wearing any) and it doesn't compete at all. My skin tone has been looking even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product,and my party guests loved it to. After one treatment it makes your wrinkles diminish and leaves your skin ever so soft.Alot of my party guests got instant results with this product ! I am planning on purchasing this ROC product very soon,because I am running low on it. A little goes a long way.Use it sparingly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My experience with this RoC multi-correction 5 in 1, is good not great. I've had the opportunity to try this for free for my review. The scent is too strong for me, i don't care for it. It also leaves a shiny kind of dewy feel on my face that I don't care for. Over time it does seem to soak in. I will continue to use this on my neck, I have been using this for over a month, it may have improved my skin texture but I am going to stop using it on my face because of the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm glad I got to try this through a HouseParty Party Pack. I like the easy of spreading this product on my skin. Because it's for face, neck, and chest, it's also good that I would only have to buy one product instead of two or three. That would be my reason to purchase it again, because it really didn't seem to do any more or less than other products I've purchased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never used a product that was meant for my ChestFace and Neck area and I have to say that I love it. My chest and neck were 2 areas that I was neglecting and this cream is making my skin look and feel great. I love that it has an SPF in it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love a product that can be used for multiple areas of my face so I can cut down on clutter/cost and application time. This cream is rich and moisturizing. It absorbs into the skin quickly instead of sitting on the surface like some other products. I did not notice any strong perfume scent, it just smells clean. No skin irritation observed. I really appreciate the fact that is has high SPF in it to shield my skin from sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Fine lines between your boobs? Wha? As a side sleeper I noticed this becoming an issue. I have slathered my decollete since the MULTI CORREXION 5-in-1 arrived and have noticed a (ahem) plumping to the area in question. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a free sample of RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Chest, Neck & Face Cream courtesy from House Party in exchange for my honest opinion. My face feels silky and smooth after applying and I love the smell too. Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have slightly sensitive skin and despise the smell of most facial sunscreens. I have had no reaction and the scent is light and pleasant. The texture is perfect for a winter moisturizer. In the sticky hot humid summer it may be a bit too heavy but for now its a perfect day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"You often see older ladies with wrinkles or spots on their neck and chest because we are so focused on saving our faces, but it is so important to use a quality product like this to protect all of our face, neck and chest! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Eureka! I have finally found a moisturizer that has everything I have been looking for. It can be used for your chest, neck, and face. It also contains the broad spectrum SPF 30. I've been using it now 3 weeks. I not only think that I look better, it has left my skin feeling smooth and less tight."
It isn't always easy to find SPF in cream. I feel that I have found the mother lode. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just love this product. I have been using this product for 2 weeks and have noticed a tremendous difference. Works great on any area and your neck.It is fast absorbing and works well with my other Roc products. Will be using this product all the time. Has spf 3 sunscreen that help block the sun and damage you get from it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this 5-in-1 Cream and the fact that I got to try it for free! I tend to spend a lot of time outside, even it the winter, so the SPF factor is an added benefit. The cream leaves my skin feeling healthy and seems to last. The 5-in-1 also smells wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing. I like how smooth it goes on my skin and how nice my skin feels after application. I have been using it every evening before going to bed and I think my skin has more of a glow to it. My neck definitely looks better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel this is truly just a sunscreen as it says it is. I don't think I saw any difference on my neck, or face. Looks a bit greasy at first but does blend in, so if you are just looking for a sunscreen this is fine. No help with fine lines though. I saw a lot of reviews were for promotional reasons hope you'll use this one too because this is the truth."
"I like that this product has an SPF 30 to protect my face, neck and chest. It is very similar to other products I have tried. I'll continue to use this because I like to use all the same brand when layering facial products. I wish they had a cream for bedtime that didn't have the SPF.

I like this product I received for free by hosting the Roc party. It has a nice fragrance. It goes on smooth to my neck and chest. I have not used a product like this before and so far am happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way that the Roc Multi correction 5 in 1 chest, neck and face cream feels and goes on... smoothly and thickly. I use it on my forehead to see if it will remove years of worrying about my boys. If in the end it works, I will happily name it my bottle of removing wrinkles caused by teenage boys. This product along with other Roc products were given to me by HouseParty/Roc [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Chest, Neck & Face Cream with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is a great cream. You only need a small amount and it doesn't have an over-powering scent. I am glad it has an spf because I sometimes forget to put it on. I am also liking the results on my chest and neck! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great everyday moisturizer I enjoy using from top of my forehead and clear down to my chest/neck area. It goes on smoothly, has a nice fragrance and does not feel sticky or overly heavy. Also like that I don't have to worry about using an additional SPF product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free to try and was pleasantly surprised. I love the feel of the cream. It has a pleasant, but not over whelming smell. I'm out in the Florida sun everyday and SPF is important to me. This does the job. Very pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I think this is good neck cream. I have been using another brand that costs much more than this one and I feel that his works just as well + it has a 30 SPF that my previous brand does not. It is a thicker cream that spreads easily, absorbs fairly quickly and does not have a sticky feel to it. I did knock off 1 star for the smell. I am very sensitive to scents and this one is a little strong for my liking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As I get older my skin has lost some of its elasticity and my skin was gathering around my neck and chin. After using ROC Chest neck and face cream my skin is lifting up tremendously! I use upward strokes when applying and it seems like a facelift in the bottle. My chest and neck are a lot more smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Can't say enough about this product! From the minute it is applied you can tell the difference. I can see my skin looking better, feel it working, and just love that it has spf 30 to protect my skin. I have shared this with all my friends ! Methods not miracles! Thank you for letting me try Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Chest, Neck & Face Cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I started using the RoC Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Cream I have see a noticeable improvement in the appearance of my skin. Fine lines have disappeared and the couple of deep wrinkles I had have smoothed out and faded. My skin is soft and supple and looks years younger. I am so glad I was given this product to try for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is probably great but I was allergic to to SPF. I discontinued it's use and bought another RoC moisturizer that I love! It is the RoC Restoring 5-in-1 Night Cream. I have used it every night and it is extremely moisturizing. My dry AZ climate is tough on skin and many moisturizers don't feel like they are even on my skin after a few minutes. This one left me feeling moisturized and just right! Not greasy! In the mornings, my skin feels soft and looks great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RoC multi correxion 5 in 1 chest, neck and face cream works great to protect and hydrate my skin every day. It protects my skin from the sun every day and it also leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I did not get sunburned while using it and I live in a beach town in Southern Ca. I got to try this product free thanks to House Party, but the opinion is my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this can used not just for the neck area but for the face as well. I have tried other products that make you use 5 different things for 5 different areas and it is both exhausting & expensive. I like that I can ""consolidate"" products and simplify my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product since it can be used for more than just your face. Sometimes we forget to take care of our neck and chest but they wrinkle too. Also the sunscreen is a good addition! I did receive this product free and I would buy it when my sample is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this full size cream free through House Party when I hosted a RoC House Party. The cream blended well into my skin and neck/chest and it felt moisturized but the fragrance was a bit too much. Fragrance can irritate the skin and generally I try to make sure creams/lotions are fragrance-free. I also would prefer tube type packaging for less contamination and better preservation of the product's ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first started using this product, I was impressed at how quickly it absorbed. So far, I have noticed a much smoother texture to my skin and a more even tone. I did receive this product for free but truly am impressed with it's ability to do as it is advertised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is wonderful...great even for my sensitive skin..love that it has sunscreen added too..good for face n neck...n gentle soft feel ..received this product free n highly recommend for anti aging skin care [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This skin care cream soothes my dry winter skin. It isn't greasy and I'm glad that it has an SPF in it. Doesn't cause any acne blemishes or breakouts like other skin care creams I've tried in the past. It has a pleasant fragrance too. Love it!
I received a free Party Pack compliments of RoC and House Party in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I start my day washing my face and applying this product its not to heavy or greasy so its good before makeup. It smells nice and I know my skin is protected from uv rays before I go out. I also apply it to my hands because the sun hits them when driving or doing anything outdoors. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Chest, Neck & Face Cream with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 that I received free in my RoC Your Age House Party Pack is fantastic! It glides on smoothly, and does an excellent job reducing fine lines and wrinkles on my face, neck, & chest. This one is my new best friend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thank you @HousePartyFun and @RoC for letting me try RoC Multi Correxion 5-in-1 Chest, Neck & Face Cream for free! That was one of my favorites to try out. I loved how it made my skin feel! I will be 62 in a few months and feel like I could definitely use this product as a daily skin care! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this cream to try for free buy my opinions are my own. This is a great 5 in 1 cream that makes my face, neck and chest look and feel great! Plus I love that it is SPF 30 to also help protect my skin. It doesn't feel too thick even though it does all these things. It goes on nice and smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for over 4 weeks and the chest wrinkles are gone. I love this non greasy 5 in 1 cream. I do not have to add sunscreen to my face, this contains spf 30. I received this product for free for my honest opinion. If you have to buy just one ROC product make this it. The best facial and neck moisturizer I have ever used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first thing that I love about this is opening the jar and smelling the slight fresh smell that for some reason reminds my nose of summer. No idea why...but anyways the slight scent to this product smells GREAT. Its very hydrating but not greasy and soaks in my skin right away. I forget its there and yet with the sunscreen its protecting my face & neck from future sun damage. I really like this product and will continue to use it as my #1 daily sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5-in-1 Chest, Neck & Face Cream with Broad Spectrum SPF 30 for free. After trying it, I could tell a difference in my appearance. I love that this cream also has SPF of 30, so I can use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from HouseParty. I've been using it for about three to four weeks. It works great! It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It has a very light scent, nothing I could really notice. My skin looks smoother already, and I will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RoC is probably one of the best over the counter, widely available, non-bank account emptying anti-aging lines available. While not as strong as what you can get by prescription, constant use will show a definite improvement in fine lines and wrinkles. This chest and neck cream is no exception. Even after just a couple of uses I could tell that this was helping to undo some of the effects of the years of neglect for this part of my body. I also like that the scent isn't overpowering."
"I have used this a couple times and the cream feels very nice being applied to my face and neck. The next morning my skin feels great. The draw back is that when I went to check the price, I was surprised about how much it is. It is nearly $30. That just seemed pricey to me for a drug store/chain store cream."
"I liked every about this cream. It works great for face, neck , and chest. I really noticed the results on my neck and chest, definitely improved look and texture of skin. I would purchase this cream in future and recommend to friends, great job RoC."
"I was so excited to see this in the Walmart sample box I got. I had been wanting to try it because I hate the aging I have started seeing on my neck. Within one week I saw a dramatic difference! I have purchased a full size which should be here tomorrow, and I was so excited by the price as well. I suggest if you are looking for a neck cure, at least try this solution!"
I was surprised I did feel like I felt results from this cream overnight.I have been using it since receiving it as a sample. .My fine lines are much less noticeable.It was not greasy and I could feel that my skin was tightening almost immediately.I would recommend this product.
"I don't know why the beauty and skincare world think that our skincare stops at our chin. Thank you ROC for catching up to the premium brands at last, and offering a cost-effective product for the neck and decollete. I will buy this... in bulk!... and use it every day! Goes on smoothly, absorbs well. Can't speak to long-term benefits yet, however if this is anything like other ROC products, I expect it to also be quite effective!"
"What can I say? ROC products speak for themselves. I've never had a bad thing to say. They are extremely pricey, I'd love to see them a little cheaper, but at least they do the job. Sometimes you have to pay a little more for better quality. I have alot of issues with the skin on my face as I get older, and this really makes a difference for me."
"I received this RoC Face, neck, and Chest serum in my Walmart Fall Beauty Box. It was a very small sample so to me I didnt get to use it enough for a great review. But I can give you a good one. It really works on your face. It starts to improve your overall skin texture and feel. And starts to ease those lines away. Worth buying a bigger jar."
Roc really made my whole face and neck feel so soft. There was no funny smell or sticky feeling after or while applying which I love. I used this in the am and in the pm I felt like the small lines around my eyes and mouth were getting harder to notice. This will be my new go to.
I was surprised by how much I liked this product! Seems like most facial creams I try are too thick or greasy and don't seem to sink into my skin making me feel like I have a mask of mayo on my face. This was very light and smooth. Sank right into my skin with little effort and I was able to put my makeup on directly after applying it. I made an excellent primer and it had a light scent also!
"RoC Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Chest, Neck and Face Cream was something I used on my neck and chest to try. I really liked how it made my skin radiate and smooth out. It seemed to tone down some of the uneven areas too. I feel overall it made my skin look much better."
"This cream is amazing. I have used it everyday since I got it. It is very expensive. For the money, I am on the fence about it. I am weighing the pros and cons of buying this product. You dont get a lot but it does last a while. I think I will buy it one time to see the value."
"I used this where I needed it most--on my neck. While it didn't magically erase my crepe neck or give me a facelift, it did firm and soften the neck/chin area. No problems with itching/burning, etc. and it didn't rub off when I used moisturizer on top of it."
"I've been looking for a cream to use on my neck and chest and was delighted to get this Roc cream. It works well, feels nice on my skin and even has a lovely scent. The sample size lasted a week. I then went to Walmart and purchased a jar of the cream and I use it every day."
I love this product - the sample was great. Cream could be applied to multiple areas and is really effective. Cream goes on smooth. Moisturizer worked well and I could see results in the appearance of lines in a few days. This product will become a staple in daily regime.
"I enjoyed the fact that it was non-greasy and left my skin ever so soft ! I like the product, but I am not sure if I would be a regular user because of the price of the product. I am loyal to another product already and I feel like I would be ""betraying"" the product by using this anyway."
"This sample is ridiculously small. Can't give an honest review with such a tiny sample, so I gave it a 3. Too bad companies can't REALLY allow you to TRY a product with enough of a sample to make an educated decision on its value. Won't be buying it because of this."
I liked this product. I felt I could see a difference that I haven't noticed with other products. The only reason I didn't rate higher is because I'm waiting for the Texas heat to kick in and see how it does. I don't like a product that resurfaces in the heat and humidity. So far so good. No harsh smell.
"I got this in my Walmart beauty box... The small sample size lasted me about a couple weeks... Within that time I found my skin to look more juicy... Yes juicy... My face was not swollen but my skin looked plumped (in a good way), very fresh and dewy, and my skin was so soft... I wash my face at night and lather this on my face, neck, and my chest... My skin felt so supple... I loved it..."
I really loved this cream! The smell was lovely and the texture of the cream was so smooth and rich. But once I used it I didn't feel like it was too thick and it absorbed quickly. I definitely feel like the skin on my neck and chest is much smoother and and softer. I'm especially looking forward to using it in the summer time. I'm so excited to have found a product that treats my neck and chest with as much care as my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using RoC Multi CORREXION 5 in 1 chest, neck, and face cream a little over a month ago. In just that short time I have noticed that my skin is less red in my face,neck, and chest. My skin is starting to regain it's elastic in my neck area and not be as saggy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been searching for a product for my chest and neck. I already use Roc on my face and it has made such a difference. This Roc is just as good. The chest and neck area can give away your age. This product reverses it. Love Roc Multicorrexion 5 in 1 Chest Neck and Face cream. Will recommend it to friends and definitely give it as birthday gifts to my sisters.

"I bought this cream because of a review that said it really works well lightening brown spots. I bought it believing that a little. I have tried so many others. But, about a month later I realized my brown spots have been reduce by 80% in color and intensity. I got the night cream and that has enhanced the effect. I love this cream. It's very light weight but hydrates perfectly. I recommend it this cream and the night cream from this line to anyone. #recieveditfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super light cream with amazing results! my skin feels soft and smooth after few days using this product. Some of the small lines around my neck are gone! my skin looks radiant and healthy.

"I love my ROC! I was skeptical at first, but just one application I felt and saw a difference. My skin was so soft and not greasy, just after the one application. I love that it has sunscreen, and that it is fast absorbent. My skin shines, and feels so much healthier. I feel more confident after wearing my ROC Multi Correxion, even under my makeup. I never did a neck and chest regiment, but now after trying my ROC, I now have it as my regiment every day and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is my first time using the 501 Rock and it makes my skin feel very soft and smooth I'm used to use another stuff like oil of olay I've been using it for about 3 days now and I really like it I think by the bottle is gone I'm going to buy more this is a very good brand [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can tell the difference already in two days my skin is smooth! I can't wait to see the difference after a week and a month. I have terribly dry skin and this is making a tremendous difference! I was skeptical but now I am a believer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never used RoC products before since I couldn't afford the hefty price tag but I got a free sample from @Crowdtap for testing purposes only and fell in love with this. I am at the age where I need to start taking care of ageing skin and all the signs that go along with it (wrinkles, fine lines, skin blemishes, etc...). Finally a product that delivers the goods ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love anything that is a multi purpose product and actually works. This #Roc cream goes on smoothly blends into skin instantly and hydrates plus it has SPF 30 too. Made my skin feel soft and diminished fine lines. Excellent product, and takes the place of at least 3 others [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have try so many face creams that promise great younger skin but I can truly say RoC has been great to my skin. My face looks and feels amazing. Doesn't leave my skin oily or get breakouts. And did I mention it smells amazing. I also use it for my hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I began using this in the last week and it really feels and smells great,it is nice to know I'm doing something to benefit my face,neck and chest with this Roc cream,I am very pleased with it and will be using it daily and loving it and the SPF 30 is great in it for sun.

"This RoC's® MULTI CORREXION® 5 in 1 Chest, Neck and Face Cream was amazing for me to try out. It was so light to put on I did not feel weighed down by it like most other creams. I applied it int he morning and at night to get the full benefits and I was able to see a difference in my skin in just a few days. I also noticed the skin damage that my statin medicine caused faded so I was happy about that and will continue to use this so I can get rid of this staining.

"I love Roc multi correxion 5 in 1 chest, neck ,and face cream. It smells really good and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. I am allready seeing results. My skin tone doesn't look dull, it's giving my shin like a glow to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only used this once because I found the fragrance too overwhelming.
"I used this one time, and got a rash almost immediately. The rash lasted for a week."
"This product and actually a few other ROC products I have tried are too Harsh on my skin, I am 58 and have dry skin. This seemed to make it worse!"
"Didn't really see or feel any difference in the feel or texture of my neck and chest area. Sorry, I wanted it to work."
"This makes my skin look and feel younger, I would definitely recommend it for those fine lines that creep up as we age."
"The sample was really small, so I really can't give you a truthful review. It soaked in really fast, but I still had some dry patches after I thought I was done applying."
I like facial moisturizers that aren't too think or too think and contain a sunscreen. This is similar to Olay but Olay might be less expensive; have to find ROC on sale
there was not enough product to determine if it correct but I did like it and would buy it in the future because it was light and did not make me break out
"This is very good for dry skin. It says for use on chest, neck & face, but I only used it for my neck & chest, since I don't have extremely dry skin on my face. It is not at all greasy. Definitely would recommend."
I love the scent of this cream. It smells light and fresh! It is a small sample so I can't say yet whether it will have great firming effects on my neck and face. But no complaints so far.
This product feels good to your skin. A little tingling lets you know it is working. I have been using it for a month. I can see improvements in my skin's texture and lightening of discoloration.
I appreciate the combination of spf and face cream. The extra moisture barrier with sun protection is a plus for these summer suns. I used this ROC product sample from Walmart on my trip to Arizona. It worked so well under my makeup.
This has officially become my permanent moisturizer . I had been searching for a summer moisturizer with SPF that did not make my face greasy . And this one is perfect not greasy at all and moisturizing.
"My skin has lifted and brighten with combination of different products, since I'm using this I have noticed a huge difference in my skincare and skin. It looks healthier."
Easy to apply. I have sensitive skin and it did not aggravate it. Lightweight. Pleasant smell. Sample lasted 2 weeks for me. Did show signs of improvement in fine lines.
This lotion went on well. It's nice and smooth a little smelly but not bad. No greasy feeling and not thick when put on. Really helped with my dry rough skin.
"This is a good cream to be used on dryer complexions or as a under the eye wrinkle cream. I use this product on areas that need extra protection. The Roc Multi Correction 5 in 1 Anti-Aging Chest, Neck & Face Cream is a good product."
I am 62 and this is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and never feels greasy. It does diminish some lines and wrinkles. I would highly recommend this.
"This cream Is silky and smooth. My husband is sensitive to smells and has no problem with this product. Have not been using long enough to see much results, but feel it will work well.an"
"It really works. It smells great, feels good going on, and I can tell a difference in my face after only a few days. I went out and bought a full size after using every bit of this sample."
I have not used this product. I don't go out in sun. I already have too many brown spots from when I was younger and being out in sun all day long. I am sure the product is good though. A trusted name
Love this stuff. I just wish I could afford to spend the money on it. I am on a strict budget. I have to pay for my kid's required school items first.
this was a very nice cream. I liked the smell and the coverage was great.
it automatically has a spf in the cream so one less routine to bypass in
getting myself together in am. highly recommend this product.
"I really liked that i can use this on both my face and neck. Other than i thought it really made my face feel oily. . I have oily skin as itbus, so i dont need any extra oil there"
"Roc Multi Correxion 5 In 1 Anti-Aging Chest, Neck & Face Cream With spf 30, 1.7 Oz., I love this stuff I've tried so many different things and Roc is the best. No turning back for me"
I actually bought this product after using the sample.
Very affordable and works really well on the wrinkles on my upper chest.
Very pleased with this product.
I had never purchased ROC before. This sample changed my life completely. I love the smell. It keeps my face moisturized all day. Has a good feel to it. Its the best face product ever.
"I only got a small sample of this in my Wal-Mart Beauty Box, so I can't comment on how well it works after using it long term. But I can say its a nice cream, easy to spread, and has a nice fragrance."
"I like the feel of this lotion on my face, not sticky at all! I may have to buy this one as most anti-aging lotions for the face leave a horrible feel on my face! Would love to know the long-term results for me as at my age, anything helps!"
I love this product but could not find it at my local walmart!!! Its great for under make up. I went to buy it and could not find it. I will continue to check for it.
"This is so very creamy...not greasy at all. The scent is too good to be true!! Only negative on this, for me, is the cost. It's priced a bit higher than I would like to pay."
"Got this in a Classic Walmart Beauty Box. Sample size was a bit small but this is the second sample of this that I've gotten and they were both the same small size. Although this is a good product, I just can't see spending that much on it."
This has been one of the best moisturizers I have ever found for face and neck. It is not sticky and does not cause me to sweat. It allows my skin to breath. I will purchase this item in the near future.
Thank you!
"I love anything made by Roc. It makes my skin feel rejuvenated and I see positive results. I would buy it over and over, if I could afford it. Excellent product."
"I have been using face cream on my neck and chest for a while, and have noticed good results -- smoother skin tone and no wrinkles. This is a good cream and I love that it has spf 30 also. I just wish there was more of it!"
I've recently started using this & it's so smooth. It's not heavy or greasy. Love the lightness on my skin & knowing it also protects me from to much sun.
"My daughter actually got a hold of this one, she loves the little packages and thinks they are meant for her. She used it as a regular lotion, but I have to say it did relive her eczema flair up so I call that a win."
"I like that the cream isn't greasy and feels nice on your face. However, it has a very heavily fragrance. I don't care for that. You smell it all day and night as a result."
I liked the fact that a little goes a long way. It left my skin feeling soft and supple. It abssorbed quickly. And it is a sun block. It has a pleasent scent
I dont use this kind of stuff. Theres so much out hwre of this stuff that i think its ridiculous plus its expensive. I would tell people about this though evdn though its just not for me.
"Great product. My face felt so silky smooth afterwards. I didn't give it a 5 star because of the cost, but I will consider purchasing this because of my silky skin."
"I loved this moisturizer! It was light enough to wear in the summer and under make-up... and for the price, I would highly recommend it! Worked awesome!"
will be buying this product--so glad i got to try it---otherwise i probably would not have bought a full size on my own--but now I will---thanks so much for these beauty kits
I have since purchased this product and use daily since I received the sample. The product does not live my skin greasy and I stopped using foundation daily since I started using this.
"Really enjoyed this product. Nice fragrance and liked have the 30 spf factor. Diminished a little of the dark spots, but probably have to use more to see a dramatic difference."

"Received a sample of this cream in my Beauty Box. A very nice, odorless cream. Not runny, it had a nice consistency. I used this on my Throat area at night. Not greasy. I give it 4 stars. I would buy it."
"I would never have bought this. I was leary. BUT after trying it, I really liked it. It left my skin smooth and the wrinkles appeared to disappear. I will be purchasing this soon."
"I like trying new products thats why I love getting the beauty boxes this cream I have wanted to try for awhile an I really liked it wasn't greasy and no powerful scent and no breakouts. and again good size for traveling, or weekend getaway."
I have very sensitive skin and was nervous to try this. Even as a sample I got several days of use from this and never broke out once. It was too short a time though to actually see if it helps in any other way.
It is lightweight & doesn't clog my pores. I love the way it smells and would TOTALLY recommend it to anyone. I have super sensitive skin & I used it everyday right after my shower and its amazing!
"i've been using this sample everyday since i got my box. i LOVE it. absorbs nicely, never greasy. feels good under my makeup. will definitely be buying this."
"I had been wanting to try it and am so glad a sample was included in my #WalmartBeautyBox. Unfortunately, I am not able to say whether or not it works. The scent is too strong for me so I stopped using it."
Ive used this product in the past. I was so glad to see this be a part of the Wal Mart box. I never thought of a moisturizer would work for both face and neck but it really works. Amazing product.
I just love putting this all over my face and neck a couple times a day. It has made my face radiant and also has improved my over all skin tone. I will be buying the full size of this product. Thank you ROC.
"It works really well, & covers up a lot of the splotches on my skin. And, it doesn't take a lot of the product to work either. I definitely plan on buying some in the near future."
"This cream smells really great, I had no sensitivity to it at all so this works for sensitive skin. Made my skin feel smooth, and I plan on continuing on using this to see more results."
"It was alright. I've heard wonderful things about this product and was eager to try it. Not sure it was the best for my skin. Nothing bad to say, also nothing extraordinary to say about it."
"This cream is Great! Used it morning & night; light, smooth & applies nicely. I truly noticed a difference on my face/skin -- fewer lines, smoother skin."
I've always been curious about Roc products. I loved my 5 in 1 cream sample from my beauty box. I have dry/combo skin that loved this hydrating yet non greasy formula. it has a subtle refreshing scent too! love
"I've always wanted to try the RoC products but they are a little pricey and I have sensitive skin. But thanks to this sample I can try it out. However, I do wish it was a little larger sample to see if it really works as it claims."
I loved the smell. My face felt and smelt refreshed. I noticed that the deep pores on my face didn't seem as deep after a week of using it. I will definitely be purchasing this product..
"The RoC Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Chest, Neck and Face Cream was nonirritating and absorbed well into my skin. It didn't leave a greasy or sticky film. I could easily apply make up over it."
This is the first time I have used an RoC product and I love it! It has a great fragrance and it does not leave my face feeling greasy or oily. I have oily/combination skin and it works perfect.
"this worked great on my neck area, i have lost some weight and the skin there was kinda loose and it helped firm it up and helped my face with dryness also."
Love cthe way it made my neck feel. It was as if it was tightening it up. At 43 I am starting to sag because of weight loss and age. I wish I could afford it in my budget but most beauty products are not in my budget.
"I really liked this face cream. It came in a sample box, and I'm so glad it did! I probably would not have selected it off the shelf, but I will certainly purchase it now. I like that it has SPF 30 in it, and it's not greasy at all."
I'm still not sure on this product. I don't believe there is enough of a sample to be able to make a decision either way. I will keep trying this product for another week and go from there.
Product absorbed fast and left skin feeling refreshed and replenished. it's a little pricey but the way my skin felt after even a few applications may make it worth the purchase.
"I enjoy all of Roc products, and this cream is a must. It goes on smooth, absorbs and is not greasy. After using the small sample I saw a difference in the lines on my face. Will definitely buy. Thanks"
"after hitting my 40's, I could see a difference in the skin on my neck - this is a really good product, after a few nights use, my skin looks smoother and younger"
"It's a very smooth cream that feels amazing! Not oily. What I didn't care for at all was the fragrance. It smelled like I was applying a sun screen that stayed. For that reason, I probably wouldn't buy it."
"I have never purchased RoC products, I haven't felt the need, but I did like this sample of nightcream...great smell, went on smoothly and non greasy. I would purchase this product."
"With just a sample to use, it is hard to make any real judgement calls on the direct impact that this product has on your skin. It felt creamy and absorbed well."
This cream is wonderful! I need to find this. I thought ROC was sold in high end stores like Lord and Taylor or Macy's. I will definitely be going to Walmart for this!
This cream was thick and seemed to be more effective in evening skin tone and texture. I do not see the wrinkle result it claims yet. I did buy a full size and just started it so maybe after some more time
I liked the way this cream goes on - not greasy at all. I received it as part of my Fall Beauty Box and may end up buying some when my supply of what I usually use is gone.
"I love this new ROC daytime Chest, Neck and Face cream I received in my Walmart beauty box. Smells wonderful and the SPF is an added bonus to protect my skin outdoors. I have used ROC product before and find they meet my expectations."
I only had a sample of this product to try but I found it non greasy and really pleasant to use - it is costly though and that should be taken into consideration when chosing a prodice
"Bought this for my mother & she loves it. She's 60 years young & looks even younger with this cream. Light feel, non greasy, absorbs quickly! Definitely recommend!!!"
"I find that I often forget to add sunscreen to my neck and collarbone area and therefor that skin is aging a little more quickly. This product helps me remember to apply there. Sunscreen is the best part about it, it was nice to get as a sample."
"Got this product as a sample & love it! It does seem to be a bit pricey, however, it has wonderful smell & feels great. Leaves no sticky feeling! Would like to try it for longer than a couple weeks to see if it really firms by neck area."
Ive always been a RoC fan so I was excited to try something new from them. Its a good product. I really didnt have a big enough sample to use it long enough to notice a big difference but my skin liked it. It felt light and made my skin feel smooth.
"Average product. My sensitive skin did not alow me to use it more than 4 times. Likely sunscreen causing burning sensation. I have enjoyed many of the RoC products, but will stay away from those with sunscreen until the formula changes."
this really does work well it minimizes the look of fine lines and wrinkles and leaves your skin looking smooth and refreshed and a little goes a long way
I really liked this sample. It felt good on the skin and smelled great. I liked it for my neck area it didn't leave it sticky. Leaves you skin feeling smooth.
"Great results from this product. Would recommend to anyone looking to have wrinkle free skin. It worked really well. Not sure about long-term results, but immediate results were good."
"I love all the Roc products! This cream is no exception and I would recommend this to everyone, my new holy grail and you will see great results over time!"
"There are many anti-aging creams with SPF that leave you face sticky and tight. This product is truly moisturizing, leaving no sticky film! YAAAY! ;-)"
"ROC is great, the product works a described. I like that one cream can be used on my face neck and chest. My skin is smoother and the fine line have improved."
"First time using Roc product and I'm very happy with the results. Left my skin smooth, is fading my dark spots and the texture is improving. Be careful about using everyday if you have sensitive skin, can cause some irritation."
"ROC is good and it works, skin looks better after using it. However, for the price, i wouldn't switch. I use a lower priced line that works just as well. Also wish they would provide something with spf."
"The amount of the sample wasn't really sufficent to give the product a better meet expectations rating. What I was able to use worked fine, but wish there was more."
It hydrates my skin well & evens out my skin tone. It makes my skin brighter & more even skin tone. I have used better products but they are also very expensive. For the money this product is worth your purchase.

I tried this new product and my 17 year old daughter asked me what product I had tried because my face looked luminous like one of those more expensive Sephora brands. Will definitely keep using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I do not have a lot of deep wrinkles in the neck area only a few light to medium ones. I used Roc chest neck and face cream everyday to see if it wold make a difference. I used the entire sample. At the end I didn't notice any difference in my neck chest or face. Maybe it would work better for someone else.
"Yes, I have tried Roc Face, Chest and Neck Serum. I have been using another specialty product nearly three years and it has done wonders for my skin for battling aging. However, this is only a sample that they send and you really can't approve or disapprove of the results. Inorder to put this product to the test you would need to use it everyday for quite some time to be able to give this a rating. I felt it was a bit too greasy, and left a sticky feeling."
I have great skin but have always had issues with my neck and chest. This cream is really awesome. I've used it for only a week and I can already see a difference on the wrinkles where my neck and and shoulders meet. It is also working on the center of my chest to remove the long wrinkle lines that go down the center.
Couldn't stand the scent to even want to put it on.
"you can see the results almos immediately, great! #walmartcontest"
This is a great product to use everyday
"Roc Multi Correxion 5 in 1 is probably good, but my sample was too small to see any difference"
"It was okay, but I need a lighter lotion. Liked the spf."
All I can say is not for me
"I did not like how this product smells, therefore I can't use it."
and after just a few days my under eye lines appear to have diminished.
Sample was too small to make a difference or make me decide to buy and add to routine
I do not see the value in this product. To me it is a bit gimmicky.
I love the idea of a product geared for my neck and chest. This is an area that women forget to moisturize but it is an area that is first noticed!
I buy this wonderful moisturizer all the time because it has an spf of 30. Most face creams do not have any spf. I use it on my neck
"I like the feel of this moisturizer. It has a nice fragrance and is light weight. Only time will tell how much it reduces lines and wrinkles, tho."
I have super sensitive skin. This left rashes all over where I applied it. The scent was a little overwhelming.
Great stuff. A little goes a long way. Moisturizes while protecting against the sun. Too bad sample was so small. Definately will buy some!!
I have used ROC products for a very long time and never been disappointed. This time is no different!
This is excellent for my grandma. She is in the sun a lot and needs extra moisture for her face. This does both.
It felt nice on my skin I couldn't really tell if i worked ornot because the sample was tiny only enough for one use
This sample was my first experience using Roc. Wow! I really liked the results. I've already purchased some after I used up the sample. Thanks!
"Love Love this face cream, smells so good, feels really good on my face, and you don't need to much, and went to buy some"
"I had to purchase this after I ran out. It smoothed wrinkles, softened my face and neck, and made be look younger. Loved the scent."
I really like this product. I'm going to look for it in the store. It's not greasy and absorbs really well. I like that is has SPF30.
"I have used this before, not among my top fav's. Didn't think it did anything for me. I'll use this up but won't purchase."
I couldn't believe this was in the beauty box always wanted to try it couldn't afford it i like it makes your skin soft and not greasey
To sample this product I feel the sample needs to be enough for a 2 weeks to compare the difference.
This moisturizer made my skin feel so soft! I noticed a difference in the smoothness of my face and neck in just a few day.
It is important to moisturize your neck and chest along with your face. I liked the feel and smell of this moisturizer.
"Great moisturizer! No greasy feel, left skin softer, fought dry areas, and had a neutral scent that was barely there."
This cream is amazing it does not feel heavy or thick. It feels light and creamy and makes me feel so nice. My face and neck feel good again
I really like this lotion. It is very lightweight and not greasy at all. absorbs quick and has a very light pleasant scent.
"Another great product from Roc, not surprising. Easy to apply and feels great, no irritating fragrance"
Really disliked this cream. It felt awful going on and just took forever to dry. I would not recommend this at all.
I like roc retinal products. Maybe not my first choice but it is a good product. My face felt soft and smooth.
This stuff is rather pricey. I can't use it. It breaks my face out so much. Ughh!!! I had high hopes of this but NOPE!!!
I like this product. I like that it has a good SPF in it and helps with anti-ageing. I would use it again.
"Highly recommend this anti-wrinkle cream ! I saw results w/i a week. It has a soft smooth feel, absorbs easily and doesn't feel heavy or greasy."
I noticed a difference in fine lines soon after I began to use it. Smells good. Did not cause me any irritation.
"I love the way this face cream made my skin feel. It was soft and smooth, not greasy at all I think it even made me look a little more refreshed"
"Not enough in a sample to really know, but I will buy this. Like the idea of something for the chest."
I really like this product a lot. It works really well and it feels good on my skin. For the price it is well
Worth it.
I use this Roc skin cream at night. I love how it doesn't feel greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. I wake with soft skin and no oily build up.
I love this product. I loved the feel of it when applied I loved how it made my face feel. This is a must for me.
Works on ridding me of fine lines and wrinkles on my sunburned overexposed skin. I'm almost 60 and it's working for me!!
I really like it but it is way too high. It went on well and made me feel good. I just can'take see spending that kind of money.
"This is a great moisturizer for very dry skin, but the scent is too strong, it should come unscented."
I like that I got compliments that I looked like I had on makeup or I had a glow. The only thing is it didn't absorb in my skin easy.
"This face cream is very smooth, non-greasy, and keeps my skin very moisturized and reduces Fine Lines."
This stuff is amazing! It's really moisturizing. The only thing that keeps me from purchasing is the price.
"From the first time I tried this I loved it! The way it drinks into your skin. Making your face, neck feel fabulous!"
I liked this item very much. I have purchased this since. This is a light cream not greasy for under makeup so with the sunscreen it is a duo item.
The ROC neck and face cream is awesome. It leaves your skin feeling so soft and satiny. Great Product.
Has a nice texture and went on easy unfortunately I didn't notice a difference from not using this product to using it.
I loved how this smelled and felt in my face. Would love to try more and see what kind of results since I only had a trial size. Great product!
I like the way this product feels on my face and I like the way my face looks after using it. Great product

I've been using Olay products for years and received this as a sample in my beauty box. It's very nice! I really enjoyed it!
I like the product very much. It smelled good and seemed to work well. I purchase a larger amount and time will tell.
This product was decent. There was something about the scent I didn't enjoy. I would not buy it again.
This product works it is worth any amount of money and you only need to use a small amount so it lasts buy this
I loved the way this made my face feel and my neck looked so much smoother after using this product. I plan to purchase this.
I love this product! And it even has SPF in it! I have already purchased a full size and am loving it.
I think this really helps with my fine lines. I'm having a hard time seeing the lines. Which being over 40 is a wonderful thing!
I have very oily skin . This lotion was good for keeping my skin firm and soft and yet not making it more oily. I will surely purchase this item.
"I do need a bigger sample to make a good judgment about this product, it seems like a good product, but it is a small sample to decide on it."
"Amazing got to have this prouduct!,Love it works great,and light weight! Nice fragrance,moisturizing g ,anti aging prouduct."
"Easy to apply, was not irritating to my sensitive skin smelled good."
The sample was not big enough to comment on if it corrected my skin issues
I loved how this made my skin feel and to know that I'm Fighting Aging is The Ultimate Plus!Def recommended!
I like the idea of a multi-purposed moisturizer. Why buy 5 items if 1 can do all the work? The product was gentle but effective.
Am loving this brand and cream! I'm shocked as it is so affordable and I have spent a ton on huge name brands! My Mistake!!
Worked better than I ever expected it to. Love the way it made my skin feel. Wish it were more affordable. This stuff is awesome.
"Absolutely loved it, I purchase ROC products and I have never seen this product on the shelf, will definitely be looking for it!"
I thought this product was top quality. I like the fact it is a moisturizer with a sunscreen in it. It works well.
I like Roc products and found that the Multi Correxion 5 in 1 Cream did the trick. Works as well as the very high end products.
I like this cream. It's not too heavy or thick. It absorbs into your skin and doesn't leave it oily. A little goes a long way.
"This creme feels great on your skin, but the sample was too small for me to tell how well it would work for sagging skin and wrinkles."
Loved the smell and non greasy formula. Went on smooth and made my face look and feel fresh and nourished.
"I have just been using it a short time but like the way it makes my neck, face and chest feel and look."
I really thought this product did what it said it would and I would consider buying this product as soon as I run out of my current brand.
"the sample was very small, only lasted a couple days, less than a week but it d.id seem to make a difference on my neck"
"i liked it alot my skin is very soft, didnt help the dark circles but not sure its made for that, im happy with it"
"I'm never disappointed in RoC products. This cream was really great, thick and rich yet soaked into my skin quickly and left it feeling fabulous."
I really enjoyed this lotion. I used it while landscaping and it kept my skin unburnt and younger looking.
I love this product because it targets the neck and chest which are often over looked. It has sunscreen and is from a great brand!
I had never used a ROC product and I'm very pleased with the results from the sample. Skin felt much smoother. I will buy the full size product.
I actually gave this to my mom and she said she uses it every night. She loves it and says it makes her face feel so much softer.
I'm in my 60's and tried this sample. I love it. Especially when it comes to the neck and chest area.
I'm new to the RoC products and after using this it did not disappoint. My skin appeared more youthful looking.
I love RoC products. I've used their facial serum and loved it. This cream does its job as well. Very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.
I had never used Roc before. I will never go without again! I have noticed changes in just the few short weeks I've been using it
"I will definitely purchase your product, so happy for the sample to try it out."
"Love, love, love, it!"
I have been using Roc products for a while now and it really works to fight wrinkles! People don't believe my age when I tell them.
Leaves skin smooth and moisturized without feeling greasy. But I haven't noticed and real difference in my skin so far.
Good texture. Does not take a lot to cover face and neck. You can see a difference in just a few days.
This brand really works at changing tone texture and tightness of skin. Can't go wrong choosing any of their products cause they work.
Love this cream seems to help with my fine lines also love that it is spf 30 I revived this in my Walmart beauty box buying full size ❤️
