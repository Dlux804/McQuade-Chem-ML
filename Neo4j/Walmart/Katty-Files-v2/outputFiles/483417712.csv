"Glad to see that they make this product with SPF30 and not just the SPF15. It goes on easily and does not cause breakouts on the face in sensitive skin. For a person who is prone to acne or sun-induced rosacea, it's terrific. It's very pricey, so we use it only on the face, and use the less expensive Aveeno on the rest of the body."
"I bought this product a few weeks ago. I've been using it everyday. My skin is SUPER sensitive and SEVERELY dry. The product says that it is for sensitive and dry skin. Whenever I put the product on it will burn my skin. After about 20 minutes, my skin is dried out again and has very large dry patches in my nose, forehead and cheeks. Very disappointed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this product because it specifically states it's fragrance free. I get headaches from scented products and take the time to research fragrance free products. I was excited to find this moisturizer but am completely disappointed because it has a pretty significant fragrance. Labeling it fragrance free is totally misleading. It wastes my time and money and makes me not trust the brand.
I bought this because I like the gel cleanser. This product is clearly marked fragance free. My skin turns red and irritated when I use fragrance on it. Well I was surprised when my skin turned red after I used this on my face! So I googled the ingredients and sure enough methyldihydrojasmonate is a fragance!! This company is outright lying.
"I have always used the sensitive skin daily moisturizer with spf 15 and really liked it, I also use the night moisturizer. I decided to get the spf 30 to give my skin more sun protection. I find it leaves a white residue on my face and doesn't seem to soak in at all. I now have to buy the other stuff and don't know what I am going to do with this stuff as I'd hate to throw out a full bottle."
"I've been using the old formula for years and loooooved it! This however, is NOT the same. I'm shopping for something else."
I thought it was fragrance-free but I do believe I was wrong. I am guessing my face broke out because of the feverfew or the Methyldihydrojasmonate (I believe this is a masking ingredient). This product also does leave a small white cast.
Heads up this has straight up benzyl alcohol in it so it's actually gonna dry your skin out so you have to use more of the product
I bought this to go with the face wash but that was a mistake.
The lotion doesn't absorb in my skin. I went to the eye doctors today and the doctor asked why my sun screen was showing. My fiancee asked the same thing later in the day.
I can't recommend this product.
"I was excited to find this product since I love other Aveeno products. BUT I can't use it. It does not absorb into my skin. Instead, it leaves my face feeling sticky and looking white--like I just put on a thick, cheap sunscreen. I wore it to my yoga class once and was asked by others if I was ill since I was looking ""peaked."" The only thing I like about it is that it is fragrance free. It is going in the garbage, not even good for a beach trip."
"So glad the sunblock agent is mineral only. This is why many people below complain about the white caste, but chemical sunscreens (which don't work BTW) area a significant irritant on sensitive and rosacea skin. I took off one star as this is not moisturizing enough for my needs, but that happens when zinc oxide is combined with a moisturizer."
"It's only been 3 days of me using the wash and moisturizer, I have super sensitive skin and have tried dozens of washes and moisturizers, after over 10 years I found something that works for me it is amazing!!! My skin is soft, and my redness is completely gone."
I'm breaking out everywhere! Please let me know a remedfy 69arriva! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The best moisturizer I've tried for my hyper-sensitive skin. Non-greasy mineral sunscreen is hard to find, but this is perfect. Please never discontinue this product!"
"I bought this because I need more protection on my face from the sun but it leaves white residue, also it dries my face alot I only used it three times, a waste of money."
I have used this product for years with fantastic results. I have rosacea and this is the product that works the best for me.
"I love Aveeno ultra calming night cream as it does wonders for my face as I like in Colorado (dry air and lots of smoke from forest fires). However, this did not rub or soak into my skin, leaves a sticky white feel behind. Very unsatisfying."
This product leaves a horrible white cast all over my face and hair line that can't be blended out. Maybe on people of a lighter tone this will not be as noticeable but to all of my brown skin people.....stay far away from this
"I have rosacea and this moisturizer used to work well for my dry, red skin. I bought a new bottle recently and something has changed. Like other reviewers have noted, this does not soak in to my skin. Instead, it leaves my face looking weirdly white, like I've just rubbed a bottle of zinc sunblock all over. I'm not pleased, but also not sure what to do with a full bottle. Also, definitely not unscented."
Bought this product 4 days ago and used 2 times. Experienced a tingle sensation and white residue left on my face (customer service said this is normal - I say it should be listed on the box - who walks around with white residue). Washed it off immediately the second time. Looked at the other reviews and agree with what others are saying. I also called the customer support after 30 mins of holding and then talking with someone (answering the same questions over and over) I hung up. Horrible! Waste of time and money.
no matter if I exfoliate my skin or pre moisten it this lotion cakes up and leaves white chunks on face. not worth the money. the spf15 is better
"Purchased this instead of the usual Daily Moisturizer Ultra Calming SPF 15 thinking it would be a better formula. I was wrong. Leaves a think white residue on the skin. Strong, patfume scent. Causes my skin to break out"
This is a great skin care product that I discovered 8 years ago. I had rosacea and this was more affordable than prescription creams. The cream with the face wash are great and gentle on skin.
i love aveeno because they have great products for sensitive skin. it's non greasy and does not irritate my skin. it keeps my skin very moisturized even in the winter
This Aveeno Product provides my skin with the moisture it needs and also gives my skin the protection it needs when I go hiking on weekends. This is a great quality product for my picky and sensitive skin.
I put on my face and it leaves a white looking film and seems heavy. I love the Calming SPF 15 but this one is disappointing. is it suppose to be like that?
"I've used aveeno ultra calming for years. It's my go to spring, summer, winter, fall lotion. It's light, non greasy, has spf. I've got super sensitive skin and I simply love the way my face feels after using it."
"I suffer from mild rosacea, amplified with stress and allerghies. This moisturizer helps me keep it in check, and my skin looks even and smooth even with no makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this a month ago and the pump on the bottle broke within days of opening it, so that now I have to take the top off in order to use it. Mineral sunscreen is also very thick and leads to breakouts, though that could be a personal reaction. Wish the bottle worked so that I could use it more easily"
The description states that this is a fragrance-free moisturizer. It in fact has a strong perfume-y smell (which is aggravating my allergies) and sits on top of the skin in a sticky layer. It is also irritating to my face.
"Judging from the other recent reviews, this is a common experience. Massive waste of money."
I absolutely LOVE this product. Aveeno has always been high on my list of favorite beauty products and this is definitely a staple in my daily routine. AVEENO ULTRA CALMING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 30 is fantastic for hydrating my skin all day while keeping
me safe from UV Rays.
I love how well it went on with our making my skin feel sticky or tacky. Worked well into my skin. And I noticed a difference in my face it's less red and irritated then before. I definitely feel like it rebalanced my skin. The smell was good to which is always a plus [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Aveeno® Ultra-Calming® Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 helped me reduce the redness of my cheeks. My skin had become very sensitive and dry after using topical acne creams so I was in search of a cream to calm my irritated skin. I'm glad that I found Aveeno® Ultra-Calming® Daily Moisturizer SPF 30. I received it from home tester club. So far this cream is doing great job on my skin. It moisturises and also had SPF in it which is good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought it was really great. Had a subtle smell that I liked. It smelled slightly like sunscreen but not overpowering at all. It was thick but not sunscreen thick. It took a little more rubbing in than a typical moisturizer but it's worth the SPF benefits. I would definitely recommend and will be using as part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this sunscreen. I use it only on my face and neck. It does not burn my eyes like so many others do to me.
Love this product. I have rosacea and this defenatly helps with calming it and as soon as I put it on my face it feels much better.
I really like this aveeno! It keeps my face feeling fresh and clean!! Also it leaves my face so soft I jus love ut
I recommend this product. Especially if you have sensitive or red skin. Aveeno products are excellent!! This product reduced my redness and didn't flare up my sensitive skin. An absolute must have.
I love this Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer. It works so well on my face and keeps it smooth and calm. I also love the SPF30 right in the cream!
"I often have dry, Rosy cheeks and this moisturizer works well to take care of that for me. I also love that it has an SPF of 30 in it. This also works as a moisturizer before applying foundation."
"I really enjoyed this product. I have sensitive skin and was worried this might be too heavy or irritating, but it was neither of those things. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like that the smell isn't too strong and it is very moisturizing without being oily. It's a definite pulse that it has spf too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! It isn't too thick, makes my skin soft without being oily, and is easy to use. The built-in SPF is awesome as well, I often overlooked that part of my daily routine until I started using this product, now it's one less thing I have to worry about."
"When I first tried this product I absolutely fell in love. Ever since then, I have used it nonstop. Its definitly my favorite product to keep my facial dry skin at bay and since its a sunscreen on top ofit helpinf with dry skin, its great for summer time and winter. I already recommend this product to everyone"
"I love this lotion! It does what it claims. Calms redness and soothes my sensitive skin. I love that it's lightweight for daily use under makeup, fragrance free, and provides great sun protection. I use this with the Ultra Calming Gel Cleanser, also by Aveeno. Really helps my acne prone skin!"
"I've used this moisturizer for many years now, and I love that it has SPF protection-without being too heavy or greasy, and it has very little fragrance. I have pretty sensitive skin, and it does not irritate me. It works particularly well in the winter,"
"to help sooth chapped, dry skin."
"I have used and am currently using the facial wash not the moisturizer, I love the facial wash, it doesn't leave my face filmy, red, itchy, dry, it feels softer, lighter, and cleaner. I feel its a gentle facial wash. I love it and did not know about the"
"moisturizer and now I want to purchase it to see if I get the same effects. I would expect a light moisturizer with a softness and light fragrance, I can't wait.!!"
"When summer time rolls around and it'd time to start protecting my skin from the rays, I use Aveeno Ulta Calming Moisturizer with spf 30. It's so soft on your skin, has a nice clean gentle fragrance, protects your face from the dangers of the sun, and"
"leaves skin feeling soft and clean long after applying. Lasts for hours, and super easy to use. I absolutely recommend this product!"
"I came across this product because I remember my mom telling me that I need to use sunscreen on my face. I know Aveeno is a well known brand that is good for eczema so I went and tried this out. I fell in love with it because it is fragrance free, you"
"have an spf of 30, and it is good for sensitive skin."
"Its a very lightweight effective face moisturiser, that actually does what it says & reduces redness. I am a dairy farmer & at times I get windburn. Other moisturisers can sting & make my face shiny which emphasises the redness! Aveeno calming moisturiser is perfect. My only complaint is finding it in shops, the seem to have all other Aveeno products except the calming one."
"I bought this as an alternative to the Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer (spf 30) because that product has become too strongly scented. :( Unfortunately this misses the mark big-time. I'd prefer it not be all mineral if J&J isn't going to ease the product application. It goes on very pasty and it is very difficult/impossible to blend in, prefer to pay more than deal with this. Needs help but hey, it's unscented!"
"I really enjoy Aveeno moisturizers. This product provides hydration without leaving your skin feeling oily. I always use this first before applying my makeup. It's great for keeping my face soft and smooth all day. This product is very soothing, I definitely like the calming variety! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This wasn't a terrible product, but it wasn't great. After applying, my skin would feel sticky all day long. I had a very very bad hormonal breakout, and while I don't think this product was the cause, this product did not help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Aveeno ultra calming daily moisturizer SPF 30 was very easy to apply to the skin. It left my skin feeling soft and relaxed. It applied easily and dried up real quick. Plus it smelled really good jut like all Aveeno items. I was happy this moisturizer had an spf of 30. Even with it having spf thw moisturizer didn't feel heavy on my skin. I recommend this product to anyone looking for something new try it you will love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed this product. It was great for my dry winter skin and has also been good as the season is changing to spring and we are getting warmer days. It def has helped relieve a lot of dryness and flakiness in some of my problem areas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After trying Aveeno ultra calming dial moisturizer I can't say that I was to impressed by it. I was not a fan of the lingering heaviness that I felt on my face. I did like the locking top though and the fact Sun protection was apart of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoy this product. My skin feels renewed after using this. Also what is great about this product is that it has SPF 30 which not many moisturizers don't carry SPF. I always want to protect my skin against the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was impressed with the sample of Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 that I received. I have extremely sensitive skin that gets irritated by many of the moisturizers I've tried, but did not from this. I would recommend this to friends and family that also have sensitive skin like mine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this moisturizer! My face felt super smooth and hydrated all day. plus, I love that it has sunscreen in it as well to protect y face from sun damage. This is definitely going to replace my current moisturizer! I have also shared with my mom and she loves it as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Aveeno Ultra Calming is a light fragrance free moistuzer with SPF 30. It is a wonderful product for those with senestive skin as well. This product is fast absorbing and very norusing for dry skin. Not only is it a light moistuzer its also considered a mineral sunscreen. Its a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer has become a staple in my daily skin routine. It is lightweight and moisturizing without making my skin feel greasy or oily throughout the day. I'm so happy that this contains SPF 30, because my previous daily moisturizer did not. Now I feel relieved that my skin is protected each day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love the Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF30. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. It is an amazing moisturizer and knowing that it has SPF 30 in it adds even more reasons to love it. After the sample I received is gone I will be purchasing more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my first time using a product like this, and I was surprised! I have some redness in my cheeks and using this before my primer and makeup has really suppressed the flushed look! However, I do have combination oily skin, and I have noticed that my t-zone gets more oily quicker when I use this product. Overall, great product! But this is something I will probably only use in the winter months, so I don't get as shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not like this product I have really dry skin and every time I put this on, which I tried out for a week it seemed to dry my face not moisturize. I understand that it has spf in it, but it was really thick to me and when I would rub it in there was like a white residue left behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I fell in love with Aveeno ultra calming daily moisturizer. And it's a plus that it has a sunscreen spf 30. My skin is pale and sun and age was damaging it little by little. And this moisturizer is easy to apply and has no fragrance. I've had no reaction to it and my skin is sensitive and this has been wonderful so far. I like using it with no make-up. It feels weird with make-up so I go natural when I have this on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed this moisturizer because of the ultra calming part. I have severe dry skin and it gets so bad it hurts and this moisturizer has helped take the redness out and smooth it out plus protect it from the wind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing I noticed about this product was the strong odor of rubber. I definitely did not want to put this product on my face, but I did. This product does not feel right on my face and my skin is a combination of dry and oily. After an hour or so I wanted to wash it off because my face felt so wrong. I was also turned off by the long list of ingredients in this product. I will definitely be sticking with my Neutrogena product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer for almost a whole month and I absolutely love it!!! Love how you DO NOT smell the SPF(sunscreen) in it. Feeling is light and hydrates my skin, great for under my makeup or on a day without any. Wore no makeup just the moisturize one day and was out side over 3 hours (72 degrees) and it protected my skin. Believe I finally found a product that is gentle enough for my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved experiencing the Aveeno Ultra-calming Daily Moisturizer. I dont have sensitive skin but i always prefer frangrance-free products. It moisturizes and protects me from the sun. It has natural ingredients like oats which is soothing for my skin and good for my conscience. I would reccommend to all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I love Aveeno, I wasn't into this product. The Aveeno Ulta-Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 has a pleasant scent. However, the moisturizer went on a tad too thick for my preference. The moisturizer left my face inflamed due to my rosacea. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Initially I really enjoyed this lotion. It is very calming and feels great on the skin when you first apply it. However, after a couple of hours, my face felt a little bit more oily than normal. Overall I wouldn't say that it was the worst SPF lotion I ever used, but it also wasn't my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this! It makes my skin feel moisturized and i have been putting this on right after i wash my face each morning as a moisturizer before i put my makeup on. I love this and it does not irritate my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given the ultra calming daily moisturizer spf 30 for testing purposes.. I overall wasn't to pleased with the product, I did give my skin some moisture but as I applied it had a burning sensation, that I couldn't have it on for to long.. I probably would recommend to others, my only down fall was that it would burn my skin while it was applied on. Otherwise I had no other issues with the product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This truly is lightweight and made for sensitive skin like mine! I love the SPF 30 in it as well! I don't need to double up on both moisturizer and sunscreen anymore. This is all in one! And the biggest plus for me is that it's fragrance free and doesn't leave an unpleasant white tint on my skin! Love this and will continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this stuff! I have always wanted to try this moisturizer but was hesitant because of the price, and I didn't know if it would work well with my skin. Now I am pleased to say, this is a great all around moisturizer. Goes on smoothly and I feel it soak in my skin, not just sit on top. I have super dry skin due to eczema and this didn't irritate my skin and worked great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Aveeno Ultra-calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 worked really nicely for my face and skin. My face felt hydrated and soft after each use. I would definitely recommend this and I plan on getting it again once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product is very light and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving a greasy film. My skin feels soft, moisturized and I feel confident and protected with the SPF30. Also, love it not having a fragrance. It has quickly become my favorite morning product beside my coffee. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Obsessed! I've been looking for a good moisturizer for my skin and I have found it. You automatically feel the moisture on your skin. It leaves a small tacky texture but with your primer on top of it. Your face will look amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As a daily moisturizer I wouldn't recommend this. There are a few reasons why I wouldn't recommend this. First off it's quite heavy on the face and doesn't feel comfortable at all. Also it says it's fragrance free but it definitely has a scent to it. And lastly it has been drying out my face and looks almost flakey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face is overly dry all the time. I was using a loreal moisturizer but it was runny and didn't moisturize very well. This Aveeno moisturizer is thicker and leaves my face feeling very moist! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so excited to try Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizer because I'm a huge fan of the brand and their products. Unfortunately this specific product didn't work well with my skin. It caused a lot of dryness, flaking and peeling, and wouldn't dissolve into my skin easily. It basically left white residue all over, it was too thick of a cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a big fan of Aveeno products, and this so far has been a life saver during the cold winter months. My face has been so irritated by the cold and in combination with the calming cleanser, this daily moisturizer is giving my face life again. I love that there is 30 spf included in this because I can just mix some foundation and this lotion and have a quick bb cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very irritated and dry skin, so I decided to give this a try. I used this for a couple weeks and saw no improvement. My skin is still red, dry, irritated, and now I'm breaking out. I would not recommend this moisturizer to anyone. it's over priced and did not help at all! This product is a waste of money!"
I like the way my skin feel after using this product. I find my skin is soft and moisturized throughout the day. I like that it contains 30 SPF which provides protection from the harmful UV rays of the sun. I would definitely recommend the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I recived the Aveeno. Free to review from home testers clud and I was thinking spf or moisturiser never thought of both in one. Very light scented and works great on my face plus sun protection. I wished there was no white cast left over after rubbing in but I loved the softness of a lotion without a dry down which seems to happen to my skin with certain lotions. Glad I found something different thats work more than one way. Thanks home testers clud. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very concerned about skin care products but wanted to find one which would be the perfect for me. Hopefully, this Aveeno ultra-calming moisturizer is that one. Right now, I feel that it keeps my skin very soft. When I apply a small portion of the cream on my body, I feel a comfort, soft touch. I keep using it and would be happy to find more benefits from it. It also helps against sun perfectly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was searching for a moisturizer with SPF included to provide an extra barrier on my face under my SPF foundation. I love that Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer calms sensitive skin, as I have a problem with my skin break out with certain products. This moisturizer is the perfect size to take on trips when traveling and after applying it has a very light feel to it. I will definitely buy this moisturizer to continue using after finishing this bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product really does help. My face has spot that are really dry in the winter after washing my face. I put this on and it moisturizes the dry spot.

I love the light airy smell of the product. I used this after washing my face in the evening. It is a moisturizer that you can feel go right into the skin without it making your skin feel greasy. It leaves your skin feeling very soft and refreshed. I love that it has SPF 30 in it to go about my day and not worry much about the sun. I would highly recommend this moisturizer to anyone looking for a product that is light and not going to make your skin feel like it went through a grease gun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

What I like most about Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 is that its fragrance free. I get really angry winter skin and fragrances irritate my skin. This is also very lightweight for being an SPF 30. I know I can always trust an Aveeno product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very happy to have Aveeno Aveeno Ultra‑Calming Daily Fragrance‑Free Moisturizer. It is not heavy at all- unusual for a high SPF and absorbs into the skin well. It is a nicely balanced product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Best moisturizer! This moisturizer has made me skin feel so smooth and soft. It got rid of most of my redness and aveeno is so amazing for sensitive skin!

"I really loved this Aveeno Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 30! It's a great facial moisturizer that didn't irritate, or break out my sensitive skin. This definitely helped reduce redness as well. Great product to moisturize your face, especially if you have sensitive skin like me. I recieved this complimentary from Home Tester Club for testing purposes only. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Aveeno's Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 did well in calming my sensitive skin and reducing redness. You can tell it has sunscreen in it by the greasy like feeling it has.

"I love the Aveeno Ultra Calming Moisturizer. It keeps my skin soft and provides some sun protection. Best of all, it does not irritate my VERY sensitive skin. Most other facial products make me break out, but this moisturizer soothes instead. I highly recommend this moisturizer if you have very sensitive, acne-prone skin. I also love this because it soothes my redness which is also something i have struggled with for a very long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As i received my product i lived ghe packaging of it. Its just a bottle with a pump for easier application. Its a daily moisturizer with spf 30. The consistency of the product is creamy and whipped like it is very soft and refreshing on the face. And blends really fast, taking to mind it has spf and that sometimes leaves white patches or its hard to blend the white into the skin, but not with this cream. This avenoo moisturizer doesnt have that problem. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Aveeno ultra
"Calming daily moisturizer yesterday. I literally washed my face at that moment, just so I could try it out! This moisturizer left my face feeling soft also super hydrated.

No joke! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is such a great daily moisturizer for any skin type. It is so gentle on the skin and feels very lightweight. I love that it has SPF in it that way I don't have to apply any extra. The product states that it is fragrance-free but it still has a very light fragrance to it but it is a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This facial lotion Ultra Calming by Aveeno is excellent. It sinks in does not cause any irritation and is soothing also. I love that it has SPF 30.

It smells really good which is always fab! It glides onto the skin perfectly. I feel that it gives a good balance of moisture and protection. It's also great value for money. It does not irritate my skin at all as promised. It really does give me a sense of calm [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer it is amazing it helps my skin be balanced, and I love that it has an SPF 30. This is a great product for sensitive skin types. I also love how it has an amazingly calm feeling on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. My skin isn't as sensitive as some others, but it's sensitive enough to be negatively affected by a lot of products. This product is soothing and doesn't dry out my skin. I should mention that my skin is on the oily side, so I don't know what it would do to dry skin."
It's definitely worth a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Went on smoothly, but has a sunscreen like smell to it. I tried this before bed, and it made my skin feel oily by morning. I have tried Aveeno Positively Radiant and loved it though, so it's hit and miss with my skin. But, this is still a great product, it was wonderful on my husband's extremely dry skin.

"I thought this Daily Moisturizer was more like sunscreen for your face only. This is really heavy to be my daily moisturizer. Also, it left my face feeling oily/greasy. I would use this at the beach or if I was going to be in the sun all day. However, for my daily moisturizer I would not use this, it is too heavy for my skin and it clogged my pores.

After I put the moisturizer on for the 1st time it kind of made my face feel a little bit of a burning sensation but it didn���t last more than a minute or so. After the burning sensation was gone my face got used to it & i actually really likes the moisturizer. I was extremely happy that by the end of the day my face was not greasy at all which is usually what happens when I use any moisturizer. I will most likely be purchasing this once the one I recieved runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
