I use it daily after my shower. Softens and smooths my skin better than others I have tried
"I've used Oil of Olay for 40 years. I started using it because it was pink and sounded exotic. I kept using it because it made my skin feel like silk and I wont give it up now because I'm 53 and I look good. No, I look great. almost wrinkle free and glow, glow ,glow ,glow."
"I am about to turn 50 in January and it is currently November. Needless to say I've tried my fair share of moisturizers!! This one has been by far 100% better than all of the previous ones I've used in the past. The non-greasy, fast absorbing moisturizer has the best results ever. The overall brightness and pore reducing looks have allowed me to forgo any cover up, foundation, or powder! I've reduced my makeup bag by removing three products!"
"I have used oil of Olay products for 50 years, and found this product fantastic. I had a dry patch on my forehead, and this worked within two days I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for, so buy oil of Olay and save yourself the time and money."
"I love this product, it is my favorite moisturizer by far. I have tried many but this one works best for me and doesn't have a heavy feeling when applied. Also doesn't clog my pores. Easy to apply, fantastic pump bottle and doesn't take a lot to cover completely."
I usually never write reviews about products but i had to for this product I had uneven sun tan on my nose from my glasses and i hated how it looked so I decided to try this product and my skin is already starting to show evenness all over after only using it for 3 days!!! I dab a little under my eyes every morning and night and I dont even wake up with bags as bad as i did this product really does what it says
It really smoothes the skin. I have sensitive acne prone skin and i have not had any negative reaction to it. One minor issue for me is that it has fragrance and the amount is reallg small.
"I loved total effects anti aging/ anti blemish product, which is no longer available. So the web site told me if i loved that product, then i would love the total effects daily moisturizer..... The scent is overwhelming!!! I am very sensitive to fragrance, and had to wash it off immediately. Olay, please bring back the anti aging/ anti blemish product!!!!!!!!"
"Using Oil of Olay since I was 20 has helped me with my aging process. I am often thought to be much younger than I am. It is a wonderful product that does not clug pores. It is very important to people with sensitive, or dry skin and moisturizes your skin for hours, and never greasey . Will not stain clothing and makes you look young and viberant."
"I like Olay Total Effects moisturizer. It blends well with my natural skin tone and has helped the overall appearance of my skin. The problem is the packaging. Sometimes it blobs out and there is no way to ""put it back."" There is no way of telling that it is almost gone and there is no warning that you are running low. So, this morning, I'll be going to work with no foundation."
I have a problem with brown spots and uneven color. Total effects has minimized both. I am very pleased and will let others know.
It's too greasy. After applying it felt uncomfortably oily.
This product got high rating by paying the reviewers. Please stay away from this product or else u will end up with a burnt skin or pimply face. The strong chemical used are not suitable for normal skin also.
"I like the smell and how it feels when it goes on. But as far as seeing lines go away and helping with brown spots, have not seen a difference. I have had this I believe for a week."
When I use this moisturizer you can almost hear my skin go Ahhhhh! It feels so great when it goes on and I love the nongreasy feel that it leaves on my skin. My makeup goes on flwlessly after I use this moisturizer.
"This worked really well under makeup and as a night cream. It helped the appeareance of wrinkles, especially the crow's feet around the eyes. I would highly recommend it."
"I use a 2 serums and 2 creams from the department store! I have used this off and on but today I made the switch. I want something fast and easy that does what it says. It does take the place of serums, treatments etc. Will be using this for a long time!"
"I have used Total Effects Moisturizer for two days. I am 59 years old and have used very expensive brands in the past. This product is a fresh breath of air. Puffiness 50% gone. Skin tone and texture perfect. Correct amount of moisture-giving properties. The old saying, ""less is more"" is totally true with this product."
"After ending chemotherapy my skin was extremely dry and nothing seemed to work. I started using the Olay Total Effects 7 fragrance free and just after one application i noticed a big difference on my skin appearance. My skin looks much better and healthy now. I found what I needed, Thanks!!!"
Too light for my needs but would work for someone who does not want a more hydrating moisturizer. Absorbs well and quickly
"I am a middle aged woman and I found it did not help with my skin dryness. So, I will be going back to a moisturizer that works better."
Just started using this. Thrilled with the results and the feel on my face it gives. Like silk and doesn't feel greasy at all.
"i have been using olay since i was 20 years old . i have tried several different products and nothing worked for me like olay. no one cao ever guess my age, so thats why i stuck to olay, i called it my baby. thank you olay. ilove you."
Product very effective at doing what it says it will do - reduce the 7 signs of aging. Noticed my skin looked brighter...better. Worth the money spent!
"I use a lot of Olay products but I am very disappointed in Olay Total Effects. I don't like the way it feels on my skin. It's heavy and greasy and makes my hands feel dirty. I'm willing to put up with having to wash my hands if I saw results, but I saw no visibleresults"
"I've been using it since i was 20 and now i am 22 and it is amazing, it smells nice and works effectivley , but i don't like its texture i think it is little bit thick i prefer gel-like texture , and i had a concerns latelly about the suitable age , should i use an anti aging product while i am still 22 ? And if not what is the suitable age ?"
"These were the first cleanser that ever worked for me, I have very sensitive skin and always had to trade off between having clear looking skin that quickly got too dry or skin that never looked clear. The cleansing cloths were wonderful and my heart is broken that they've gone the way of the dodo. Why oh why?"
I am in my 30's and still have combination skin but also skin sensitivity. This product is the only one I can use morning and night and it doesn't make me break out and it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily and it makes my skin feel soft and not dry or tight. I find it's a perfect consistency and I wouldn't want it any other way
I have been using Olay since I was 15 years old and Olay Complete is my lotion of choice. I decided to try something different now that I am older (I won't say how much older!) and my skin has changed a bit. But I am not a fan of this product. It feels very cakey and sticky on my face. You have to be careful not to rub it on too much or it will clump up. It feels like it is sitting on my skin instead of soaking in. I will stick with my Olay Complete!
"If this product is oil free, why doesn't it say so on the product container? Is it oil free? or non-pore clogging (can't remember the phrase)? l used the 1.7 oz moisturizer, didn't buy again. Don't really remember why, maybe the cost or maybe blackheads came back. I can ONLY use oil free products. I hope this is, if so I will buy it again."
I was very excited to try this because I've always liked other Olay products. What a disappointment! The first time I put it on my face I wound up washing it off within an hour because it made my face feel uncomfortably tight and sticky. Today just tried it on my neck and chest and as soon as I'm done writing this I will go and wash it off for the same reasons. Would not recommend this product.
"I've been on Oil of Olay since I was young. Even thought I will be ""48"" this year, I look like I'm in my mid ""30's"". I have oily skin, which can be a real struggle. I use this as my morning routine with my Oil of Olay facial wash. Face, neck, and chest area. The neck and chest age as well."
"I tried the trial size first & got hooked almost immediately. It only takes a few days to notice the effectiveness of this product. My skin is smoother, brighter, more moisturized & overall better. I have incredibly sensitive skin & I tolerate this product very well."
"Without hesitation, I purchased I gave this a try. I use OLAY soaps in my daily routine and I have never been disappointed. I have been using this product for over a week now and my face has gotten so dry. I do struggle with combination skin, but this has not helped in the slightest. I have even felt a slight stinging feeling when applying the moisturizer. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I am beyond disappointed."
"I'm always on the look out for moisturizer that feels great on my skin, is lightly perfumed, and actually makes my skin feel wonderful. I tried the sample size and I'm back to buy the larger size. :D I rarely leave ratings, but this one deserves it. It's like a mid-weight cream and applies smoothly. After application...omg, my face feels fantastic. Smooth, non-greasy. It doesn't feel heavy and feels like a much more expensive cream. Try it. :D"
"It feels and smells great.I liked using it every day. The value is exceptional.I would recommend it and plan to keep using Olay products. This cream does what it advertises.This cream is the best. Very ,very VERY GOOD .IT HAS MANY beneficial QUALITIES.I REALLY LIKED IT."
It is a good product but not for everyone. It is to heavy for some and you don't have enough information about the product before you buy to know this. Olay is a good company I just feel that it is very difficult to decide which one of there face lotions to use.
I've been using Olay products for years now & get compliments. Turned many friends onto it. When I couldn't afford it I noticed a huge difference!!! Now I scrafice to keep Olay always! Stocked up so I wouldn't run out! Also I've sensitive skin & Olay is all I can use. Just love their products!!!
Leaves you skin soft a smooth helps wrinkles.The product smells refreshing and leaves you face feeling silky smooth. Great base for makeup because of the silky-smooth texture it makes your skin your makeup goes on to easy and last all day. Oil of play has been scientifically prove to be the best skin products over more expensive brands.
"Mom has used this moisturizer for years! I tried introducing her to more expensive brands, but she always goes back to this one. It doesn't break out her face like some other ones she's tried. It smells good and it's light weight. Oh, and her face looks great too=)"
"I moved 1,000 miles across the country and my new environment has really been wrecking havoc on my skin. I had bought a bottle of Total Effects a long time ago, but never really used it... But, I picked it up again once I started noticing how horrible my skin felt. I'm so glad I picked up that bottle again! All the weird dry patches have gone away! This product really does feel lovely on your skin... Hoping I'll see some other results with continued use."
"A friend gave me this moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. I've used and liked olay products in the past. I am currently using the skin brightening cleanser and this moisturizer twice a day ( I use serum twice a day, as well ). I have combination skin, prone to breakouts. This product absorbs quickly. It seems to have evened out my complexion in just two weeks. Great product!"
"I was really happy to be able to try Olay Total Effects, and I've liked it a lot. To be honest, I haven't really noticed a difference in my skins appearance, but that could just be because I have young looking skin to start with. This is a very nice moisturizer though, it has a nice light scent, it feels nice and smooth on the skin, absorbs fast, leaving my face shine free. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a lovely nourishing cream, that will leave your skin feeling soft for hours! I really enjoyed using this product out over the past month. My skin feels and even looks firmer and brighter. The scent was a little strong at first, but I got used to it within a couple of days, and now I actually enjoy it. I may only be 30 now, but I believe this is the time to start taking care and taking some preventative action for my skin! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've been using it for almost a month and did noticed some improvements in my face. It is moisturizing but without that greasy feeling that's usually apparent in night creams. I like the fact there are vitamins in it -- a somewhat new concept to me since the moisturizers I've used in the past had no such vitamins. I'm not too big with face moisturizers but I thought this Olay Total Effects went pretty well for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"i got this as a free trial to try , i did not like this product at first i used the very last bit of it though so that i would give it a chance , well after i ran out i noticed how dry y face was without it and cant wait to go out and buy some (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects, a product that lives up to its claims. The dark circles under my eyes were reduced significantly and while the fine line around my eyes are non-existent, I believe the unique vitamin complex is akin to the old saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. A little goes a long so be sure to use it sparingly. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
It was an awesome product that I guarantee will make you look younger and your skin softer it made my skin tone even out and I started seeing results in about a week. I got a lot of compliments on my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
my mother always said when you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all. maybe I have tried other creams and I'm comparing them to this one and maybe its not fair but when I tried it I could feel the dryness effect of the alcohol or soap that it carries. I tried to find out what ingredients it had but I could find out. in other words I was disappointed with the results it didn't leave my skin feeling nourished and it made my skin feel dry afterwards. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
The Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Anti Aging Moisturizer smells so good. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. It isn't heavy or sticky either. I have sensitive skin and it didn't cause any adverse reactions or make me look greasy like some moisturizers. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"My skin is definitely on its way to moving on up. With a usually uneven skin tone, it has been a pleasant surprise to see that things are looking more even and brighter. Fine lines also seem to be improving because of the unique vitamin complex that has been introduced to it recently. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have noticed subtle changes in my skin since I started using Olay Total Effects a few weeks ago. I think my fine lines have been reduced, my skin tone is more even, skin seems firmer and it's definitely moisturized. The cream absorbs easily and is not greasy. I will continue to use Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have seen some improvement in my skin tone and my face feels moisturized. I like Olay Total Effects. I have been using it everyday for a few weeks now. I will continue to use it and tell others about it. It has a pleasant, light scent, absorbs well and seems to be doing what it claims to do! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects is amazing. It smells amazing, and leaves my skin feeling silky smooth for 24 hours. The easy to use pump gives you just the right amount. The product is not greasy and absorbs quickly, leaving behind a super smooth surface rather than sticky like some products. I definitely recommend Olay Total Effects to anyone!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Not sure if Olay Total Effects made me look up to 10 yrs younger, but I definitely love the way my skin looks and feels Initially, due to my eczema, I was somewhat reluctant to try a new, ""unknown, unproven"" product on my face. My fears were quickly alleviated as my eczema did not flare up. Olay left my face feeling hydrated, which is an amazing feat - considering the bone chilling temperatures we have had lately. Awesome product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer definitely delivered. It promised to be a 7 in 1, and it was definitely that! Though I didn't find the moisturizing aspect enough, the rest was good. My skin was brighter, a better colour, smoother, etc. Definitely worth looking into as a regular buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"now that i find myself getting a little older i was worried my complection, But since i started to use Total Effects 7 it must of really did something for me . My boyfriend for just about 20 years actually noticed my skin. He said my skin is softer more smoother and asked if i was using anything different. For him to notice must of worked. I deffinitly will buy and keep using Olay Tolal Effects 7. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
this product will fight any anti-aging that you may have. You will see results within the first week. the touch and the feel of this cream is so velvety I love it. That is the first thing that I noticed when I first put the cream on my finger tips to put on my face. I am in the early stage of aging skin. I am always trying new products to achieve results in younger looking skin on my face. This is one product I will recommend and I am sure you will love it as well as I am now. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am in my 40's and blessed with a young look, except for some wrinkles that are starting to form. Olay to the rescue! After a few weeks of using the product, my skin has evened out in tone and my wrinkles have diminished! The product includes SPF 15, so I never have to worry about forgetting my sunscreen. It goes on smoothly, and the pump on the container delivers just the right amount of product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I dont feel like i really needs this yet, however, I do love the texture of the moisturizer. Feels amazing and seems to be working great!! (even though I dont need it :) ) I havent purchased this product so i am unsure of the value for the cost but I am liking it so far. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this is an amazing product! I had dark spots around my eyes and it helped to get rid of them Also my face and neck became a lot softer and smoother with each use of it. And my skin tone is a lot more even And it's not a bad price for it and I really like Olay products (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I loved this product! It felt great on my skin and didn't cause any irritation. I could see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes too, which was great! Will recommend this product to friend and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I did not know what to expect when I started OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I tried it and after a few days I noticed how my skin had smoothed out, the dry spots disappeared, the fine lines started disappearing and made me look and feel younger. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I thought it was very greasy and didn't feel good on my skin. It didn't take long for me to break out all over from it. It feels to heavy and I didn't notice any improvements. I tried it for a week. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think the olay 7 in 1 anti aging works very well and i did notice that some fine lines on my face had faded which is awesome. I think most olay products works well ive never had an issue. This product is easy to use and doesnt leave your face greasy it leaves it with a mild glow as i put it. I will be telling everyone to purchase this product or at least try it to see the difference it makes.Will be buying again forsure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Is glorious! Makes my skin smooth but not oily. Smells good too :) My new go-to moisturizer for life!! Time will tell how the anti-aging aspect works out but experience with Olay has me feeling very optimistic. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I enjoyed using this moisturizer. It smelled great and applied smooth and silkily. It was easily absorb into my skin. It moisturized nicely and shrink a few pores. I liked that it didn't make my skin feel greasy after. More time maybe needed to see if it works for its other claims like minimizing fine lines & enhances brightness (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Not quite sure if it was this product or just a bad diet in general, got a zit while using this. other then that, it went on nice, easy to absorb, i think it did shink a pore or two and didn't go on greasy. I liked it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The very first time I tried this product, I felt a my skin got little softer and brighter but as days passed I started noticing that my skin started to get itchy. At that time I had to stop the further usage of Olay Total Effects . I guess this product is not made for my oily skin type. I can recommend this product for the people who have dry skin as one of friend tried it on and it suited her really well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I have noticed my skin feels better, smoother, and healthier. I don't appear to have a tired look, someone even complimented me on how youthful I look. :) if you are looking for a product that doesn't feel heavy on your face, and that makes your skin healthier I suggest you give OLAY total effects 7 in 1 a try. :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have always really liked Olay products and this one is exceptional as well. I love how little you need to cover your entire face and neck. It has a great scent and goes on silky smooth. It has been a really dry winter and I noticed that this lotion really helped lock in moisture all day long. I do not have many wrinkles so couldn't tell if it did anything for them, but then again that's why I'm using it, too prevent aging. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Well I was excited to try this product but sadly I had a bad reaction to it & broke out in a bad rash! So I had to stop using it :( I have never had issues in the past with Olay products & I will still purchase from the brand but not this particular product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I actually waited to get the results after use. I did notice that it did give a nice glow and smoothness to my dull skin. It didn't make my wrinkles disappear totally but it did make my skin look firm and moisturized. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This was a great lotion for pampering my skin and keeping it soft and smooth. I have slightly oily, acne prone skin, and this is perfect for nourishing my skin with making me break out. It is perfect for using as a night cream because it does not have spf. The immediate and long term effects are amazing. My skin is smoother than it has been in a long while. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this moisturizer is amazing! I have been using this Olay product for almost six weeks and I love it. I am 44 years old and I have pretty dry skin especially in the winter and I am impressed with how hydrated and smooth my skin feels. This moisturizer feels light on my face, the scent is not overpowering and the pump delivers the perfect amount. My skin tone looks even and my laugh lines seem to be less defined. I will definitely continue to use this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Absolutely love this product and will continue to buy it. I have nothing negative at all to say about it. I love the way it feels on my skin has a nice fragrance, isnt sticky dries quickly. My mother has always used olay products growing up and now that I am grown up I am doing the same and I can see why. I definitely have gotten a better complexion overall from using olay and my skin feeling more firm and brighter making me happier! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"If any of you have noticed my skin, its really bad. I was able to try OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free from BzzAgent. It has made such a difference. I have no more redness, dryness or blemishes. I also have skin that looks really great! I would recommend this product hands down over anything else Ih ave ever used. This included expensive department store creams. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using a lot of different moisturizes and night creams as the season goes from fall to winter. As winter has been nicer than normal but it still dries my skin out very badly. This was the best week trial yet as I put on the Olay Total effects 7-in-1 anti aging moisturizer, my face felt terrific. It was so smooth and soft and best of all those little lines around my eyes seem to be going away! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was nervous to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. Surely, a trial size wouldn't be enough to see 1 result on my skin, let alone 7, but I'm here to say that's exactly what it's done. My skin tone has a more even appearance, it feels bright and firm and it is extremely soft. I didn't think I could believe such a small bottle would have such a large impact on my skin, but I'm definitely heading out to buy a full size bottle! Thank you Olay. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I liked this stuff! The Smell is awesome and my face felt really soft. I use pro Active, so after I cleanse i need a really good cream that Replenishes the moisture my face needs.Works better than the pro active moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this is a great product! My skin looks overall better. I have an even tone and healthier looking skin. The product is very light and requires a small amount therefore goes a long way. it's silky smooth and has a really nice light scent. I have combination skin and find it does not leave a greasy feeling like most moisturizers I have tried. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"To say I loved OlayÂ® Total Effects is an understatement. I went and bought some before the sample was done. Within a week my pores were visibly smaller and I haven't suffered from my usual dry winter skin. This is my new brand, I won't go back to my old brand. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am really happy with this product. Since I have been using this I have noticed my fine lines haven't deepened, which is something I am conscious of. My skin also feels great. It feels moisturized. I also notice a glow as well. This works really well. I am noticing my red spots aren't as pronounced. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Recently I've been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer and i have to say that the new vitamin enriched formula is an dazzling sensation, not only does it make your skin younger and fresh but smooth and creamy as well! The new trial size formula is a wonderful way to start the new year off looking beautiful, stunning and exquisite. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Gives a good hydration (but haven't noticed any other benefits), skins feels great but I have had acne problems many times since I started using this product so I am now reluctant to using it since I am afraid that it is the cause of my acne outburst (I hadn't had that problem in a long time). (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I enjoyed the fact that's it's fragrance free. It wasn't oily or greasy. I really liked the silky texture. I really made my face soft and smooth. I used this morning and night. I was complimented that I looked ""fresh and bright"". I will buy more of this line. Thanks for the trial. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"being mid 30s its time to use those anti aging products, i tried the olay total effects for several weeks now and to my surprise my wrinkles got slightly less. i also like the scent of this product, it belongs into my daily routine now. my skin feels smoother then before and people made me compliments that i look younger. overall its a great product and im happy i could try it out.

I have been trying OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and I love how quickly it absorbs into my skin. It is leaving my skin feeling clean and fresh. It is moisturizing without making my skin greasy and my pores are definitely looking smaller. My skin is brighter - I didn't even realize how dull it was until I saw the difference. I have sensitive skin so I was wondering if it would cause blemishes but no problems at all. I will definitely keep using this. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this product sure does improve the look and feel of your skin. It made me look ten years younger than I am. People sure notice it too. They always ask what is my secret to youthful skin and I say Olay total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"i think since i have been using this it has smooth out fine lines, my skin look more even color, hides some pores. my skin feels firmer and not so try.so it has put more moisture in my skin has made my skin look younger and tighter good product will deffinatly buy it thanks bzz and olay (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have tried many different moisturizers over the years, many I don't like from the first time I try them. They are too greasy or have a strong scent. I loved the Olay moisturizer from the first time I tried it, the feel of this cream and soft and not greasy at all, no overpowering smells. I am a fan and definitely will be buying this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I totally love this product! I never stick to any regime with regards to my skin for very long, but I have used my Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 every day for the last few weeks and I love the relults. I like subtle changes where people know something is different but they don't know what it is. This product is one of those products for me and I totally love it!!!! Thank you Olay Total effects and BzzAgent for the opportunity to fall in love with this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is great and perfect for a person who is on the go. I used this product for 4 weeks. It had a nice texture and light scent. I usually have oily skin and have never used Olay products on my face. However this product was light on my face. I was not able to see a difference on my dark spots and uneven skin tone. I would definitely buy this product for travelling as it saves space and has all I need in one bottle. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really enjoyed using this product. It didn't have an odor to it which I dislike in most products. I felt that my skin was left smooth and hydrated without feeling greasy. I was a bit sceptical before using this product about Olay as I have never tried any Olay products before but I must say I am happy with the product and will continue purchasing it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Since I started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer four weeks ago, I have definitely been noticing a difference. My skintone seems more even and my face overall seems to be more hydrated for a longer period of time. Even my fine lines seem to be diminishing. Overall, I am very happy with this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"All in all I wasn't too impressed with this moisturizer. I found it to be fake and synthetic. I have tried better. If you're looking for a good moisturizer, keep looking. There's better fish in the sea! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think when you have trouble skin like me it is hard to find something that works all day, and continues working for everyday that you use it. Well Olay 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer does just that and more. I am no longer afraid to show my skin off, and no longer afraid to meet new people because my skin is no longer red and inflamed.

"I've been using this cream every day since the Bzz campaign started, focusing mainly on my forehead as that's the only place I have signs of 'aging'. I still have all the fine lines on my forehead, there's been no change. Maybe my skin isn't old enough to show a difference, I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend this based off my experiences. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think Olay 7 in 1 anti- aging moisturizer is one of the best for trouble skin. It helps you feel replenished and helps your skin feel soft and fantastic all day. It has the effect of several different creams all in one. It has helped with my rosacea, and has helped with outbreaks on my skin. In my opinion it is a god send, and Im not so self conscious to show off my skin in public. If you haven't tried it already, go and get yours today because it is fantastic!

"This product is great, I love everything about it! Theunique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone! Everybody comented on how great my skin looks, very happy I got the chance to try it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The scent is nice and mild. Worked great in clearing up my dry patches caused by the Alberta winter weather. After two uses I broke out in mild acne. I stopped using the product until my face cleared up then tried again......same result, acne! Because is could not use the product on a continuous time period I was not able to see the results that were expected. My results were that of acne. Will I purchase this product?.... No. However, it may work for others with less sensitive skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I found this product to be good. It had a great smell, went onto the skin nicely leaving my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. As for the anti aging I have not seen any drastic improvement in the alloted time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this is by far the best facial moisturizer that I have ever used and have already gone and purchased one for myself and my mother!. I love the fresh, clean scent as well as the way it leaves my skin feeling. The fine lines I was developing are already starting to decrease and I can feel the elasticity of my skin improving. I plan on using this product for a VERY long time. Thank you BzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Have been trying Olay 7 in 1 Total Effects Moisturizer for quite some time now. At the end of this campaign my skin is soft and supple and my fine lines have faded. The vitamin complex has helped fight the signs of aging leaving me feeling more confident in my own skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think that this works as a moisturizer. I didn't see much of an improvement in fine lines around my eyes. I'm not sure if I would purchase this particular product for fine line reduction. I would however purchase other olay products if they moisurize as good as this. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I used to use just regular Olay moisturizer. Since trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 my skin has looked so much smoother and clearer. I have bad acne scarring that is hard to cover with foundation. When I wear the new Olay moisturizer under my foundation, my skin looks younger and I feel more confident about myself. I will be using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 from now on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got my trial size and was a bit nervous since I have sensitive skin on my face. The morning after my shower I used total effects everyday, and within a couple days my friends were saying how my face looked brighter, smoother, and looked really healthy. I would definitely recommend this product to ANY LADY LOOKING FOR A YOUNGER NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
oil of Olay has been around since j was a young girl my grammas always said it's the secret to youth and I now believe her ð I cannot rave enough about this product my face feels amazingly smooth refreshed and youthful it's non greasy what more can we ask for ladies make this your daily routine and lose 10 years off your appearance ......I'm an oil of Olay believer ...and thanks for making my grammas look like she's in her 40's (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I should have taken a before picture before I started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer because I honestly haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines or skin tone. I did notice however that my skin was dry (could be the increase in winter-like weather) so I have had to supplement with my usual facial moisturizer. I do like the texture and mild fragrance of this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and honestly, by the end of the bottle I saw no significant difference in my skin appearance. I would not recommend this product or would go out and purchase this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love how the Olay total effects instantly feels refreshing as I put it on my face. The cream is light and airy. I don't get that grease or slick texture! My lines and bags are lightened and smoothed, I just wish we got a bigger bottle!#bzzagent #gotitfree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Okay made my skin soft. The product was not greasy. It made my skin soft and I didn't feel it clogged my pores. My skin was not oily afterwards either. It dried evenly and nicely. It also smelled nice at first when it was in the bottle. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use because half an hour after I would put the product on my skin, it would smell like rotten eggs. I guess it just didn't go with my skin type! Because of the smell I can't recommend the product to anyone else. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now. The difference in my skin and complexion is amazing! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to reduce the fine lines on their skin and have a more even skin tone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I did like the cream, but I have VERY dry skin and felt like it didn't keep my skin feeling smooth all day, you could see my dry skin after just a couple of hours and the more cream I put on the heavier it felt on my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Love the smooth effect this gives me when I put it on. Easy to absorb and a nice overall feel. My skin is moisturized and glowing the rest of the day. I would recommend it to others, along with other Olay products I use and love. Thanks Olay and Bzz Agent for letting me try it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
My skin has held up well against the cold Canadian temps since using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer. It feels smoother and there seems to be a fresh glow that wasn't there before. I suggested my mom to try it out and she is looking forward to trying it. Pleasant smelling and not oily! I'm definitely a fan. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Recently tried OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, and found it left skin soft and smooth. It has a pleasant fragrance( Can be bought fragrance free), but found it bothered my contact lenses even when being careful applying around the eye area. It absorbs fast and is easy to add to the daily beauty routine and would recommend it for anyone wanting to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and who wants to minimize the signs of aging. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have really been liking this sample of olay anti aging 7 in 1. My skin is softer and brighter with use. My wrinkles while still there are less deep and less noticable. You can feel it slightly tightening your skin after apllication. I dont have age spots so I can't speak on those but overall my face is more even toned and my pores are less visiable. I also find that it works great as a makeup base. Good job Olay. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have always been skeptical of products that promise to reduce your age appearance and such. I don't know if I look 10 years younger from using this product or not but I love how it definitely delivers on the promise to even out skintone and minimize pores. The small amount that needs to be used is great and it's not greasy or oily and goes on silky smooth. I will continue to use this and see if I can actually look 10 years younger. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think the chemicals in this product was to harsh for my skin. I would rather use a more pure product. That is good for me and my skin. This is something I would want to know before I bought the product. I used the product for a week and didn't like it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I loved this product so much that I asked my teens for more for Christmas. Super light and easily absorbed into my skin and easy to keep beside the bed for daily application. I can see a difference in my traditionally dry spots and my age freckles are less obvious than they were. I'm converted. My only comment is there is a slight smell which I find pleasant but someone with a scent sensitivity might need to try the fragrance free version. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think that from the product size I was given to try that I will positively be following up with a purchase of the product. While the size may not have been large enough to see the long term effects I have alot of interest in it. I love everything about it. From the way it goes on so smooth and light, the packaging, it has a nice aroma , feels great just before applying make up as well. I would like to see how after more use it diminishes age spots and wrinkles (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay has been a staple in my beauty arsenal for as long as I can remember. As a teenager I used to buy it because it the soap smelled so wonderful. I am glad that as I have gotten older Olay has continued to provide products that match my skin's stage. The unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. So now I can look like I still have young skin and be wise enough to know the secret to it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that the most noticeable difference I have seen since using Olay Total Effects is a more even skin tone. The darker areas seem lighter and the fine lines are smoother. The unique vitamin complex really does help fight the seven signs of aging. This product absorbed well into my skin without leaving it feeling oily or dry. Loved the trial size which is perfect when seeing if a product is right for you. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was really not a fan of this product. Being Olay, I expected so much more. I found my skin felt oily, and did not reduce fine lines, age spots or uneven skin tone. I DEFINATELY am back to my old product again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So much to love about this product! I ended up having to purchase a 2nd bottle! I used this under my make up or alone and it made my face feel smoother, softer and not greasy. I loved the smell - I'm sensitive to scent but this was light and nice! I've found that living up in the north my face is extra dry in the winter and this helps a lot! This moisturizer is long lasting and does a great job absorbing. It feels more hydrated! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have found that by using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, my wrinkles have become more invisible. I also got a friend to try it along with me and she had really deep wrinkles and we noticed how well it worked to make them not so deep. It didn't leave a greasy feeling on our face, that was a plus. It also has a nice scent. We are very satisfied with how well this anti-aging moisturizer works and will consider purchasing more for future use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product is amazing and leaves my skin feeling soft and amazing the unique vitamin complex helps fight the signs of aging like fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. I love Olay products and this new one that comes out in February is one I will be purchasing ð (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this product is not for sensitive skin. I found it too heavy on my skin. It made me break out the first time I tried it so I waited a while and tried it again. The same thing happened, I broke out. Not sure if it is the product itself or something in it that irritates my skin. I gave it 2 stars since it didn't work for me but it may be good for someone else, which I cannot judge. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that this product is perfect in every way. It doesn't have a strong overpowering fragrance to it and is not greasy. When being applied the cream layers on evenly and smoothly and is not gritty and leaves my skin feeling smooth and non-greasy. It really evened out my skin tone and just erased some of the imperfections in my skin. I will be going out to purchase the product and continue to use it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think that Olay Total Effects is a good everyday face cream. it didn't combat my winter skin dryness, nor did I see any significant reduction in wrinkles or skin firmness. If I used everyday religiously, it did seem to lighten a few sun spots I have on my face, but these seemed to reappear if I forgot to use it for a few days. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I noticed results right away in how youthful my face was!! the brightness in appearance was nice. In the coming weeks of using the product in my daily skin regiment the fine lines around my eyes diminished, and my skin tone was definitely more even. My pores are less visible and I am totally impressed with this product I will be using it in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product was nice, but it didn't have anything that was really different compared to all of Olay's other products. I used it for a couple of weeks, and there was a small difference, but nothing new compared to all the products I've tried. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this product. I have used various olay moistuizers for the past 20 years but am stuck on this one. It wasnt sticky but rather went on nice and smooth. My skin absorbed it immediately, there was no greasy residue which really sucks when putting your makeup on over it. It almost seemed like a pick me up as before putting in on my skin looks dehydrated and tired but looked refreshed after applying. I will definately purchase this moisturizer (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Since I started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have noticed that my skin tone has evened out. I think that I will be purchasing this cream and continue to use it. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it absorbs nicely. I also like that it does not leave my skin feeling greasy, which is important for my combination skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I felt this product was more for people with mature skin. I felt like I had a minor rash when I used it the first time. My skin took a few times to get use to it. But now the question is was it worth my time. Unfortunately it wasn't worth it because I didn't see the effect on my skin as of promised. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think the moisturizer was a good one. I am not sure it improved my seven signs of aging, but my skin felt smooth and I liked the smell of it. I had no reactions to the product and I would definitely use it if I had it on hand. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer is now one of my favourite moisturizers with my aging skin after 2 weeks i noticed my fine lines fading brighter glowing skin:) i apply this olay before applying my foundation and it makes my skin glow all day:) went out and purchased not 1 but 2 bottles so i always have it on hand my freinds have tried and are also raving about this product:) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love Oil of Olay products but I'm on the fence on this one. I like that it was light and not to heavy, it didn't clog my skin and the most important part was that it was not heavily scented. But not enough to tell if the effects on my skin. I would try it again though. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I used to use the original Oil of Olay years ago and I really liked it, but as I get older my skin is dryer and it seems I need a heavier moisturizer than the Total Effects 7 can offer. It's nice and light weight, very lightly scented, which I do like, but it absorbs fast and then my skin seems to feel even dryer for some reason (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Olay total Effects has taken an aging face and made some wonderful changes. It's hard to know where to start but lets begin with less wrinkles which every woman wants to see. I have also found that my skin tone has become more even making me feel younger and more youthful. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been quite ill over the past few weeks and not able to do much. However, the Olay Total Effects was a lifesaver when it came to visitors. I would use it and everyone would say how great I was looking (not so much on the days I didn't use it). This is a fabulous product which truly lives up to it's promises!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"What a wonderful product. This Olay Total Effects make my skin feel and look beautiful. I love that the smell isn't over powering. When I first tried it, I noticed that my face look less red and blotchy. After a week, my redness on my face was very minimal. I would buy this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is just the skin cream I was needing. As I age I found my skin changing. I noticed it was getting dry and I was getting fine lines. This is a very light formula and is great under my makeup. It isn't sticky of heavy. Makes my face feel soft and fresh. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this cream is awesome. I am 50 and do not want to look old. It softens the skin and actually made skin more firmer in the spots needed. My skin is very sensitive and was not bothered by this cream and will be buying it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I gave the very generous sample a try for 7 days. I thought my skin was feeling and looking great until about day 4, when I started to recognize the signs of an allergic reaction. While the cream is great, I was definitely allergic to the fragrance. I'd love to get an up scented version and give it a try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love the way my face feels after applying this cream. It's not heavy but still does a great job moisturizing my skin. I didn't notice any difference in my pores or fine lines unfortunately. But I would use this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer, I noticed my skin is noticeably brighter and more youthful! The frown lines in my forehead appear reduced. It feels really nice on, since it's not greasy but still moisturizing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm usually hesitant to try new skin products as I have sensitive skin and most products irritate me.I was quite surprised on how light and smoothly Olay Total Effects went on and how I didn't have a reaction. This is one of the major reasons why I will continue using it. A bonus is the minimized pores & even skin tone! A must have for everyone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really enjoyed the sample of Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It soaked in really quickly and wasn't greasy. It helped to even my skin tone which is great with the unique vitamin complex it has. It will help to fight the seven signs of aging. It is definitely a product I would consider buying. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Although I love the feeling of Total Effects on my skin, I don't think I look any younger. Maybe it's just that I look at my face every day so I don't see a difference, but maybe I was just hoping for miracles. I'll continue to use it as I like the feeling and smoothness, but I don't feel it's made me look younger. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I like the the pump style bottle it comes in. Olay has very light and pleasant scent !! The texture of the cream is silky smooth and is not to watery or to heavy on the skin at all. This cream absorbs nicely and gives your skin a smooth hydrated feeling. After using the Olay total effects for a while I have noticed pretty good results! My skin tone looks healthier and my fine lines seem a bit smoother. Thanks Olay for giving me the chance to try this great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
You know that Olay is a product you can trust. I use the Olay line but I have never tried this one. Once I finished using this product I found my skin to be brighter and smoother. It is really nice to your family and friends complement you on your skin. I would recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this was definitely one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! I really like the lightness of it, it really made my skin look softer and smoother within no time at all.I loved it so much that I'm now switching from my other one I was using for the last 2 years:) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Ever since I started using Olay 7 in 1 I've noticed that my skin is brighter. I've also been told that I have a glow that I didn't have before. I was starting to feel that my skin was looking dull and uneven so I believe I've found the right product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Love this product. None greasy goes in smooth. If u haven't tried this product yet than u are missing out...want a product that doesn't break yoh and and actually leaves skin feeling silky smooth than this is the product for you!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Now that I have been using Olay Total Effects for a couple of months I can really see the difference. My skin looks significantly smoother and brighter. It feels amazing too! I can't go a day without using it or I feel like I'm only half ready to face the day. I think that I will purchase this product once the sample is finished. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I don't think this product was for my skin type. I did like the overall texture of the cream. It did not make my skin feel over moisturized. I do not think it did all that it claims it's suppose to do. Maybe it's just my skin type. I am glad I tried it. But I don't think it is something I would be purchasing. Thank you for the opportunity. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I noticed so much life in my skin now! Seems more even toned and softer. I like the way it isn't heavy on your skin when you apply it. My skin was dull from the winters harsh wins and its seems now that it's much better. Would definitely use this all year round! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Since using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I've noticed my skin tone has evened out. I have also noticed that my fine lines have started to disappear and the vitamin complex has helped make my skin look smoother. The only downside to it is that I've noticed a few more breakouts. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've titled it miss beautiful because after using this product for almost 2 months that's how I feel. My pores have minimized, my skin is softer, no more dry skin and I have a glow. I've recommended this product to all my friends and family and hopefully they will take my advice and continue to use it as I will be adding this to my daily routine. Thank you bzzagent for the opportunity to try this new product. Nut my main shout out goes to olay for creating this wonderful product!!! ð (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really liked this moisturizer. It felt nice and light and not greasy at all. I would apply it before bed and my face always looks rejuvenated the following more. The scent took a little getting used to. ( just a bit strong for me). I will probably purchase this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The cream is ok.. Still left some dry patches on my skin in this cold weather, so I think something a bit more is needed at this time of year. The smell wasn't that great. I would prefer a different scent. I didn't notice any difference from any other face cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is the perfect cream for my skin in the winter in the northern climate. It moisturizes without greasiness, and helps smooth out the fine lines and uneven skin tone. I highly recommend this cream to anyone looking for a solid moisturizer for dehydrated winter skin. I can't wait to see how it performs in the summer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Smells great, application is nice and smooth, my skin did feel great all day. I'm don't think if I saw any changes in pore size, brightness, or fine lines after using the sample size, perhaps after a longer trial period. I would purchase and recommend it just based on the way my skin felt after using it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that one cream that covers all the bases is perfect for someone like me. Its not greasy, goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling vibrant. When i an finishing using my BzzzAgent sample size I will definitely be purchasing more! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer for a while now. I noticed that my fine lines are disappearing!! I still can see my fine lines around my eyes but they seems to be less than before. My face is really soft when I put the moisturizer on. Before I tried this product, I didn't think that there is any moisturizer can decrease any fine lines. I am glad that I gave this product a chance. I will continue using this product for sure!

"After using this product for about a month, I personally liked the results I achieved with this product. It did improve the quality of my skin as well as the appearance. But after switching back to my old moisturizer I did miss it. Unfortunately the price point is quite high which is a downside (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm not someone that usually puts lotion in my face but I did try the Olay Total Effects 7. I liked the cool feeling it left on my skin but didn't care much for the smell. I ended up sharing it with my boyfriend who loved it by the way âº (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Originally, It worked great! During the winter months my skin is awfully dry and I need something that is much more moisturizing. My skin doesn't stay hydrated through the day. I would definitely use it in the Summer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It works well. It soaks up fast, non greasy and keeps my skin hydrated. I don't know if it's necessarily better then the facial moisturizer I already use, but I think the anti aging properties is a definite plus. Instead of using an anti aging serum under my moisturizer I just put this right on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I suffer from Perioral Dermatitis flare ups, and unfortunately after using this product once- my skin was red and hot. I had to wash it off right away, unfortunately the skin infection still flared up some :( I can't blame the product though, my skin is sensitive to almost every cream I've tried in the last few years :( (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I loved this so much I purchased it for myself on the weekend @ Shoppers. This maybe my new 'go to' cream especially for the winter. Here in wpg it is super cold and skin is so dry especially in the house. I have to have a humidifier going in the place. My face feels awesome with this product. Thank you bzzagent and Olay for the opportunity to try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this cream isn't for me. After the first use I had a terrible reaction to it. My face turned red and became quite sore. I don't know if it was one of the ingredients or the fact that there is a strong scent to it. I prefer my face products to be scent free and at most lightly scented. However, Olay is a a very well known and trusted brand and while I'm sure my skin's reaction is rare, I think it would be wonderful for someone else.

I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product. My skin is so dry in the winter and after using this product for a week I can feel the difference already. My skin feels so soft. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was very excited to try this product since it's not even in stores yet! Also I am very skeptical about these anti aging creams! I applied the product everyday but after 4 weeks, I didn't notice any real significant difference! I'm not really surprised because I've never had any success with these types of creams! So in my opinion I would not buy this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Noticeably softer and smoother skin! Such a great product that I went out and bought a full sized bottle! All the tiny lines around my eyes and mouth are gone and my skin tone has evened out so I no longer have the red inconsistent tone! I get tons of complements on my skin daily and I couldn't be happier! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really think my skin looks healthier and more radiant after using Olay even after a short while. The way it goes on and the way my skin feels is a testimony to this product. There is no after effects of putting it on like others that leave a sticky residue. This goes on clean. Leaves an all over nice effect on your skin. It doesn't have the overly powerful smell of perfume products which you don't want in your product to begin with. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using the cream since I received, and as someone with senative skin I was skeptical. But, my fave has never looked so great. I have complexion, and my skin finally feels mosterized without breakouts! I will absolutely be buying this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I found this product so effective. I wanted to reduce fine lines, and it helped me to look smooth and line free. I was surprised at the silky softness and the way I felt after..something I will try again and again. Feeling beautiful is easy with Olay 7 in one. My skin glows, nothing to show but clean (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, and you can really notice a difference. Not heavy and oily like some moisturizers, and has a nice scent. I would have liked to have a bit more in the trial size version to see some of the longer term results but I like what I see so far! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Since using Olay total effects my skin feels and looks like it's glowing. My pores have definitely shrunk and my skin tone looks so much more even. I barely see the crows feet that I noticed before I started using this product. Olay totalk effects 7 in 1 is now my fav go to cream. Goes on nicely and with a pump of the bottle you have just the right amount everytime. Definitely glad I got to try this out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I thought Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer worked really well keeping my skin soft and moisturized. Over my duration of use I noticed a reduction in the fine lines and uneven skin tone on my face. I do have sensitive skin and my face had no negative reaction to the cream. My only issue with the cream and my reasoning for giving 4 stars was the scent was quite strong and I do prefer scent free products. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using this product since the beginning of the campaign and must say that my love affair has only grown!! I absolutely love this product it now silky smooth and does not leave any greasy after feel, it makes my skin feel and look healthy and younger. I truly love the texture of this cream and the dispenser. It dispenses the perfect amount! Love all around! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

This is now my permanent 'tool' for fighting the signs of aging. I have found that my fine lines are almost impossible to see and my skin seems to glow as my husband puts it. It doesn't feel as dull as it did and my skin tones are no longer. Thank you Olay for a powerful product in one bottle (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried the product and liked the light, smooth texture to the cream. It has a pleasant smell as well, and felt relaxing Unfortunately, my skin is very dry and it drank up the small sample within a week! In that time, I enjoyed the moist feeling in my face and I would definitely recommend it to people looking to try a new product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this product so I didn't set high expectations, but Olay is an excellent brand in my eyes. It was a pretty good product, and I do see changes on my face my skin tone. Maybe extended use will give all the results promised from the product.

Love the new Olay cream that I got to sample! I feel like my face is glowing after I put it on! My mom loved it as Wel! I know she is going out to get some! So everyone my review on this out of 5 is 5! Love Olay products! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I let my mom and sisters sample it and they will buying some as well! So everyone my experience with this be cream is go get some today! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After using this poduct for a month, the 7 effects are noticeable. My skin has never felt smoother or softer, though it has not removed my wrinkles, there is an improvement in the overall look and feel of my skin. I expecially noticed that my pores are smaller which gives my face a nice glow. I am going to continue using this product for sure. Very happy and satisfied customer.

"I have been using the new trial size of the Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer every day since I brought it home, and I can't believe how moisturized my skin feels! I have used it every day, and the trail size is still going strong! I love that you don't need much to feel the effects. I will be buying more, when my bottle runs out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was quite excited to try this product as I have heard great things. I used it for a few days and then ended up having a skin reaction. It was unfortunate. I gave this product a 1 out of 5 just because of that. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have used Olay moisturizers before, but I tend to stick to the simple variety: unscented, for sensitive skin. The scent of this moisturizer immediately put me off. But I tried it anyway. It was light and non greasy, but I didn't see much change in the appearance of my skin. For the price I wouldnt recommend it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I wasn't sure about Oil of Olay products... the last time I used them ages ago I wasn't terribly impressed, but WOW! This changed my mind. With consistent use, I saw results. Noticeable results. I don't have many wrinkles, but I have one on my forehead that definitely lessened with consistent use. This product is definitely on my anti-aging radar! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"so, I've always used Olay products on my face, so I was excited to try this. I found that even with my combination skin (very dry forehead) I could use this all over, I didn't have to switch to something else for the extra dry areas. The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is I'd like to have an unscented option, but I'm still going to use the rest of my sample! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this face cream! I used the whole bottle! I will be buying it for sure. Made my face feel and look very smooth. I will definitely be suggesting more friends to try it. I did share with my sister whom already tried the product and my mom who said she will try it for sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Olay total effects moisturizer is amazing! It has now become my go to brand to purchase. In only a few weeks of using it I have noticed changes in my skin. Those pesky fine lines are smoothing, my face is glowing with moisture, even a few of my dark spots have lightened. I have seen more benefits using this product than with my more expensive department store brands and at a fraction of the cost. Thank you buzz agent for introducing me to this great product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think Olay Total Effects is a permanent daily routine now and I'm going to keep it. I look younger. Even skin tone. Aging spots lighter or gone completely. Stress lines are looking happy. Makes you feel good that a product actually works. Got to try the product before spending money on something that may not work. It lasts so the price is worth it. Especially if it works! Thank you Bzz agent for giving me this awesome experience! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I loved this moisturizer the first couple weeks but into the third week I started to break out and it just kept getting worse. My skin is sensitive and I do have problems trying new creams. Some block poores worse than others so i guess this one does too. If you don't have acne prone skin you might be fine but if you have sensitive skin, I don't recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Great product leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth i used daily for about 2 weeks then went and bought some because it worked so well. I think I have found my new moisturizer/anti aging cream. Finally a product that actually works! Thank you (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer goes on bery nicely and absorbed almost immediately. I needed a very small amount to cover my whole face and there was next to no smell. However for the claims they make towards wrinkle reduction, evening tone and making pores appear smaller etc. I really didn't see a difference. It is a good moisturizer but not something I will buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I would want to know that this product really did reduce fine lines before I actually bought it. I received this product free to try and did so for two weeks straight. I was hoping to see a difference because it felt really nice going on my face but I didn't. My skin did feel nice after putting it on but I did not see any difference on my fine lines and age spots which may be because I haven't used it long enough yet. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have finished the trial size sample that was sent to me in the mail. I am very pleased with the results. I used the sample every day and feel as though my skin is in much better condition than it was previously. Things I notice are, my skin around my eyes looks nicer not so dark and gloomy. The fine lines and wrinkles or laugh lines are totally less visible. My skin is softer and in my opinion it looks and feels more nourished. I can hardly wait til February to get some more!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think his would be a great product in a different climate. I don't find that I get enough moisturizing from it. My skin has felt scaly and itchy. I will give it a try in the summertime when my skin isn't so dry. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product was nice. It went on smooth and had a nice fragrance. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin, so that is a bonus. I have been using it for a couple of weeks, although being a nice product, I have not noticed any significant benefits. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I used this for about a week, but unfortunately I ended up with hives/bumps. I am allergic to so many things - I have no idea what could be in the product that caused me to break out. I'm sure it's a great product for those who aren't allergic to EVERYTHING, but for me, it just didn't work out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer worked well for pore reduction and moisturizing. It went on smoothly and absorbed quickly. I couldn't handle the weird smell for the duration of the trial though. Not everyone would find it smells offensive as it smells like tea, however I don't like that scent. If i could find this in a truly unscented version I'd certainly give it a try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay has been around for many years. I loved the product had to be careful as I have rosacea, it has a wonderful feeling on the skin, no film or sticky feeling. It had that mild scent that olay is known for. I like the pump bottle. It didn't seem to harm my skin, however i didn't used every day (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was so excited when I received the Olay Total effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer. I have been using it for over a month now and have noticed my skin is much smoother and my pores appear smaller. I love how the product goes on so effortlessly and LUV there is no harsh scent. Just Perfect! My skin feels so soft and not dry. I will definitely purchase this product @OlayUS #GotItFree #Braggingðð± (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I've been using Olay products for years because of how effective they have been for my skin. The Total Effects was no exception. I used the lotion primarily at night as there was no SPF. The fairly thick lotion went on and was absorbed by my skin quickly and smoothly with no scent (a definite plus for me). It moisturized my face during the night leaving it smooth the following morning. It's definitely worth buying the next time I need a night time mositurizer.

"I really liked this product for the first week or so and then it didn't seemed to keep it's promises. It was great as a moisturizer, but I did not find that it made any difference with the appearance of my skin. Maybe I don't have enough need for the changes that it promises, but I found little or no change. It might work better for someone that has more issues with their skin.

I typically use a thick hydration cream in the winter as my skin gets dry and an spf on top. I feel that this product could take the place of 3 products in my winter routine. I have some first signs of rosacea that I could see clearly before starting using this product but having used it for a few weeks has removed those signs and evened out my skin tone. I may have to start using blush! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
After using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 3 weeks I can say I was excited!! I did`t know anything about this product before. After just 3 weeks of using the cream I began to notice wrinkles reduction. I would recommend this product to everyone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have used on and off for years Olay products. Almost 2 months of using Olay 7 in 1 Anit Aging Moisturizer, I have to say that It keeps my skin well hydrated during the day. I've seen a bit of reduction in the lines on my forehead and a bit of brightness. I'm hoping continued use I will seem more wrinkle reduction and some of the other claims but it's worth it just for the moisturizing factor. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I stand at the bus stop to and from work, and usually in the winter I get dry, chapped patches on my face from the cold. Not this year! I've been using the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and it must have something to do with it, as that's the only change in my skincare regimen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have skin that alternates between very dry and super acne prone, so finding a moisturizer that hydrates without causing break-outs is a hassle. Olay 7 in 1 works really well for keeping my skin hydrated with the added bonus of evening out my skin tone. The one drawback to this product is that as soon as I stop using it every night, my dry skin returns within a day or two. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Since I've been using Total Effects I've noticed that my skin is softer It also appears to be a little brighter .the tones has evened out some as well i sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose.That has not completely gone away but has diminished.I have some fine lines across my forehead that seem smaller now .I like the pump design but is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle .I would definitely purchase this product again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was looking forward to trying this product from Olay as I am already a user of its moisturizers. I found the product to be creamy, hydrating and non greasy. I saw definite positive results after using the product. 8 I highly recommend this. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"even though the main reason I was excited for this product was its claim on age spots, it it a nice light weight cream. I have very sensitive skin and I did not have any negative issues. I did not notice any difference in my age spot after 1 month of use. It looks the exact same. As a brightening cream it is beautiful. I use it under my foundation and my skin feels smoother and definitely looks brighter. I liked this cream so much I even purchased my own full size jar. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the feel of the OlayÂ® Total Effects. it is soft and creamy. I don't have any age spots or lack firmness for this product to correct, but I did notice a reduction of fine lines around m eyes. It was not greasy and absorbed into my skin quickly. I will keep this product in mind the next tim I am purchasing facial moisturiser. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay makes wonderful products. Another without a complaint. Over the holidays I was sick a week and no one even noticed. If was during that time too I tried my sample and it worked beautifully. My face was soft,balanced, and toned. Until I spoke no one even knew I was sick. I will definitely purchase in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on and I like that it's fragrance free. It works so well and makes my skin look fantastic. I put it on at night and when I wake up, my skin looks awake, energized and beautiful. My mother-in-law, my sister, my girlfriend got Olay Total Effects as Christmas gift. I love it and I am confident they will like it too. I definitely recommend this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed a major difference in my skin. My face feels so soft and smooth. The fine lines have definitely diminished and my skin tone is much better as well. Great product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I didn't notice a difference in my skin day to day, but looking at the side by side comparison, it's definitely there! My crows feet are little baby crows feet now. I think it even evened out my skin tone. Too bad it was a small bottle as it is now all gone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
A great 7 in one cream from Olay! I loved the way it soaked into my skin. Not leaving it feeling dry or stiff. I took this product on vacation the first week of December and continue to use it now. I feel great (and my skin does too!) about using this cream by Olay!!! :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've used this Oil of Olay cream since the day it arrived. I love how it works for me. During the cold, dry, winter months I always struggle with my forehead being dry, but my nose being oily. This product worked amazing to give my forehead the moisture it needs, without being oily. I love the light texture, and lasting affects. I will definitely be buying this in full size! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
i notice my face being shinning like a star. i look a lot younger than before. ican not say anything bad about this produce i havetold my family they gotto try it. I use it everyday. I just can not get enought. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love the product, my skin is smoother, dark spots early age fades, I have less identifies and my complexion is uniform. People notice a difference and I also. The product to be a nice texture and apply evenly. I totally satifaite the result. You now have a new user filled and will continue treatment. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really don't notice much difference than other products, but perhaps if used longer it may be more noticeable. The size received doesn't really give enough time to try the product to see how well it can work. I do like that it goes on quickly, and don't have to wait for it to dry before proceeding with other products/makeup. The scent is nice and mellow. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After my first review and two and half weeks later. I did notice my skin was smoother but I don't have any wrinkles or fine line to see any reduction in that area. I also notice there is some reduction in the size of my pores. But nothing dramatic. I don't have any age spots so I couldn't see if there is any improvement in that area. Overall I think this product is O.K. I would somewhat recommend it to others. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"this, as usual for Olay, is a great product. I am suprised of the prices in effect that I see for this product on the shelves in the last few days. I loved it. it leaves my skin soft and even. I am 37 and starting to use skin care products with aging processes. thanks Olay ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"this product offers moisturizing properties it's super hydrating and none greesy. I use this on my neck also and the results are great!! The texture of my skin has improved, the dryness before was starting to make me look aged. Now by using this cream daily my skin look smooth, supple, fine lines are reduced. So Olay total effects is a very good cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have tried other anti-aging moisturizers but Olay is been the best so far. Only after a few weeks of use, I see a noticeable difference! I use this daily under makeup. I love it so much feels great on my skin as it's not too greasy. It gives glow to my skin that I get compliments on from my friends and family. This is a great moisturizer from Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Got a chance to try the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer from #BzzAgent. I love the texture of the cream and the smell of it. It made my face looked brighter and my skin tone more even. Also it's very moisturizing that it lasts the whole day. Definitely would purchase the full size and add to my day and night routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Olay is the brand that my mother always used...but never me, because that was for ""older women"". I'm now the age that I used to consider old, so this was perfect timing. I really quite enjoyed this product and found that it helped even out my skin. Thanks for the opportunity! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have just finished my trail size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 and I can really see a change in the appearance of my skin texture on my face. My complexion is much more even, the lines on my forehead are much less pronounced, my skin just looks healthier. I have already gone out and purchased a full size of this product in the unscented formula so that I won't miss a day of using it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for actual results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I loved this product. I have sensitive skin and eczema on my face so have to use caution with new products. This one was great, it didn't burn my face like so many do. It also smelled great and evened out my skin tone fairly well for the short time the sample lasted me. I'm still relatively young but my face is definitely starting to show signs of age... Would definitely be interested in purchasing for longer term use to see the full results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this as a sample from BzzAgent and Olay Total Effects. It was a good product. It made my skin soft on contact, but it did sting my skin a little. I would recommend this product to anyone without skin problems or ecsema. I had to give the rest to a family member, and they just loved it! Made our winter skin, look brand new again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is amazing. My mom uses this moisturizer all of the time, but I never got around to trying it. Since Iâve been using this moisturizer I notice that my skin texture has transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and there is a noticeable improvement. And best of all I can wear it under my make-up without it feeling heavy. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to everyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Iâve been using this sampler for a few weeks now and am impressed with is as a daily moisturizer. My skin definitely looks brighter, not the usual dry-ashy look that comes with Canadian Winters. I havenât noticed a difference in lines, pores, spots etc â but as a daily moisturizer I think this is great! Itâs light enough that it doesnât feel greasy but works well enough to calm dry skin. Iâll definitely be sticking with this one! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The product is great, it has a wonderful scent and as soon as I put it on my skin feels tighter. After using it for a 7 days I can see some imporvment in my skin tone and in my pores. Will continue to use it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was pleasantly surprised with this product. To actually clean to fight seven signs is pretty big soon. I can actually. Is there a clue. The small bottle of that I didn't think would be enough to test it was more than nice that you didn't you a lot. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think that Olay has outdone themselves with this product. My skin is so soft and the fine lines and wrinkles are a lot less noticeable. I have already purchased the larger size and will continue to use this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Since using this product I've noticed visible changes. My dark spots are no longer dark, my lines around my eyes and mouth have dissapeard, my skin jus looks visible smoother and younger!!! Thank you Olay!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using Olay Total Effects daily for about four weeks now. Overall I would give it an above average rating, but I'm not a convert. While it is moisturizing for the most part, I find it gives my face an overly shiny appearance while leaving my cheek areas still dry and flaky. As such I find I am constantly needing to blot the excess oil, and applying other moisturizing cream on my cheeks. So the search continues... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I, and other people, have noticed a change in my skin. The pores are less visible and so are the lines. My skin is brighter and much more even in tone. I have not noticed the reduction in age spots yet, but it hasn't been very long. The results are really visible and I have bought the regular size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. The trial size is available in February and will go in my travel bag. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for weeks now and have noticed a change in my skins appearance. My skin is brighter,softer and smoother than before. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines on my face. I recently had someone guess my age as 25 and I'm 33. So its working for me I think. The product absorbed quickly and doesn't have a strong scent that a lot of face moisturizers have. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
very nice light fragrance and a good texture when applying to your face feels very light and smooth. I do not know about anti-aging that I could not tell any difference. Very nice to use though. Would buy this product if not too expensive. The Olay moisturizers are always a good choice for face care ecspecially the ones with spf in them. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer every morning for over a month. At first I didn't think I noticed any effects. It was my husband who pointed out I looked brighter and younger. This moisturizer is light feeling and a little was all I needed. My skin looks hydrated, healthy and young. If the price is right I will definitely try the version with sunscreen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"First impression: I was happy it didn't make me break out! It felt nice on my skin, not heavy or greasy. I have a few fairly deep worry lines that I was paying close attention to with this product. They are not gone, but I do think I see an improvement, which is more than I expected in about a month worth of use. OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is worth a shot! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using this item for the past couple weeks. I am not happy with the item and won't be continuing use. I don't see a difference and I don't like the feel of it on my skin. I have used other products that have worked better in comparison. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I decided to continue trying this product s little longer to see if my review would change, but it unfort. Has not. I have not noticed any changes while using this product. It helps with moisturizing but that's all I liked about it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I used up the sample and found that It did work on my skin. I did need to use something else for the colder, dryer days but for the most part only used this as my moisturizer. I like the texture of it, as it soaked into my skin quickly. I find that some stay on top and do nothing. The sun spots around my eyes looked lighter, and my skin tone was more even. Will look for this in February. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is fantastic. I used it every day for 3 weeks and noticed the lines start to dramatically reduce. It's amazing how well this product works. I was very sceptical but I wad wrong. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this is a good product. I found it to make my skin break out a bit but as I used it longer the break outs were less. I am not sure it reduced any lines or brown spots but my skin felt soft and less dry than it was when I started using the product. I will continue to use Olay 7 in 1 to see if I get better results as time goes on. I really loved the light scent and how well it blended in with out a oily feeling. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried other anti-aging moisturizers but Olay has come through as the winner. After only a few weeks of use, I saw a noticeable difference! This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. It's Fragrance Free, which is so important for facial products. This is my favorite Olay Moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I like this product alot I have really sensitive skin and this one broke me up but that's how my skin is so no big deal I think it's a bit pricy but it does give u what it says it gives u. The smell is so nice the creamy texture it has a shine but nothing like sparkles I think ppl should try it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was so happy to get this sample as I usually use a expensive name brand anti-aging product. But I was so surprised about how awesome the oil of Olay worked. My skin has never glowed so much! It really does fight the seven signs of aging! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This Oil of Olay cream was the first face cream I had tried that was actually enough moisture for my face and left it feeling soft. While it did a great job of moisturizing, I'm not sure how much of a difference it made with my ""aging"" needs. I didn't notice any reduction in wrinkles, lines, etc. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have heard such great things about olay total effects however it made me break out! The product does have a great smell. I did pass it along to my Mom who said she thought it helped with the crepiness around her eyes. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love the feel of this cream.The texture is luxuriously smooth and velvety. the scent was light and fresh. I have fairly sensitive skin and found that although this is a thick moisturizer, i didnt break out from it. My skin always felt super soft and hydrated after use. i dont have too many wrinkles or age spots, so i cant attest to those properties. But i did feel like it made my skin glow, which i love. Can i get another sample ? :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

After using this product now fora lost a month. I can tell you I am very happy. I went and purchased one and keep on getting complements on how my Sikkim is looking great. I am very happy with this product but wished it was cheaper. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After my mom had ""stole"" my Olay, she has continued to use it and the difference has been amazing. I think her wrinkles are smoothing out even though she doesn't think they are but she sees herself everyday in the mirror and I don't. Her skin spots are even starting to fade. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love the feel of my skin since I started using the product. I have noticed that some of the fine lines around my eyes are not as pronounced as they once were.. My husband has noticed that my skin looks and feel younger. I would suggest this product to any woman. And for young women as well. Start young to protect your skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"What a surprise! I was thinking: ""Oh another cream for wrinkles that does not work! and you know what? It really works. For the eyes fine wrinkles, the big one on the forehead and my skin is soooo smooth, I can not not use it. The results are so quick, and it's a real pleasure to apply on the face and the neck. For sure, I will buy some when my sample will be finish. Great discovery! Thanks Olay (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT, i USED IT EVERYDAY AND ENJOY THE LOOK OF MY SKIN, EVEN MY HUSBAND NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE, I WOULD GIVE IT A 4.5/5 THE CREAM IS SOFT AND EASY TO APPLY, AND LEAVE NO LINES ON THE SKINS AFTER APPLICATION. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I waited a while before reviewing because I was hoping to see some results. I really don't think it did much for my skin at all. My skin tone is still uneven, and I don't see any improvement to my fine lines. I do give it two stars because it wasn't greasy and didn't make my skin oily like a lot of anti-aging products I've tried, and it went on beautifully beneath my makeup, and didn't turn oily during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed since trying Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, that my fine lines are more even. My skin felt smooth. I liked the smell of the product, it wasn't overpowering.

I do give it two stars because it wasn't greasy and didn't make my skin oily like a lot of anti-aging products I've tried, and it went on beautifully beneath my makeup, and didn't turn oily during the day.

"I am so happy with Olay Total Effects, I receive compliments on a daily basis from people telling me how young I look. The best compliment I received so far is that I look 25 and I'm 37. I suffered from uneven skin tone but luckily not anymore since Olay Total Effects has fixed that problem. Olay Total Effects offers 7 amazing benefits that helps me have younger, healthier skin.

"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is OK. I like how my skin feels after I use it. But I don't like how strong the smell is. I haven't really noticed any anti-aging changes but it may be that longer use would show those. I find the packaging a little annoying - the cap is small and almost touches the nozzle, so it gets messy quickly. I don't expect I will be looking for this product in the store, but I'm happy to finish off the sample. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Olay has been a good product for me. I love the way it radiates my skin immediately after use. I like the slight sheen which is not too slick or greasy. It absorbs into my skin almost straight away after application. I love the feel of it. The fact that it is fragrance free means no rashes for me. Yippee!! Top marks for Olay. Needless to say I love the product and have recommended to my friends who have gone out to purchase it. Thank you for the opportunity to let me try it.

"I would buy this based on scent alone!! I have very dry skin and it keeps me moisturized all day long and keeps my skin bright, especially around my eyes! I am 42 and have been experiencing age spots in the last few years and this is making them less noticeable! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have combination skin and find it difficult to find a moisturizer. This moisturizer went on very light and absorbed quickly. My skin always feels tight after washing it and this relieved the tightness immediately without causing additional oiliness. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 for more than 4 weeks, i found that it just offered me a good moisturizer, i did not see any other changes in my complexion. I would say if you are looking for a good moisturizer then this is a great find. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects is a great moisturizer that improves skin texture, moisturizes without feeling greasy, evens skin tone, firms, and minimizes pores! Fortunately I am not yet faced with age spots and wrinkles but I will definitely continue to use the product to help slow the aging hands of time! My skin definitely looks brighter and smoother!! Next time I will try the fragrance free moisturizer as my skin has been more sensitive during the dry winter months! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this. It really works. Brown age spots have faded. Small lines around the eyes have smoothed out. It smells great. You don't need a lot. Absorbs quickly. Light feeling. My skin doesn't feel greasy or heavy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"In my previous review I stated that this product does seem a bit oily at times, therefore I wasn't using it day and night... However, I just decided I can use it day and night on more of the problem spots (forehead); I don't need to use it on my whole face every time I apply it.

"I think OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has help smooth out some of my wrinkles on my forehead. Has a great scent, a little went a long way. A little heavy for me under make up as I tend to sweat but was great alone or at bedtime. I would buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I normally use Oil of Olay but usually buy the lesser expensive versions, simply because of cost. But this is a great, Ive been using my free trial! for a month and my skin is very soft, even in tone, but I'm not too sure about the reducing of lines though. It tingles slightly when I put it on, but not in a bad way. And, importantly, it doesn't have a chemical or perfumey smell to it. I can't stand products that smell strong, this is very nice and mild. Would recommend it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After i used Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin feel so good and soft . I could not tell the result because it was small bottle i am waiting that it came in store but after i used it my king was shingle too (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This product is amazing! I've been using this product for three weeks. I've noticed (and others) how the bags under my eyes have almost disappeared. I don't look like I haven't slept for a while. My skin is softer and there's a glow about it. (No I'm not pregnant). This is a really good product and the smell is really clean. There's isn't to much perfum. I would definitely recommend Total Effects Cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"the One trial size (15 ml.) of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great product ,easy to apply with the pump system not greasy at all and not perfume just like I prefer ....my skin seems to be more hydrate more smooth ...a product to use for women in any ages (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"What I really like about this MOISTURIZER is how face it absorbs into the skin .. and doesn't leave my face feeling oily! I've noticeda slight difference in lines around my eyes not being so noticeable. Oh one more thing, it's scent is very mild ( scent sensitive) so that is something else o enjoyed about this product.

Well after giving this product one more shot to help with moisturizing in cold weather I have concluded the following: 1. It did seem to add a younger glow (+) 2. It helped Moisturize (+) 3. It was lite weight and my face didn't feel weigh down (+) 4. It caused me to break out in my face (-) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
What i want to know before i get this product is if it removes wrinkles? I think that this product is really amazing! Although it doesn't magically get rid of wrinkles or lines it does make the face more toned and soft. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think since using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin feels softer and fine lines are less visible, plus it is a great moisturizer under my make-up. I would definitely recommend it to women who are looking for a effective skin-care product at a reasonable price. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the Total Effects brand of Olay is great!. I already am an Olay girl but have never used the more expensive stuff but I think from now on I will! Loved that there was just a light fragrance, nothing too over powering. The moisture was fantastic. Usually this time of year my face gets so dried out but using this cream the past month it has been sily smooth. Will be purchasing this product in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received my sample of oil of olay total effects moisturizer about 3 weeks ago. I absouletly love it, I love the way it feels on the face, non greasy , very silky, and smooth. I use it daily and does not clog pores, I will purchase this product!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I loved how light if felt and the scent. It was easy to spread around, absorbed quickly and I felt my skin firming. I did not notice a drastic difference in fine lines. It did however rid me of a dry spot that I have by my eye brow. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

What a difference 6 weeks make. I loved this product right from the beginning and I am even more in love with the product now than ever before. My skin not only feels great but it looks so much better too. The fine lines around my eyes are disappearing and my pores look smaller. My skin feels moisturized and refreshed with each application. I can't say enough great things about the OLAY total effects!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I've been using Olay total effect 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer for weeks now and haven't noticed any major changes in wrinkles or age spots. However I do love the way the moisturizing sinks right in and makes my skin feel smooth. There is no strong scent so it doesn't burn my eyes which is another added bonus. All in all it would definitely be a moisturizer I would buy and recommend to friends! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer is definitely a must have. I have noticed a tremendous difference in my skin. My age spot is almost gone. I had crowd feet around my eyes and they are not there anymore. This is a must try product for sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 cream now every night now for a couple of weeks. I love it! I can really see a difference in the smoothness of my skin. It looks younger to me, and my lines and age spots seem more diminished. I love that it doesn't leave my skin greasy. Overall I'm very impressed with how my skin looks using this product. Thanks Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been applying the new Olay total effect 7 in 1 for the last 4 weeks. Overall i like the creamy texture and the smell is pleasant and not strong. It leaves my skin hydrated especially in the dry winter months where my skin gets dry. I noticed my skin a lille bit more firm As far as reducing wrinkles and pores i didnt really noticed a difference. I would say its a great moisturizer overall if youre not looking for targeted areas (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I've been using Olay 7 in 1 now for a month. I've noticed my skin is more hydrated and crows feet are less noticeable. I have very sensitive skin and have a very hard time finding a product that won't irritate my skin. I've had success so far with Olay and will continue using it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"With the weather getting colder, my skin gets drier. I've used the last of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer sample I received over the last few days and my skin has been grateful. No more peeling, red skin. My skin is more even after four weeks and a few of my ""fine lines"" have disappeared. Age spots are still noticeable but look smoother. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is great. I don' think a cream will ever remove the signs of aging but it can certainly help! I think this Olay product is not too heavy like some moisturizers. I will be buying Olay from now on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging moisturizer was bang on with their product. It came at the right time of year for me as my skin was very dry. The vitamins and antioxidants helped hydrate my skin to help with the age spots and really did minimize the appearance of my pores. My skin was uneven in colour which this product helped with evening out. The sample size I found was not big enough though. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have been using it for a month and can really see a difference with the lines around my eyes. I have deep laugh lines and they have been getting better as each week goes by. I was told the other day that I looked younger then I did 10 years ago. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"It absorbed beautifully but I didn't find it really helped at all for the issues it's supposed to address. It's really nice to only have to use a very small amount to cover my whole face and my skin felt better and was definitely better hydrated but it didn't do enough for me to justify the expense. Not much in the way of smell, which is fabulous. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This stuff is amazing. I just turned 40 and get compliments about my skin when I am out in public. I been using this for only a month, but since then my skin texture was transformed. I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I definitely recommend this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have tried more expensive products to see what I am missing but always return to Olay. There does not seem to be anything better on the market for me. Absorbs quickly, pleasant fragrance, gentle, lightweight, smooth texture, makes me feel beautiful (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that the Olay Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer Product is a great hydrating moisturizer that does as it claims. I was able to use a sample of this product for just over two weeks and found that it did even out my skin tone, reduce the appearance of my wrinkles and gave my skin an overall more radiant appearance. I liked the product so much that I've already bought the eye cream and fully plan on purchasing this product with SPF the next time I buy moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After using this product for a couple weeks, I am not sure I would purchase it. I found it just ok. It did moisturize well, unfortunately it also did seem to trigger an acne outbreak. For the price, I would like pass on purchasing in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this product might be good for some, but it's not for me. I have sensitive skin and I really wanted to love because of the affordability of it, but I just can't use it. My skin itches too much when I use it and I ended up breaking out on my chin with pimples, which I never get. Not fun when you are trying to fight wrinkles and zits at the same time. But this is probably just my skin being all whacky. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I used the last of my sample today. I'm heading out to town today to get some more..My skin tones appear to be so much more even since I stated using this product. I encourage you to give it a try!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"My skin looks and feels great, thanks Olay To begin with I wondered if it was going to make a difference. I have dry but combination skin. This goes on without it being oily feeling and makes my skin glow. Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer is working wonderfully. I'll be buying it again (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer totally works!! I have better skin tone, those nasty little lines are littler and best of all, DARK SPOTS ARE DISAPPEARING!!!!!! Absolutely fantastic except for one little problem, the scent. I really don't like the scent that this Olay product has. I find that it is just too strong. If they could make an unscented version, this would be my forever lotion. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is moisture plus so much more. My fine lines around my eyes aren't as visible, my skin tones appear more even, my skin is firmer and brighter, and even my pores look less noticeable! Overall, this product gives a more youthful look to my skin and leave sit feeling silky soft as well which is a bonus and blessing when the temperatures drop and my skin tends to get red and cracked. Amazing product!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the non- greasy texture and consistency of Olay Total effects. It's non- irritant and good for sensitive skin. I like the fact that it comes in a pump for sanitary reasons. This also helps in controlling the amount used, avoiding excess usage of cream. It's light with a slight tint, adding some colour to the skin. The size of the sample, did not give me adequate time to see an extensive change in my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
i think this product does work just how it says it will makes my skin more even and look refreshed and younger also took a few of the lines away that i didnt think it would do that makes me look a few years younger #gotitfree #bzzagent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"I live in a pretty dry and cold place, especially in the wintertime. I found this moisturizer really nice to use. The smell of it was great, the container size was perfect for going to the pool and throwing in a small bag. My skin looks and feels great after using it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The first thing I noticed was that my skin was very soft after using the entire sample. I didn't notice a significant impact on fine lines, but it did seem to blur them a bit. I'd be interested in getting a full bottle when it's available because I think it actually works. Olay is a brand I trust as well, so I'm pretty pleased overall. Luckily, I don't have age spots (yet!) but if I continue to use this, I'm sure I'll be set! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for just one week I noticed a significant improvement in my skin!

"I actually tried this as a base on my skin, and then applying my makeup on top. It actually worked! Other moisturizers have been too greasy/oily to allow makeup to go on, but with this product, I'm able to have both a moisturizer and make-up at the same time!

"I first was very excited about getting this product. Then after some use of it ,I noticed I did not like the smell of the fragrance. But it did make my skin less tight and dry feeling. My skin felt a lot more smooth and I did notice my seemed a little more even toned. All in all I probably will not purchase this product in the future as I didn't notice that much of a dramatic change and that other products can do as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"While I did not find that this really helped with any noticeable difference in the lines and look of my skin, I did find it my skin felt smoother while using this product. It has a pleasant scent and felt nice on my skin. It wasn't sticky like other products and didn't have an overbearing smell. Nice product but didn't live up to the claims it makes.

"I think this has been a very successful trial for me, I love using Olay Total Effects moisturizer! The lines around my eyes and mouth are diminished and I feel I have a more even skin tone.

Thanks for turning me onto this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I absolutely love this product, its so easy to use and benefits me a lot! I have notice it makes my skin look younger and healthy. It hides my uneven skin tones and brightens up my skin. It has a nice light scent but disappears after when applied. My face feels light not heavy by adding it to my everyday routine. It has become my new favorite moisturizer, for all the benefits I need in one. Amazing results! I would highly recommend it to everyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Winter is brutal for your skin. We all know this. Dry skin seems to be unavoidable - but Olay's Total Effects 7 in 1 is up for the challenge.

"This product is the revamped, updated version of what I remember my mom using when I was young. It has the familiar Olay scent. The product is a joy to use. It smells nice, goes on smooth, and results are noticeable in a few weeks. I used it everyday after a morning shower and it fit seamlessly into my morning routine. It replaced my moisturizer.

"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has a unique vitamin complex helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone.

I am going to personally buy another bottle and try it again for 4 weeks everyday. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

"I liked that this product did not leave my skin too oily and had a pleasant scent. Unfortunately the sample size was too small to give a fair review of this product.

"Tried Olay Total Effects for a few weeks now. I like applying it straight out of the shower for the best absorption. Otherwise it felt a little bit tacky. Didn't notice much difference as far as pore size, skin brightness or fine line reduction. It did leave my skin feeling moisturizer and soft. I was hoping for better results since I have large pores on my cheeks and forehead. It's a decent moisturizer in line with what I would expect from Olay but it's not a miracle cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Yup, does what it promises. I used Olay Total Effects for a week, and my skin was noticeably softer, smoother, with fewer lines and lessened wrinkles! To be truthful, aging isn't something I'm terribly worried about showing- but I loved how soft, smooth and moisturized my skin felt with using this product everyday! I love it, I recommend it. It's just that good. Thank you Bzz for letting me try Olay Total Effects. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 didn't live up to its claims for me. It was wonderful for a moisturizer, light, nice scent and non greasy. Only thing that is expensive for a moisturizer only.

This product is to perfumed for my liking. I dont usually use daily cream and this one does not make me want to buy one. It is soft and smooth for the skin of you like that kind of product and are in to a harsh flower smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this product, it moisturizes while minimizing pores, evens out my skin tone, reduces wrinkles and lines and has SPF - what more do you need! From the cute packaging and the pump which dispenses the perfect amount. The consistency of the cream is smooth and applies easily not greasy and gave my face a nice healthy glow. Would highly recommend this product and I will definitely being buying this cream again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My sensitive skin reacted beautifully to this cream - I was excited by the results my skin looks hydrated, toned, age spots faded and under my eye looks tightened and less puffy. My skin tone looks more even and there seems to be more color not so dull as before I used this cream. The texture spreads easily on the face just add to your beauty routine night and day and you will see the fantastic results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think Oil of Olay Total effects 7 in 1 Anti aging moisturizer is not for everyone. I loved the smell and the texture of this product but I could not stand it after 2 hours on my face. Might be my skin type but it made my face and neck extremely oily, I would have to wash my face or use a tissue to mop up the oils. My skin is already on the oily side and I don't think I was compatible for this product, Although the bottle itself is easy to use and convenient It just wasn't meant to be. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"When I first tried it I wasn't sure if I liked it but once the bottle was done I wanted to buy more. I liked the high quality of the product, the scent and the coverage. I wore it under my make up with no trouble. I do wish the product could have a different package to allow to know when it was running low. I was sad to have bottle run out, but will purchase more very soon. Over all I loved this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The original reason for me to try out this product was to reduce my pore size, moisturize and even skin tone. It did moisturize my face, which made it feel nice and soft. The smell was very nice as well. All the other things it is said to do, it didn't do. I was really rooting for it to work but unfortunately all it did was make me break out with bad acne. I used it every day, only missing it once. I love the Olay brand but this product did not work for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 for a couple of weeks now. I love that my skin tone appears more even and I've had less breakouts since I've been using it. It's a light cream, not too thick and absorbs quickly. There isn't a strong fragrance which is good for a face cream. The cream has a slight tint to it which makes your complexion glow. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't seem heavy enough for my dry skin now that winter is here. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think anyone looking for a great moisturizer should try this Olay product that I received free to try from Bzzagent. This is by far the best moisturizer I have used in a very long time, my face feels great all day long, this cream has my face looking and feeling healthy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have fallen in love with the Olay Total Effects! After two weeks of testing it, I see great results such as: skin testure and softness. In addition, I love how it feels light on skin and it is not strong in scent. When I first put on the Olay Total Effects on my skin, it gets absorbed right away without leaving any oiliness. Although it is light on skin, it is moisturizing enough for the winter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I loved it so much, hope all of my friends like this too. I shared what i like and i was tried this product it was really great item. The price of this is fair too. I think i will keep going to use it and buy it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using the Â OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer very day and I enjoyed how it feels on my skin. It is lovely product to use when is cold ourside, it feels like it really moisturize and protect your skin. Even if my sample size is fineshed, Ia small size lasted me for 3 weeks because you need a small quantity of product for fabulous results (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

I love it!!! Best skin moisturizer I have ever tried. I cannot speak or wrinkles as I don't have any yet (hihi...yet) but for moisture and soft skin it is fantastic! I use it morning and night and my skin feels soft but never greasy. A very good product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using it for a week and it does make my skin feel a lot softer. But as far as the fine lines and age spots, I still have them and they look exactly the same. Maybe it takes longer than 7 days for some people. I will continue to use this until the bottle is empty. Lets hope for better results nest week! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total effects sloan states younger looking skin in just 4 weeks. I have been using the product for 2 weeks and already seeing results! My skin feels smoother, and an even skin tone and best of all the product contains SPF 15 so it also protects me while outside in the sun! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay total effects is a great product. It's not greasy or to heavy and absorbs into your skin pretty fast. It made my face feel softer and not as dry, it also seem to minimized my pores which I never thought possible because I have huge pores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I don't think that its for my age range, but then again it's to prevent aging skin. For me it did great on evening my skin tone , as for those fine line I didn't notice a difference. The product moisturizes great and it's easy to apply, a little goes a long way. I did not like the feeling on my face after application, it felt like my skin was being stretched (maybe it's what it does). I think its a great product for someone that doesn't spend much time on makeup since it's like an all in one . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Since I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for several weeks now I have noticed my skin has become more radiant and moisturized. I noticed that my skin tone has also improved, my dark spots have become less visible and my overall skin tone is more even. I am very impressed with this product and I would definitely recommend to friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Used this product for two weeks and didn't tell anyone .First my husband noticed. He said I looked more fresh. My mother said my eyes had less laugh lines. I feel smoother and I love how light weight it feels! I have found my new face cream (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I do like the feel of this lotion on my face, soft and smooth. But as for the looking 10 year younger in 4 weeks, I don't believe that it does. I have not had any compliments on my skin looking younger. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This makes me feel like a human being again'. It's easy to use and doesn't require a lot of it.... It has decreased the amount of wrinkles given color back in my face. Has broughten out true beauty of a make up less face. The moisturizer Is a light airy and works it's magic all day and night. Thanks olay for making me feel wonderful one dab at a time.

Loved getting to try this. Helped even out my skin tone and wrinkles. Did not love the smell of it but was overall happy with the results. Prior to trying this my skin care regime was lacking and I have seen great results in the last few weeks (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. I am in my 60s, after only a few weeks of use, I saw a noticeable difference! It makes my skin feel real soft and silky. My friends said I look younger than before. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This cream goes on smooth and smells amazing. Within a few days i noticed a difference in my face. Lines werent as deep and tone looks even. Dont need much cover up to help my aging face anymore. I would recommend this to friends my age for sure! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think total effects made my skin soft... As far as diminishing my forehead lines I didn't see much difference in the amount of time I used it. Maybe I would of seen/felt more results with more time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was amazing I loves using it .. it helped a lot you should try it ... I have gone out a buy a new one . my face look so o difference . I am loving it .. its renewed my face my face its not that oily anymore . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
So sad to report my trail size of total effects is all gone. I really enjoyed this product and enjoyed seeing a difference in my skin. I can't wait for my current face cream to run out so I can go out and buy some total effects. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I found that using the new Olay Total effects was very pleasant. On first impression, the package itself was recognizable, I could tell it was from Olay. The pump bottle was easy to use and non messy. The scent was nice and light. It felt light on my skin, and moisturized it right away. after a few days, my face felt smoother than usual. The only gripe I have about this product is when I wash my face after using it, my yes start to burn. I may just be sensitive to it, who knows. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

I am a busy mom of 4 so age is showing very fast!! I was very skeptical about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer . But it is amazing!! heaven in a bottle.. Not only did it make my skin soft but it also took years off my face!!My mom and my 2 sisters are very amazed about this product!! I will continue to use this product even when my trial size is done! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I normally do not use Olay products, so I thought it would be a great idea to give this product a try. I'm also at that age where anti-aging products should be integrated into my face care regimen. Unfortunately this is not a moisturizer for someone with oily skin, which I have. I tried it once and it left me with very greasy skin, more so than usual. This then eventually led to breakouts. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay is not a trademark that i purchase usually. So i was very uncertain about the product. So i tried it, like the light floral perfume, cream is not to eavy, penetrate well the skin, no greasy feelling after application. Skin is soft and moist for the day! I trully fell in love with it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I am very pleased with the total effects anti aging serum. I found after one week I was noticing a difference. My skin regained color and softness. Even when applying it I was surprised to find it wasn't oily or greasy. I look forward to the next few weeks and it has definitely become part of my daily routine for skin care. I highly recommend this product for everyone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I loved being able to try this free sample from oil of olay and bzzagent. I've never tried any form of antiaging product . I found my skin feeling smoother and softer after just one week of using it. It really seemed to bring my skin to life. With a great color and soft look. I will most definitely be buying this product once my sample runs out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Was sent this in the mail and i have to say i'm very satified and plan to purchase more in te near future. I love tue bottle and how easily the product dispenses. The lotion smells bice and goes on perfect. I've been using it for a few weeks and have noticed softer skin and smaller pores. 5 stars all the way. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this Olay total moisturizer I got to try. It actually did tame down a line that just started forming on my forehead. I'm still using the sample I received, so just the trail size goes a long way as I've been using it for a few weeks now. It doesn't leave a greasy after feeling and doesn't smell bad. I recommended it to my mother and she will try it out as well. I'm hoping to get the face wash and other products from the total effects line. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think my skin looked so much better after using the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I slowly but surely noticed an even skin tone appearance, enhanced brightness, minimized look of pores, and replenished moisture on my skin. This is an amazing moisturizer for aging skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Waited until I used this product for a long enough period of time before completing this review. I wanted to ensure I was able to give this product the great review that it well deserved. It works very well near my eyes where I have the most issues. I'd recommend this product for anyone conceted with the effects of aging. Gives your skin a glow you will be very impressed with.

"I enjoyed my sample sooooo much that I ran out and purchased a big bottle!! After 3 weeks of using this product my skin is smoother my fine lines and wrinkles are visibly less pronounced! In this harsh winter weather, my skin is kept hydrated! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I don't look 10 years younger and not sure it holds up to all its promises but it does hydrate very well and my skin feels great. I put it on every night before going to bed. I have had 2 acnea outbursts since I started using this product, I hope it didn't cause them. I would consider buying it in the future because it provides good hydratation and I really need that in winter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I tried it and think it was nice. It make you face feel fresh, clean. What i liked about that product, no oil on your face, you got a dry face. About the pores i havent seen a lot of changes i do t have lots of pores but it didnt change. Maybe if i would use it for 4 week( cause i didnt got some for 4 weeks) i would finda change and tons more too say but like every olays product, they're great! Thanks olay to give us the chance of trying your product!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was surprised by how much i liked this product. The cream is very moisturizing and feels rich but absorbs quite quickly. I found that for me I dont have many wrinkles yet, but that my skin looked and felt very plump after using this cream. I cant really say forhte long term benefits as the sample size is quite small, but in the short term it really helps soothe dry skin and does give it quite a boost. I also really liked that the scent was not too strong. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Holidays are always hectic and stressful leaving me with very little sleep and poor eating habits. So I was really surprised to get compliments on how 'young' I was looking from friends and family that I hadn't seen in a while. What was I doing differently... I can only say the moisturizing with Olay Total Effects. Once the sample runs out I will definitely buy it again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Im still pretty young,,,, but my pores look smaller , evened my skin tone, dark spots lighter... Replenishes moisture. I love it . it smells good and not to thick that it will clog your pores or take 15mins to soak in to your skin. I dont think i will ever stop using it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was unsure at the beginning but after a few weeks of using Total Effects of Old of Olay is amazing....my skin looks bright, with an even tone, firm and smooth. Also helped me reducing the dark circles. I can't wait to get another one at the stores (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this is a great product for someone who doesn't need an intense mositurizing cream. I found it absorbed quickly and left my skin a little too dry. Great firming and evening though. Would definitely recommend it for someone who doesn't need a lot of moisture but would like the anti-aging benefits. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Received this small sample sized pump bottle. I've used it continually morning and night for two weeks. Haven't seen any change in my skin tone or the fine lines on my forehead. I found the moisturizer to be a little bit greasy as well. Thanks for the opportunity to try/review this product BzzAgent!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I like the texture of the cream, easy to absorb, but I prefer fragrance-free. The pump works extremely well, very easy to push and the amount of each pump size is very good, I am wondering if the pump is registered under the special pattern. Overall, I do not see any improvements of my skin, eg., educe the wrinkles. This products does not fit my needs. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've never really had much of a moisturizing routine. I'd use it on my face once in a while. But this is the best sample I think I've ever received. I've actually gone out and purchased it, it made such a difference. I'm not that old but I've got a couple wrinkles and this, this has made my skin look and feel better. Thank you!

"I was always an Olay girl in my twenties until I got a clinique sample, switched and used that for 10 years. I must say this product is sooo much better! it leaves a silky smooth feel and doesn't bother my sensitive skin, I am definitely switching back to Olay! Wish I had shot a before and after photo but I think my fine lines are reduced. 5 stars all the way (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this cream as a free sample. After a few days, I truley loved the cream. It left my skin feeling smooth with even skin tone. I think i would need to use the product a little longer to notice a difference in age spots and fine lines. The cream does leave an oily feeling on your skin. After sampling the cream, I did buy the product as I did like the feel of my skin after using the cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have combination skin with the cheeks being quiet dry. I need a nourishing moisturizer and was happy to try this product. Firstly, it was a great moisturizer. It was easily absorbed by my skin and I was able to put my make up on right away. My skin felt firmer, even after the first use. After using it a few weeks, I found my skin tone was more even and brighter. I would recommend Olay Total Effects! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I didn't see any real tell tale affects. However it did keep under my eyes properly moisturized but that was about it. There was no lightening of the dark circles or minimizing of thin lines. It just keep them looking fresh and alert. Perhaps not a product I would continue to use (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer has a nice, light fragrance and feels creamy, but not heavy on the skin. Although it moisturizes nicely, I'm not sure that I saw any great difference in terms of fighting the signs of aging. As a result, I don't think I would seek out this product. Olay's perfecting cream from their Regenerist line, which contains retinol, would be my preferred choice. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin is noticeablely smoother and softer. As well, I've notice my pores are smaller and the small lines around eyes have shrunk. This stuff definitely works! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like this product because of the nice sheen it leaves, however I have dry skin, especially in the winter and need something with weight. Olay Total Effects would maybe be ok for me in the warm months, but in the winter I use a night cream as my day cream because I need that extra protection and moisture. For those of you that do not have overly dry skin, I could see this working for you. Give it a try and see how it works for you! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this product for several weeks now and I have to say it is a really good product with great value! I have noticed (and others have too!) that some of my fine lines have disappeared with the regular usage of this product. It works just as well as many of the more expensive creams and lotions out there. I have tried many, but this is great for the price paid. This is my new regular product and I am saving money not buying the more pricier ones. Thanks Oil of Olay!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The travel size bottle is not really enough to fully review this properly. I have only noticed a lighter colour in my cheeks after a week and a half use. It is very smooth with no smell. I also noticed my skin does not get oily near the end of the day. We'll have to wait a few more weeks to see but Iam almost out. Hoping I can find it in the stores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
So I'm not one to try many different moisturizers as I find my skin is very picky and prone to breakouts when I switch around. OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer though has not made that struggle real. My face reacted well and feels and looks amazing. I use it morning and night and have noticed a visible difference in both. I'm excited for this product to reach the store shelves in February so I can continue on with my routine. Good job Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using this product for a few days now and if you're looking for a product that evens skin tone appearance, this one is a good one. It's fragrance-free, which is a big plus for me. I will continue to use this product, I recommend it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've avoided using Olay products for years as I have combination skin and, regardless of the type, it always seems to work well at first but then my face gets an oily sheen. It's unfortunate, as I'd love to be able to use a more affordably-priced facial moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Amazing cream! It does everything they are saying: my skin is smooth, bright, ferme and not at all dry. it is the perfect cream for the winter saison. I have a very dry skin and during the winter is worst. So it's very difficult for me to find a cream that not leave my skin greasy. this new cream of olay is the perfect match for me, keeps my skin hydrate all day long. thank you OLAY (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like this as a moisturizer. It absorbs well and doesn't leave my skin sticky. As for the fine lines, age spots and skin tone I don't notice anything different. But I don't feel that a couple of weeks if a fair time to assess those kinds of changes. I don't see big changes as promised but I won't take off stars because I haven't been using the product long enough to make a fair judgement. For now, it a great moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the fact that it did not dry out my face or make it greasy but the sample size just wasn't enough to get the full affect of the product. I personally only got a few days out of the bottle. It's hard to recommend it since I didn't see any changes. I would definitely recommend the Olay brand though, I've always been a fan of the company (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got the opportunity to try the Oil if Olay Total Effects and I really liked it. It's a little bit thicker than I'm used to in a facial moisturizer but it really stands up to the Oil of Olay name. Great product, but pricey (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received a sample of olay total effects to review from bzz agent and i was really happy by the result ,it left my skin noticeably smoother and brighter , it also worked alittle on my dark spots and minimized the look of pores , i think with long use it would leave more effect overall i liked this cream (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Ive been using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 20 days straight and I am a ex smoker so I have wrinkles by my eyes and rough skin and this worked I see a difference my skin tone is looking so good. Im looking a bit younger so if i keep using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I maybe will look few years younger! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The sample size was not enough to get a great idea of how this product will react with my skin. Also, it didn't really seem any different than any other product I have used on my face. The packaging didn't wow me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this product! I've heard about it before but I never came around to purchasing, always thinking that I'm saving myself money. Oh, how wrong I was. It made my wrinkles less noticable and it really evens my skin tone. I feel as I I'm young again. The only thing I didn't like was the smell, but its worth it for its anti-aging effects.

"When i first started using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 I noticed right away how soft it made my skin feel. After a few days the lines and wrinkles disappearing....I really like the soft scent of this product too, normally I cant take many scents but this one was good. I will continue to use this Olay Total Effects till my sample runs out and then will definatly look into buying it!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a hit. I found this moisturizer light which is important for daytime use. It has definitely helped to combat my dry winter skin and to make my skin look healthier. The bottle is aleek and dispenses tge perfect amount each time, taking the guess work out of how much I will need. A great product OLAY! This definitely fits your brand!

In the biginning I was surprise that all I have to do just use it once a day I didn't think it will be enough to fix my face but it works and I'm glad to know there is Olay total effects7 in 1 and the most important I'll put it and forget about it until the next day .love it.

I have been using Olay Total Effects anti- aging moisturizer for about a week now and I am loving it so far! One thing I have noticed is how soft and moisturized my face feels. I have some fine lines on my cheeks and around my eyes but haven't noticed anything as of yet so I cannot comment on that aspect of the cream but my face looks a little brighter and more pleasant. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I tryed it out to see if i could use the product but its scent made me have an asthma attack so instead i let someone i see everyday use it so i could judge by their face. They said they like how it makes their face feel and they are noticing that their skin feels and looks nicer then it did before. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"When I first received the sample, I thought that the bottle was not going to last long since it was so small. But I found that you do not need to use a lot. It goes on easily and smoothly. It's very light and lightly scent (which is great as I can not stand strong scents). After using this product for awhile, my skin is more hydrated and less red. But I do not notice that it has minimize my pores or reduce age spots. Maybe if I continue to use it longer, I will see these benefits too. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really liked using the Olay Total Effects moisturizer. I was so glad that it had a light sheer feel on my face. It wasn't greasy or heavy at all. I think I would prefer an unscented version though. I took the sample away with me on vacation. With all the sun I soaked up, this moisturizer kept my skin smooth and fresh. I really think it has smoothed out the tiny lines at the corner of my eyes too! Yay - speaking as a 52 year old! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
OLAY Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Is not for my sensitive face. I tried it off and on for a week. And every time I broke out in a rash:( And my sun spots got darker :( :( Unfortunately I just have sensitive skin and should've know better then to try something new. But I would like to find something one day that won't hurt my face. Thanks for the sample. And I'll past on the little I have left to a friend to see if they like it.

"I think this is a good product, brand name is very well know & been around for years. However I find for me it didn't work. I broke out I have very sensitive skin. But it has a great smell & goes on very nicely. You need to know if you have sensitive skin and do a test on your neck behind you hairline (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I liked the simplicity of use. It's all in one bottle so no remembering order to apply just get up and wash your face and then again before bed. It truly is that easy. And it helps to notice results quickly. I also liked that there is no oily or dry after effect just pure softness. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 4 weeks now. I've noticed that my skin tone appears more even and my pores look smaller. I use other Olay products in my daily skin care routine and will definitely include this one as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Trying the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer I received from bzz agent. So far not seeing much change in wrinkles or anything but I don't have a lot of visible wrinkles at this point, I think I need to use a little longer. I do like the way the moisturizer feels, it goes on feelig very silky but not greasy and absorbs quickly. My skin is definitely smoother and softer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that Olay has indeed done it again! I always love using Olay products and this one does not disappoint! Before I started using it I wondered if it would be any different but the answer is yes! My skin feels so smooth and soft and is so light you feel like you don't have anything on at all. The trial size is great for fitting in the purse and I find it really takes away my fine lines. If you love Olay like I do, give this a try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It is a great product. I am totally going to make it party of my beauty routine. It does not feel heavy and oily. I have used the product as part of my morning and evening routine for the party week and can see the results. Don't take my words, try it and you will also make the switch!

I have a little age spot by my eye and it does seem to be lightening since I have been using the moisturizer. I can see a bit of difference so far on the fine lines around my eyes so that makes me happy! I would for sure recommend this to others. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this product really works. It is moisturizing, smooth and a little goes a long way. My pores are really big so this help them looks small and petit and presentable. My fine lines have gotten better and the wrinkles looks like they are fading away. This is a good product! Definitely Go try it out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Great product from a trusted name brand. I liked how this moisturizer felt on my skin and love that it's enriched with vitamins to help fight common problems we all have. I would give this product a thumbs up and have recommended it to friends & family. Thanks so much for letting me try it out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I received a sample of Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer cream. The cream had a nice smell and a little went a long way. After the first use my face felt moisturized and softer. It absorbed nicely and didn't feel greasy. However I don't think I looked 10 years younger. As far as a moisturizer goes I would rate this as one of my favourites. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This product clams a lot of things. I found that the fine lines were not as prominent, skin tone didn't seem to change, but perhaps I don't have the uneven skin tone the product talks about. Pores seem a little smaller and tighter skin overall. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I had hopes for this new product to be hydrating as well as helping with anti-aging. I had to stop it after a week because it gave me breakouts and I never break out from anything besides period hormones. I waited a week for my skin to go back to normal and gave the cream another try, only to find out it would breaout my skin once again. I also feel that the cream is too floral for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have now been using this moisturizer for 4 weeks. The consistency is good. No noticeable smell. Goes on feeling non greasy and absorbs well. While it is doing a good job with keeping my face moisturized I have not seen any of the extra benefits that it claims. Fine lines and uneven tone have not shown any improvement. So, no ""visible results"". (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Since using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for almost a month now, I have noticed it minimizes my imperfections and acts as a subtle tint to cover my pores on my fair skin. It is almost a BB Cream in a moisturizer. It also softens my skin and allows it to look more glowing and radiant. A very amazing product for an amazing price. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As of late, I've been suffering from uneven skin tone, large pores, and the beginning states of fine lines. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has brightened and firmed my skin, and reduced the look of fine lines around my mouth and eyes. I have oily skin, and it reduces the look of my pores without feeling greasy or heavy: my skin is left moisturized and firm. This is an affordable alternative to expensive department store moisturizers; it works!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this is one of the best I have used, my dry skin loved it! I don't usually wear makeup, with the Olay moisturizer on the makeup didn't make my skin feel dry or heavy. Skin instantly feels better! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The first day I used Oil Total Effects, I was very impressed by how soft my face felt. I enjoyed the smell of the product as well! Unfortunately Oil Total Effects was too oily for my skin and after a week of using it I had quite a few break outs. If I didn't have sensitive skin, it would be the perfect product for my daily facial routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Just started using this product and after 2 days, and talking to a friend about it, no difference. Of course, it's too early to tell but overall I like the product. Good coverage, not a strong scent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I can't believe the power in this little bottle. Miracle worker and a new staple in my daily routine. My skin looked great and noticeable better after only a few applications. I saw age spots almost vanish and skin tone was much more even. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have to be honest, I LOVE moisturizers. I have tried many in the past and I have to say I was not that impress with this one. It does unify the skin tone and moisturize it but I did not notice anything else special. Not a big difference for the wrinkles which I was looking for. I had heard many good comments about this lotion in the past so I will definitely give it another chance but for now I'm am not too impress. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have only used this a few times and I'm not liking the tacky feel that my skin has after using this lotion, which is why I have not used it everyday. I will give it another try and hope I have a better experience (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! Another score for Olay! The moisturizer has just the right amount of scent and it keeps my skin smooth and soft. I would recommend this to anyone that wants smoother, softer skin with some anti-aging effects. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
although it smells nice and was an ok moisturizer the product did nothing along the lines of anti aging or improving upon the way my skin has already aged over the years. i even tried to simply use it on one half of my face for comparison purposes and there were still no discernable results after 7 days (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was skeptical to try this product at first. I have a great face Moisturizer that I've been using for years, but I decided to give it a try and I am definitely impressed. My skin tone has evened out and any blotchy spots have almost disappeared. My skin feels hydrated and stays hydrated during the day. I also don't have to worry about any perfume smell. This product delivers! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am loving Olay total effects seven in one anti-aging cream. It is so light weight silky and smooth and makes my skin feel fantastic. It is so hard to find a cream that combines all the benefits of an anti-aging cream in a nice light moisturizer most are heavy, cakey and leave a film on your skin, but no Olay's!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
as thi is a Olay product and because its reputation follows it this product is just delicious. I am 37 years old and beginning to see the importance of have wrinkle and or aging products to protect my skin. The smell is great. The texture is soft and soothing. I use it everyday and i do see the difference. I have been using it for the last 2 weeks and I have nothing negative (ok maybe the price to come) to say about this product. Thanks Buzz agent ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was given this product to sample. When I got it, I was with my mom. We both tried it out. (I think she was hoping i would give it to her). We both like how easy and smooth the product went off. I also really liked that it didn't leave my face feeling like I needed to add more, as often my face can be left feeling dry. My mom said this will be a product she will be purchasing in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It hasn't been a full four weeks yet since I started using this moisturizer, but I like what I see so far! It's another high-quality product from Oil of Olay, leaving my skin feeling really moisturized and generally healthier than before I started using it. I will be back to write more after four weeks. In the meantime, I would recommend picking up a bottle as soon as you can. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Though, the cream is light, pleasant smelling, and is absorbed really quickly into the skin but even after two weeks of using it day and night I cannot see much difference in the way my face looks or feels. It was not for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This was a good moisturizer, but I found that it did not smooth my fine lines oe minimize the look of my pores. It did even my skin tone and replenish moisture. My face also seemed brighter. Overall it was ok, but I think I'll stick with my regular face cream (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this product for a while now and have seen improvements on my skin being moisturized and evening my skin tones. I don't need this cream (for now ;)for the primarily advertised effects of wrinkles, age spot, etc therefore I cannot speak for those but I do like how a little bit goes a long way as not much cream is needed, which makes the travel size perfect. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I had a hard time with this product, the smell was too strong and irritated my nose for a few hours. I really didn't get the chance to use it long enough to see any differences. The texture was very nice and it felt ok on... A little great at first. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've used this daily since receiving it and haven't found that it's moisturizing very well. Even when I've used it a few times a day. It isn't evening out my skin tone either. Overall, not impressed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The moisturizer is feeling great when putting it on, and i like the light texture. However i havent seen results in regard to fine lines etc. The product looks great in its package and i love the pump design to much easier to get a good amount. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the olay total effects 7 in 1. It leaves my skin feeling soft, and i really notice a difference when I use it. My only concern is the smell... I find it has a very strong scent that I am not keen on. Maybe olay can release a non-scented one. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I put some in my hand and instantly loved the texture and weight of the lotion, not too thick or heavy and silky smooth. I love the way it feels on my skin and my skin feels extra soft since I've started using it but, I've seen no improvement in tone, scarring or fine lines. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This face moisturizer is fantastic! I regularly use the original olay cream as a daily moisturizer so I was curious to try this product and see how it compared. It has a smooth silky texture and great smell. It also gives an overall glow to your face that the regular olay doesn't. While it may be too light for the winter, it is perfect for summer wear as it is light and protects your skin! I would recommend this product for people with oily skin or who like a light, weightless moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So, after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for over a month, I have started seeing some nice results. My skin tone is even. My morning redness isn't as bad, and my face feels nice and smooth. My under eyes don't look quite as frightful as they did prior to using this moisturizer. I'm just sad that my sample is almost finished :( I wish the sample had been bigger, as now I have to wait until February before it's available again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Whenever I have tried products like these, my complaint is always that the product is too greasy. But this wasn't greasy at all! I can't tell you how happy I was that it wasn't greasy. I would buy it this! My only complaint is that the pump dispensing the product is so thin, that it gets clogged up after every use. So everytime I use the product, the nozzle is plugged, hence product is being wasted. Other than that, I love this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I noticed a difference in the dark circles under my eyes within a few days of using Olay Total Effects... This product made my skin feel great and I think it did reduce the fine lines making me look and feel younger and more beautiful! Also has an amazing scent! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been applying this lotion regularly for the past 2 weeks in the morning after cleansing my face. This moisturizer is good. It absorbs well into my skin and you do not need to use a lot. However, I would rate this product as average. I have not seen any noticeable difference in my skin since using it. Disclosure: I received a free sample as part of a campaign from BzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this is the most amazing thing that Oil of Olay has come out with yet! I am a firm believer in their products and use their facewash and moisturizer everyday, but this was the topping on the cake! It significantly reduced lines, age spots, and evened out my skin to look like a teenager again! I LOVE IT! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Olay Total Effects went on smooth and did not feel greasy at all. I love the unique vitamin complex which helps fight the 7 signs of aging such as age spots and uneven skin tone. I have noticed that my uneven skin tone is starting to be less visible. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I thought it was a good moisturizer. I found it went on matte and helped somewhat hide the look of pores and some skin imperfections. But within a couple hours, my face became overwhelmingly oily and I experienced a couple break outs. I did not notice any difference with fine lines, wrinkles or pores getting smaller. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this produce was a good moisturizer, it smells great and feels very nice on the skin. However, there wasn't enough of the product in the sample to really use it for the time period. Didn't really notice any difference in my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I did like the scent of this product, it wasn't over bearing which is a nice change from other similar products. However, having said that, I didn't find that it actually did anything. My face did feel somewhat smoother but that is about it. It did nothing for my uneven skin tone and I found no difference in the fine lines on my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This lotion felt very nice on the skin; smooth, supple after application. In all honesty, I quite enjoy the product, however have not been able to discern an overly noticeable difference overall in my skin. I have avoided dry winter skin thus far, though, so perhaps that's been a perk of this product, I like to think? (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I wanted to try this product before I write up my review. I have been using this product for two weeks now and so far I have not seen any significant difference other than slightly smother skin. I will be doing another review when my four weeks are up and see if there is any changes. the moisturizer is light and was not greasy when applying. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I honestly only used the Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer once. The smell made me gag. The moisturizer was incredibly greasy and I woke up the next morning and had broken out. I really wish I could give this a better review. But for me this just did not do it for me. I have had good experiences with Olay in the past, but the products I have used must have been a different scent or scent free. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really appreciated its discreet scent. I see that my skin is softer than before, with an healthier tone. However, since I'm only 28 and do not have wrinkles yet, it's hard for me to say if it really works for this... But I would certainly recommand to my friends and ciblings that are older than me to try it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm only beginning to use Olay total effects so no visible results just yet but my skin is being well moisturized I had flaky skin before and now I don't so that's a good sign that more results will come. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this sample size product from Bzzagent to try for free.It took the dark circles away from under my eyes,smoothed out the fine lines around my eyes,and it noticeably moisturized my skin.I would recommend this product to anyone it does work... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"while I cant speak to the claim that it will make you look "" 10 years younger in 4 weeks""...the trial size isn't large enough to last 4 weeks... I loved the moisturizer. I used it day and night. I love the way it feels on my skin. it is luxuriously smooth and nourishing without being heavy or greasy. It soaks in nicely and is great under my make up during the day. I guess I will have to buy the full size product to really test out the ""age-rewind"" properties. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is by far the best skin care product I have tried in a long time. It makes my skin feel soft and bright. It goes on and absorbs well and does help with wrinkles. This is a keeper for me and I will buy this one for sure. Another bonus no break outs :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
My BzzKit finally arrived and I am excited to try the new Olay product. Olay typically is a great product line and I look forward to seeing if this product lives up to the claims. First use I noted that the cream goes on smoothly and did not leave my face feeling greasy or heavy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I used Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 faithfully. Although I didn't see my skin look any younger during my use, it was softer. I finished the bottle the day before yesterday. The cream was not thick but thin and went on fantastic. I'm not sure of the price but if it is reasonable I would probably give a full bottle a try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"#GotItFree hashtag, along with @OlayUS to join the OlayÂ® Total Effects conversation I tried that free product for at least a week. Iloved it! My skin is smooth with it and it's easy to used it. It smell good and my face feel better and look like it's younger. Really a good face product , need to try it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer went on smooth without leaving my fingers feeling oily, but I found the scent a little strong for me. I also didn't notice any difference with my skin after usage. I'm normally a fan of Olay products, but I think I will pass on this one. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'm still loving this after over 2 weeks of using it. My skin is healthier looking, glowing and my pores are almost non-exsitent. I keep telling my family and friends they should really being using this product that they don't know what their missing (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My skin can be very senative with different face creams. I sometimes breakout when trying a new one. But, so far my skin is soft and great looking. With no irritation. Provided I keep seeing these great results I would absolutely buy the product in the future (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I don't think I look 10 years younger but I love this product! My sample was not enough I had to run out and by myself a full-size! It really does moisturize and firm my skin and I have noticed a mild reduction in fine lines! I totally recommend this product! A ""must-try"" for ladies, like me, that are starting to show our age (40+). I love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am in love with with this product. I have already finished my bottle and can not wait to buy it in stores! I use it every morning and at bed time and find it keeps my face nice a smooth. The dark circles under my eyes are not as dark, my face just looks over all healthier. I would recommend everyone to use this ! I have told all my friends and family about it and have had people ask me what I have been doing different and telling them all about this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really loved the olay effects! Infact I love the olay brand itself! However I did not notice much change. I was a bit let down by the product but that may have just been my experience. I still think it's worth to try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This stuff is amazing. I know of this moisturizer because my mom uses it all the time. . I use to have many dry patches, and dark spots. I'm only 29 but skincare is extremely important to me. I'm very picky when it comes to skin care products. Olay is the only drugstore brand I find that actually works and is worth buying. I deff recommend this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Winter months are always very tough on my skin.. This moisturizer is great for keeping it hydrated. I'm currently pregnant and noticed more lines on my skin in the last month or so.. Which I'm sure just has to do with pregnancy. I'd like to give this another shot next year. Works even better when I exfoliate first. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
The OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a beautiful moisturizer. The scent is light and pleasant. It is moisturizing without being heavy. The pump dispenses the perfect amount of cream and my skin feels fresh and clean after application. It's a great product to help with the effects of aging. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Both of the ladies I got to try this were stunned by the results. Their skin looks lighter, appears smoother and the fine lines are still teir but they are much less noticeable. Its almost like there is a light reflector or something because they are glowing. They also seem to have more confidence and smile alot more now. Its amazing what a simple, great and inexpensive moisturizer can do for a lady on the outside and the inside. Great product great results (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
i think this is a great product.it goes on very smooth.i only put it on at nite before bed.i found that doing it twice a day was to much felt heavy on my face.it does make my pores seem smaller.bonus for that .i would recomend this product . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer for several weeks now, and I've noticed a subtle improvement in my fine lines. My laugh lines and the lines between my eyebrows are less noticeable, my skin feels softer and smoother. The moisturizer is creamy with a strong scent so I only use it at night, but it seems to be working! And it is certainly cheaper and safer than a facelift! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is wonderful. It makes my skin soft and not greasy feeling at all. Other products I have used have caused my skin to break out as well but nothing like that with this one. It has only been a few days but I love this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've now been using the trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisurizer for 4 weeks. This product is everything it says it is. A little goes a long way!! I have noticed my lines around my eyes and forehead have reduced, my skin is firmer, brighter and an even more skin tone. This is a product I definitely would recommend to friends and family to use and buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Although I don't look 10 years younger, my skin does have a new fresh brightness to it. I can also say that this Olay product is the best moisturizer I have ever used, and will without a doubt recommend this product to anybody looking for a great moisturizer that gives your skin a nice even skin tone and brightness. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this a great product for moisturizer. However as an anti-aging cream it doesn't work. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have noticed no change at all. It is a little oily but works great if you have dry skin. It also doesn't effect my sensitive skin. I would continue to use as a moisturizer as i like the way it works. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried Olay product about fifteen years ago when I was a young adult. I never tried it back... And I won't... The fragrance is for me horrible. Easy to apply but I fee like my skin is left oily for few hour. So most of the time, I rip the moisturize off and put other product on. I didn't noticed any change on my skin. :( I won't buy Olay product for long time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I didn't see a huge change. First few days my skin was more hydrated but then it got red and dry. I blame my pregnancy and winter weather. I think I'll try this product again AFTER I give birth, just to be fair. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was excited to try this creme and tried it out for 2 weeks but unfortunately I broke out each time. I do not have acne prone skin so this was strange. I didn't find it particularly hydrating either. The smell was nice though! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Better than I expect, my skin felt great! I know about this product but never tried it. Will definitely purchase it! You will not be disappointed, it's a rich cream that enhances your skin. Glides on smoothly and is quickly absorbed. It does not make your makeup slip. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am loving this moisturizer. I have very dry skin and rosecea. Not the best skin combo. I love how light this formula is, it isn't thick or oily. It has helped the lines around my eyes. It also keeps my face moisturized for hours. I do not have to reapply and reapply. i will purchase in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"With the winter air drying out my skin, I have been really interested in switching moisturizers from my usual one (Neutrogena) to Olay Total Effects. After switching my skin routine to Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer my skin has looked amazing and radiant. It leaves my skin perfectly moisturized without being oily and the tone has evened out! I absolutely love it and I would definitely recommend to friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've had the product for some time and it's ok. It doesn't have much of an effect on me at all. I think that my skin is a little less dry but other than that there doesn't seem to be much benefit. I'll keep trying it and see if there's any effect with further applications. The product seems to be more like a makeup thing for me. I don't think this would be a priority for me to purchase. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried the new trial size of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Not only did it come in a convenient size, but it really made my face feel smooth. I could see that the wrinkles starting around my eyes softened a little bit after using it for a few weeks - colour me impressed! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Im so grateful i got a chance to try out this product. Ive always wanted to try before i buy. This cream goes a long way. its so sily and smooth and smells great. I havent noticed much differences with my skin but i do feel smoother. I will continue to use this cream and will be purchasing a larger bottle for future use. I really do enjoy olay products.

"when l started olay 7 l love how it makes my skin feel, and also my skin looks and feels great after each use. l have noticed some of my wrinkles are getting smaller and l have 2 age spots very noticeable on my cheeks they are fading away..l cant wait to buy olay total effects 7 when it hits the stores. l give this product a 5 out of 5 on this one.thanks for picking me to try it.

"I was kind of skeptical when I first got this because I was thinking, ""I feel like I'm too young to be using anti-aging products."" NOT ANYMORE. This stuff was amazing. It absorbs great and it doesn't leave a greasing feeling. I have combination skin and it's hard finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me look super oily. When I use it, my skin looks and feels a lot better. I definitely recommend this to anyone (even if you're 25) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this product. It is nice and light and doesn't feel heavy on my face. I have also noticed that my dark spots are diminishing. I went out and bought a bottle as this will now be my moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Took a shower after exercising and then applied the lotion on my face after cleansing and it felet awesome. Olay anti aging facial lotion keeps me away from dry skin. This is especially good when during the winter. Even suitable for people under 40 s to use it. Always good to care the skin from aging. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"this is the best stuff. I like it so much I even ask for some for Christmas. I like how it feels and smells, it definitely has reduced my wrinkles especially my crows feet and the lines on my forehead as well. And it makes my face feel soft all day and night when with most creams that soft feeling goes away after a couple of hours. Will definitely keep using this everyday. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I gave the oil of olay total effects moisturiser 5 stars. It's a nice everyday cream. My skin is brighter and smoother already. I like the pump style bottle. You can get just the right amount. A little goes a long way with this cream. Thanks bzzagent and oil of olay for the sample. I will recommend it to my friends (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
The cream felt nice but I have not noticed any real difference in my face. I don't know if given enough time there would be any kind of difference but I am out of the sample. Sorry but I won't buy a full size product without at least seeing real progress from the sample size. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is OK. But it's not great. It is a light, non-greasy formula that easily absorbs into my skin. But it leaves my skin still feeling a bit dry. The scent is too strong for my liking and I found the pump on the bottle to be temperamental. As yet I haven't noticed any difference to fine lines, but I'll keep going with it for a bit longer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this product is excellent! Not only does it smell so good but you can notice how soft your skin is after several uses! Also, my face has been glowing and super moisturized. I love this product and I think I will definitely consider buying it! I noticed some fine liner were not as noticeable and it even evened out some of my un even skin tone spots. This product is great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was very dissapointed with this product. First of all, it smelled like an old lady dropped her perfume in the cream. Not very interesting. Second, even though I used the cream every day, twice a day, my skin didn't feel or look different. So that was a let down... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

"I'm so worried because I know I will run put of product before it hits the shelves in February....I keep checking it out in every store I am in...just in case. This is the most highly rated product I have ever sampled, it is just awesome and great, i find after just a couple of weeks of using it I have reduced redness in my facial area and a smoother complexion, It feels great going on and a little goes a log way, the light texture smooths on easily and the faint scent is fresha nd light.

"As a Bzz agent, I got a free chance to try Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mositurizer and I love it! A soft fragrance and a perfect consistency were the top two features for me. My skin feels so my softer and the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable after using this produc for about two weeks. It's not greasy at all and absorbs very quickly. I went out to buy a full-sized bottle for myself since the sample is almost gone. I can't say enough about this cream! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received a sample size of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer to try for free from BzzAgent. While its difficult to say for sure how well the product works when only trying a trial size version I do like Olay's new moisturizer as its left my skin tone very even and balance particularly when using under make up. The product goes on smoothly and is not greasy nor does it make my skin oily. Smells good and seems to work well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love the Olay total effects! I grew up with my mom always using Olay products. Everyone used to ask her secret, and other then good genes, she would say Olay! The total effects is great! Adds a touch of concealer, moisturizers, minimizes the look of pores and made my face beautiful! Thanks Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have sensitive skin and i found the first 2 weeks it was worse but I wanted to tough it out. Now my skin looks awesome. My face is nice and evenly toned. I have noticed some of the smaller wrinkles are reducing. My face feels nice and smooth. But most of all it stays moisturized. I don't feel like I have to re apply during the day. In fact it still feels moisturized in the morning. I will be buying this cram when it runs out. Thanks for letting me try it bzzAgent! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I never tried this product before, but now that I did I can say I'm impressed. It's not greasy, it's thick, doesn't irritate my skin and it smells very good. I've noticed that every morning, when I wake up, my skin is very vibrant. I use the product 2 times a day (morning and evening) and I love it because it keeps my skin hydrated, smooth and vibrant â¦ I really see the difference now. I really recommend this product! It's a great product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really enjoy this anti-aging cream. I have been using this before I go to bed and have noticed a change in my skin. I really like how this has a pump, as opposed to having to dig the cream out. It is very sanitary to have a pump. I will be repurchasing this. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"What more could one ask for in a moisturizer! It worked. The fact also that it did not break me out nor cause me a skin rash is a huge selling point for my sensitive skin. I'm still using the moisturizers , looking forward to uncovering even more benefits! :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This product would be a great for someone with normal to oily skin or great for my skin if it were summer. This dried out my skin so much that I had to stop using it so I can't give a review on anything this product is claiming to do. It smells great and it absorbs good it just doesn't have the amount of moisture my skin needs during the cold winter months. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This is one of the best moisturizer I ever tried. It went on smooth and dried quickly. My pores looked smaller and my skin looked brighter. My makeup went on more smoothly. My fine lines did not show through the makeup. One of the best product I ever tried. Will recommend it to all my friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Smells fresh & clean. I have acne prone skin so I am concerned about products that feel oily/greasy. I didn't break out any more than usual & I'm able to wear my regular makeup without issue. I didn't really notice any change in my pores but it does moisturize well. My face did feel firmer. I don't have wrinkles so I can't speak to that. Over all, I'd have to buy full size and use for longer to determine if the 7 effects are true. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was excited to try this product but was a little disappointed in it. I have not seen or felt any changes to my skin. I usually use coconut oil and I find it did a better job than this cream. I had high expectations as I have used other Olay products in the past and liked them. It did not leave my face feeling greasy though, it does go on very nice and is very light feeling. I was hoping it would have faded some of my lines and faint spots. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think it is a very good overall moisturizer. I have very sensitive and allergic skin, and this did not have any adverse reactions to my face, which truly surprised me. I've had lots of stress, so I don't notice change that way, like wrinkles being slightly diminished, but my skin was much softer, and hydrated, without being oily at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I noticed some difference with Total Effects. My skin was a little brighter and my skin tone was little better. I just wish this product didn't make my skin oily. I think it would be better if I didn't have combination skin. I think they should make on specifically for oily prone skin (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer lives up to its promise of making skin feel firmer. I use facial moisturizers all the time and noticed a difference in my skin's firmness using this product, more so than the comparable brands I have tried in the past. I believe the unique vitamin complex contributed to making my skin feel younger, evening out my skin tone and reducing the look of fine lines. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is the product I was looking for... Affordable and does what it suppose to do...hydryte refine lines and the best make my skin more even. It really make me feel good make me feel like I take care of my skin better I will recommend this product for sure!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am not too old myself but after using this for just 1 week, I feel like i look younger and have even had people saying I look younger now. I used to have fine lines under both of my eyes and after using this for a week they have almost disappeared! I will definitely continue using this and will buy this product when it comes in stores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really liked using Olay Total Effects 7, my face looks and feels great. This time of year I have a tough time with dry skin, but this has made a world of difference. Thank you for the opportunity to try this product, I will definitely but it when it is available in stores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really like using this cream not only does it help with wrinkles and dark spots but it helps with everything. Its a 7 in one and I really like that I don't have to go buy different products for different effects it does it all. I like that it has antiaging and helps with uneven skin tone. I am really loving using this product that I have even gone as far as getting rid of all my single bottle stuff and using just olay total effects saves me money and I only need one bottle love it. #GotItFree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After trying the vast majority of moisturizers on the market, Olay Total Effects is the clear winner! It is not oily and leaves your skin feeling refreshed! It reduces fine lines, age sports and wrinkles! There is no moisturizers that have worked in such little time (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My favorite aspect of Olay total effects is the fact that it does not leave my face feeling oily. Its a really nice light, unscented moisturizer. haven't realty noticed if it has made me look younger but I do notice a more even tone to my skin. Definitely worth buying. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It is nice to use Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. After using it , my skin is definitely improved. My fine lines reduced. My age spots is lighter. My skin tone has been improved. I really like olay (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product is light weight, non-greasy, and very moisturizing. I have not used it long enough, in my opinion, to determine if I gained positive results from all the 7 benefits promised by this product. I would however recommend and buy this products based on how moisturizing light weight and non-greasy it is. I really like this moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have tried several Olay products in the past and was excited to try this new version. I applied it twice a day. I was told on two separate occasions in the last week that I look like I haven't aged in years. My skin is definitely more hydrated and plumper. I look forward to continuing with Olay as part of my routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was skeptical at first, as I wasn't sure if the product delivered. But now all I can say is wow! It really does provide all those effects, and I one convenient bottle. I love how moisturized my face really feels. My skin really glows. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the size of the bottle, but not much else. Before this product, I was using a RoC anti-wrinkle cream, which I happen to like a lot more than this Olay one and I think it's a lot better quality, with better active ingredients. I don't like the texture and feel of this cream, it makes my skin feel greasy, and I already have oily skin. I'm hesitant to use it regularly as I don't want it to cause me to break out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like this product. I wish I had enough of a sample to finish the four weeks, but after 2.5 weeks my skin feels softer, smoother and firmer. My skin tone is more even and brighter. It goes on nicely, it's not sticky or greasy. It has a light, subtle scent which is great because I'm sensitive to over powering fragrances. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make their skin look a little brighter, smoother and softer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I absolutely loved half this product! It was very light compared to other anti ageing moisturizers that i have tried. The texture was almost airy it was so light! Although it said it was unscented it did have a very very light scent to it that was pleasant. I used it everyday for at least a week and i enjoyed it. I did feel that it was not as moisturizing on some days where the weather and wind left my face feeling drier than usual. All in all i would purchase this product in a full size! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I thoroughly have enjoyed using this sample. My skin had seemed brighter and tighter. I use it nightly. I wouldn't say this is just for wrinkles it is for all skin to lift it up. It doesn't leave my oily like other creams have. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The new Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 product is great. The cream is soft and light on my face when I use it. It doesn't make my face feel greasy at all. Within a week you could see the difference. My skin was soft, bright and glowing. I would recommend to everyone, start a routine with this product! Def. worth the money!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think Olay Total Effects 7 I in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a really good product. It helps to reduce fine lines and uneven skin tone. The age spot on my cheek is lighter. That surprised me consider I spend a lot of time in the sun. This product is not heavily scented. I recommend this product. I like it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this product is really good for the moisture... leaves your skin soft and less wrinkle lines, they should also say helps with acne cause i have some now and since ive benn using #olay total effects 7in1, that i have less. Overall an excellent product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this product ! I have even gotten out to buy the big bottle! Everything it claims to do it does and more , i feel like I dont have to use concealer and whatnot anymore ! My face is smooth and my pores are tight ! I also love the smell, smells way better than some other brands ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
unfortunately i got a rash from it... not sure why...skin is very sensitive... i thought maybe this wouldnt however i was wrong... i did let a friend use it and she loves it she will be purchasing product in the future :)... she really love this product...

"I noticed that the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer goes on feeling a bit heavy. Once it is on though, I got used to it and my skin felt amazing! It helped my skin feel and look less dry, and seemed to take away those fine lines. Love using it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've used the trial size Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer daily for a few weeks now. I do like that it has a nice soft scent and it is light and non-greasy on my skin. I do feel like it firms my skin after I first apply it. I haven't really noticed my fine lines diminishing yet though. Maybe I just need to use it for longer. Overall I am happy with it and will continue to use it. I like that it came in trial size and that the trial size will soon be available for other consumers to try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have never tried any Olay products before trying Total Effects Anti agin moisturizer and I have to say it's the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I have sensitive skin and my skin was fine, it's never been better. I am forever an Olay girl. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I has been using it for two weeks and my skin is more smooth, with less fine lines and less age spots. If I do not use it, I feel my skin dry, tired but when I use it evens my skin appearance, minimized the looks of my pores and my skin is more firm and moisture. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The trial sized version of Olay Total Effects is good for use in an overnight bag, or tossed in your purse for spot treatments. Its small size may not be the best for a full on sample of its benefits, but it does offer good moisture, if anything. This would be good for someone with mature skin who is looking for a light, dewey look. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and I love the difference I see in me. Usually I look worn out and tired but since I started using this Moisturizer every night before bed I look vibrant and ""awake"". It goes on smooth, easy to use and my skin loves it. I look 10 years younger. Thanks Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have nothing but a positive experience with Olay Total Effects. It made my skin so unbelievably soft and smooth. It was non-greasy, the scent was subtle and pleasant. It did exactly what it claimed to do. I will definitely be asking for this on my Christmas list! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this is the best moisturizer around #olaytotaleffect7in1 #bzzagent #tryforfree; my personal experience is it easy to apply, non greasy, reduces fine lines and wrinkles especially around my eyes, by skin tone is refresh glowing and even tone, my skin feels firmer and my pores do not show especially on my nose where they were more prominent. Fantastic product - will now use on a regular basis!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects is okay as a moisturiser, but maybe you need to use it longer to get the full benefits of the 7 claims. It goes on smoothly and feels silky, but is eventually a little greasy feeling (glowing is a nicer word) after a few hours. If your skin is very dry, this might be a good choice. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Although i didnt see younger healthier skin, the olay total effects 7 in 1 did make my face softer so thats a plus. I'm sure if I continued to use this product longer I would notice the difference. It is a great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have combination skin. That awful oily T-zone with dry cheeks. This moisturiser gave me balanced nourishment without causing me to break out. It went on silky smooth and did not make me feel oily or shiny. The smell was really neutral and pleasant (I really can't handle a strong odour for facial creams). I would definitely use this one again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this from to review and have been using it now for a few days. I really like that it doesn't make my skin oily but just moisturized enough because I do tend to have dry skin. Totally helped changed the look of my skin when I need to go without makeup. Love it and will continue to use it! A++ (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using the cream now for a few weeks since I received it and I feel so much better. Some lines on my face seem to have gone and I have even gotten some compliments on how my skin looks. I would defiantly purchase this, continue using it and recommend this to my friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I enjoyed using Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and it did not irritate it at all. It was light while still moisturizing. My skin tends to get really dry in the winter months and i found that this did the trick without being too heavy. I didn't notice a great difference in some of the fine line on my face, but that could be because it was not a full size bottle. Would recommend to others! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using Olay moisturizers for over 10 years and for some reason this one dried my skin out instead of moisturizing it. It feels greasy going on which also disappointed me. I've always loved play as a brand, and the moisutrizer I'm used to using has never dried my skin the way this one has. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 delivered. I have very sensitive skin that typically does not respond well but after using Olay Total Effects my skin was smooth and had a glow about it that not only I noticed but others commented on it as well. Goes on light but moisturizes well. Will be adding this product to my daily routine for sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this is one of the best moisterizer ever that I have tried ( other than my regular one offcourse). I have been Olay customer for over a decade but they don't manufacture the white cream anymore so having a chance to try this OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was a welcome gift for me. It not only feels great on my skin but blends so well as If I dont have any cream on my face. It also makes my skin soft and bright. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have never used Olay moisturiser before but I really like this stuff. It doesnt leave your skin feeling greasy but really moisturiser your face. I love the smell too! Its got just enough scent to it so smell nice but now over power you. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now. First impression is that I like the texture (not a watery cream, also not a heavy cream, somewhere in the middle). But it does have a strong scent and not one I like unfortunately. My skin does feel moisturized but I will continue to use it and see if the other supposed benefits are happening. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this is a great product it smells nice and feel great on my face. I am glad I got to try this before I bought it to see how it felt on my face and would definitely be purchasing this product in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really like this product! It's actually working for me...I've noticed a big difference in my fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes..they are barely visible now. My pores have also shrunk too.I would recommend this to people for sure. Thank you Buzzagent! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received Olay Toral Effects 7in 1 to try. I loved the feeling on my skin. It wasn't greasy or sticky like some others are. The results took a few days to notice, but it showed that I was using something. A must buy for your daily routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
What I know about this product so far is that it is inexpensive and comes in a trial size. Perfect for people wanting to trial without buying a full size bottle. I have just been trialing this for a short time but so far I am experiencing silky smooth skin. I look forward to the Anti-aging results. My skin no longer has the dry patches I usually get in the winter time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am always a bit skepticle when it comes to wrinkle creams. I feel like if you don't spend a fortune then don't bother. So I am a bit surprised at the effects I see from Olay Total Effects. My skin feels smoother, and looks smoother. It even looks brighter and more even. I have one age spot and it has been minimized. I will definitely become a regular user! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was so excited to receive the Oil of Play Total Effects sample and I was not disappointed. The cream feels luxurious, has a very nice mild scent and absorbs quickly. I felt like I was really pampering myself. So far after using the product daily for 5 days I have noticed that my skin tone appears more even, my skin looks smoother and it's not as dry as it usually is at this time of year. So far, total thumbs up!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am really enjoying the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti ageing moisturizer. It's silky smooth and smells nice. I have yet to really notice whether or not the anti ageing properties are working yet as its only been 2 weeks. However, I do know that my skin feels smooth and healthy. Only more time will tell! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been waiting a while to write this review to give this product a try. It feels nice on my skin. I have sensitive skin and my acne has gotten worse ever since I tried this product. If it weren't for that, I would continue using it and consider buying it. My skin did however feel soft and hydrated after I used the Olay Total Effects. I have also mentioned this product to my mother who is thinking about trying it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using this product for about a week now, and although I haven't seen great improvements with my 38 year old fine lines, I do have to say I'm very impressed with the overall feel of it. My skin is wonderfully soft and the scent of this product is great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It effectively reduces the appearance of pores, wrinkles and age spots. The effects of damage is also reduced. It leaves the skin hydrated, firmer, healthy, radiant, even and smooth. People also tell me that I have a radiant skin since I use Olay total effects. The only downside is the fragrance too strong. I would opt instead for the odorless version. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the Olay Totla Effects was pretty good. I don't really have many lines yet. But I did notice the few around my eyes were diminished, and it did make my skin feel good. I really liked the mild scent, and it's not a heavy cream that just sits on your skin. I liked how you don't have to use a lot of the product, a little seemed to go a long way. I would purchase this product, just because of how good the cream makes my skin feel, and who wants crepey looking eyes? (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It's moisturizing, but I couldn't get past the scent. I am somewhat sensitive to perfumes, but I am not so badly allergic or anything, but this was just too strong. It gave me a headache. I don't understand why any skincare line would put perfume in a product like this (that goes on your face). It's not necessary and what's worse is that I think that is what caused a breakout. I don't recommend this at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got to try the trial sized version of this for free from Bzz Agent. I loved how it worked to even out my skin and to help decrease my fine lines. I just didn't like that it made my chin break out in some pimples though. Everything else about it was great though! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I've had the opportunity to try a few great campaigns from BzzAgent and they have all been positive. This is the first one I'm not happy with. Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the product ( rash and swelling) and I can't recommend it to anyone. Obviously pictures are not a good idea. I know Olay is a very popular brand so I am sure this is not the norm and obviously my skin does not agree with the product. I have given it 1 star but only because it can't be blank.

"I noticed a brighter complexion after only a couple of days of using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I noticed a few of my fine lines seemed less visible. On the downside, though, I found it irritated some of my skin and left it a bit red and itchy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think olay total effects 7 is amazing. My fine lines and wrinkles especially around my eyes are definitely smoother. My skin tone is more even. I even have a brightness to my skin it glows. My age spot are less visible and cannot see my pores on my nose. My skin is firmer like I was a teenager again. #olaytotaleffects7inone must try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly into my skin leaving it feeling soft. It doesn't feel greasy. You don't have to use a lot of this product, as a little goes a long way. It smells really good. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the product is a good moisturizer. My skin tends to dry out pretty quickly but this one keeps it moisturized. As for the anti-aging effects, so far I haven't noticed a big difference in my fine lines and uneven skin tone. I haven't used it for that long so hopefully I will start seeing the effects it claims to bring about. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I used this product until the bottle was empty and went to purchase. I took several pictures along the way and noticed a visible difference around my eyes and mouth. It was hard to find and expensive however a little does go a long way. As a consumer, I would want to know the potential benefits of the product. I would also like clear instruction on the best time of day to reap the most benefit. This was not explained on the package or instructions. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer made my skin more even toned plumper with less fine lines. It worked well under makeup but had to make sure it was all smoothed in or an unabsorbed patch will dry ballys rubs off. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am familiar with the okay brand, but I always think of it as a product for older woman. I don't have many issues with skin aging or wrinkles. After trying Total effects 7 in 1 my mind has changed! The scent is soft as well and the cream itself. After using it for a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin! It was softer, smoother and the fine lines seem gone. I am very happy with this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

"As i said in the Bzz Report earlier, i tried this product for over a week, but I'm not seeing the promised effects in the advertising. i have had breakouts since I began using it and at my age, this is really not acceptable. I am ceasing the use of the sample and going back to my previous moisturizer. I expected a different result and am disappointed. This won't stop me from trying new moisturizers in the future. I think that this is just a bad trial for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Normally I'm skeptical of anti-aging products. I was uncertain when testing Olay Total Effects, but had a positive experience from the very first time I used.

"I think Olay total Effects 7 in Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a must for maturing skin. It has a lovely texture, goes on smoothly without an oily feeling. After using it a week I had a co-worker ask what I'm using on my face because my skin looks so soft and smooth. I highly recommend it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have wanted to try this product for a while now and was so glad to receive the trial size. It makes my face feel so smooth and the fragrance is very nice too. I am going to continue using it for all the full benefits of this product. I have always liked olay products and this is my new favour te cream and I'm sure you will agree with me upon your use of it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I recently quit smoking. This product couldn't have come at a better time as I had noticed what smoking had done to my skin over the years. I noticed the difference almost right away!

I have used OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few days only but I had to stop because even it I loved the texture it made my skin dryer.

Love ...love ...love this. I was so excited to try this product and I wasn't disappointed. The moisturizer is light and weightless and made my skin feel great.

The box has all the information you would need to know before purchasing this item. From the time you take the bottle out of the box I was impressed. I like the colours and the sleekness of the shape. When you squeeze the lotion onto your finger it feels so smooth. Goes onto your face so nice and has a nice smell. Does not feel greasy on your face at all. Would buy this product and will share my information with friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have what you call combination skin, oil in some parts and dry in others. So trying this was a challenge for me especially since I have tried most products with no real likeness to any of them. So since I started this it has made my skin look, feel even glow. I had dark spots on my face due to acne scaring and this lightened it up wonderfully. it evened out my skin tone and I am on the way to a better looking me!

"With being a BzzAgent, I get to try out new products. This is a favorite of mine. I have noticed a change in the way my skin feels. It seems a lot smoother, wrinkles seem to be going away. I have also noticed that my skin tone is evening out. I will keep using this product for as long as the bottle will last. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this is the best product on the market. This product goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy feeling afterwards. In the past, I have used products that leave a greasy film on your skin when applied. This product is amazing! It is unscented which helps if you are allergic to strong scents. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After trying Olay Total Effects 7 I fell in love. After 4 weeks my skin felt tighter, more supple and just looked great. I got of compliments. I noticed the tiny crows feet were less noticeable. More pores are smaller. Thank you Olay! Sorry for the horrible picture. It's the best my tablet will take. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I live in Toronto, and my skin gets quite rough this time of year. For about 10 days I have been using Player Total Effects 7 as my morning moisturizer, and my skins feels great, especially when it comes to fine lines on my forehead and uneven tone. The texture of Total Effects 7 is very light, but it stays well for the whole day. I have no need to re-apply it during the day! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Having only purchased higher end anti-aging products, I was very impressed with this drug store brand! The product is very creamy, yet light! I have combination skin and this product did not feel greasy. I used it day and night and found my skin (after returning from s sun-filled Caribbean vacation) to be smoother and more hydrated. I would recommend this to any age but top marks for the 35 & over ladies! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the smell of this product, it's thickness and how my skin doesn't feel greasy. It's hard to tell its anti-aging effects, the only thing I miss is an SPF. For that reason I will not wear it during the day, and only use it at night but that's fine. I gave it four stars for its lack of SPF. I will buy this product again. I have not used Oil of Olay products in a while since I felt they dried my skin but not this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have tried Olay 7 effects for a free trial. I think that the moisturizer feels nice when applied. especially good for winter months. I don't think that there is any difference in fine lines or pore size but I would continue to use this moisturizer as my skin feels soft and does not cause breakouts (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think that this moisturizer has done wonders for my skin. It has made it obviously brighter and my existing age spots have even faded a little bit. It is the perfect amount of moisture for my face. It is definitely worth a try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love the texture of this product. It feels super smooth and silky upon application. It's light but has a lasting moisturizing power. Unlike other types of serums or anti aging creams I found that this did not feel sticky and it has a very pleasant scent. I've tried it twice a day, morning and night application but never saw a noticeable difference in fine lines. My complexion did look brighter, however since this is advertised as an anti aging product, I expected some better results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have always used Olay products for my skin care. I trust them and let me say this product is right in line with all the others! I found the Moisturizer very light and creamy. The fragrance was fantastic and it really made my skin glow! It helped with my fine lines around my eyes and really made my skin tone amazing!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think that the Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer is fantastic I love how my skin looks and feels! I spoke to a few people about the 7 in 1 moisturizer Olay and they have some interest in purchasing the produce! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"My mother ""stole"" my Olay Total Effects. She said I will let you know how it is. Well.......She has said that it has been the best anti-aging product she has used. She LOVES that it goes on smooth and the smell is great. Her only bad review about it was that it wasn't in a HUGE bottle that she could bath in. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product is one of the best I've ever tried! My face feels so soft, and my skin has never looked better. The ""11"" lines that I have between my eyebrows is softer and not as harsh looking. My skin feels like its glowing! It doesn't make my skin feel greasy, and makes me feel like I look younger! Who wouldn't love a product that does that?!?! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Olay Total Effects feels really smooth going on my skin. I really do like the feel. It definitely moisturizes my skin without having that oily feeling. The good thing too is that you don't have to use much to cover your whole face. It didn't really smooth out my fine lines but I guess I need to use it for a longer period to see more results. Overall I do like this product and I will buy it to see what the longer term effects will result. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this product delivers on all of it's claims. My skin looks younger, brighter, the tone is more even, and I notice less fine lines. Personally I don't care for the fragrance, I find it too strong. However, I would still recommend this product to family amd friends who are looking to improve their skin! This product would get a 5 out of 5 from me if the fragrance wasn't as strong. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After ten days of use I completely broke out into bad acne. I have oily skin to begin with so i was sceptical about trying this product. It says oil free and won't clog pores. But unfortunately it caused me to break out :( (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I honestly didn't find this product any different from a regular moisturizing cream. I used it morning and night, the whole bottle. However, as a moisturizer it is nice! Just isn't any good for anti-aging. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the fact that this Anti-Aging Moisturizer doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or oily after applying it...but to me, it almost felt like a 'drying-out' feeling on my face after. It didn't feel soft like other moisturizers I have previously tried did. Thanks for the option of trying this out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As someone with extremely sensitive skin, I worry about trying new face products, but this was fabulous. Not greasy, very hydrating and didn't clog my pores at all. It made my skin dewy and beautiful. I felt the skin's thirst for moisture be quenched. Definitely would recommend this. PS you only need a small amount as the product goes quite far. Another plus. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is just what I was looking for in winter moisturizer! It is a nice thick moisturizer but when applied goes on quite well. I find that it is very moisturizing and wonderful feeling on my dry skin. I have noticed that it helps to even out the redness in my skin as well. I am not sure how it would work in the summer but since I live in Canada... not much of an issue :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried the new Olay total effect 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer and let me tell you I am impressed! After applying, my skin feels less dry, soft, and amazingly not greasy! I need to use longer to notice aging effects but I am already impressed! Try it for yourself (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was asked to test Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging MoisturizerÂ  This product has a very nice fragrance to it. It is a little strong. My skin doesn't feel very soft after and within a couple uses I started to break out. I am not typically one to get many pimples however after trying this product they were appearing everywhere. I discontinued using it after 4 days. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This lotion has a lot of promise, it's light weight feels great and smells great. It is non greasy and it's small size is easy to fit in your purse. How ever it really irritated my skin making me break out with horrible painful pimples so I had to discontinue use. I feel like this would be great for someone with less sensitive skin such as myself. I only gave it one start because personally it didn't work for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects 7in1 moisturizer made a difference in my complexion. I found that the unique vitamin complex improved my skin tone. My skin tone is appearing a lot more even and smooth. I found that some of my spots that I had been developing are disappearing, and fading. I am looking forward to continuing to use this product to determine its full benefits. I would also like to know a complete skin care routine to follow to get the most benefits of this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using the olay total effects for a few weeks, and it has been soothing to my winter skin. It's soo dry but it has helped sooth the dryness that comes with winter. Ok, but not noticing any other difference. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Amazing! I have been using Olay Total Effects daily for about a week now. My skin is noticeably softer and smooth and my dry patches are gone! I have also noticed that my skin tone is more even overall! Goes on nice and doesn't leave an oily residue. Keeps my skin moisturized all day, even under makeup. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've tested this product for a couple of weeks now. I do like how it moisturizes my skin, however I have not noticed any of the other benefits. Maybe it's because I haven't noticed many wrinkles or age spots, before starting to use the product. I would recommend this as a good moisturizer but I'm not convinced that it has any anti-aging properties. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this product is amazing, in just a short while you start to notice your skin looking younger and even feeling younger. I have noticed the fine lines are disappearing., and my skin tone is really evening out. you'll want to go out and purchase this product once it hits the shelves. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really like this product!! I have been using Olay 7 Step Anti Aging Moisturizer for the past couple of weeks have noticed a more healthy radiant complexion. The moisturizer works great on my oily/dry combination skin. Seeing the price in store this product is also VERY affordable. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. Overall I give this product a 5/5 due to its affordability and quality. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"When I first tried this product, I found it to be non greasy, it went on smooth and made my skin feel very silky. Although this isn't the type of product I normally prefer to use (I prefer using natural products), I do like the way it makes my skin feel. I generally use 2 pumps per application and that's more than enough to do my face and neckline. While I can't speak to the results as I haven't particularly seen any yet, I do believe this is a great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I loved using the anti-aging 7 in 1 moisturizer! My skin looked and felt great! I could definitely see a difference in my skin tone, definitely made it more even! What a great product! I will definitely purchase this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is great. It is absorbs into your skin very quickly which is a feature that I am a big fan of. I have a busy life and every second counts. I also love the pump. The quantity that it squirts out is perfect and allows for zero waste. I can't wait this product to be available in the stores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Having sensitive skin, I was initially worried about results but was pleasantly surprised with my outcome thus far. My fine wrinkles are disappearing my skin feels & looks more supple and the results to my neck are amazing!! Overall my skin tone is less blotchy, pores noticeably less visible & taunter neck skin I love it!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using for a week now daily in the morning and have already noticed my skin tone being more even, however I find that my skin still feels dry mid day. Smells great and will continue to use and see what the outcome is. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"What I really enjoyed most about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was how smoothly it went on and left my skin feeling silky as it went to work. Within a week, my skin appeared brighter and at the three-week mark, the fine lines on my face were visibly reduced. One friend asked if I'd been to a spa lately because I looked so refreshed. The unique vitamin complex not only improved the appearance of my skin, but smoothed out the texture as well. Thank you, Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"For myself, I did not enjoy this product. Week 1 my face was red and splochy. Week 2 started to look a little better not as spotty redness seamed to be gone. By the time I was done week 4, I found that my face was oily and greasy two things that I have never experienced before. I am willing to try a different product but this one was not for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So loving Olay Total Effects! My skin is so smooth and appears brighter! Fine lines around my eyes have decreased! A rich and lightly scented cream, a little goes a long way! Will definitely be adding this to my regular routine! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Its a very bice product only been using for a few days but it makes my skin feel very fresh amd radiant. I would recommend this product to anyone. It doesnt leave your skin with an oily residue and isnt heavy on the skin. I apply a pea size amount and it covers my entire face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using this Olay product for almost 2 weeks and I have seen a noticeable difference in crows feet and other wrinkles, and the texture and tone of my skin. It feels smoother and softer, and I only had to apply it once a day. No time consuming routine, just real results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have to say I wasn't too sure what to expect with this product, since I usually don't use anti-aging products. However, this moisturizer leaves a clean feel and it is not greasy which is really surprising. It also improves skin texture, and you feel it after one week or so depending on your skin type. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have noticed a smoother softer skin since using Olay Total effects. I am not crazy about the scent of it but the pros certainly outweigh this. Prior to this campaign my skin care regime was almost non existent so I made a point to keep on top of things. And I was not disappointed (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I don't normally use any type of creams or moisturizers on my face as my skin is super sensitive...I went ahead and tried it anyways and end result?...I loved it!! I never had a break out or rash and people complimented my glow left right and center...def be buying this ahain (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The product goes on super smooth. Works amazing as a primer under makeup. The only thing I found was that if I used it, it plumps up the fine lines and wrinkles. Make your face look really even, smooth and well texturized. However, this is a product that will be needed to use continuously if you want it to be effective. Great primer, not Greasy, and very effective against wrinkles. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using this moisturizer every morning and night for over a week. I must say it does work however I am not a huge fan of the smell. I also found it to be a bit oily and very expensive for what you get. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I actually really like Olay products but I found my skin was getting more and more oily as I was using this product. Mind you, my skin is softer and looks like there may be less wrinkles but the oily skin kinda canceled the good out I think? Sorry Olay likely not going g to buy this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I gave this a long time to try to see what it would do. It did not break out my sensitive skin. It smoothed wrinkles. It made my skin baby soft. I have normal/combination skin and it was the perfect amount of hydration for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this Oil of Olay Moisturizer is a very good creme. It not only helps with anti aging, but it also replenishes moisture in your skin. This particular moisturizer restores firmness and visibly reduces age spots. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am not sure if this works in terms of anti-aging because those kinds of products are more of a preventative step for me. However, it is a nice daily moisturizer that helps to keep my skin soft and smooth. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is the best anti-aging cream I have ever used! This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it sinks into the skin as soon as you put it on. It has little odor, which is important for facial products. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"While the moisturizer feels good and smells nice (not overpowering), I'm not sure that it makes me look visibly younger. Also, I wish it had an SPF, because now I feel like I need to use two products. (I believe that there is a version with SPF, but I don't have it.)I've posted before and afters...see for yourself! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Since receiving and using my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I am truly pleased with the results I have noticed. The unique vitamin complex has made my wrinkles and age spots almost all but vanished and my skin looks and feels so much softer. I have received compliments from friends and family at how much younger I look and I have since purchased this product and will continue to use and recommend it to my family and friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I started using olay total effects almost two weeks ago. I use it morning and before bed and my face feels a lot smoother and I have noticed less dry patches on my skin. The cream is not too heavy, but not thin either. It has a noticable fragrance, but it does not bother me and it is not too strong. I am eager to see the results after using it for a longer period of time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about 3 weeks now. I put it on every morning, it is nice and light, does not feel greasy at all. However I do not see any change in my skin tone or aapreance. I will keep using it to see if over the next couple of weeks i see any other changes. But for now it is a great moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have to say this Olay total effects moisturizer is really good even though I don't need anti aging cream I still use it . It makes my skin look flawless . Looking fresh , soft and shiny . What I would want to know about this product is if it actually does work . I use it everyday and I love it . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay 7 in 1 has reduced lines around my eyes and my skin feels soft. it also helped tighten my neck which was looking a little wrinkled. I highly recommend this product. Give it a try, you wont be disappointed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay total effects 7 !!daily for over 3 weeks now and I am disappointed that I have not seen a change in my complexion at all. I was really hoping to achieve a more even skin tone and to lighten up a large sun spot on my cheek. I like this product as a moisturizer but I wouldn't pay the price for it because it doesn't do what it says. I have always liked Olay moisturizers and will continue to use them, Just not this one in particular! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay total effects 7 in one is amazing product to have ..it gives me smooth skin feeling and softer skin, visible fine line ..I also noticed the firmness of my pores. .my skin feels and look totally different, I will buy olay 7 in one all the time , thank you bzzagent for letting me try it ..and I hope everyone notice and feel the difference like I did ..

I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer feels great when applied. It's light weight and doesn't interfere with foundation. Olay has reminded me that skin care is really important and the benefits are worth the effort. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this is one of the best products I have tried. It has reduced lines around my eyes and has improved skin.I even found it helped my neck which is sagging and wrinkled. Many have complimented me on how good my skin looks. I would highly recommend this wonderful product to all and tell you its worth every penny (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I actually took this campaign because I wanted to reduce a dark spot on my cheek which it hasn't done but....it killed the wrinkles around my eyes. I am not concerned about them but I have totally noticed a huge difference!! These pictures are take a week apart from each other. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really did enjoy the way the Olay Total 7 effects felt like on my face. Unfortunately i found it to be a little to oily for my skin type. It's great for the winter months for those dry winds but I'm afraid in the summer I would feel it. As for it's wrinkle fighting properties. Well I didn't really notice much difference on the lines on my forehead. Overall I really wanted to love this lotion and it does have a lot to brag about it was just not right for myself. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"It is a pretty nice product to have since the benefit of Olay Total effects7 In one, the 7 benefits of this product are: 1.visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles 2.Evens skin tone appearance 3. Enhances brightness 4. Minimizes the look of pores 5. Visibly reduces age spots 6.Restores firmness 7. Replenishes moisture. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects 7 on 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a fantastic product. It mentions it does the following which includes: visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, evens skin tone appearance, enhances brightness, minimizes the look of pores, visibly reduces age spots, restores firmness and replenishes moisture and I have to admit it lives up to the hype! I would recommend this product to anyone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"even though this product goes on easily and does not leave any residue on your face, and makes your skin feel smooth, I really have not seen any difference appearance wise!!! I am also starting to break out with more zits than I have had in years !!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay goes on smooth and easy. It was light and not greasy or heavy. It seemed to keep my skin moisturized for most of the day - even with the cold dry winter. I didn't notice any real difference from my other moisturizers as far as wrinkles or skin tone - it seemed to make the fine wrinkles less noticeable (especially around the eyes), but of course the wrinkles are still there. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is 50/50. It leaves my face feeling moist and so smooth without the greasy feeling BUT I found I broke out in acne around my neck line. Can't say if it because of this product only, might have to use it more to confirm, but I haven't broke out since I stopped using it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that you need to know there is sunscreen in the moisturizer.You also need to know that it does lighten up dark spots .IT does make your pores appear smaller.IT does help a small bit on the fine line and wrinkles.IT does not remove redness of the pimples that it gave me .I liked the richness of the cream and it was not greasy feeling on your fingers or face.But big draw back was the 13 pimples that it gave me.So then i needed an acne cream to go with this cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have used this moisturization every morning for a month now. I wear it under my primer and foundation. I have had no breakouts. It was very cold and my skin was so dry this cream arrived just in time! I am just about at the end of this sample and I have to go out and buy some more. Love this stuff!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
same olay smell theyve had for years non greasy goes on like its not even there cant say i noticed a difference with it perhaps if i used it longer. didnt notice any difference really in my skin after 7 days but im sure it was well nurished with teh unique vitamin complex that it has in it i probably wouldnt by this product but thats not to say it wont work wonders for someone else (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love the feel of putting on this cream. It is so velvety!! I really look forward to putting it on. My skin feels moisturized all day, but never feels greasy. I feel like I'm getting an intensive moisturizing experience, especially important for me in the winter. Although I usually prefer fragrance-free products, I actually liked the soft scent as well. My skin appears brighter and definitely has a more even tone. LOVE IT! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have tried it for awhile now. I have to say I love how it makes my skin feel after I put on my face. I have very dry skin and my face feels so soft after I put it on. The only thing I would have to say is the scent of the cream is a little strong when first put on but does seem to fade after short bit. Other then the scent it works great. My skin is smooth and feels soft and looks better then ever (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
My skin has been so dry from the crazy weather we have been having. OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer makes your face feel wonderful after applying it. Your face feels so nourished and soft. And after using this product I saw a dramatic decrease in the size of my pores and my skin just plain seemed brighter and clearer. It doesn't go on greasy and absorbs right in. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have never tried an anti-aging moisturizer before so I was nervous that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer would be heavy and greasy but it is definitely not. This lotion is light but hydrating enough for Alberta winters. I don't have deep wrinkles but I have noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. It also seems to give my skin a glow without adding shine. This product is everything it claims to be an more. I am hooked! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Loved this updated product from olay. They really toned down the scent which makes me want to buy it again! Worked wonders to even my skin tone and keep my skin hydrated all day long! Definitely going to repurchase in the future (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using OlayÂ® Total Effects and so far so good and I love it !!! It is a unique vitamin complex that helped to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a fantastic product! My skin feels well moisturized, and it is even healing old acne scars! This formula feels so amazing on my skin. I love the travel size option. Great size to keep in your make up bag, purse, gym bag, etc... I am trying to get a head start on combating the signs of aging (I am 31) and I would strongly recommend it to all!

"I think this product is very good. I am in my early 40's. I don't have a bunch of issues with my skin, so I don't usually buy this type of product. I was curious to try it though. It goes on like a light foundation/ moisturizer with a nice scent. I put it on my hand at first and let it seep into my skin. It was non-greasy and fast absorbing. After about a half hour I was surprised to feel my hand even softer than normal and the skin tone even out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have used the oil of olay anti aging cream only twice. I did love the light scent and the smooth application. I haven't noticed a change as of yet, but Im sure I will soon. Oil of olay is a great product that I have been using for years and trust the brand Im so excited to be part of this campaign (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think I like it. It's easy to use, just pump it on to your finger, don't need much, just one pump covers your whole face and neck, wow. Very lightly scented, goes on and absorbs fast. My skin is looking brighter and feels much smoother. I like the texture too. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was mildly concerned to try a new facial product as I have very sensitive skin. But I cannot express enough how fabulous this mosturizer is. My ski tone has evened out..it has a healthy glow and no break outs. It actually feels softer to the touch. I'm in love! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"As soon as I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, my skin felt firmer, a very good moisturizer without feeling greasy. It is fragrance free and that's a big plus for me. Very easy to put on. You can feel the freshness on you face. My skin looks good, but after 2 weeks I cannot say it has smoothed out my fine lines or wrinkles. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'm torn on this product. For me specifically there are pros and cons. The pros: A little goes a long way There's no oily feel Absorbs nicely Little scent Skin feels smoother (for the most part) The cons (well there's just one really): On my T zone, there have been many more break outs than what I am used to I like the product for the most part. Around the eyes and my cheeks it feels great. Not so much one the forehead and nose though (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This cream is very nice, it goes on well and does not leave your face smelling of perfume. I really liked applying it. Unfortunately, my skin is dry and it didn't hydrate enough. It was however very soft and did not irritate or cause redness. I would suggest it to friends and family who do not have dry skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"this is my first bzz kit.. so i got to try the trial size of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer.. i found that it went on nice, and the first night night made my skin moist ans soft. i found it had a light sent. but sadly by the third night i had to stop using it as i started to brake out in a rash. so i assumed i'm allergic to something in it.. i think i would recommend it to someone that does not have sensitive skin.. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this stuff. I have been looking for something that won't leave my face sticky or feeling like there was too much product on my skin and this is it! It absorbs very well into the skin and leaves a really smooth feeling. It smells really good so I don't mind using it at all. After a few weeks I seee a huge difference in my skin and how it feels. I will def be making this an everyday product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have noticed my skin does look different, it has helped with my fine lines, I love the smell of it ,it is not too strong. I have been looking for a anti aging moisturizer and this one is perfect! a little goes a long way, I did not have to use too much. it has become my favorite! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Ok after finally making a decision I don't care for the product. It has made my face oily and have you feeling and not to mention I am now breaking out in acne. I have not had acne in several years. So I will not be buying this product unfortunately. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"My biggest measuring stick for this is other people's comments . If they notice a difference and comment, then it must be working. Honestly I have had more people tell me I look ill or like I need to rest. (THANKS!) I will be going back to my regular good old faithful Nivea. I have been using the rest of the Olat totaly Effect of my hands and it's lovely. Hasn't done anything remarkable for my face though. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So its been 2 weeks of application of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. I have to be honest and say there hasnt been noticeable improvement to my skin. Could it be medication, hormones? who knows, but i was hoping to see at least my pores get smaller or some of my freckles and age spots lighten up a bit. It feels great as a moisturizer after cleansing, but the dryness returns after an hour. Glad i had this opportunity to try it, hope it works for you! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this product, the texture is pleasant, the results are noticeable after a few tries, my skin is smoother and fades brown spots. I am satisfied with the result. I highly recommend, as it is deplus 7 in 1 is even better. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"In the recent years i've started to become interested in anti aging products and started using them daily. My daughter is interested in natural products and told me about all parabens. I usually get her to check for me and she said there were parabens in it, which there are. How can I feel good about using this regularly over time? I used this twice. But I don't want to continue. I wouldn't buy it. It's just average. The smell was okay. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product provides results and is a great skin care product. I saw my fine lines smoothed away after a few weeks. My skin looked brighter and felt refreshed. The scent was light and clean and I would truly use this product in my everyday beauty regimen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have been using Olay Total Effects 7-1 moisturizer for 7 days. I really like that it absorbed in quickly and has a light feel. I have not noticed any reductions in fine lines and wrinkles. My skin did feel smoother. Olay Total Effects 7-1 did moisterize well but I didn't see any anti aging effects ony skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tired this product and experience was amazing, found the effects are long lasting. It provided excellent protection even in winnipeg winter, excellent moisturizer. Will recommend to all who are looking for an excellent product to protect skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Loving this product! In just a few short days, my skin is looking brighter and feels soft. Very contrary to how it usually feels in December. Granted, we are not having the cold temperatures that we usually do but the lack of sunlight is not making me all pale and pasty because Olay is helping me keep an even skin tone with a lovely tint. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'm loving how soft my skin is now that I've been using Olay total effects 7 in 1 for a few weeks. I haven't seen any improvement in my dark spots or wrinkles, but my skin is moisturized all day from applying it once in the morning. I'm happy with those results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I can never go a day without using face moisturizer, especially during winter. I've been using this every day now and my face feels much smoother and isn't dry at all. It doesn't have a strong smell and I didn't get the breakout that usually goes with switching face products.My only complaint is that it's a touch greasy for my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product definitely keep promises. It is hydrating for the whole day, not greasy, the skin absorb it right away and feel so comfortable after that, the smell and freshness are just great! I used it morning and night for best result. Finally, I definitely recommend Olay Total Effects as a safe solution for all the sensitive and fragile skin like mine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using the cream for about a week now and it has make my skin break out! I am sure it is the cream, since I have not changed my diet and I rarely ever even get so much as one pimple. I stopped using the cream and my skin went back to normal. However, it was helping reduce the look of pores and fine lines. Unfortunately the side effect made it unusable. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"it's a great product , but especially for a person older than me because I have not yet have many wrinkles or age spots but I liked it anyway used . So before buying this product may advise the person older than 35 years to really see the difference before and after use . A beautiful . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Ant-Aging Moisturizer smell awful. Having to wear it was unbearable for me. I cannot attest to how it preforms as I could not complete the time required. I would however try the unscented version. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I used to think Olay was my grandmothers brand until I tried Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. After just a few weeks my skin looks and feels better than ever! People are actually noticing my glowing skin! I'm looking younger and feeling younger! Thanks Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this product was great it was not thick like some ant ageing lotions I have tried It goes on evenly no greasy face afterwards. My skin feel firmer and radiant. I would highly recommend this produce for people with uneven skin tones cause it did wonders on my skin. Awesome product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I loved the results from using Olay Total Effects. My skin felt very soft and silky. The only complaint I would have is that it didn't moisturize quite enough. My skin felt dry within a couple of hours. It could have been the time of year (I always find the fall hard on my face). But overall I liked the lotion and would try it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer received by BzzAgent for about 2 weeks now. The best thing about this product is that it goes on light and absorbs quickly. I have not seen an improvement in fine lines or skin tone. Actually, my skin seems slightly irritated by this product. It also has a strong perfume smell that I do not think necessary in a moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Gone, my fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone are quickly disappearing. I have noticed a visible difference in my skins appearance since starting with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging moisturizer. The unique vitamin complex has left my skin feeling healthy and smooth. Switching my moisturizer normally results in some soreness of my skin but nothing with this product. It is very lightly scented and doesn't feel heavy when applied. So happy with the results so far. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Ok so I have been trying the sample of Olay Total Effects 7 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a few weeks now. The smell is a great light scent and it blends into my skin nice without leaving it feel greasy. I have not however noticed younger looking skin or anything of that nature. My sun age are the same and have not faded at all and my skin tone is the same. If using as just a moisturizer and not expecting anything else then this is ok. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've tried the Olay Total Effects 7 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 1 week. My super sensitive skin has reacted very well, in fact, it has got better! It is very moisturizing and it smells great. I recommend itto everyone, I'm sure you will like it. Your skin will feel and look amazing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have noticed that since I started using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer that my pores have been minimized, my skin tone looks brighter and more even, my face feels soft and smooth, instead of tight and dry, and it even seems to be vanishing some of my lines/wrinkles.....that I hate so much! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the trial size is perfect size for me to use and try. I will use this when I travel because it's so convenient. I broke out the first time I used it but it was around my time of the month so I can't blame it on this item. Otherwise, my skin looks great. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have tried Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 for free as a bzzagent. I am very pleased with this product my worst problem is the family's worth of luggage that usually reside beneath my eyes. Thankfully Olay Total Effects has really helped with that and now only one little kid sized bag is left after 4 weeks. I am soo happy with how soft my skin is to touch (my husband likes it too *wink*). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
the product made my skin glow and look refreshed and my wrinkles and lines seemed smoothed but the olny draw back down fall was it seemed too have too much alcohol in it so it dryed my face out as i have sensitive skin other wise all around a great product !!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love this product. It felt light on my skin and seemed to give me a great glow. It also didn't make my face oily when I applied my foundation. It does have a bit of an old last smell but that goes away pretty fast. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using Olay Total Effects 7in1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for 7 days and nights now. It is non-greasy, absorbs fairly quickly and kept my skin moisturized for about 6 hours before my skin needed a moisture reapplication. Big thumbs up for the very hygienic pump nozzle. You can control how much product you dispense. The fragrance is a bit strong. I prefer non-scented skincare products. Overall a good moisturizer. Not as brightening as an AHA product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"At first I didn't think this product was going to work at all, so that night I did my bed time routine but instead of using my normal lotion I used the olay total effects and absolutely loved it, my face was soft and not dry for once, I would definitely recommend this product to everyone (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer was applied on my skin for 3 days and I found my skin more hydrated, soft and smooth feeling and regenerated. I loved trying this product and would definately buy it. The cream was not heavy or greasy but a nice consistency. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have not had success with this product, this is not for me? This product has made my skin break out and has not helped with my dryness! I have no doubt that this product would work wonders on other skin types, however I will not be trying this product again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
It's been over two weeks using this product and I'm in love. I'm almost 30 and I was a smoker for over 10 years. (Quit 1 year ago). I have many fine lines around my mouth and eyes. With using olay I am starting to see a different I never thought was possible. I love how it moisturizes my skin and doesn't leave it feeling sticky or oil like some other brands I have try in the pass. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am finding that this product is not working well for my skin type! I have been using my trial size however my skin has broken out in white heads! I have several girlfriends who swear by this product, however in my opinion this is not the product for me! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this moisturizer, it has a nice thickness to it so you feel like it's working and hiding those fine lines. I feel 100% confident it's doing all it needs to do within a moisturizer. I also like that it has a light scent - nothing over powering and you're not smelling it all day. I've used some higher end moisturizers that cost a lot more than Olay Total Effects products but this by far is better than those. You can notice a difference almost instantly. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product gave me glowing skin, helped my skin feel comfortable and hydrated, and also was a good base for makeup surprisingly! I wish the sample was just a little bit bigger since it says that you see results in 4 weeks, and I finished it in about 2. Also, I don't really like the scent of the product very much but it does dissipate. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I am trying out Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Moisturizer and it has been about a week. I already notice an improvement with my skin. Skin tone is more even and less obvious fine lines. its moisturizing effect is longlasting. I like the trial size and pump delivery. very useful for travellng on the go. also its not irritating especially I have sensitive skin. So far so good and it works! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received the Olay Total Effects 7 in one moisturizer to review for free from BzzAgent and I really like it my face feels smoother and it's not greasy which I love, the smell is great it's light I've been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin feels like silk. My face feels refreshed when I apply this moisturizer.. Overall Great Great Product!!! Thanks BzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm totally impressed with this Olay product! I have not used an Olay product for a long time and didn't know what to expect from this. But to my surprised it exceeded my expectations. After just one nights use I already noticed my skin looking healthier the next morning. It is very easily absorbed and doesn't feel greasy (which is a pet peeve of mine)! My skin did look smoother and more even after more than a week of usage! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have fairly oily skin, so I get nervous about putting anything too creamy or moisturizing on my skin, because by the end of the night I'll look like an oil slick. However, this wasn't too heavy! It went on light but provided a bit of 'coverage' and left me looking 'radiant' all night! I didn't have to blot my face more than usual and I had a nice glow to my skin. I went to a Christmas party and it held up beautifully! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product has too much perfume scent in it for me. I prefer a moisturizer that is unscented or a light scent. The scent in this product was so overpowering for me. The day after I tried this product my face broke out which that never happens! I think it had something to do with the high scent in the product. I would recommend this to others only if they like something smelly. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"From some of the other commercials I've seen there are products out there that show results much quicker than 4 weeks, I've been trying the Olay Total Effects 7in1 anti aging Moisturizer for a little less than 4 weeks but have not noticed a single line being smoothed away... not that I have a lot just a few laugh lines. But so far they are still there (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The product has a delicate smell and agreable texture. It leaves the skin fresh and moisturized without any greasy feeling. I've been using it under a primer and it worked well. Can't say I've felt all the benifits, altough I believe a long term use would provide good results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have noticed in the time I've been using this moisturizer, reduced pore size, sun spot fading, blackheads disappearing and more overall even skin tone and very moisturized skin. LOve it and will continue to use it :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anit-Aging mosturizer for a few weeks now and notice that there is a decrease in the small lines around the Crows feet. I just applied a little bit each night at my Crows feet and under my eyes and that is it. My Crows feet lines are smaller and the bags under my eyes are a little lighter. No smell to it, Love that and soft n silky to apply to your eyes. You don't need much to get a nice result. I would Definately buy this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think Olay Total Effects is overly priced. I have used it and it doesn't do anything special. I Would not recommend this product to my friends and family. My skin has no difference. I have been using it 2 times a day for a week. It makes my skin feel oily after its applied. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I had never tried Olay products before even if I knew the excellent brand reputation. I was really looking forward to start trying the total effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging moisturizer. I have been using it every day since I received it and I liked it. My skin feels comfortable, it is not oily so I can apply my make-up right after moisturizing my face. I also noticed that my dark spot has faded a bit. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As with pretty much all the Olay products I've tried, this one does what it claims to do - MOISTURIZE! MOISTURIZE! and MOISTURIZE!! Love the non-greasy feel to it. Put it on in the morning & away I go with my day. It feels like it's sinking deep into my skin & it feels great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"love,love ,live this product. I've never used any Olay products and I'm glad I did. my skin looks like it's glowing! the texture and uneven skin tone has diminished drastically. I'm blown away with the product. it goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly. the scent wasn't over powering like some moisturizers I've tried. I'm pretty sure I have about one pump left which is sad but I'll definitely be going to purchase more. I can't wait to see the long term affects! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Been using olay products for two decades. They get better every few years. Last year I was using olay regenerist. This year I will be using the Total Effects 7, it works better! I love the smell and velvety texture of this product. I am already seeing results after only a few weeks! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like this product alot. It absorbs into my skin, leaving it feeling soft, and not greasy at all. I would want to know before I get this product........that it has a covering agent in it, but it goes on smoothly, and blends very well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"What can I say about this product, well I am not sure if it works. I will say it does make my face moisturized and it feels good on my face. But I can't say if it reduce fine lines or even my skin tone. I think longer usage is require to know the affect or to notice the difference. I am glad that I found a product that works on my sensitive skin. As well, I feel that I got some glow. So, I will continue to use it and will recommended.

"Be the first to try it! Did you know the new trial size of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer wonât be in stores until February? Youâre getting a special preview, so let friends know they can get the full size now if they donât want to wait. Plus, you can find OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 in both fragrance-free and with sunscreen â broad spectrum SPF 15. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I absolutely love love love it. It goes on smooth and makes my skin glow and I overall feel like I have firmer skin. The smell is nice and it doesn't leave any greasy residue. Normally I would have oily skin by the end of the day, the olay seems to be helping with that. My skin appears to have a more even tone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried Olay total effects and used it every night until the trial bottle was finished. I honestly did not see any difference in my wrinkles and fine lines. I didn't find that it made my skin feel any softer either. I was disappointed with this product as I have always had positive results with Olay products. I wouldn't buy this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"In the time that I have been using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer I have noticed a huge difference in the texture and softness of my skin. My skin is brighter, clearer & noticeably softer. I have had people say that I look younger and more vibrant. I was skeptical but this product really works. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was pleasantly surprised by the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. In this time of year my skin is super dry. My skin eats up the moisture, but it doesn't make me look oily or breakout. The trial size is great. I always find skin products super hard to find in travel sizes and this one is a perfect fit for my travel cosmetic bag. My one wish is that there was SPF. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Olay is a product my family as been using for years. I'm soon going to b in my 30s so a aging moisturizer is something that is very important to me. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I already feel a difference. It doesn't dry out my face like some moisturizers. You can see the difference it's made in my skin already. This is a product I will continue to buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was super excited to try this product but the first couple of days and I broke out :( not so fun ! I have sensitive skin and was afraid of this but after three days of using it I noticed my fine lines had reduced which were mostly on my forehead. my skin looks brighter! So I guess I am sold !! Great everyday moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"As a person who shies away from skin products and moisturizers in general (I have sensitive skin prone to react), I was a little reluctant to try another but had heard good things. I was happy I tried it out as I have not had any breakouts and my skin is actually feeling soft. I am only just over a week in but my skin tone is looking good too. So far this one gets a solid vote for feeling on and scent as well. Hope that 10 years comes off in the next 3 weeks! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
i think this is a good product made my skin feel smooth.a little goes a long way.not greasy feeling.my pores do appear smaller!!!!!!!!!!!!! which is a wonderful thing right ladies??? who doesnt like that i give this product a 5 star rating (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have been using Olay 7X for 2 weeks now and have noticed such a difference in my facial appearance. The fine lines on my forehead and around my eye are less noticeable. My skin looks more even and youthful. It's almost like turning back the clock on my face!! My skin is very sensitive to certain things and this doesn't affect it at all. I would recommend this to every women I know! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I Love this moisturizer! Really really moisturizing for the skin and has definitely brightened my face up! Perfect winter moisturizer! Definitely a step up from my regular Olay sensitive skin moisturizer! A little bit of product goes a long way with this in my opinion! Worth the extra money. The Olay brand is one of my favourites and this cream is no exception :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using OlayÂ® Total Effects since I've received the sample. i can see that my fine lines are smoother, my skin looks brighter and firmer with more moisture. i did not have any age spots so i can't comment on that. i really enjoyed using this product and i'll definetely purchase it and recommend it to freinds and family. thank you! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have sensitive skin,and can't use all creams. I have only used thus a couple times because the first time it felt like my skin was on fire and I had to wash it off. It didn't seem as bad the next day. I have a lot of freckles on my face and I feel like the cream brought them out more. might not be the cream for me but doesn't mean it wouldn't work for other. I'm going to try it again and see if it has the same effect. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
When I was chosen to try this new face lotion I was extremely happy! After using it now for one week my skin is noticeably smoother and brighter in appearance. I really like the non greasy formula and love how it comes in a new smaller bottle which will be ideal when I travel now. I would recommend this wrinkle cream to anyone and I can't wait to see the results in a few more weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this product is amazing! so light, fragrance free., light enough to use day and night liked the amount that came out of the pump, perfect portion, will definately look at changing what I am using to this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I can't say enough good things about Olay 7Total effects! My skin looks and feels fantastic. Generally in the cooler months I find my skin looking and feeling dull, and all those little lines and uneven patches seem to jump out. I've been using this for a week now and my skin looks fresh and clear, and the lines almost seem to be improving somehow! Absolutely love it! Will be adding this to my regime! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay has done it again! I love this product! Goes on smooth and feels soft! No greasy feeling when applied. Has a wonderful light scent, who doesn't want to have a hint of perfume without the bottle?! I would love to be able to use this as my daily moisturiser in my routine! Noticed almost right away the fine lines around my eyes where deminished after only 4 days. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love Olay products & this one is no different! It leaves my skin hydrated without that greasy feel that some other moisturizers leave & makes my fine lines disappear! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think this product has minimal effort, good results, but I think longer term use is required for significant ones. And I still feel the serums are less irritating to my very sensitive skin, so began using once per day instead of both am and pm. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturiser was a nice lightweight lotion easily used under makeup. Hydrating and not greasy or oily. #BzzAgent @OlayUS (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This product left my face visibly and touchable smoother after the first application. I have not noticed a difference in the appearance of lines spots or wrinkles though. The only negative for me is the scent and how extremely powerful it is. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"First of all, I am 32 years of age, never smoke, never been drinking, every body say I look young, I never use anti-age product before so I thought maybe It was time. I use it for a week, but it give me so much pimples that I had to stop using it. Even if I'm 32, don't think my skin is enough mature to use anti-age product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I sure wish this product came out a long time ago, because I have tried several and having sensitive skin, I usually break out. But the total effects anti-aging, is fabulous, my skins feels so good and not once did I have any problems. I do have very dry skin and I found that it could use a slightly heavier moisturizer in the cream but other than that I love the stuff! Would recommend to anyone with regular or oily skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using the Total Effects line for almost a week now, and it's been the first moisturizer in a long time that will be a repeat purchase for me. My skin looks and feels great. I use the fragrance and sunscreen-free version at night as I'm a little oily in the T-zone. It's been a great night cream for my sensitive skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this product is wonderful, it goes on nice and smooth and it is not greasy. I don't have any wrinkles at this time so I don't know how it would work on them but it is a great for moisturising. I would recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got to say I wasn't to impressed when I received this sample because this type of cream always claims you look younger but I really do think you do.I started using it and it makes you feel great.After you use this for a while you feel like your turning back time and your skin feels so alive and glowing.Sorry my camera is broken or else I would show you.

I spent a month in the hospital so i had very tired old looking skin. I tried this as soon as i got home. I am loving it so far. It is VERY lightweight. I was expecting it to be heavier but i couldn't even feel it on my skin. I have already noticed a difference around my eyes. This is a product i would buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"While I like the feel and the how light the feel of the product is, I do not like the smell. Although, it is not overwhelming I disliked it so much I made a point of not putting the product under my nose and avoided wearing it at night to avoid getting it on my pillow. That being said I did like the feel of my skin after using it and would be will to continue to use it, however, I would prefer if there was an unscented version. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I haven't gotten a chance to use it for a full four weeks to see how much my skin has changed, but so far it seems to be a lot more moisturized. It does have a scent, which I am not totally in love with. It does smell nice, but I get headaches because of some scents. My skin also broke out for the first week while using this, but it could be just my skin getting used to a new product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I never thought about trying a product like this before. OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer really does change your skin in a great way. My skin has more even tone and the fine lines are definitely less noticeable. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their skin to look better. I don't have to wear as much makeup now to cover up imperfections. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using the product for about two weeks now and haven't noticed much difference other than my pores seem less noticeable, but other than that no changes yet, but I think I need to give it some more time as I do enjoy how light it feels on my skin and how it moisturizes ever so lightly with no film left behind, oh AND the delightful smell the cream does have! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The moisturizer is great, its made my skin soft and my T zone has started to even out. I have a lot of freckles and I've noticed them lightening. As a busy mom I don't have a lot of time in the morning this is great. It pumps out just the right amount of moisturizer. It is light weight and the fragrance is fresh not perfumey. I will continue to use it!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"When I got the kit, Olay mentioned the unique vitamin complex that help to fight the seven signs of aging: 1.Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles-Definitely 2.Evens skin tone appearance-Yes 3.Enhances brightness-Yes 4.Minimizes the look of pores-Sort of 5.Visibly reduces age spots-Slightly 6.Restores firmness-Yes 7.Replenishes moisture-Yes As you can see from my answers, I was overall impressed with this product and will recommend to all of my friends!

"I tried the Olay total effects. It made a great difference to my skin. It made my skin look younger, my pores appear smaller and evened out my tone. It also moisturized my skin and has a great smell. I certainly will be buying this product in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have an oily T-zone and have seen a slight improvement, but I've only been using the product for about a week. Maybe after the 4 weeks there'll be more. A tip for those with similar oily areas, use only half a pump not a whole one. Using a whole pump seems to make my face extremely oily! Will definitely keep using it and hopefully see more improvement in my skin! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"i used the olay total effects, and i found it really helped me with my dry skin, i have dry skin and in the winter its worse and i found it really helped with this, it didnt make my face look or feel greasy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay Total Effects for just about 3 weeks now and I love it. It goes on nice and smooth, not greasy and has a very pleasant scent to it. Within a couple of weeks I noticed the lines around my eyes not as visible but most of all I notice was how bright my face looked. The dark circles diminished under my eyes as well. I will definitely recommend this to all I talk to and continue to use it myself! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for two weeks now. I have noticed my skin feels softer and more hydrated. The small fine lines have be less visible . I noticed my dark spots have become lighter and my skin tone seems brighter. I found it a little expensive when I looked for it in the stores. Thank you BZZAGENT for letting me try this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After using for about 3 weeks now, my skin feels soft without the greasy feel. My skin tone is brighter and more even. Fine lines are a little less noticeable, but not much difference on the crows feet, but over all this is a great product and definitely worth using. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product had some good qualities and unfortunatley, some bad. I found this to be just too heavy for my combo/oily skin. It actually made my skins texture bumpy and I did not continue to use it. I love other Olay products but this one was just not for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think I am going to let my photo speak for itself regarding this moisturiser. Usually I am not one for posting photos of my self but I will make an exception this time. Keeping in mind I am not wearing foundation or face powder in this photo and this photo is not photo shopped in anyway. This moisturiser has made my skin glow and my pore less visible am loving this product, thank you. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Three days after using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer, two pimples pop up on my face. I am saddened as it has this kind of effect on me. Luckily, nothing more showed up. On the brighter side, after a week of using Olay, I noticed that it minimizes the look of my pores and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Looking forward to look younger in another week with the help of the unique vitamin complex it contain. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Though it didn't reduce my age spots and fine lines ('cause I don't have them right now! and hopefully they won't come till I am age 70+!) it did reduce my dark spots and pimple marks (those that I thought wouldn't leave my face anymore!), though I still have a few, most of them are already gone and those that I still in there, they are lighter and less visible now! :D Thanks to @OlayUs #Gotitfree Thanks to@BzzAgent for making me try this amazingly great product! Lurveit! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Great moisturizer! Provides great hydration while brightening skin tone. My skin feels fresh, pores minimized with a beautiful glow. I'm excited to continue using the moisturizer to experience the anti-aging effects especially during the dry winter months. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
At first I try it in a little skeptical. Thinking it will be the same oily product that feels icky on the skin. I was totally wrong it was absorb by the skin the moment it dry out. It fells soft and not sticky at all. After 7 days of trial I seen less of age spots. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this product. It goes on easily, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It is not greasy at all, and doesn't make my skin look shiny at all. I will certainly buy this product in the future. It certainly evens out my skin tone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the new OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! It smells fantastic and leaves your skin super soft and moisturized. The temperatures dropped here and I am always switching to a richer moisturizer for the winter and this one feels really great on my skin. If only it had some kind of SPF, that would make it perfect. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using my free sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging for 2 weeks now. This moisturizer absorbs quickly, leaves no irritation, is non-greasy & has a very light scent. I haven't noticed my fine lines & wrinkles diminishing, but my skin definitely look firmer! In all honesty, I am fairly impressed at this product - usually I stay away from the anti-aging products, thinking they are just hype - but so far I am liking Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am absolutely loving Okay total effects <3 it is a great moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or weighed down! It's also nice to find a product that is scent free, and doesn't bother my sensitive skin. 3 thumbs up! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After 7 days I notice that my face is much softer. I have quite dark age spots, and they do not seem any lighter after 7 days. I wish that I would have gotten a full bottle to try since the claim is to notice a difference in 4 weeks. I like that the moisturizer does not have a strong smell.. I don't really think I can give a really good review since I only tried it for 7 days, and not the 4 weeks that Olay says the product works in. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this product up and have yet to notice any difference in my skin. At first, my skin totally hated it because of the fragrance, but I kept using it to see if it would be beneficial at all. I broke out bad when I first started using this. After about a week I can say it is a nice lotion, but otherwise I feel it has too many ingredients. I wish we got the fragrance free version, or one with spf, as those both seem a bit more useful. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was really excited to try this product. However, I was really disappointed. It doesn't moisturize my skin the way I was expecting. My skin is very dry in the winter and I was hopeful to try a different product that might help me. It's not the first time I use this brand and I think it's sometimes worth paying a little more for a better product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I recently received a sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 and I have to say that it is one of the best moisturizers that I have used in a long time. It took care of all the fine lines with the first application! My skin looked smoother and plumper that it had in quite a while. My family noticed that I appeared as though I had had 12 hours of sleep even though I think it was only 6! Thank you Oil of Olay!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think its a good cream for the price range, it left my skin soft and hydrated. The scent isnt too strong, and it is well absorbed in the skin, not leaving a greasy feeling to it ! I didnt see a big difference on my pores thought. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using the product for well over a week. I can't believe the results considering it's a mosturizer . I have sensitive and dry skin and what this product has so far done... I'm very impressed! Thanks Olay !!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Love Olay Total Effects 7-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! It's a nice smooth moisturizer that makes my skin feel soft and look younger by fighting the 7 signs of aging! If you have fine lines, age spots or uneven skin this is for you! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using the moisturizer that I received from bzzagent for free to try for about a week so far. I find if I put it on at night my face seems to look fresher and brighter in the morning. the scent is a tad strong for me. it's not a bad smell just a little strong. It goes on really smooth and a little really does go a long way. I think I may let my mom give it a try after the 4 weeks is up. ( 4 weeks is the time frame it says you should notice a difference) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think it is the best product available. Within hours after the first application i could see the difference. In fact most people asked me if I was using a new face cream cause the change was so drastic. Highly recommend (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I found the fine lines around the eyes seemed to be fading giving a smoother look. I believe with continued use most fine lines on my face will fade to a much smoother and even appearance. This moisturizer left my face feeling soft and smooth. Love this product and will continue to use it daily. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This Moisturizer is true to its name, younger looking healthy skin, made my skin look smoother, replenished the moisture, and made me feel great! This is a must try moisturizer.

I love the sample size, it gives you a chance to really try it. Thank you so much BzzAgent, I love it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After getting my sample in the mail I started using it right away. The Olay Total Effects 7in1 Anti-Aging has a nice light scent and not too perfumey, but what I noticed right away was how well it blended into my skin. Most moisturizers I've tried have left behind a greasy feeling but the 7in1 left my skin feeling smooth and soft throughout the day. By the end of the first week my skin started to look brighter and more evened-out. While my only issue is the price, it is well worth it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am a few days into the trial and I have already noticed a bit of change in my skin. My pores are smaller, and my skin looks healthier and has a more even skin tone. However, I find the smell of the cream is quite strong and it is a bit greasy when it goes on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 ant aging moisturizer is great as a moisturizer not entirely impressed on the anti aging aspect of the lotion .I don't think any product can truly help wrinkles but I gave it a go and didn't notice any true signs of a change in appearance but my skin felt very soft and the moisture lasted in my skin.The scent wasn't bad and overall I will give it a average as moisturizers are concerned. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Very much liked this moisturizer. Nice texture, not sticky or goopy. Not very strongly scented, a bonus. Evened skin tone and lessened age spots. Nice feel to it, and went on very nicely. Would like to see a stronger one for winter time, due to wind, cold and dry heat from being indoors. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
My skin has been looking smoother since I started using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for free. It is a nice thick moisturizing cream that helps bring back some youth to your face. I like the smell and how quickly my skin absorbs it as well as the improved look it has given me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I tend to be a person who loves complaining. This product totally zipped me up. I love the product alot just like its other lines - facial scrub. It minimized some of the wrinkles I have around my eyes and cheeks. It is a great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"After trying Okay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-aging Moisturizer, I have not noticed any reduction in signs of aging. What I can comment on is how great the product feels when I apply it onto my face. The moisturizer feels light and and makes my skin feel smooth. There is a bit of a fragrance but it is not strong at all. I did not have to use very much of the product to moisturize my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I found my skin to be smoother and more even toned after just a few days. I have some sun damage on my forehead and the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer started to fade the dark marks almost immediately. The final result is amazing. The contained vitamins and SPF are helping to repair and protect my fragile skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have only been using this product for a few days now, so not noticing all of the 7 signs of aging reducing yet. What I am noticing is that a scar on my cheek is starting to disappear, and the skin on my face and neck is softer and more supple then it's been in a decade! The unique vitamin complex helps to fight the 7 signs of aging, such as fine lines, age spots and uneven skin tone. I am hoping it will reduce the size of the pores and uneven skin tone on and around my nose! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that Olay Total Effects moisturizer is a fantastic product. The scent is pleasant, it goes on smooth and addresses the many issues that women of a certain age can have. It makes the skin appear smoother, more radiant, reduces fine lines and helps boost your confidence as well. I would recommend it to all my friends.

I got this Olay Total Effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer to try for free. I loved that this product is not greasy and absorbed into my skin right away. I have been looking a long time for a non greasy moisturizer. You cannot tell that you are wearing a moisturizer. My skin felt so soft after. So far i have noticed that my skin is more even and i will be repurchasing this and using it for years to come! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was really excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging moisturizer. Being in my early 40s I am starting to notice more lines and dryness on my face. The lotion was nice and creamy and went on smooth but unfortunately my skin reacted with redness and a hot itchy rash :( (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I see the total effects that this product has had on my skin and it's amazing! My skin tone looks more even and bright and my fine lines are less noticeable. My skin also feels much more hydrated and comfortable. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants one product that wil do so many amazing things! I will definately buy it!

"i am now 15 days in and still liking it a lot it has improved the texture of my skin, made it smoother.

"Pretty good product. Most product still kept my skin dry at time, but with Total effect 7 days, it stayed moisturized and not dry. I've notice that my face looks more refreshed. The fine lines on my face of decreased also. My husband even said I look refreshed these days. I would recommend this product to anyone. Even if you don't have signs of aging, it's great to use on a regular basis, so you stay looking young, no matter what age. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Every morning I use it with my foundation and it goes on smoothly and is not greasy. Every night I use it before bed as a spot treatment. Since using the product my pores look smaller my face is softer and the brown spot on the side of my face from the sun is not noticable. I would definatly buy this product #gotitfree #buzzagent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Loving Olay Total Effects 7in1! So light and makes my face practically glow! It gives a Dewey effect and has totally diminished the fine lines I'm noticing around my eyes and mouth.

"It has only been a couple days but people are already commenting on how I look nice and different and asking what I was using. I was surprised people noticed so soon because I only started using it a couple days ago. I wasn't expecting results so fast! Loving this moisturizer so far, it makes my face look and feel great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love the way this product makes my skin feel. I believe that some of my fine lines are less noticeable in the short time I have been using this product. My skin does not feel greasy or slippery just more smooth and there is not an over abundance of smell associated with this product. Nothing more annoying than a bunch of beauty products introducing extra scents. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. It's Fragrance Free, which is so important for facial products. This is my NEW favourite Olay Moisturizer! It does exactly as it states. It left my face soft, smooth and radiant!! Thanks so much for the Opportunity of this Amazing Sample...

"I was excited to try Olay's new Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as I use a lot of other Olay products. From the first use I was impressed! It didn't have an overpowering ""smell"", the cream was light, absorbed easily and didn't have a greasy after feel. I would definitely add this to my product line!

I was very surprised that I liked this cream as much as I did. My skin is VERY sensitive but the Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 moisturizer feels wonderful on my skin and I've had no allergic reactions. My skin feels soft and well moisturized but not overly greasy. I would highly recommend this product. I was given a free sample but I am going to purchase this for sure in the future!

"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer was something that was never on my radar, but my how wrong I have been. Since starting to use it I have noticed that my skin feels so soft, the fine lines are starting to disappear a bit and my skin has a slight glow to it. I've tried many other things and this is the first one that I've enjoyed this much. I can see that Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer will become a permanent part of my regime from now on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The best thing about this moisturizer is that it's gotten me back into a face wash routine, which I've been meaning to do forever... Aside from that I like that you don't need a lot to cover your entire face. It's not greasy and only has a faint (nice) smell. My skin is looking much nicer these days, no more dry patches and actually more even in general. I'd probably keep using it once the sample runs out.

"I have been using the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 trial size since I received it in the mail about a week and a half ago. Within days I have seen a difference. My pores are noticeable different, the skin on my upper cheeks is tighter and I can notice an evening in my skin tone. I've been using a competing brand that advertises 'even skintone' for years and have not seen results like this. I will absolutely be buying this product...and I really like the smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My skin is fairly dry, so it takes a good product to help get it less dry. This product seems to be getting more moisture in to my skin and in turn, making it look less ""old"". It's going on smooth, goes a long way (don't need to use a lot), lasting throughout the day and there is a lot more in the container than you would think. It's still going after a few weeks, so it goes a long way. All are positive aspects for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that Olay total effects is a quality skincare product. It hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling smooth. I normally use aveeno but I really liked this Olay effects. I felt like my skin looked a bit better after about a few days it was more noticeable. It is fragrance free so good if you have sensitive skin. Going on vacation so I packed it with me and it is great that is has SPF in it. I think this is something I would use daily. Left my skin feeling soft, clean and refreshed and not oily. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that I'm in love with @OlayUS! #GotItFree and have been using it for 2 weeks! Already my skin is tighter, my pores are smaller and my skin tone is improving! My favorite part is that while it's doing all of this my skin remains moisturizer all day! Can only imagine the do difference that the next two weeks will bring!

"I really, really like this product. Its not earth shattering. It probably won't become world famous or a ""fad"" product but it is practical, well priced and trust worthy. It feels nice on my skin. It sinks in, doesn't feel oily and isn't sticky. It doesn't have an overpowering smell. It leaves my skin feeling replenished and nice. It wears great on its own or under makeup. This is just a solid product that I will continue to use. I also really like the packaging. The pump is clean and quick. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried the product for 3 days but unfortunately could not continue. The fragrance was just too much for me. I did like the light feel to the moisturizer - it never felt heavy. Perhaps an unfragrenced product would have been better for me (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Very surprised & pleased that my rosacea reddness has been reduced significantly. Pleasant, light fragrance, got rid of sandpapery skin on jawline & forehead. Unfortunately, this product contains more than one endocrine disruptor/carcinogen such as parabens. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product as a free trail from Olay as a part of a Bzz Campaign. I've been using this product for about a week now. The moisturizer goes on smooth and the pump puts out just the right amount of moisturizer. It does feel a little thicker in my hand, but when I put it one, it doesn't feel heavy or thick at all. I think it's great for winter especially. I think for the price point, this is an excellent product that I would buy myself in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

I have only used this moisturizer for 3 days and I like it. It's not sticky and very light. The smell is light and fades after use. I feel like it absorbs well into my skin. I wish it was a bit colder so I could test it out with the harsh Canadian winters but it's good so far. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love the texture and the smooth of the cream! The skin seems to be radious after the application and the cream doesn't leave oil on the skin. The smell of the cream is sweet. I love it! I will definitly buy again! Wonderful experience! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
since my last review 2 weeks ago I still have noticed much of a difference in my skin I did not have many fine lines and no wrinkles at all. Only thing I have noticed is my face has more shine to it. I have told my Mom about it and gave her what I have left so we will see how it works on her. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I can't believe how bright my skin looks, it has made my skin so much more healthy-looking! It's not too greasy, very light with a light scent, but still makes my skin feel moisturized and protected from the elements.

"Olay Total Effects 7 in1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer made my skin feel so refeshingly soft and moisturized. My pores were minimized,and it evened out my skin tone.

Totally happy with this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After using the Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer I received many compliments. My skin looked bright, clear and even more rested. Many mentioned my face looking more slim, I think the healthy tone that my skin gained after using the moisturizer was being significantly noticed by others as well as myself. The moisturizer felt very soft and I really enjoyed using it. The scent was also mild which was another bonus for me. All in all, it is a really good moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using this for about 10 days, applying day and night. It goes on very nicely, not greasy at all. It has a pleasant aroma as well. It's fairly moisturizing but if you have dry skin you might want to mix it with your normal moisturizer. I haven't noticed any anti-aging effects yet but I'm guessing it would take a little while longer for that. I'm not sure I would buy the product but I'm going to keep on using it until I run out to see how it goes as my skin seems to like it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a beautiful, lush cream. Fast absorbing and non-greasy. Left my skin feeling silky smooth and saw a noticeable difference in wrinkles and smoothness after only three weeks. Slight scent, but very mild and natural smelling. Would buy this product again and again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

Will be on my list to buy from now on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"As always, Olay makes a great moisturizer, but I honestly didn't see or feel anything different with my skin with this new product. It does a great job moisturizing and it is a nice thick formula, which I like, but there is nothing amazing about it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and it works great. It smells lovely, very light and clean. It makes my skin feel incredible! I had a small break out after the first day, but it cleared right up and has remained clear since! I'll definitely be purchasing a full size one of these in the not-so-distant future! Thanks Olay & BzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Throughly enjoyed the product. The cream was soft and silky, smell was lovely. Was a little bit thick however. I was not able to see a difference in skin or wrinkles with such a small sample. Would have to see it over time. Packaging was nice but would prefer a regular bottle. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that Olay total efects is great! It's the perfect moisturizer because doesn't make your skin look oily and that's, for me, it's a great advantage. It's my first time using this cream and I have to say that I'm very impressed, my skin looks firm and bright. The smell is amazing , wich I love in every beauty product, it's make me like it even more. Like always, Olay never disapoints.. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this since I received it in the mail. Looks like its working. I keep using it daily. I'm trying to see if it will help with my fine lines on my forehead and my neck. I will still keep reviewing it but am waiting to see results that I have confidence I will achieve. I will keep posting, so far so good!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm loving it still. A great moisturizer. Makes my skin feel light and not greasy. Evens out my skin tone. Currently attacking the crows feet that have been making an appearance on my face. Works well with combination skin and takes care of dryness where I need it and doesn't make my skin feel yucky where I don't. Feels great under my makeup or no makeup at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
After using the product for about a week I've notice my skin feels much softer. I usually struggle with dryness in the wintertime and this product has eliminated this problem! My skin does look brighter! I also love how it feels when you apply it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was thrilled to receive the sample of Olay Total Effects 7. Generous sample size too. I found the product too heavily fragranced. However as a moisturizer, it went on like a cream and absorbed like a lotion which I loved! I did not find it to be superior to my current moisturizer though, so I have no immediate plans to purchase it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product is amazing! I've always liked Olay products and been loyal to the brand the last few years. This, however is by far the best one. It feels so nourishing and you can actually feel it quenching skins thirst! I will definitely be sticking with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this moisturizer every morning for the last week. I can't believe how my skin looks. It feels great, my make-up goes on smooth and my pores have started to look smaller. I have absolutely found a new moisturizer that I plan to use every day and can't wait to tell my family and friends about it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So far, I have not seen any noticeable difference but I realize it is early. The first thing that turned me off was the overpowering perfume smell. I do not want my face cream to be what people smell off me. It smells like ""old woman"" perfume from the 70's. Here is hoping the next few weeks using it, improve. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think the oil of olay products in general are great but not too sure this on is for me I how how much it moisturised my face and made it very soft but didn't like how tight it made my skin feel so for me about 50/50 like part but not all aspects of this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have been using Olay Total Effects for a couple of weeks now. At first I found the fragrance a little strong but it no longer bothers me. I like that the cream is not heavy and my skin does appear to glow. We had a weeks worth of dry cold weather and it moisturized my skin well. The bottle dispenses the cream easily. I definitely will be buying this cream when I finish my bottle. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I loved the opportunity to try the 7 in 1 total effects by oil of olay. After cleaning my skin and putting it on it felt like it was stinging me after application but then the feeling faded. I tried it for 4 days and by the 4th day my face started looking swollen and puffy so I stopped using the product as I was worried if I was allergic to it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, has been my best friend with this cold weather, and I am noticing my skin is looking as good as it feels. I have always been a fan of Olay but now I am cheering louder (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've noticed that my skin tone is much better after 2 weeks. Also, I have sensitive skin and usually putting lotion on my face makes me break out, but not with Olay Total Effects. I enjoy how smooth my skin feels. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I never use moisturizers or soap on my face and I have always had fairly youthful looking skin. I'm glad I was asked to participate in the Olay 7 in 1 challenge! I am loving this stuff! I am only about a week into the campaign, but I'm feeling a change to my skin already! Looking forward to the next few weeks and the end result! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product and have been using it for a week now. It is a light weight formula that still allows makeup to be applied normally. This formula isn't greasy and in a week I noticed the laugh lines around my eyes shrinking and deminishing. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a cheap solution to fine aging lines.

I have used OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I am 40 years old and I have received many compliments about my skin. I am often asked what brand of lotion I use on my face. I would like to buy the lotion in a larger container because it is so great for my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
*I think *olay total effects work fine on my mom's aging skin she is 60 now and she loves product like that she feels better with try* olay total effects. If she loves i definitely buy full size for her. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think the oil of Olay moisturizer works great! It evens out my skin tone and definitely brightened my complexion:). I was surprised at how fast the product worked. I like the way the Oil of Olay feels on my skin, it didn't clog pores or cause any breakouts as other moisturizers have. I would absolutely recommend this moisturizer:)) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Although I have only used this product for a week, I have not really noticed any differences. My skin does feel smooth. I do not think it keeps my face moisturized all day long. I have noticed that my face gets a little dry by the end of the night. Maybe I need to use this product longer to notice any more effects of the product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Sorry to say but this product is a disappointment. The pump does not work well and the product itself makes me break out. I have used several times to give it a fair shake but each time break outs occur even had a big lump in the middle of my forehead my husband called me a unicorn. LOL (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this is the best ever moisturizer for my aging skin. I applied this and immediately my skin felt soft and was instantly glowing. I'm hooked on this new product and highly recommend this to all my friends:) it also has a nice light scent this product is also great because it has awesome staying power it also targets every problem that im having as i age:) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I can't believe how great my skin looks, I was skeptical of this product but after using it for just a week, I definately see smoother more even skin tone. My pores are smaller and my skin looks more even. I didn't really have many wrinkles (yet) but my biggest issue was uneven skin tone. This cream is a bit expensive, but the results are worth it. What a great skin product, thanks Olay!j (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the past couple of weeks and I'm really amazed at the results. I feel like my skin is visibly clearer, with less dark patches, and less lines. I also feel like there is more glow in my face. I absolutely recommend this product for women above 35. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Although it's still early in the usage time, I am starting to see tiny improvements to my ""laugh lines"" and ""crow's feet"". One thing that I would improve is a reduction in the scent. I find it quite strong (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I have a really hard time with dry skin and starting to get wrinkles. After using this for a week I have already noticed a difference in how soft my skin seems to stay and my tone seems to be more even. I would definately recommend this product and will keep buying this myself. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have always used Olay Original for a face moisturizer and have been reluctant to make a change because it worked so well...BUT of course I tried my sample of Olay Total Effects and am I glad I did! It brightens up my skin and gives me a glow that I love! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"A little goes a long way with this cream. The first time I tried it, I squirted far too much in my hand to use. I learned my lesson quickly. I only needed a small amount. One tiny, tiny squirt. It spread very easily and evenly. The cream didn't feel oily when I was done. Some times that can be a problem with face cream. I like how it didn't have a strong scent either. All in all, this has been good so far. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I loved the smell of this cream & especially the texture. It dissolved easily and I loved how well this covered! A little dab will do ya! I will definently buy this in a full size. I found the product helped reduce the fine lines and even skin tone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really like this new moisturizer. I started to notice the changes on my cheeks first. They were soft and smooth and looking younger and healthier. Then after a couple more days I noticed the fading of laugh lines. This moisturizer is a keeper! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was immediately impressed with this product. The scent was pleasant but not too powerful. I could feel a change in the softness of my face after the first use. The Moisturizer was light and left my face moist but not oily. Love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I absolutely love this anti-aging cream!! This goes on so smooth on face!! My skin felt tighter just after using it for DAYS!! Fine lines DISAPPEARED!! My uneven skin is no longer!! I can't believe this product!!! AMAZING, AMAZING is all I can say!! I love the bottle too, the pump makes it easy to use, just put a bit on your finger & that's it!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really dislike this lotion. My skin felt like rubber and did not breathe well resulting in acne. My skin had a stiff/tight uncomfortable feeling to it. I saw no difference in fine lines, age spots and brightness of skin. Sorry, but this is a pass in my books. #gotitfree #olay (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received it and tried it every day . It was great it made my face feel so smooth and the lines around my eyes were so fine . I told all of my friends about it . .I love it . Thank you for letting me try it out (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was quite excited to try Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I have had uneven skin tone for some time now and I thought I had to live with it. I have been using the moisturizer for just over 2 weeks now and I can see a positive improvement. My skin feels smooth and looks smoother. I am very satisfied with Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. It is now my go to moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was eager to try the Olay total effects lotion. Unfortunately, my sensitive skin was not as eager to be introduced to this product. I tried applying it at several different times, however the reaction was consistent ;I got a rash. So, no Olay Total Effects for me :( (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have a very hard time to find a moisturizer for my very oily skin. I don't mind using this at night, as I find it makes my faces oily during the day. But I do use it every day on my neck and chest. And I really like it. It does not break me out, and it doesn't feel creasy. I would buy this for this reason only. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Finished off my sample bottle of Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer this morning. Used it morning and night for the past 7 or 8 days, and can definitely see the difference. The fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable and the uneven redness in my complexion is almost gone! Way to go Oil of Olay. Awesome product, just like we always expect from you! Hoping this is available in stores now so I can pick up another bottle tomorrow! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I THINK IT'S THE BEST ANTI AGE MOISTURIZER THAT I HAVE EVER USED. AFTER ABOUT 5 DAYS OF USING OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS, MY HUSBAND SAID, DO YOU EVER LOOK GOOD TODAY. HE SAID I HAD A GLOW. AND I NOTICE MY FACE AND NECK LOOKING BETTER THAN EVER. I HAVE VERY SENSATIVE SKIN, AND IT WAS SO GENTLE. I RECOMMEND TRYING THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is such a great product and I have been telling so many people about it. I have so wrinkles under why eyes that I hate. After using this for awhile now and the fine lines under my eyes are fading. I have tried lots of anti ageing creams before and not one have made my wrinkles go away like this. Love this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I subbed in my other anti aging cream for this oil of Olay. After 3 days I was breaking out all over, my face was a oil pool and I normally have dry skin so it shocked me. I discontinued use right away very disappointed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been in need of a good moisturizer. I have acne prone skin, lines and dryness due to the colder weather. This moisturizer was a lot richer than I expected but it didn't cause any breakouts. I can't comment on the anti-aging effects yet because it's only been a few weeks but I'm really liking it so far. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thank you for sending me a free sample to try.However, I found that the sample I received was not big enough to show any improvements. The scent was very nice and I found it dried very quickly and did seem to make my face feel silkier.But there was no difference in my age spots, my skin did not feel firmer and the fine wrinkles are the same. I would probably not purchase this item again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have tried your product and absolutely love it. The unique vitamin complex in this product evened out my skin tone, minimized the fine lines and age spots and gave my skin some elasticity. In addition, I have noticed a healthier glow in my skin. It applies smoothly and oil free all the while providing the anti age visible results. I will continue using this product and will encourage my family and friends to try it out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Overall the product works fairly well, it is hydrating although I am not sure that it actually make a difference in the fine lines and uneven skin tone but I don't think there are very many products currently on the market that do. However my major beef with the product is the smell. It is awful and chemically and I hate putting it on my face as a result. When there are so many other products that offer similar results but smell good I would tend use them instead. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the Olay Total Effects Moisturizer, I liked it from the first time I tried it a few weeks ago. I love the texture of the moisturizer, it goes on smooth and not greasy at all!! You can immediately put your makeup on after applying it. I have definitely noticed an improvement in my uneven skin tone, my skin looks brighter. I have already recommended it to friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Its been about 3 weeks , i've used the lotion daily and although i haven't noticed any visible changes, i like it. When applied is seamless and smooth, very light fragrance as well. But the one drawback is that i have had a small breakout on my forehead and cheek. Other then that id recommend it but i will not be purchasing it in the future, i will stick with my tried and true Aveeno, daily moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Last week i tried Olay Total Effects 7-in- 1 , unfortunately I am allergic to the product , I given the product to a friend to do a test...... Unfortunately she had skin reaction to the result use Olay Total Effects product 7-in- 1 . this is the first time we had a skin reaction after testing a moisturizer. Too bad the product looked promising ... Better luck next time ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is amazing....I can not believe the difference in my skin!!! It brightens the look of my skin and my pores don't look as big. I have been trying a lot of different things and this product has made the difference!!! I am definitely going to continue to buy this product as it has changed my self asteem!!!! I have struggled for years to find the right product and through this free offer I have finally found it!!!!! Sooooo happy ;) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is a good skin product to use for aging skin. While I didn't see significant improvements in wrinkles or sagging skin, it does smooth and moisturizes your skin so that it feels soft and supple. It also matched my skin colour so it did reduce dark colour spots and big pores. I think you have to use it longer consistently to see improved results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have to say, I have really enjoyed this product. This is the first time I have used an Olay product. I feel very confident in saying I will continue to use this product. My skin feels softy, healthier and I don't find it a hassel to use. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to take care of their skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Since the winter weather hit, my skin has been extra dry. Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer has helped keep this dryness to a minimum. It goes on smoothly, and I can feel my skin drinking it up! It leaves my skin softer and I like the light scent it has. I find my makeup goes on smoothly on top of it as well, which is a definite plus. I'm not sure if it makes my skin look younger, but I probably haven't been using it long enough to really see the results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Went on my face nicely. I like the pump bottle. It smells nice too. It's too early to tell if it works for anti-aging. There certainly weren't any immediate results. I have sensitive skin, and like many other creams with scent, I get little red bumps. Overall, didn't feel like it did anything for my skin that amazed me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am a 34 year old woman, not many wrikkles but my pores a relatively visible. I have found the Total Effect 7 to be of good quality, you can notice just by how little you need to do the whole face. It's absorbed very fast, which I love. The smell is OK, not bad, but not a feature it self. As for the using it , I did notice my skin look a lot brighter and my pores shrank (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've absolutely loved the Olay total effects moisturizer. Instantly on application my skin feels more moisturized and healthy. After only a couple weeks of use I've noticed improved skin tone with fewer dark spots. My eyes look less tired, giving me a fresher, younger look. I've never had results this quickly from an anti-aging treatment before. Can't wait to see what will happen after longer use time. This is one I'll stick with! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was so excited to try this product. I have been so disappointed in it that I would never purchase it. I have been using this for about a week and a half, and I have never had such bad acne! I have not seen any fine line reductions, and the only noticable change that has occurred is with the amount of acne I am sporting! I am not prone to breakouts at all, so it was a surprise when suddenly I look like a teenager. Super unhappy with the results I have seen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really enjoyed using this moisturizer...My skin feels soft and looks bright and clear. I am not sure about wrinkle reduction as of yet but I will continue using it and hope for the best. I also really like the smell of this cream!! Will definitely buy this product and recommend trying it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Well I've been using this product everyday for the past couple weeks and I definitely can see and feel the difference! Winters here in MB are cold and dry and really take a toll on your skin, after using this product my skin feels so mosturized, more brighter and my pores appear smaller. I'm very impressed with the results so far that I've already purchased this product for when my trial bottle runs out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product would be great for a person who does not have sensitive skin. I found it a little too scented for my liking. I also found that it clogged my pores. Perhaps this is best used as part of a night time regime rather than during the day with makeup. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think olay total effect s moisturizer is a 7 in 1 daily skin miracle. It fades age marks, reduces the look of pores and fine lines. I could not believe the difference in just 4 weeks. I noticed a difference in the sun spots gradually fade over the last couple of weeks.my skin feels softer and firm. This product is fantastic and cannot wait until hits the shelves in Feb, 2016. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It's not something FANTASTIC and AMAZING but it smells good, decrease the appearance of pores, lives a soft skin but will not be moisturizing enough for winter for sure. Could be good for spring and eventually summer but not enough for fall and/or winter. I've tried it for 2 weeks now and it gives my skin a lightly ""healthy"" glow that I appreciate. In conclusion I'm probably going to keep it apart for the winter and use it again in spring (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Worked well with my combination skin. It did not leave my forehead oily, which was a nice surprise. No visible signs of smoothing the fine lines, but I don't have many yet either. I do think they need to do their homework and get with the times though. The ingredient lists three parabens, which preserve the product from spoilage and may disrupt our estrogen levels. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I can really tell that it dose what it says ,my lines look smaller my fade is a lot smoother and more firm , it has helped with the aging spots and even my husband notice my skin tone seems more even now I could not be happier with the product would very much highly recommend this (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think it is great, I totally see a difference. I absorbs into the skin really easy, smells good, easy to use and a little goes a long way. I liked it alot. I would buy it for sure. What I would want to know before using would be if it clogs the pores and creates pimple like things on the skin. And also would it help with blotchy skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"You definitely notice an automatic fine lines smoothing. It gives your skin a brighter look, and a firmer look. You will notice your pores starting to fade after about a week. Recommend this to all looking for a good moisturizer and fine line smoother! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was surprised how light the cream is and how moisturized my skin was after. My skin felt silky smooth after every use. I was worried it would make my acne prone skin break out but this oil free formula did not make me break out and left me with smooth hydrated skin! Makin sure it was oil free was the first thing I looked into before I used this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really enjoy Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer, it goes on smooth, soaks into my skin fast and leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth. I've noticed an improvement in the glow of my skin, especially under my eyes where I tend to get dark circles. I'm 29 and want to prevent further wear of my skin, and I think this product will help a lot, as well as treat the issues I already see. The product itself feels smooth and smells refreshing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As with all Olay products, this one did not disappoint. This moisturizer absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. It feels soft and smooth and I'm getting compliments about how great my skin looks! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I may just have very sensitive skin, but this didn't work out well at all. I had to throw it out. It made me break out and made my face itchy. It feels like it's sitting on top of my skin instead of sinking in. I didn't like it at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"As a person who suffers from major allergies, I was very relieved to find no kind of reaction to this scent free moisturizer. It definitely moisturizes and smooths fine lines and wrinkles, makes skin so soft, and evens skin tone. Requires very little product to smooth over face and neck. Feels very refreshing, and keeps skin moisturizer through out entire day! Love this product and will continue to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This Olay product smelled nice and provided moisture to my face. However I didn't not have any other visible results on my face. I would buy this product for the moisture benefits and maybe the other results would show after longer term use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The results are as expected and I ..... LOVE IT! My skin feels smooth, my discolored spots have blended into my natural skin tone and the scent is heavenly. So easy to use too! Absorbs quickly and doesn't become sticky or oily. An absolute must-have! My new secret weapon ;) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for the last 7 days. Overall I would say it's a pretty good moisturizer. My skin feels nice and soft. I can't really say I've noticed any visible difference in any fine lines but that being said, I don't really have many. My skin does appear to have a more even tone though which I really like. I think the best feature is the moisturizing. It's been a pretty dry winter and my skin feels quite moisturized. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. It's Fragrance Free, which is so important for facial products. This is my favorite Olay Moisturizer!I tried other anti-aging moisturizers but Olay has come through as the winner. After only a few weeks of use, I saw a noticeable difference! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The moisturizer did not block my pores. It did leave my skin feeling soft and smooth. It was not a heavy or sticky cream so my skin felt fresh and clean. I don't know about looking ten years younger but to be fair, I am 39 years old and I expect to look 39 years old. What I like is feeling good at what ever age I am. Remember today you are both the youngest you will ever be again and the oldest you have ever been. Thank you for the great product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product is excellent! It's lightweight and goes on non greasy! I can put it on and then do my make up with no issues. The pump dispenses in one light push enough product to do one's face and neck! It goes a long way. My skin is smoother, firmer and brighter. I think I need to look if they have an eye cream in this line too--help with those dark circles. At 47 I am very pleased with how my skin is looking. This product is a keeper! Definitely! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have combination skin but with the cold it becomes more dry. This cream feels great and is so light. The lines in my face are smoothing out. Over all I love it!! Olay Total Effects is a must have. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Loved this moisturizer!!! It's lightweight and not greasy feeling on the skin. Did not log my pores and create blackheada like ao many moisturizers do to me. The smile lines by my eyes have disappeared amd my skin tone is now one healthy radiant color!! Best Olay product yet!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Love, love, love this. My skin can be quite sensitive and dry but this keeps me hydrated without breaking me out. I have definitely noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin since I've started this and will continue to use it. I have found my HG moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been applying the Olay total effects anti-aging moisturizer for a full week now and can see the slight improvements in my skin! My fine lines are gone and my cheeks and forehead appear tighter and younger. I am definitely a fan! I was worried that a new moisturizer would make my sensitive skin greasy or break out in pimples, but I can happily say this has not happened! I am only left with a fresher appearance! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried the Olay Total Effects and I found that my skin felt moisturized and smooth. I remember using the basic Olay as a teenager and stopped using it as my skin changed and aged. This product seems to fit my current skincare needs and I would buy it in the future. It has a good texture and is thick (great for nighttime) but not greasy). Great value for performance! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I tried the product for few days. The texture and sent of the cream is very nice. But for my type of skin, it didn't fit. Too oily. After few days, I got pimples. It is probably a good product for the right skin type but not for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I put this product on my face for one day, and threw it out. The smell was terrible. It smelled like something an older wiser lady would wear. Unfortunately, you didn't win me over with this product Olay. I was very disappointed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I absolutely loved the feeling of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. It felt like cool, creamy velvet on my face and neck. I also used it on my hands. A co-worker also noticed the brightness in my face that came with my once a day usage. It really makes a noticable difference. It is quite an affordable luxury. Does not make your skin greasy. Definitely worth the money. You only use a small amount so it lasts a while. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I liked it so much I actually went and bought a full sized bottle. One pump contained enough for my entire face. It was non greasy and it made my skin feel soft and supple after a week's use. I would upload the picture but it won't let me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really wanted to like this moisturizer since I'm a faithful user of Olay, but after just 2 weeks of using the product my skin has become a landmine of pimples. I'm not sure if it's the scent or the colour but I won't be able to use this product in the future. I'll be going back to using my Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin. One plus about the product is that it does what is says in the Anti-Aging department. I must look younger since I'm 35 years old and was asked for ID the other day.

I found this cream to have a nice texture when putting it on. But it doesn't seem to moisturize as much as I'd like it to. I also found that it caused me to break out a little bit. I wouldn't purchase this in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I absolutely love this product. My little girl always said i had soft cheeks and skin. Now they are even softer. It goes on smooth and doesn't feel greasy at all. The small wrinkles that were starting to show are gone now. I love Olay and plan on buying this onces it comes on the market. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Olay total effectsis an awesome product. I imagined it being greasy and not effective but it is complete opposite. My skin feels smooth even and alive. I feel my pores look smaller and fine lines around my mouth have decreased. Thanks bzzagent I do believe I found my new moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have noticed more radiant and healthier looking skin after using Olay Total Effects. The lines on my face and near my eyes are not so visible as before. My face and neck look more healthier and my skin tone looks more radiant than before. I was skeptical at first but you have to try Olay Total Effects for yourself to see the benefits of the vitamin complexes used to help your skin look more younger and more appealing.

"I received my trial size of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer free 10 days ago, and I have been using it every morning since i t came. I have noticed really great results. The slight wrinkles around my eyes have shrunk, and my skin looks a lot more bright and even toned (I am prone to having red blotches all over my face) I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wanta to have younger, healthier looking skin in just days!

"I believe during the course of using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer has really rejuvenate my skin. The vitamins in the is product has even my skin tone, which was a problem before,has refined the lines under my eyes and makes my skin firmer. I love the way it made my face smoother than before. I would definitely encourage consumers looking to fight the signs of aging to please consider Olay Total Efeect 7 in 1 Anti aging moisturizer, it woks.

"I liked this moisturizer for many reasons. It made my skin feel soft and silky, it wasnt greasy like some anti-aging moisturizers and it had a pleasant scent. I did see a difference with the look and feel of the skin around my eyes, being that the moistuizer seemed to do its job. For the price, this is a good product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think I have finally found a product that actually does what it says it will do. Have only been using the Olay Total Effects for a week but already see a reduction in the fine lines and texture of my skin. I have used the Basic Oil of Olay for years but this product outshines all the other stuff I have tried. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I tried it it thinking it might be like all the others out there but its not it works i see and feel the difference i now have a product i will use all the time i am even going to get my mom to give it a try (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love this olay product . My skin is very sensitive and I had no problem using it. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and not greasy. I dare to say that My skin actually looks younger and healthy since I started using it and I will continue to buy it because I'm extremely happy with the results :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using the sample of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for a little over a week now. I think I might be seeing results but it's hard to say - I would of needed to try it for a month to really be certain. With the little sample I've received, I did notice my skin feeling more supple, looking less fatigued and healthy. Send me more so I can be sure that I should switch from my high-end brand to OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using this on my face and neck for almost two weeks. I really haven't notice any difference however I do like the smell and I like that it doesn't leave my face oily. I think I will update in another two weeks to see if there has been any progress in my tiny, fine lines that show up when I smile. So far as a moisturizer it's pretty good. #olay7in1antiagingmoisturizer (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This product is light and refreshing. It doesn't clog pores or feel greasy at all. The coverage is fantastic and very little needed to apply. The skin looks smooth and subtle and redness and blotchy colours are evened out in tones. Wrinkles and fine lines are reduced quite dramatically and a youthful glow is the result. I highly recommend this product to woman that have started the aging process. It's fantastic! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is a great moisturizer from Olay! It's not too greasy, it really sinks into the skin when you put it on. It's Fragrance Free, which is so important for facial products. This is my favorite Olay Moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received a free sample of Olay Total Effects 7 from BzzAgent to give my opinion on the product. The only issue I have is that I wish the sample was larger! Smells great, feels nice on my skin, very moisturizing without making me feel like I have something laying on my skin and just a really nice and effective product. I'm hooked! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried the total effects 7 in 1 moisturizer and was not very impressed. It left my skin peeling and made me break out but without all the skin promises like reducing fine lines wrinkles etc. It had a nice light scent and applied very nicely and moisurized skin but it didn't meet my expectations or the benefits it touts. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I started using this cream 4 days ago and wow! My face is so soft and stays that way all day! Even in this cold weather! I am really enjoying this face cream as part of my morning ritual! Thank you bzz agent for introducing me to this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think it's a really good product and also that the price is good. It's good quality enough to think it's a good deal to buy it. The smell is nice and not too strong (if the smell is too strong, I can not use it), texture is smooth and the feeling of the skin right after is really comfortable. I recommande it to anyone who is looking for a good product for a cheap price. I also may buy some of it as a christmas gift for a friend of mine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
At first I didn't see a big difference but after a few days I noticed that my skin tone seemed to be balancing out. My skin seemed smoother and it just felt softer. I love that the cream is smooth and has a satiny finish as I can apply my makeup right after I've used the Olay Total Effects! I think that this product is terrific and will definetly be buying this once it's on the shelf in February. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was not overly impressed with this product. Yes, it smells nice. Yes, it smooths on nicely. Yes, it absorbs quickly. Did I notice any improvements in my skin.....no. The sample was too small. A product like this normally needs to be used religiously for at least a month before any improvements are seen. I appreciate the sample. It has interested me enough to buy a full size bottle to give it a real try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Really liked the Olay... the smell was great, the texture amazing, the application great, liked the short-term results in covering pores (not sure it covered fine lines)... not sure if it would help in the long-run of fine lines and pores but really did enjoy the product for the short-term results. Would definitely buy this product to try a larger sample and give it another go! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think the sample was too small to see any real results. It did help diminish the redness on my face though, no signs of improvement after the 10 days the bottle afforded me. I didn't love it enough to run out and buy a bottle to see if I will get the promised results with continued used. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Upon using Olay, it gave a nice texture on my skin. With everyday use, I feel my skin starts to feel and look smoother. No greasy feeling after I apply it on my skin. Lines seems to soften up too. Lighter skin coplex and rafiant looking. I will comtinue to use it and will highly recommend to my friends and family. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried this product and found it to be quite rich and made my skin extremely oily to the point I had break outs on my face and had to discontinue usage. I have oily skin already so it is not the product for me. But appreciated the opportunity to try before buying. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I was so happy to test Olay cause i'm a daily user of their products. But quickly i found out i really hate this cream. It Smell awful and did absolutely nothing good on my skin. The bottle is too small to test long enough i think. i'm very very sad to give a negative point of view but i have to be honest because i respect Olay a lot. I just wish they will consider our opinion and ameliorate the Moisturizer before selling it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love the lotion! It was very moisturizing and left my face feeling very soft and it was not greasy which is great! I love how there is 7 in one instead of using a bunch of skin products. I will recommend this product to my friends so they can try it too I will definitely buy a full size! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been Looking for a moisturizer that could compete with some of the higher end (higher priced) options. There is little to no scent. The sample size was generous. It went on without any oily or greasy feeling and was light weight. I am sad to say that after using for 5 days, my skin was not very moisturizer and had started breaking out in weird places. For these reasons I had to discontinue use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Well....it's been 2 weeks of using Olay Total Effects and I'm almost a new woman! My skin feels so soft and smooth and people say that I'm almost glowing! My skin tone is even and bright! I'm 46 and I look much younger! This is a fountain of youth in a jar! I am so thrilled with this product! If you want to feel and look younger....look no further! This is a miracle cream!!!!

"Olay is fantastic!I have been using olay for quite a long time.i love the soft scent it leaves and i love how soft it leaves my skin feeling for hours after!I need hydration and this product gave me that too.Olay is such a wonderful product it always does what it is supposed to do,Many products claim some thing but dont comply,Olay always gives something to their customers!Very honest company (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I did love the quick work at reducing fine lines and such. But sadly I had a mild reaction..surprised me. My skin is not prone to reactions, I did pass product on to my sister andshe loves it..went out and bought a bottle to keep using. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this was a good product. Found my skin to be firmer and even skin tone. I have no reason not to recommend this product. I feel it will do its job. Found that it was good at a few of the age spots that have been appearing. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really like this I have even noticed my freckles fading with it. I am disappointed that it is not in stores until February as I am almost out of it. But it is my new must have I would highly recommend this to anyone and I have told lots of friends, coworkers and family about it. I have tried ordering the full size one and it keeps telling me to go to my local retailer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
If you have wrinkles and you try many product and it didin't works thant this product is for you!! My skin was really tight after using it and the apparence of the wrinkles was better. I give this protuct 10/10!!! Its really innovating!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"Don't get me wrong I do like the cream, its light and non greasy. This is the end of 2nd week and I don't see a difference... I been applying it twice a day, before/after bed...maybe I'll see more changes in a few more weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have really bad dry skin on my forehead and on my nose and around my nose and this has helped tremendously. My skin feels so moisturized . When I am done this sample size I will be buying a full size for sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I like the texture and consistency of the product. It smells nice but is not overpowering. It penetrates my skin quickly and leaves no greasy film. I haven't been using it long enough to gauge whether my skin looks more youthful BUT I know that sun damage is a major cause of aging. So why doesn't the product contain sunscreen? (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This product has really outdone itself !! Smooth skin lines and age Spot are barely there . The smell is amazing !! Olay is my go to product and has been since I was 20 !! Give it a try it you will not be disappointed !! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using the Olay anti aging cream for only a week now. I cant say that my face became wrinkle-free but they definitely feel smoother, brighter and firmer. It is definitly a product that I intend to buy once available and use as a long term solution. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the way my skin feels after I use this product. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I'm hooked. I already notice an improvement. I only wish I would have received a full bottle, but I'm buy it anyways. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After 2 weeks of using the olay total effects 7, I can see myself look younger. I like the fragrance smell, and the moisturizer absorbs quickly and does not leave my face grease. And it's working great, I would definitely recommend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received a trial size of Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer and I am impressed, it smooths out my skin and I really like the smell of it. I apply it once a day and have added it to my daily routine. I think my skin is much softer and smoother. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer for about a week now. The texture is nice and light. It'd be a good summer time moisturizer, but I'm not sure if it is good enough for me for the winter time. I usually use something that feels richer in the winter. I haven't seen any difference on my fine lines and dark spots yet. Hopefully, it will come with time. So far, I quite like the product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love Olay products and use them 99% of the time. I like the texture and smell (yes it is perfumed so if you are sensitive to smell be aware). It soaks in quickly and it feels great, however, as the day progressed I felt my skin was become ""tight"". I am not sure if it is because of the winter weather, but I feel like my face is lacking in moisture by the end of the day. It would be interesting to be able to compare it to spring/summer months. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this cream is amazing its evening out my skin tone and it feels really soft.. The smell of it I love too cause it gives you a fresh perfume smell. I have been putting it in the morning after washing my face and my face feels amazing all day long and it doesn't leave a greasy after look or feeling I'm liking it so far (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I live in a very dry climate and this moisturizer is a dream. I am not even concerned about the antiaging characteristics at this point. It feels so lovely on my skin, previously i had used clinique but it felt too watery and like i hadn't put anything on my face (is. back to dry and itchy) within minutes after application. This Olay however is so soft and creamy to apply, and makes my skin feel naturally hydrated all day. it definitely outdid my expectations. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

"loved the scent, made me feeling alive and fresh all day. my skin drys out A LOT during the colder seasons and this helped keep my skin feeling good all day. i find a lot of moisturizers can leave my skin feeling oily/greasy all day and this one did not. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Well not much has changed on my face this past week. Well not that I have noticed. I still really like the feel of this cream and the smell. It is an easy pump to use and does give out the right amount for your face. When I look at my face it seems not so dull. So I guess somethings have changed. By the time Christmas rolls around I'm sure hoping that 10 years have gone off my face. What a Christmas gift that would be LOL I will keep you posted.

"I love this Moisturizer! I had never tried this before, but now will change my moisturizer to this one. I love that it is now available in trial size for easy travel. I love how soft my skin feels and how it minimizes the look of pores. I have an age spot that I am watching to see if it helps eliminate or reduce the look - here's hoping! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I didn't expect to like the moisturizer as much as I do! I love the light scent and the fact that my skin doesn't feel sticky after using it like others have in the past. My pores are less noticeable. I have also noticed a lot less redness. I was applying a primer to my skin using my finger tips and was surprised at how smooth my skin felt. I haven't noticed a big difference in the lines and wrinkles. Perhaps if I give it more time I will. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received my olay Total Effects a couple of weeks ago and I LOVE it! I have always used olay products on a regular basis before, but never have tried this one before until about a week ago. I can feel such a difference in my skin in even this little time.It looks smoother and just more even toned. I love it and I will continue to use this product always:) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think that having used this product my skin texture has improved and is more even toned. I have not had anyone commenting on it but I notice a improvement. My skin feels softer as well. If you have dark spots or uneven skin tone it will give you definite improvements. I haven't noticed a big improvement with less wrinkles but my skin feels tighter. Having tried it first gives you a better advantage. I would buy the product especially for skin texture. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think the Olay 7 in 1 Anti Aging moisturizer is a fantastic product! The scent is a very nice and light, the product goes on very smooth and absorbs quickly, and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated even through these cold Canadian winter days. Great product!

"Well been using it for almost 2 weeks . There is not much difference with my skin accept I feel it not hydrated enough, but I have very dry and sensitiveskin . The one thing I was very impressed is it did not have a itchy or burning feeling so a big plus there for me. I don't have the huge yet to change from my usual brand. But will use it to the end to see if i'll change my mind eventually. Would certainly tell friends to try it to see If they would like it more then me.

I've been using the free trial size I got for free from BzzAgent last week ... And well while I love the consistency I really hate the heavy scent that's in it . The perfume in this cream make my eyes burn a few days after I started to use it so I'll be discontinuing it . I think this cream has potential but Ther perfume in it has to go . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this product a lot. It moisturizes, minimizes pores, has SPF, evens out your skin, prevents wrinkles and more. One thing is that it does smell like sunscreen but it's barely noticeable. My skin is oily combination so greasy moisturizers are a no for me, but this one is light and not greasy at all. Everyone is different so results will be different, but I definitely recommend this product and I am definitely repurchasing (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have to say I love how smooth the olay total effects is making the lines on the outside corner of my eyes and smoothing out my cheeks. Seems to have calmed the bit of redness I get. Plus it smells fresh and doesn't feel heavy on my face and neck. Going to be buying for sure...only negative is that the bottle was to small!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received the olay total effect 7in1 and really loved it i feel like even after one week my skin look totally different it's really working amazing on my skin . Anyone can notice the difference I really want to thank for sending me this for trial (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
i think that I am really enjoying my OlayTotal effects. I like the smell and i love the texture of it. It is light and very rapidly absorbed. I like to think that i see diminished lines around my mouth . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Mosturizer for one week now and I am starting to see and feel a difference. My skin seems more toned. I am starting to notice a cleaner look. There are fewer fine lines that I need to cover up with concealer. Overall, I am happy with the product. It doesn't feel heavy. There is a pleasant light odor and no residue. I really feel like I am doing something good for my face when I use the product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 for just over a week now! Having been a Clinque fan for years I might have already switched my routine to include this anti-aging moisturizer! Non-greasy, low scent and even coverage! My skin is softer, no break outs or blemishes and the sun spots are evening out with the rest of my skin tone! Love this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This has got to be One of the Best Products I have Used for My Face. It makes My skin soft and looks better just after a week of use. I definitely recommend this product. I have Sensitive skin and have had no reaction what so ever to it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think that it had a great scent, went on easily, wasn't thick or stick, had a nice texture and overall was a nice product. I found that it covered pores nicely but not so much the fine lines around my eyes. Not sure if its 'anti aging' more of a concealer. Maybe if I used the product longer but I'm sure if I want to get ride of fine lines then a more drastic approach is needed. But I did like everything about this product for a temporary solution and would definitely buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It was a first for me, I never use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I received the cute sample (I love the pump, gave just enough cream) its not too oily and my skin feel hydrated... I love it... I will recommand it to my friend and family. thanks bzz (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Love the size of the container for travel! Pump works great, size is perfect for carry on. Really like the weight of this product, goes on even and does not leave a heavy feeling on my skin. Results, well those are still unknown at this time. I can say that I have not experienced any break outs, which is a bonus. Skin is soft and blemish feel. Now for those wrinkles. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The more I use this product, the more I like it. It is light, which is of primary importance to me as I have combination skin. It is frustratingly dry but if I put cream on it, I break out. I have terrible winter skin. I just had to go to see my doctor to get some taro-clobetasol cream in order to combine a spreading rash on my neck. This product does not burn or interfere with my medication. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this sample, which i was looking forward to try because i like Olay's products!! I am very disappointed as i haven't seen no changes at all. My lines are all the same ......I even did it for 10 days because after 7 days, i didn't see no difference.... It does make you skin feel hydrated and soft. That's pretty much it! So , honest opinion, don't spend your money on this product if you want results! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that this product is not a quality product for anti aging. And it does not live up to The claims it makes! After 5 days of use my skin feels very dry and i dont see any inprovements in my skin. The pore size is the same, the lines are the dame and even look worse now because of the dryness in my skin now, my skin tone has not even out and i have also gotten a few blemishes. i wouldnt recommend this to a friend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have used this product for 7 days now and I love it! I am always skeptical on anti-aging products and I was skeptical with this one too. The cream has a nice fragrance and consistency and definitely provided my skin with the moisture it required. Low and behold after a week of daily use, my fine lines have smoothed out and are not as noticeable. Especially in-between my eyes. My sample is almost done so I will be looking for this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got this product a week ago and LOVE it. I normally use coconut oil on my face but found this just as refreshing. It didn't leave a residue and my skin feels great all day long! I've been using it a week and I can already notice uneven spots that are evening out. Very satisfied and would recommend :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Got my Olay Total Effects 7 and loving how my skin is feeling. I,am noticing a different around my eyes. The moisturizer is also nice on the skin, will be sharing information about Olay Total Effects 7 to my family members and friends so you can get Olay Total Effects 7 will continue to use it in the future.

"I have combination skin, so it's hard for me to pick an appropriate moisturizer. I used the product for two days, and broke out on my chin. I am waiting for that to clear up to start again. I plan on trying to use the product on my problem areas (in between eybrows, forehead and laugh lines), instead of on my entire face. So far, 3 out of 5. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Aging Moisturizer for about a week, I can totally see myself switching over to this brand! It goes on smooth (dont need to use a lot) and it really leaves my skin moisturized / silky almost (even the next morning). I'm using this in the evening and then my regular moisturizer in the morning. I'll write another review once the trial pkg is done...but for now, thumbs up! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"What a difference a few applications make, this has left my skin softer than ever and slowly helping to even out my skin tone. Love this product and at a ""average"" price point will have me buying it again. I have tried a lot of moisturizers in the past and this is one of the best Olay products I have used. Such a nice texture and no sticky residue. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
So this is Day 1 of using Olay Total Effects. It goes on nice and easy and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I have large pores on my face that I am truly hoping that this will help dimensh the sight and leave my skin firmer. After using it the first time it has left my face feeling nice and soft and has a pleasant aroma. So far I am quite pleased with the product but will do another review after using it for awhile to see the difference. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think it's awesome! I've never used a better face product in my life! my sun spots are gone! My wrinkles are gone! That's like the Fountain of Youth! I'm going to buy it for sure! in fact I didn't even have to tell anybody bout it because people just asked me what I was using to make my face looks so good and just overnight at that (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think olay is a good brand and in the past i have found them to be on the oily side but olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizer is not at all. It feels so light on my skin and does what it says. My skin tone is brighter and more even. Im in love it with it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Since i employ thie new Total Effects from Olay, to protect my skin has never be funny like that.. I enjoy the trial size, and 1 push from the pump is the good amount of the cream tu use... It's my first step the morning . Before buying it i would like to know if it's a night or day cream. The 7 in 1 moisturizer has a vitamin complex that help to fight the signs of aging.. My skin is more even and soft.. #GotitfreefromOlayUS #BzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have only been using my trial size of OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer that I got free from @OlayUSA for one week and the unique vitamin complex has helped completely erased the dark spots on my face and evened out my skin tone beautifully! I will continue to repurchase this product as it is such an amazing products! I have used many anti-aging moisturizers and none have come close to doing what they claim....until this one!!! #GotItFree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Got it free from Bzzagent. I love how it makes my face feel and that it's not greasy. Im always nervous to try new products on my face.

"I think my skin for the most part looks radient, I can see clear signs of tightening of where the wrinkles usually are. However I have SLE with discoid involvement and the area that has leisons were irritated. Works well for those without skin issues. I use in all areas but those and thankful I tried it and you will be too!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really enjoyed this moisturizer! I usually have trouble with strongly scented creams/lotions and this one was so lightly scented it was perfect! I didn't get any pimples either which also is a problem I normally experience! It was so quickly absorbed my face felt great straight out of the shower and I was ready for the day! Thanks again for the sample! Will definitely be purchasing the one with sunscreen when I run out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This product is really good! It's not something I would have bought if I didn't try it first. I started using it a week ago and I can already notice a difference in my skin! I will be adding this to my grocery list from now on. I even had my mom ask what I was using for my face! She plans to go out and buy a bottle as well!!! Very impressed with this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Its good for dryness of the colder weather. My face is sometimes sensitive so did notice it tingled a bit. I am not sure if I would buy myself. Didn't notice any difference in skin other then a little softer.. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was excited to try this product. At 42, my youthful appearance is starting to get some wrinkles. After only 3 days of using this product, i have noticed a difference in not only my skins appearance, but thr softness of my skinas well. My skin is brighter....i look healthier :) younger :) and most important my cconfidence is back! Thanks Olay....i am a loyal customer from this day forward! Love this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I like the product goes on smooth and goes a long way with a little bit of cream. Nice smell. Used it right after the shower on damp skin and it absorbed easily. Not greasy or shiny. Awesome product would highly recommend (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I find this product actually does some of what it promotes! It definitely enhances brightness and evens skin tone and moisturizes the skin! Haven't noticed anything with pores or lines and wrinkles as I'm not quite there yet but it hits the mark in the other categories and I love the smell too (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received my trial size of Olay Total Effects 7. Once I got it I put it to use. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. It kinda leaves my skin a little greasy and heavy feeling. I like the idea of the trial size (available to all in Feb.) Try it out cost efficiently first. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Olay has always produced great quality products, whether it be for cleansing or moisturizing and I can wholeheartedly without reservation recommend that you will get your money's worth and more every time. Go ahead give it a try. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a very good product. I saw a difference just in the few days that I've used it. I have ultra sensitive skin and the only thing that I noticed was that I had a slight reddening and burning, which I'm thankful to say that wasn't as bad as with other products that I have used in the past. My skin was smoother and bit plumper looking than before I used it. I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
1 week in to using my Olay Total effects and I have noticed a more even skin tone. I have a few dark spots on my face and I have noticed that they have faded. I love how my skin feels after putting on the cream. It's not greasy and you don't need a lot of it. My only complaint is that I wish it was fragrant free. Not a fan of the smell. Thanks Bzz Agent! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
After the first week my skin is looking pretty good. I love the velvet texture of the product and the fact that it does not bother my allergies. I can't wait to see how my skin looks after a few more weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"The unique vitamin coplex, helped me go to war with my fine lines and uneven skin tone, I have noticed that since I have started using Olay total effects 7 in 1 anti aging moisturizor that my fine lines are less visable, my skin tone looks more even and my face feels soft, also I have not had any break outs ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The texture of this product is hard to explain- it incredibly light like a lotion and yet it penetrates my skin like a thick moisturizer. It was an effective weather block on a fall day. My skin immediately felt moisturized and revitalized. The pump ensured I dint get too much - my face used 3 pumps . After a few days (not weeks or months) I could see results and I expect the best results are still to come (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
this helped me with my dry patch that I have under one of my eyes and hasn't come back . Leaves youe sjun feeling fresh and smooth ... so with that said I think that I am going to go buy me a full size bottle . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Olay Total Effects is nothing short of fabulous, no hoax here folks. Truly amazing, my face has a particular age spot that is now visibly gone.. I can't believe it, of all the products.. well look no more! As well as firming, replenishing moisturizing and brightness it also: Visibly smoothes fine lines and wrinkles; evens skin tone appearance & minimizes the look of pores. You will not be disappointed and neither was I! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"oil of olay claims 7 in 1 anti aging beneifits. Ive been using for 4 days and I have noticed a very little difference in the fine lines under my eyes but Ive also noticed some negative things. For one the moisterizer is sented and the perfume in a moosterizer can be very drying, i dont feel like my skin is well moisterized when using this face cream. Also there is no sunscreen in it which is important to prevent aging. I will continue to use and update later. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was so excited to receive my sample in the mail. I started using the first night it arrived. I loved the feel of it and it really seem to moisturize my oh so dry skin after a couple of night. The third night was the end for me.........woke up with swollen eyes and blotchy skin. Allergies kicked in with no mercy. Not sure what ingredient was the culprit, so disappointed. Hopefully will be able to find something that I can use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"At first it felt a bit greasy when I applied it on my face, but the product gets easily absorbed, leaving skin feeling supple and well moisturized. I could see that my skin visibly appear brighter. The smell is pleasant. The moisturizing effect lasted throughout the night and my skin feels great in the morning. I am usually not a big fan of play products but I definitely wouldn't mind purchasing it for myself or others. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been trying the new olay total effects 7 in 1 anti-aging moisturizer. Since i have started using this product my face has felt amazing and so very soft. I dont have many wrinkles on ny face but after a matter of days the have become less visible to me and everyone else around me. This is a product that i will definatly continue to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
How many wonderful things can I say about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. I was lucky enough to try it courtesy of Buzz Agent. First thing I love the fragrance. It's heavy enough you feel it moisturizing but light enough it's not greasy. My face looks brighter wit a radiant glow. This is definatly a new addition to my face regime. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"i think its a great idea to put so many benefits in 1 bottle. this will help me cut down putting on other skin care. also, its an antiaging moisturizer! my skin feels more supple with first application. the bottle design is great for easy delivery. so far, no obvious changes on wrinkles or fine lines. i will try for a week and see if there will be changes. no irritation is a great plus. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that using the Olay products for many years, my skin is younger and healthier looking than my sisters who dont use anything on their skin. I am the oldest and you would never guess by looking at me and my Olay skin! I have always loved the smell and it is one of very few products that dont make my face turn red from sensitivity. I loved Olay many years ago and I love Oay to this date. Great product!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I just love, love, love this product. In just a few days I noticed the fine lines around my eyes were deminished and my skin was much softer, if this is the results in just a few days, I can only imagine what my skin will look like after 4 weeks. Olay Effects has a fresh clean scent and smooth texture that it makes you want to use it everyday. I will definitely be buying this product the next time I'm at the store. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"My skin is very sensitive, and I'm always worried about trying new moisturizers, but Olay has always been a trusted brand, so I was happy to try it out. I've only been using the product for about a week, but I've noticed a difference in how soft my skin is. I also noticed that my cheeks and forehead which are usually reddish - were not as bright as they normally are. So I'm thinking it's evening out my skin tone as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I just received my Olay moisturizer, yay! My first impressions are very positive. The texture is nice and it smells really good, without too much perfume. It leaves my skin really soft and smooth. I am really looking forward to see the improvements on my skin over the next few days. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this cream is amazing I have tried many different creams and have not been very happy, but this cream goes on smooth and is not oily. I have been using it for about 5 days now and I have seen a difference in my skin especially around the eye area, I love this cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The day I received the sample of Olay Total Effects within hours I tried the product . I was reluctant to buy, because there is always so many to choose from. I heard lots of good things about this moisturizer and boy were they true. It smells good, leave the face feeling fresh and soft. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've used different Olay products throughout the years and was excited to try Olay Total Effects. I'm 5 months pregnant and up until now, my skin has been its usual self, since starting Olay on Saturday my skin has had a lot of Acne. I have discontinued use for now but will attempt again once my skin clears up. I'm disappointed that my skin reacted this way and hope its hormones instead of Total Effects. I did like how the product went on, very smooth application. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Omg my skin is so dry, I tried so many cream, serum, etc. and always have this problem. But after only 4 days trying this product, my skin was so smooth and well moisturized, people compliment me and say my skin look healthy and bright. I will seriously include this item in my 'to buy again and again' list. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This stuff goes on like velvet, absorbs right into your skin, and smells amazing. I haven't used it long enough to know if it will help with my annoying age spot, but I love the ritual of putting it on. Doesn't feel greasy but feels so nourishing. I'll check back in next week! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I'm now noticing that my age spots are now lighter. My skin smooth and more even looking. This really is a fantastic product. It seems to be even better at this point than the other olay products I've used. I haven't checked out the price of it yet but I'm sure that with the results I'm getting after a few days it will be well worth it. This lady is sooooooooooooo pleased. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I think this product is great. I don't have a lot of visible lines and wrinkles because I've always taken care of my skin. But just after a few days I can see a difference in my skin. Anything that keeps me looking younger than I am is a good thing in my books! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"It's a good moisturizer in terms of doing the job. The first thing I did notice was the list of ingredients. The moisturizer I use on a regular basis is all natural, organic and Vegan which I love and contains 1 ingredient. This moisturizer contains so many ingredients that can't even be pronounced by a fluently english speaking person. So I am conscious of the fact that this is all chemicals. Not for me (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
As soon as I open my eyes I reach for my Olay 7 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and on it goes . So refreshing and light with a mild fresh classic Olay scent my skin absorbs it instantly. I am loving my newest morning routine thank you BzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

Before you get this product you should be prepared for some incredible results. I have been using this product morning and night for about 5 days now and can already see visible results. I also have highly sensitive skin. It makes my skin glow with youth and silky smooth to the touch. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Noticing tighter pores and softer skin; even after just a couple days use. The Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer is lightweight; leaves no oily or sticky residue on my skin. The smell is strong but appealing. Very floral. My skin feels soo soft and firm. A noticeable difference in two days. A little goes a long way so im sure ill see significant results by the end of the bottle. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer helped to make my skin feel smooth. It didn't make my skin feel heavy when applied. I received a lot of compliments on how bright, young and refreshed my skin looked. It made me feel better every morning looking in the mirror and feeling great. I will be recommending this product to my family and friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is the fountain of youth! Goes on smooth and light and completely evens out skin tones and doesn't clog pores. I don't even need foundation anymore as the balance in tone and texture is covered by Olay Effects7! I find most creams or lotions that claim to smooth wrinkles and find lines are too heavy and greasy feeling but this product is light and smooth and natural feeling. This is a new beauty essential for me! Love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After using the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer for a few days, I can already feel the softness of my skin. I love a moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy on my face and this is breathable and refreshing! I plan to continue to use it every day. The trial size isn't available in stores yet but the full size is and I know I'll be going to buy a bottle once my trial is gone :) also it smells amazing! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using this moisturizer for a few days and already I can feel my skin is super soft. I use it in the morning after washing my face and my face feels so refreshed and smells really good! I like that it's not thick and heavy on my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I actually liked the feeling of it once it was applied. Not greasy and easy to apply. I have combination skin, so certain parts of my face are very dry while others are very oily and acne prone, so if you're like me you may actually like this product. I didn't notice it making a drastic change so far though. Maybe it takes a bit more time for some. I'd want to know how well this works for combination skin before I buy it.

Day 5 ! It work so well and moisturizing my skin. Now I have 5 years younger cause my pa where my eyes dissappear ! !! All gone!

Love the texture and subtle scent of this moisturizer. It glides on my skin smoothly and absorbs quickly which is a must so I can get to applying my make up. Also acts as a great primer under my foundation. Leaves my face feeling very supple and glowy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Received Olay Total Effects 4 days ago! Love it! Super soft...non greasy and very light scent. I can feel a difference on my face for smoothness already. I can't wait until it's on the shelf to buy. It will be part of my day, everyday! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Once again Olay does it!! Every product that I tried by Olay is always 4 -stars. Am a fan of everything from the face products to the hair products. Thank you for offering this campaign, I have enjoyed trying it and will buy again when the trial-sized product is gone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using my cream for three days now. My first impression is that the texture is really nice. Smooth and silky, the smell is the caracteristic smell of Olay products, it smells good. A synthetic but nice smell. I liked the product so far, my skin is hydrated, smooth, and luminous. Since I have used for three days I cannot say yet if it had any effect on my wrinkles. I have wrinkles mostly on my forehead and near my eyes. I am eager to rate the efficacity of the product ! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Before I tried this product, I was wondering if it would accomplish all its 7 claims. Only using it for a few days, I immediately feel that it evens skin tone appearance and enhances brightness I am confident that it will deliver all its 7 anti-aging effects, however, it is just a bit early for me to say right now as I have only used for a few days. But I like this moisturizer very much, I feel very comfortable using this. This is a product for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"If you want to have great looking skin and feel younger, definitely try this product. It does wonders to make you look younger and makes your skin feel amazing. Even if you feel it's too late to try the product that it might not work I suggest trying it because you do notice a difference in a short amount of time.

"I started using OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer 4 days ago. I love the subtle scent of it. I haven't noticed anything on my little wrinkle yet, but I'm still hopeful! I have been noticing that my skin tone is starting to even out though, and I'm incredibly happy about it! It goes on incredibly smooth, and I love that it doesn't make my skin oiling, like so many other lotions do. I will definitely be buying this lotion the next time I go to the store! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I used to love Olay products, and when I got this Bzz invite I was so excited to try. Until I looked at the ingredients. Lots of alcohol which is drying, not moisturizing and the use of parabens. For shame Olay! It has a pleasant smell, but fragrance is an irritant so this isn't great for the face. It feels nice and is not at all greasy, it's just too bad the ingredients aren't better. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I just received my trial size of the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer and I am super happy with it. My face feels soft and hydrated since using it. It has only been a few days but so far, so good. This product smells fresh, feels light weight and makes you feel great. I have also noticed that I look more awake and fresh since using it. Like my face has received a little radiance. I will continue to use it and see how it pans out. Super happy and excited with it so far!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
So I used to use olay products until I changed to another product few years ago. I was excited to get this campaign. I'm in my 30s so this product is perfect for me. Leaves my skin smooth and moisterized. Even after couple of days ..my skin is looks firmer and even skin tone. Love the feel and texture of this moisterizer. And seems like it will be available in near by stores. Thanks BzzAgent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have tried the Olay Total Effects twice so far and I am pleasantly surprised. I haven't used very many Olay products and I didn't feel overly positive about the brand. So far I really enjoy the cream. It has a lovely soft texture and nice smell. My skin felt soft and it absorbed quickly. I haven't noticed any changes in my skin yet, but I am pleased so far (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer for about three days now. I already feel a difference, my skin feels softer and smoother. I have very dry skin and the cold weather makes it even drier but I find with Olay Total Effects my skin remains moisturized all day long. Also, my skin tone is more even and there is a radiant glow on my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think that the trial sized bottle was too small to give me enough time to notice a difference. I used the entire bottle, once daily for a week. I did not notice a difference in my skin. I was hoping it would help with the wrinkles around my eyes and the two small age spots. Nothing. I did find the scent a little too strong. Maybe if I had two trial sized bottles or one larger one, I would have noticed a difference at the end of the bottle (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been delighted to have received Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer! I feel my skin being well moisturized and firm and I don't feel my skin pulling because of the cold weather. I have also noticed this radiant glow on my cheeks and even skin tones under my eyes. Thank you for inviting me to try the Olay Total Effects! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Second day, I continue to test Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. First of all, my skin face burn after application. My skin is sensitive. If your skin is sensitive this product is not for you. My skin still burn after 9 hours after application. I have pink spot. This cream smell good. After 2 days it is too soon for anti-aging effect. Olay is oil-free, will not clog pores, fast absorbing, non-greasy formula. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been trying this product on a freebie trial. It's only been a few days but I'd say it does 1, 3, 4 and 7 in its claim to fame list with a quick turn around so far. I think the appearance and age spots might be a longer term result. It's more a light creamy lotion whereas I prefer the serum for my very sensitive skin as it usually irritates less. I am using after washing in the evening and under makeup in the am. We'll see how it continues... #IGotItFree #BzzAgent #Olay (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Received my Oil of Okay Total Effects! I applied the cream and OMG! It went on like silk! It doesn't feel oily or greasy, as most moisturizers do. It absorbed quickly into my skin, leaving it soft and smooth. Okay Total Effects also didn't irritate my skin. Although this was my first application, I am looking forward to using it and hopefully seeing some fine lines ""disappear"". (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The product is good because you can see the result really fast and moisturizer the skin. The result depend a lot of your kind of skin but you can see some good result. I like the oil-free because it does not stick or look gross and the fast-absorbing so result can be seen fast. The packaging is good designed and easy to use (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I absolutely love this trial size facial cream. I have already noticed a difference since I started using it. Skin is softer, has an even skin tone and is brighter. I would recommend this product to anyone my age and up. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I started using OlayTotal Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Mousturizer as soon as I received it. In just 2 days my husband commented on my smooth skin on my cheeks and my teenage daughter said my cheek wrinkles weren't as noticeable. I noticed that my skin looked less tired and dull. After only using it for 2 days I can't wait to see what it looks like in 1 week of use. So far I have had positive results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I got to try Olay 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer from BzzAgent and it going on really smooth and soaks into your skin real fast so it doesn't stay greasy and oily on your face after and it smells great just like a bar of Olay or Dove soap. Great smelling I haven't really noticed a difference yet in my complexion but my skin does feel smoother. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Olay anti aging moisturizing cream glides on easily, feels great, non greasy, and helps with the application of my foundation. My dryness doesn't happen now. I am loving Olay ! My face feels firmed and my skin tone is even. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this new product is amazing. I have always liked Olay products but this Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is incredible. Since I started using it I have noticed the unique vitamin complex really helped reduce fine lines, age spots, and even helped with my uneven skin tone. We have all heard about the importance of daily sunscreen and this product makes it easy by including SPF15 built right in. Can't say enough good things about Olay Total Effects 7 in 1. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So I have used the Olay Total effects 7 for 3 days now. I have already noticed my pores are getting smaller. It does have a scent so those people with allergies try a unscented version. The one downfall is my skin gets very greasy compared to normal. I do have oily skin, but not this bad. Don't get me wrong I have not broken out or anything. My crows feet seem a little fainter. Can't wait to continue the product for the whole month. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Have been using the trial size for a week now. My skin feels smooth, and moisturized. I can be sensitive to scents, but the light scent hasn't bothered me at all. Easy to put makeup on afterwards with a smooth skin. #GotitFree #BuzzAgent (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This review is based on 4 days of trying the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer , I found it has really nice texture. I like that the cream is oil free and Minimizes the look ofpores , it is not greasy and dries fast. The only thing I would prefer it to be fragrance free.

i am now on day 3 of using olay total effects and love it i love that it is fragrance free i dont like strong scents it also has spf for the harsh weather in calgary it is evening out my skin tone and minamizing pours i would recomend this product to anyone (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I've been using this for about a week now and I wasn't sure if I'd see results, but I have! My skin is softer, it looks smooth and bright. It's also not so red all the time! Definitely a must have on my list! A little bit goes a very long way. I usually just used body moisturizers but this would be worth the cost because I only apply once after I wash my face, not multiple times per day. There's a very light scent, but it doesn't bother my sensitive nose. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love how you don't have to use a lot of this stuff and my face feels moisturizer all day....2nd day using this....first day I was a bit unsure but after the end of the day I loved it...a bit oily to put on I thought but that goes away quick (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is amazing. My skin feels silky and looks visibly smooth after just a few days! I am so excited to see how my skin looks and feels after 4 weeks! The only thing I would recommend is the unscented cream versus the scented. As it does smell very nice it's a little to strong smelling for my face, in my opinion. Other than that, wonderful product that I recommend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was cautiously optimistic about this product but it is so far exheeding my expectations. It goes on nicely and not greasy at all. Also, no break outs....which is my main dislike about moisturizers in the past. Thank you! I can see myself purchasing this product after the trial is over. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I can't give this product a perfect 10 just yet! I have only been using it for 3 days now. So far I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel and look......it has really changed the evenness of my skin tone in as little as 3 days. I can't wait to see the results after a couple of weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
#gotitFree@OlayUS and I LOVE IT I love the way my skin feels after using it I am sad it won't be in the stores until February as I don't know what I am going to use in the mean time THANKS BZZAGENT :) I am so happy to be one of the first to try this product. This is a must buy for me when it comes out :) My skin feels like it is tightening and I have freckles and I can see them fading a bit after using this for 4 days now (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have been using this product for 4 days now. It applies smoothly and penetrates into the skin right away leaving a non-greasy feeling. My skin tone appearance is enhanced to my natural skin-tone. One of my co-workers even told me that I looked as if I had come back from a vacation in the sun. I have been using Olay products for years now and this is the best so far. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think it is too early to speak about the benefits mentioned above. most anti aging products say they take at least a 30 day trial to show any signs of improvement. I like the feel and texture of my skin using this product, and the light scent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am totally in love with this product. Just 4 days into using the new Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer I am already seeing results. First of all its not a sticky moisturizer. My skin does NOT feel gross and clammy after applying. It feels soft and smooth. After 4 days of use my skin is more firm. Its brighter. Less Redness, less bumps and overall looks clear and smooth. I cannot believe the results. I have tried MANY products but this out moisturizes them all ! I am in love !! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Glowing moisturized skin which looks like a million bucks is all I am asking for. And Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer gave it all to me including making my face smell so good and feel so soft. Next time I'll treat my girls! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Got this the other day, and started using it that night. I haven't noticed any results yet, but I love the soft scent of it, and how it doesn't make my face oily when I put it on. Will keep using it, and hopefully, it'll do it's job :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"One day into my 4 weeks and so far so good! The lotion looks and feels nice, and it at the very least moisturizes my skin. I'll give it a while longer to see if it truly fights 7 signs of aging (all of which I have.) The smell is not too overpowering.

I have found that it has been making my skin oily and my face has broken out. I am going I continue to use Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer and hopefully will begin to see positive changes in my skin, such as skin tone.

It has been a while since I have used a moisturizer that I felt did anything. This is awesome! My skin felt softer and smoother after using the first time. After a couple of days I notice my skin was more even and bright! I will be buying a bottle! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
It's an overall ok face cream. But at the moment I have extremely dry skin and this cream just isn't working for me. It is leaving my nose and for head with dry patches so I will have to switch back to my old stuff... I didn't see any change in my skins appearance but then agaiN I did not give it the 4 weeks it has asked for. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Seriously, I look more young just because my eyes aren't nor more puffy! My face now think I'm 10 year younger!!! That's great! And, this creme smell good, is very soft and ""soyeuse"" ...You should try it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
While I didn't find that it did anything for my fine lines I do still love this product. My skin is crazy and reacts to the simplist of products but I've always been able to use Olay products without a reaction or worry of a break out. This cream goes on smoothly and without needing a big amount either so it will last longer than other cream containers. It did solve my dry skin problem and left it feeling soft and silky. It is a product I will definitely be using again and recommending. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I think that OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is Great so far. I have been using it since the weekend . I noticed right away how my skin felt smoother and fine lines lessen.

"I always have confidence on Olay products. I think it is still too soon to see noticeable result after using the trial version, but it does smells good and comfortable to put on. Maybe it's due to having SPF, I find it a bit too oily for my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It is great !! nothing more I can say.... Feels great on and nice and smooth feeling... I recommend to everyone, I am going to get some for my mother for Christmas, cause she loves Olay everything... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 is the best new product I have tried in a long time. Goes on smooth. Doesn't leave my skin greasy or even worse, sticky. Makeup goes on smoothly over time. Have only used it for 2 days........so will have to report back in a few days to see the overall effect. The only downside to this product is the overly strong scent. I usually use unscented products so this seemed very strong to me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this cream is amazing after only a few days using it I have already noticed a difference, wonderful product and it makes my skin feel soft and not greasy, I will definately be using this product instead of what I was already using.

"I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer had a faint smell of un-burnt tobacco. I was unable to continue using this product because of this odor, as it was applied to my face. I cannot attest to its claims of being able to fight the seven signs of aging, such as fine lines , age spots or uneven skin tone. I wish it had a more pleasing odor. I was however happy to be able to try this product for free. I have been looking for something to help fight signs of aging. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
So far all of the products statements have been true. No oily feeling left on the skin. Absorbs into the skin nicely. I have only been using it a few days and have noticed the difference in my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I haven't used products from Olay for many years so I was very excited to try this OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I like the smell and how my skin feels, but due to having sensitive skin, I normally prefer my moisturizer to be perfume and colour free. However, this moisturizer has both. I have only used it for a few days and I will see if I will develop an allergic reaction the next few days. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is my new olay total effects 7-1 anti aging moisturizer! It has a new unique vitamin complete that helps with aging and to keep ur skin healthy and glowing.

I was so excited to use this. I tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer as a night cream as I have to use my day creams for my Rosacea. I woke up and my face was swollen. I've never had a cream do that to my face. Under my eyes and cheeks were very puffy. I was so looking forward to using this product and seeing a difference. :( I hope others have success with this and look forward to reading their reviews on BzzAgent.

"This cream feels amazing when it is applied! It actually does a fantastic job at moisturizing my dry skin. The pump was hard to get moving initially, but it's way better than a screw off lid. No mess, no extra product. The cream smells great too! I can't wait to see how my skin will look in a few weeks time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
the idea of the olay total effects 7-1 seems great but i had a reaction so i couldnt continue using it for fear of developing a more severe reaction. I was really hoping that i woul d be able to use this product as i do not have a facial moisturizer (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
After only 2 days I feel and see a difference in my skin. My skin feels smoother and has a brighter appearance. The moisture level is great in this product with no oily or greasy feeling. Smells great and feels great. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love the way okay total effects feels especially right out of the shower ... A little goes a long way so one pump is all you will need for your face and throat ...

"I am impressed with the Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer after only a few uses so far. It goes on smooth, and has a scent that isn't too strong. If I were considering buying this product, I would want to ensure that it does what it claims to do. The product has already made my skin softer and has evened out my skin tone. Way to go, Olay!

"i would want to know how this product is on my skin as I have very sensitive skin. This is an amazing product after using this for a few days I have found my skin to be soft and feels tight.

"I was sent a trial size by BzzAgent so I tried the Olay Total Effects 7 in one anti aging moisturizer. I loved it. It was light weight, it wasn't greasy and my skin had a healthy glow. Also the scent was very light which is important because no one enjoys overpowering scents! Definately will buy when it comes on the market in February!

"I was thrilled when my hubby came in with the mail Friday when he said ""Looks like you got a present..."" He couldn't have known how right he was. I love, love, love OlayÂ® Total Effects.

(This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The fast-absorbing, oil-free formula of Vitamins B3, B5 and E is the perfect magic formula to erase years and turn back the clock to youth. I was excited to get a sample from BzzAgent to try out After a week's use I do see signs of softer and more supple skin. . And look forward to weeks more of work! It has a slight floral scent which dissipates quickly And the formula is light enough for day use yet rich enough for night as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"So very excited, I just received my sample of Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti Aging Moisturizer. I can't yet rate it, just started it tonight. I am using it as a night cream because I have Rosacea and have to use a Rosacea cream during the day to relieve my skin problem. I put the cream on and I like how it feels on my skin. It absorbed quickly and its not greasy. Took a picture of my left eye, cant wait to see the wrinkles disappear! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

Got to say I was a little bit scared to try Olay Total Effect 7 in 1 anti -anging because of my very sensitive skin. At first I found that it smelled alot but after a few minutes didn't notice it anymore. To my suprise it didn't itch or burn nothing. So this is a very big plus for me . Now it's only been 3 days that I have been using it so I watching very closely the affects in the days and weeks to come :-). (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this product and have been using it for the past week. I really like it so far. It has a light texture and feels nice and silky when I put it on my face. It moisturizes very well and I feel like it gives my face a nice glow. So far I noticed a firmness in my face with a slight decrease in pore size in my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using Olay total effects for 3 days now, it feels nice on my skin and does not irritate my skin like some moisturizers do. It is fast absorbing and is not greasy like the box says. I am skeptical, but anxious to see if it shrinks my pores and if it makes my skin looks 10 years younger after four weeks. I give it a 4 out of five because I like how the moisturizer feels on my skin but am waiting to see the results after four weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I am very happy with my sample the product is shiny so it's kinda like uhhhhhh but it smooths in nicely and it's not greasy u can apply makeup rite after no lotion rolling u know how some lotions go in little balls when u rub ur skin not this one my face feels happy :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I just tried this Olay total effects moisturizer and I love it. It comes in a pump bottle and pumps out so nice. Love the way my skin feels after applying this. I have been using olay products for a long time but never tried this one and I may have just found a new favorite. . I just started using it so I can't comment yet on fighting the signs of aging or the helping with uneven skin tone. So stay tuned on that. I would easily recommend this product to anyone.

"It's got a nice smooth texture and leaves skin smooth! It's a great moisturizer. As far as wrinkles go, it helps with fine lines around the eyes!

I think Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer is the product i have been looking for . Just in a few days of using the trial size i noticed a difference in my fine line which is a big concern for me . Hydration in my skin was also a very comforting sign as my skin was a little dry . Yaaa i feel this product is a win in my eyes and i am going to buy the full size to continue the results that i have started by using the trial size :) !!!!!

I think that this product moisturized my skin a bit to well.Since starting to use it 7 days ago .I have a face full of acne.The brown spot on my cheek is lighter in color now.And my very fine lines are a little less noticeable.I dont feel that it has changed my over all skin tone.Let my daughter try it and it gave her an acne breakout also .But her face feels smoother on her forehead and cheeks.

"Moisturizing facial lotion is very important to me now that I am 40 but still want to look 25. I apply the lotion in the morning and it is silky without feeling greasy. After I apply the lotion to my face my fine lines begin to disappear, I look and feel younger. I highly recommend the lotion to anyone who has any concern about the signs of ageing.

I really liked the lightweight feel of the OlayÂ® Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. But at the same time my skin felt moisturized and soft.

"When first putting on cream, it feels silky and smooth on the skin. I put it on after taking a shower where my skin is the driest. Olay total effects did moisturize my skin. I felt however throughout the day that the cream stayed of top off my skin leaving a slight glossy feel that I do not like. Will continue for 4 weeks to see if the cream reduces my fine lines. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Well first time I put it on I knew it was a keeper. It went on so smooth and even and was t greasy. A lot of other products are clumpy and greasy and don't smooth out evenly. This was great. I will keep using it till it's gone and you can bet I'll be purchasing some more after. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Received this as a free sample, trimg it and liking it so far. I just love the way it feels once applied. It's very light and you only use a small amount ofÂ it to be a great moisturizer, leaving my skin softer already. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"With this cream.,my face feels perfect clean fresh and not oily at all, also this cream smells good :).

"I wasnt sure if this was going to be the same old regular moisturizer they sell at any store but I really am surprised at how much I like it. I hate using creams of any kind becauae I cant stand the greasy, hot feeling and it did not happen with this Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 anti aging moisturizer. It smells wonderful. And a little amount goes a long way so you get your moneys worth. Would definitely buy again. Love my new smooth soft skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Just got my bzzkit in the mail, and have to say from the first try I'm super excited for this face cream. It's not greasy and doesn't have a strong smell which I love. Also it's super thick which I really like in a face mosturizer, I'm going to use it every night before bed this next week to see if I see a difference. Also am loving that it has 7 benefits for younger skin, great for dry winter months! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I think this is a good product, my goal is that it really works on eliminate age spots. I like the smell and it is smooth, not greasy on hand or face compare to other anti-aging product. I need to buy a full size one to replace the one that I was using. Especially when I take it to work, my co-workers were trying it too, so it was almost gone before the end of the day. Anyways, thanks for the trial size... (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"

So far the only sign I've noticed this far has been that my skin is no longer dry. I haven't noticed much else unless it's been very minimal. After longer use I may have another opinion on it. It's definitely a must try product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

I absolutely LOVE this stuff.. it makes my skin feel soft and silky and well moisturized without the thick sticky type cream feel. It is light and works well for daily use.

It's here and the results are great after 2 uses! Olay is a trusted brand but I haven't really tried it until now and I'm sold. My skin feels smoother (mosturized ) it looks brighter and it doesn't have a greasy feel either. I do have a couple small age spots that I'm watching over the next few weeks to see if they reduce in size. Overall. ..I love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"I'm very excited to get invited to the Bzz Campaign for Olay Effects. I have used it in the past and it works great. Not greasy, no leftover residue. If you have sensitive skin like me, though, you may prefer the unscented version as there is scent in the sample we received. Other than that, it works great and I can see a difference in fine lines/winkles since I started using it in the last year. Would recommend. Great product.

"I was surprised to see this in my mail so soon, but am excited to try it out! Just hopped out of the shower, and like usually, my face is super dry! The smell was refreshing, not over powering and it is definitely fast absorbing and non greasy. I'm really looking forward to the continuous use and mostly the benefits of evening my skin tone and minimizing the look of pores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Since using Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I've noticed a significant change in my skin's moisture content and the number of wrinkles I see on my face these days! I love the product! Most of my wrinkles have smoothed over. The cream doesn't feel heavy or contain a strong smell. I use it right after I cleanse my face in the morning to give it a fresh and moisturized look and feel. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
As my title implies this product feels very light and not greasy which is very important to me in choosing skin products. I have only used a few days so far but it has defiantly made my skin appear less blotchy and much smoother. The price point is fair as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"When you put this cream on your face it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. After about a week of using this product you will find yourself seeing less wrinkles and lines, it also helps reduce any bags around your eyes. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer is the only moisturizer I use day or night. My sometimes sensitive skin has never reacted when I have used Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer it has only gotten better. The moisturizer absorbs quickly and often it is the only thing that goes on my face so I am make up free on the week ends.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love all olay products, have used them for years and would recommend any without hesitation. I use total effects daily moisturizer in the morning, after washing my face, and in the evening, again after washing my face. It leaves a refreshing feel,touch to my skin. Truly, a great product!!!

I have been using this product for many years and I stopped using it for a while and I noticed my skin drying out. I then started using it again and now my skin is soft and people don't believe I'm in my 50's Love the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Years ago I came across a Good Housekeeping product review at a time when I was looking for a good moisturizer. The product was Total Effects. I tried it and I have been using it ever since. If you want a good moisturizer that not only does what it promises but is also a good value for your money this is it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After years and years of trying anything and everything advertised to even skin tone, I decided to try Total Effects 7 CC Creme. This product is the only one I have tried that actually works. Within the first week I saw a difference in skin tone and texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using The Daily Moisturizer for several months and really like the results. Very light and helps my liquid makeup to spread well. I am 60+ years old and have used many, many different moisturizers. I love this and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 64 years old. I have been using Total Effects face moisturizer for a few months and it is super. My face has never looked as great as it does now. My skin is so soft. Even my husband has remarked how great my face looks. I am lucky and have only a few lines on my face. I am sure it is due to using Total Effects daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for two weeks and with one wash and a small amount was enough to clean my face I wear foundation almost everyday using fit 355 and that is for dark skin.and this product does the job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used many moisturizers trying to find the right one. This product has proven to work!! It soaks into the skin quickly so if you need to use foundation, you can do so quickly. Skin stays moisturized for a long time. It is also very affordable. Affordable and works is a winning combination! I would recommend that everyone give it a try. It will not disappoint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product goes on so easy! It soaks in as soon as it is applied! I can feel that is is moisturizing immediately! I used to use a primer before I put on my make up but I do not have to when I use this product, I would recommend it to everyone. It is also affordable! Try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being a ""Sensitive Skin Gal"" I was very hesitant to try this moisturizer. I love it. A little goes a long way! The moisturizer does not feel greasy or heavy. My make up goes on perfectly. I don't have breakouts or dry /greasy patches in any area...just a smooth, soft feel. My skin feels very ourished and loved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
my mother used it as I grew up and I have used it all my adult life. No one believes I am 82 years and I believe my use of your products has helped that. I use it everyday and would not go out without my Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been faithful to olay products my whole adult life ( lookin at 50 people) I have nice, not perfect but nice skin. I have never used or even considered using other products. I've always used basic age defying but recently started using total effects. I see increased smoothness. No miracles just good skin. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many different moisturizers but none of them were as good as Olay. Olay is priced more reasonably than other products and works better than the more expensive products. I have used your products for many years and am often told that I don' look like I am almost 63 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for 3 months and am so happy. The product moisturizes my dry skin and I feel my face is so soft and looks radiant. I especially like that it absorbs with no greasy feel and smells so nice. I am sold on this product and will continue to use it . I have finally found a product that pleases me immensely. Thank You [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way my skin feels each day and I have noticed a change in my complexion since I have started using this product, less dullness and I do not see fine lines or wrinkles as much. I have received compliments on my skin from my family and friends, and I have recommended this product to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product for the first time at the beginning of the year when I was out of my regular moisture lotion. I wasn't sure how much I was going to like it compared to what I was using and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It went on smooth and kept me feeling hydrated all day long without a greasy feeling. I am now using this as my regular moisture lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer is just WONDERFUL! I noticed results right away by just using it the first time. It will make your skin super smooth and moisturized without being greasy. It is light weight on your skin and has a pleasant smell. I've tried a lot of moisturizers over the years and I have to say that this is the best one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It moisturizes your skin and didnt leave my skin oily or dry. You can use it morning and at night. it leaves you skin so ft and smooth. It makes my wrinkles look less noticeable. It also has sun screen for my fair skin. It also replaces any other moisturizers i use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer. I use it daily and the longer I use it the more I see improvement. I also use the night cream as well, as the BBC cream. I have recommended and brought Oil f OlayOil for both of my daughters. I can also see a a huge difference in their complexion...I proudly promote ""oil of Olay"" all the time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before I used the daily moisturizer my skin was dry and cracked my the end of the day. Now, my skin is much smoother and others have noticed. I am 62 years old and a registered nurse. I work long hours. I apply the Total Effects moisturizer before I put on my makeup, and my skin is smooth for 12+ hours! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried everything , and nothing works as good as this product. I was totally amassed , it's not that expensive , you will be purprised when you start seeing results. And in about a month or less you will start seeing results, depending on which one you get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Amazing product! My mum has always used Olay products and when i was about 6 or so i asked what she was putting on her face and she said Olay, so now im her age at the time of my asking and i couldn't be happier with my results, Face feels hydrated, soft and more youthful in appearance! Love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 84 years old and have been using this product for many years. I love it. It makes my face smooth hardly any wrinkles. I am never taken for my age. Everyone wants to know what I do to look so young and have such lovely skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'll be turning 53 this November. I use Total Effects day cream daily. It makes my face soft, brilliant and most especially free of wrinkles, that's why it makes me feel and look younger than my actual age. I wash my face with Olay facial cleanser before applying Total Effects Day cream and before bedtime. Even my two daughters in their 20's are now using Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin, and not a fan of perfumey moisturizers. I simply love the daily facial moisturizer! My skin is touchably soft and looks radiant. I have always chosen Olay products and will continue to do so always [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer for several months. I do like it, but I previously used Olay's Regenerist Serum and I loved it. I will go back to Regenerist when I need to buy more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love applying Total Effects each morning after my shower. It locks in the moisture and makes my face feel wonderfully hydrated without being greasy. It also has some SPF which is great for my fair skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used many different moisturizers and this BY FAR is the best. I have combination skin oily around my noise and dry in the t zone. But this face lotion works PERFECT. Its also helped with my breakouts I literally don't breakout anymore. I'm so happy with this product and I'll continue to buy it. 100% worth the cost.
I have used regular Olay until I started noticing that I was developing some dark age spots on my checks. Probably from excessive tanning when I was younger. So I switch to Total Effects. It has brightened my overall appearance and lightens the dark areas. It feels so light and soft. I just love it. I am 62 and people always tell me that I can only be early 50s.
"I have been using this product for about 3 to 4 years now. I can't rave enough about it. I am not one to use a moisturizer but I started using bare minerals makeup and didn't really like the moisturizer that came with the kit. I chose this one and fell in love. Since I have been using this product I rarely even wear any foundation because my skin is so clear and young looking. I love love love it!! Makes my face feel soft, clean and not heavy!!"
"I have used Regular Oil of Olay Products for years, and have great skin because of it. I just bought/used the Total Effects Products and am amazed that in just 24 hours I am seeing and feeling an improvement in my dry skin on both my face and arms. I am really Glad! that I changed to this set of products. I don't think my skin could get better, but it did. :)"
Received this for my 30th birthday as my first piece of the Total Effects line. Once I got used to the pump product was easy to dispense. A little goes a long way. Has a pleasant smell. I use acne products as well and they dry my skin. Due to this I need a little more moisture than this product can provide. This product did not improve the overall texture of my skin.
"I have used Olay products since I was a teenager. For the past few years, I used Olay Definity and LOVED it. After it was discontinued, I was told to that Olay Total Effects was a good substitute. There's no comparison. Total Effects is greasy and never absorbs into my skin. By the end of the day, even my bangs are dripping oil. Bring back Definity!!!!"
I have used nivea for 34 years and to even try oil of olay was a challenge for me but after using the regenerist nite and the night of olay i am very happy with the results from the last 6 months even though it hasnt reversed the ageing process i feel it has slowed it down considerably so i am off to buy the total effects right now
"i have never been one to believe much in any skin care product, but this one changed my mind. A friend recommended this moisturizer and I can see and feel a huge difference in my skin, especially in the mornings which is the hardest time to look in the mirror! I will continue to try other products in this line and tell other friends. fantastic. thank you."
"many years ago, i recieved a sample of total effects moisturizer in the mail. i had never used a moisturizer before. after trying the sample, i have been using it ever since. i absolutely love it. it makes my face feel so soft. it doesn't feel greasy like some products tend to do. i can't live without it."
"before using olay total effects is a product which works like magic due to pollution & thyroid facial skin become so dried that even if i apply any moisturizer it was o no use then i came to know about this cream & now my skin is glowwy,soft & healthier than early i had.I have stopped using all other products not even feels to go for facial as i also use olay total effects anti-agieng cream.Thanx to olay as it gave me my glowing & wonderful looking skin back."
The very first use left my skin glowing. Did not like the dispenser because it pumps too much product out if you forget to gently tap it. I gently tap product into skin after wash skin and my skin feels like velvet and glows - no matter how much sleep I had- I get compliments on how great my face skin looks.
"I first became a user of Olay products in 2008. I work outside, without a hat and had noticed that my skin was becoming dry, scaly, with patchy brown spots. I first tried the Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum and really noticed a difference right a away. I knew it was working when my co-workers wanted to know what I had done. I then returned to Walmart and began to look at Olays other products and purchased the Olay Total Effects. I am very happy with both products and will continue to use. Thank You."
"I love this lotion, it comes out of the pump smoothly and has a soft, clean smell to it. It's perfect for my morning routine, I like knowing that it has sunscreen in it to protect my fair skin! I constantly get compliments on how beautiful my skin is, and I'm sure it's because I've been using Olay all my life."
"I have been using this product & many other Olay products for years. this particular pump, I was daily, Before I apply my make-up. It makes my skin soft & revived. I would recommend this product to everyone & have got my mom started using it as well. I will not use anything else."
"I've beeen faithful To ""Total Effects Daily Moisturizer"" since it first came on the market. I have tried other products, but I always return to ""Total Effects"". My skin ""falls apart"" in a day without it. I can't live without it. I would need a whole line of another product to even come close to getting the results I get in one little bottle of ""Total Effects Daily Moisturizer"". Consistently great results!"
"Why did you remove spf 15 option? This was the only moisturizer with sunscreen which didn't aggravate my rosacea. Bring it back, please!!!!"
i tryed this was not the one i8 usually use serium 7 for three hours my eyes teared and wart ered and burned. i would not buy this product again.
Cream makes the skin really soft but I feel like it's way to thick. A tiny bit goes a very long way which I like. It smells really good. I put mine on every morning and I feel it Ives me the awake look and brightens my skin.
"Product feels greasy, and the promise of ""luminous 20-something skin"" just doesn't materialize. I think DNA has more to do with the results than this poorly formulated cream."
"And I would like to stay that way. This product is clearly made for a totally different demo than myself. Great value for those who are transitioning, however for those who like who they are- not the right fit."
"I always had dry skin and I would try different types of lotions and I didn't really liked any of them until I saw this one. It's so smooth, keeps your skin soft. Plus it smells good too"
"Best product out on the shelves available at any pharmacy in your neighborhood, I would recommend this to anyone that uses Olay products . It is really amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I think all of them work amazing. I use multiple of the products. I don't buy any other products for my face. I use and people notice so I tell them about them. I think the price are pretty reasonable. Worth paying a little more for the products.
"Used for years and had great skin results in softening, moisturizing, and even tone with affordable cost and saving comparable to other products available. Smell of product is not overwhelming and very tolerant."
Olay Total Effects makes me look 10 years younger! I don't want to face a day without it. A young top supermodel (in the hospital) once told me she cries too without it! I shared some of mine.
"The best ever I couldn't have got my skin back to normal without it. Why didn't someone tell me about Olay before, I feel so late on the matter right now."
This made my skin really dry and the wrinkles I'm trying to diminish worse! It's a nice light weight moisturizer but I am disappointed. It did tone my skin a little.
This product is wonderful for your skin because it's moisturizes your skin so good and helps banish those small age lines all wemon get as they age.The more and longer you use it the better the results.
"My skin has been excessively dry since my teens, to the point my nose peeled on a regular basis. This product is amazing!! Skin so soft n bright. Recommend for dry skin!!"
To the touch and feel it is so gentle and moisturising. You auickly begin to notice results. Im so happy to have experienced this product. Its incredible.
"Just started to use this product again after trying other brands and I seem to finally realize that Olay is the product for me due to the non greasy feeling,.smells great and works great on my skin."
By far the best product for moisturizing and daily use. Use This in the A.M. and use the night cream for the evening. You will wake up look in the mirror and your face will glow and smile back. 10 out of 10!
"I have been using Olay products, off and on since my teens. I recently purchased Total Effects anti-Aging Moisturizer and I love it! My skin feels much smoother. It absorbs quickly without a greasy feeling."

"I have used alot of different facial products and so far, Olay wins.....I love the Total Effects Daily Moisturizer...I do not wear cover up so, I like the glow that this product gives to my face!!!!I do tell people what I use, so they can try it."
"I can see a big different on the 2nd day using it. My face just glow when I looked in the mirror in the morning. I have tried other lines like Regenerist & Definity, but only Total Effects give distinguish improved look."
I have used the entire product line of Total Effects and it's wonderful! I am looking foward to starting the Regenerist Line very soon! I LOVE OIL OF OLAY AND WILL USE IT UNTIL THEY DON'T MAKE IT FOR MY AGE ANYMORE!!!
This daily Moisturizer does exactly what it says it will do. I have never been disappointed in an Olay Product. I will continue using this line of facial products.
"This is a very soothing face cream. I found it extremely soothing to the touch. It does have a slightly strong scent, though, so get the unscented if you're sensitive to scents. Thanks again OLAY!"
"This is the one moisterizer that I have used that really does what it says. It smells good, it goes on evenly and doesn't feel oily. It doesn't break out my skin, even in the summer. Awesome value also."
"This worked really well under makeup in the mornings and at night on a clean face. It helped the appearance of wrinkles, especially the around my eyes and mouth. I would highly recommend it."
I have been using this procuct for several years. I have totally enjoyed using this product because it is right for my skin and makes the lines on my face almost invisible.
I have combination skin and seem to break out when using various products of various quality. I usually use dermalogica (high end product) and this is a great affordable alternative to their facial lotion.
I absolutely love this product! I have sensitive skin & have used this for years with no problems- no burning sensation that other products cause. Definately worth the purchase!
I love this mositurizer. I have used this product for almost 2 years now and I will never change. My skins is so soft and smooth. I keep getting compliments on how young I look.
This is a great moisturizer; I have recently switched back to using this brand after running out of a much more expensive brand and I have to say that I think that it actually works better and I feel that it penetrates into my skin faster as well!
I really like Total Effects Daily Moisturizer. I am 42 with dry skin and my skin has never felt smoother or more supple. I find all Olay products to be as good as or better than high-end department store products.
I have tried other moisturizers with UV protection but they seem to irritate my eyes. I like the protection it gives me without burning my eyes. I know I can rely on it each day.
I live in a very dry climate and need all the moisture I can get. I love using this because it keeps my skin from flaking and I dont break out as much as I did. all in all a great product
I have just recently started using the Total Effect 7in1 moisturizer. The product seems to be working good but I do not like the container it's in. It's a push top and it's uncontrollable. It only take a tiny bit for each area of the face but sometimes it squirts out way too much. I wish Olay would find a more dependable container for this product.
"I've been using this product for a month now. I see no signs of improvement. This product is expensive. I've used other products that have worked much better. But I trusted Olay. I will never buy this particular product again. Maybe I should have tried another type of Olay, but I can't afford the price. Thank You."
This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. It is inexpensive and excellent!
"I am more confident since using this product, i am simply beautiful and i am using this to my full advantage. Thank you"
Awesome product I think u should buy this amazing product because it smells and feels amazing and it makes your skin feel very hydrated
It does what it intends to do I would buy again would tell my friends and family to buy this product great for the skin and comfortable.
"I've only been using this for a week, and noticed a difference in one of dark spots within four days. FOUR DAYS!"
Is a good product but it would be better if it was a little bit cheaper and be able to be bought very much money in their pocket
Its nice my skin is wonderfuland the price is good I will continue to buy this product all the time I just love it n will continue too
It feels great on the skin and works greatly. This is my favorite lotion i think every one should buy this product.
