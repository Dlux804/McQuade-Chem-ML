Utterly Smooth Extra Care with 20% Urea exceeded all our expectations for softening problem skin areas. One application resolved cracked callused heels overnight! Also worked well for bumpy skin on backs of arms along with a loofa scrub the following day. The price for this product available through Wal-Mart was better than other similar 20% Urea products from other suppliers. We will be back for more when we use our first tub up.
This product is excellent. My husband works outside. His hands were sore and cracked. After one night on his hands. 100% improvement ! Been telling my friends about it. !
Bought this for my rough elbows and after one week I can see an improvement. Am sold on the produce so far.
Udderly Smooth does help with lightening spider veins.
The product is pretty good and the services from Walmart are amazing!!
"Worked better on my cracked hurting hands more than anything, including prescriptions."
Makes my skin very soft and smooth
I have been using this for a while. It is by far superior compared to other creams.
I am using this long term for varicose veins. I cannot review at this time.
"I received this quickly but when I looked they sent the jar with 10% Urea not the 20% I ordered. I called Pharmpack (who filled the order for Walmart) they said they no longer carry the 20% Urea. They said I could return it or have the difference refunded, they gave me back 1/2 the price I paid the next day."
Exceptionally effective.
Recommended by a dermatologist. Very effective for eczema.
