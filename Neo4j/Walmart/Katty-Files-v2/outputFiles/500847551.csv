"I received the 14 day challenge from Loreal RevitaLift Triple Power lifting moisturizer. I seen a difference in my skin from the second day. Wrinkles have softened and my skin tone has improved. So far I really like this moisturizer. I'm only on day 3, so I will do another review later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"14 days ago I started the challenge of revelitf and I have noticed some positive changes in my face, my skin looks soft and fresh and my face also looks more relaxed.The results of the moisturizer are excellent but I would like to feel a more comfortable feeling when applying it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just purchased this moisturizer and after I applied it I noticed some flakes on my blouse and hands. When I looked into the mirror my face look as if it was peeling. Is this a normal reaction? I used a small amount and massaged it in but im not sure if I will continue to use this product.
"Literally bought this product three weeks ago. I am beyond impressed! I saw a drastic change in my skin, and I could not be happier. Changes included firmer younger looking skin, reduction of wrinkles and fine lines, and dark spots are demishing as well. Could kick myself for not purchasing sooner!"
I tried the 14 day #revitaliftchallenge and was amazed at the results. My skin was more hydated and my face clearly showed reduced fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was not used to cold weathers, and since the weather here in the us got colder and colder each day, my skin got dry as it has never been before. And so I was really excited to start my revitalift challenge. I've seen results in just a matter of days. My face became firmer and smoother. Although I didn't like the super strong smell, and it felt a little greasy during application. But definitely does the job! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this product on 11-03-2017, because I couldn't wait for the samples... I've been using it daily twice a day... It totally works I am 57 yrs young expecting my first grandbaby... This photo is a week old I have notice the fine lines, crows feets around my eyes softer.... This is my new best friend... I will continue using this product.... Thank you Loreal Paris..

"I received the Revitalift Triple Power anti-aging moisturizer so I could write a review. I was hesitant because my skin doesn't adjust well to different products. I really look younger after using this! I love it. I usually buy an anti-moisturizer from a very expensive company, but I believe I will change to L'oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very leery of the challenge considering I would never use a product on my face for fear of breakouts, clogged pores and greasiness, but this product did not do that. I can't tell you how excited I am to buy this product because not only did it perform better than I ever expected, but delivered beautiful results. My face feels and looks incredible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RevitaLift smelled amazing. It was light and creamy when applying. Smoothly spreading and easy to guide. The moisturizing cream felt weightless on my face and not noticable. Used at bedtime it wasnt irrating while I slept. When dried my face felt soft. Washed off with no after grease. Gave a overall younger look to my complexion and made me feel younger to.

I was part of the Loriell challenge for 14 days. I was skeptical at first because I have very deep lines between my eyes. But even my husband after the fifth day of using Loriell cream said he noticed a difference in my skin and didn't know what it was. I absolutely love this Product. I do believe that it is worth investing in and will be buying some in the future. Thank you Loriell for allowing me to be a part of an awesome trial.

"I received a 14 day sample of this moisturizer, It's been 11 days and I can see a boost in my skin's radiance. Also this cream has provided an even tone and soft skin. I wasn't using this for any Anti-aging properties, but it definitely gave me a nicely moisturized skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My fourteen day experience was started with the delightful smell of the cream and the good texture upon smoothing it on my skin. It hydrated my dry skin immensely, and felt wonderfly thick and sumptuous. I could feel my skin soaking it up as I applied it! The next morning my skin was supple and moist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the 14 day challenge and my skin is 100 percent better! The wrinkles on my neck aren't nearly as noticeable as they were before and my skin is so moist and feels great.

Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is day 2 of my 14 day challenge.
So the product has a nice smooth feel with a very subtle floral smell not overwhelming. The product goes on smoothly and had a slight burn but I had no redness or hives. I can see a slight improvement but I'm looking forward to the 14thday I'm optimistic I think the results will be significant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was fortunate enough to get a free sample of RevitaLift. It's extremely lightweight, your skin feels like I can breathe after you apply it. My skin absorbs it immediately without any greasy residue. Within two weeks I've seen a difference with the fine lines on my face. I also like that as a very subtle sense that's not overpowering.

I use the face scrub every morning then apply the credit and my skin feels silky soft and I can see an improvement in my facal skin. I am going to buy the night mask next bc I think that it will work just as well as the day cream! Thanks loreal!
"I've been using L'oreal anti aging day and night moisturizer and my 69 year face has barely any wrinkles. Love this product over 25 or more,lost count, of using your products. I also use the hair coloring products. I just tried age perfect hair coloring and have recommended to friends. Love all your products."
My daughter gave me a small container of this so i thought ok another cream she wants me to try. So I said to myself ill try on one side for a week .needless to say when i saw after a week i went and bought the larger container now trying to even out.by the way im 72 thank you for this product it does work
"One of the best I've ever used. And I've used the expense stuff before, but the results weren't noticeable . I also use the overnight intensive mask , the results are incredible. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to reduce wrinkles, firm skin and brighten you complexion. I will never use anything else. Love it!"
"I really like this moisturizer! I received it complimentary from @influenster! I have combination skin which leans more on the dry side most times & this really gave me the moisture I look for in a cream. My only concern would be I feel that it lays on the skin a bit and doesn't soak completely in. Other than that, great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many face products to no avail After a month and a half I have actually seen a reduction in the fine wrinkles on my face and neck. Will continue to use it daily.
"After I apply it, it rolls off my face. It can not possibly be part of the process wearing the moisturizer. This ends up causing me to appear to have dandruff on my face. I was concerned the product was old or defective till I saw other reviews & comments."

"L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift® Triple Power™ Intensive Anti-Aging Day Cream Moisturizer I received the VoxBox via the influenster program.

"I received this a few weeks ago, and started using it every day along with the rest of the skin care line.. and let me just tell you. This stuff really works! I look years younger and my skin feels super smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have just started using moisturizers in my skin care routine, bc as I've gotten older, I've noticed a lot of dry patches on my face. When I saw that this was also an anti aging moisturizer, I was even more excited to try it. So far, So good. I haven't quite noticed any anti aging aspects yet, but the moisturizer does absorb really well. It is not too thick or too thin. I like a good consistency in my moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My husband accidentally purchased another brand, so, used that one up before I purchased my Revitalift again. Noticed the difference almost overnight. Happy to have my Revitalift again, the lines and wrinkles are a lot less prominent than before. My skin is happy again"
I have tried so many face creams to reduce wrinkles on my face. Have heard good things about L'OREAL products I decided to give the REVITALIFT MOISTERIZER a try. The result was no change or improvement to my wrinkles. Very disappointed.
"Feels great going on but won't absorb into my skin. Even after 30 mins, it balls up and flakes off my skin. I've never had this issue before. Will not purchase again."
"I love this product! It has become my go to moisturizer! Sensitive skin runs in my family so I'm always careful when getting new products. When my skin became dry in the cold winter months my face would appear flakey, especially if I were to use makeup. After using this product my skin become smoother and felt hydrated. After a few days of use my skin completely lost that flakey texture and looked healthier and more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this about a month ago and absolutely love it! I am 41 years old and really care aboit my skin! You can feel and see the difference in my face. My face is softer, and tighter. It has helped my bags under my eyes and feel so blessed to have found this!"
"I never use day cream because of how heavy it feels on my face (and i have tried many different brands and some were very expensive), Until i tried the Loreal Intensive Anit-Aging day Cream.... this cream is hands down the best - does not leave my face feeling oily, heaving and when i put on my foundation it does not feel like i have 10 layers on. it hydrates my face without the feeling of face cream."
I bought this cream recently after realizing the importance of a good moisturizer. My skin immediately felt softer and looked brighter. Plus it smells great. Overall I think it's a great price for a quality product and I'm excited to see the changes in my skin in the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is light weight and odorless. I use it after the serum and don't feel like it cakes up at all. It's a nice combination. My skin looks fresh and tight. I like that I can actually see a difference. I swear my skin looks more youthful. I would definitely recommend this product. The only reason I gave it four stars is because my skin is a little sensitive and I got a few pimples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not my absolute favorite but definitely has some great qualities about it , the formula is non greasy , penetrating, provides light moisture to the skin . I think the formula should be a little thicker for more hydration and a scent like the spf lotion would be great and a larger container being that this product is a moisturizer.

This makes my skin feel so very soft and hydrated as I have very dry! It also helps reduce fine lines !
I love this cream! I've only been using it once a day for three weeks. Other people were saying how good my skin looks! I was surprised about how well and fast this cream works! Very happy with the product! I would definitely recommend!
"I just started using the brightening peel pads,absolutely amazing"
"I really love this Revitalift Day Cream. It's so light, doesn't leave any shine or oily feel to my skin. It wears great under make-up and hydrates all day!"
I bought this last month and have been using it daily. Love how it feels so great and cool on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't know why, but every time I put this on, I end up rubbing it off. It keeps balling up. I only use it at night because of this. I guess they need to improve the formulation a bit. Other than that, it smells nice and does moisturize."
"This lovely moisturizer works well after cleansing my face, and I massage it in...but after I apply it, it rolls off my face when I apply makeup base, as if it is part of the process of wearing the moisturizer. This ends up causing me to appear to have a skin condition or dandruff when, in truth, I only have plain dry skin. LOVE the product! But is this reaction normal? Thanks for any tips."
All the pictures and great reviews show young..40..50 year old women..how about being real and show older women...if you start showing older women with honest results more people would buy your product..there is no product that shows that.. you don't even have a hair color for gray in your review..
"I literally just bought this hours ago. I used it and it felt nice on my skin, but when I rubbed my face, it felt like my skin was balling up and peeling off. Not such a good claim as to the products performance at this moment. I will give it the 2 week test, pretty sure I'm going to want my money back. Here's hoping I don't!"
I am sorry to say I couldn't finish testing the product so don't really know how good it is. I couldn't get past the smell. Not that it was bad just overpowering. All I could smell all day was the face cream. I have sensitive smell due to sinus issues and could only use it a couple of times. Does it come in a fragrance free product? I would be happy to sample that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample and it was so great! I have bought since the samples ran out & never forget to apply it! It goes on easily & so smooth and afterwards my face feels amazing and my skin looks beautiful. This is definitely my have to have product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used and still do use many L'Oreal products, however this moisturizer does not absorb into the skin. I have tried using the serum before hand, I have tried using this moisturizer alone, and the product just crumbles on top of my skin. It is very unsightly and I need to completely tissue it off before"
"I really wanted to like this product but I find that when I apply the Revitalift, the product “balls” up as I try to apply my makeup over it which I then have to slough off my face. I like other L'Oréal products but this one doesn't work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried the challenge and it works well. Made my skin feel soft and hydrated. Also helped with some fine lines and discoloration. The only thing I didn't like was the product would leave a residue and almost clump on my skin after some time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had a free trial of this moisturizer and after it was over, i can only say it made my skin moisturized better than it normally is. The fine lines and blemishes are still noticeable, and it burned for a little while on the skin. I don't think it can be good for my skin if it burns, and honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of that, and the fact that my skin is the same after using it. Thanks, anyway for the sample, L'oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this today very excited from the reviews I read...only to be very disappointed... It is too heavy and actually feels like it's weighing my skin down and the fragrance is very strong!! I usually buy expensive skin care products however I just found a drug store foundation that I just love!! So when looking for a new firming foundation I was hopeful this product would be great as well. Not the case at all... I usually don't write reviews but had to with this one. DON'T BUY!!
Wow! This product is outstanding. I love the softness of my face after I apply the Loreal Revitalift intensive moisturizer. The moisturizer has a great scent and it feels very silky when applying it. I used the moisturizer for fourteen days and I was very happy with how my face looked brighter and no longer had dry flaky skin.

"I recieved a 14 day supply to test and review. I've tried many anti aging creams in the past and decided nothing works. This really does. I felt and saw a big difference. Even though I'm 62 years old, I've stayed out of the sun and really have very few wrinkles. But in the past couple of years. Fine lines around my mouth and eyes have appeared. Loreal has shown me a cream that smooths out the lines making them almost invisible. Thank you L'oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sorry, but in my honest opinion the strong perfume smell of this product was really overwhelming. I would have really loved to use it since I've used their creams before and enjoyed them but not this one. My face smelled so strong for the entire day and I had to eventually just wash it off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a 7 day sample at work. My skin is very sensitive. Depending on what I've tryed, I either had breakouts, scaling, or for the first 30 min it feels like I need to rip my skin off. If I don't put anything on at all, my skin burns, starts flaking and I get red spots. With this cream- nothing!!!! First it felt funny to me and I can feel the moisturizer for about 10 min after I put it on my skin but this cream is great! No breakouts, scaling, itching or burning!!! I am thinking about trying the intense eye cream as well. Thank you L'Oréal!!"

"I love this product. I am always joking to my friends that I am looking for a facelift in a jar. Well this is close to it. I am an ""active adult"" and while it didn't reduce my age it definitely reduced my wrinkles."
This product is awesome. Best moisturizer ever. I have used it for 4 days now and it already has made a big differance in my face and neck. It is much softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this as a sample and left my feeling amazing. My skin is hydrated and my dark circles are gone. I love this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is a good moisturizing cream but the smell is very strong. I would love an unscented version.
I have been using this for years and will continue to do so.
"I received this Friday as a 14 day trial. I have only used it a couple of days, so I cant say too much now. But, I can say, after each use my skin feels so soft! I cant wait too see all the benefits by day 14. I will post again in a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I complied completely with the instructions for the Revitalift challenge-day& night x 14 days. Product did absolutely nothing for me. My complexion looked terrible while I was using it. Was glad when it was over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free sample of this product. I moved from the east coast to the west several years ago. I have been searching for a moisturizer to adequately moisturize my face and remove the small wrinkles associated with dry skin. This is the first product to actually work. Thank you for the sample. I bought the day cream after 4 days of the trial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received samples to try, the day challenge. I used it the first morning and I had white flakes on my nose and neck. My husband asked what it was, it was the product. I also had very cakey oily skin and I had to wash it off. I am sorry to say that turned me off of this product all together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product since 2 weeks now and I'm in love with the results since the second day! It tightens the skin without that greasey texture that most creams have, leaving your face smooth and wrinkle free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed my sample of Loreal RevitalLife. It made my skin feel very soft. I did not, however, see a difference in lift of my skin. Still seeing fine lines and wrinkles on day 14 that I saw on day one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was part of the 14 day free trial challenge. I tried this the first day it came, but I washed it off less than 5 minutes later. The product is so fragranced I felt like I poured a bottle of perfume on my face and it gave me a headache. I have no idea why a face cream needs to smell as strongly as a perfume. This product may do what it claims to for your skin, but I can't speak to that since the product smell is unbearable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used my trial samples for a few days and had to doscontinue use. While the moisturizer alone was very pleasing, when paired with L'Oreal Visible Lift foundation, it turned gummy and created little pieces of goo. The more I rubbed to remove, the worse it bacame. If I only wore the moisturizer, it would be 5 stars, but I wear foundaton daily so this isn't the product for me. Otherwise, the quality was superb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the challenge and I was surprised by the fast improvements. I'm at that age that you begin to have a “turkey neck”. After 3 days of use, my neck looked great. I've always loved L'Oreal products, but this is truly amazing. I've completed chemo and my skin has totally changed. I wasn't sure if it would be too harsh. I didn't have any problems with dryness and my skin looked amazing. L'Oreal has always been my “ go to” this just cements why it is. Thank you!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always enjoy trying new products and liked being a part of this Revitalift challenge. My skin felt smoother and appeared firmer. Thanks for the opportunity to try this product, which will now be part of my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the 2 week challenge and actually began to see a difference with my skin. I really noticed that my skin tone evened out. I am going to continue to use this product as I was pretty happy with the results I have seen so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried this product for about 2 weeks and I can see an improvement of my skin and it feels very soft. After a few days at first my face broke out with pimples. Do not know if moisturizer had anything to do with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received some samples and I love this product! I can tell a difference in the firmness of my skin after just a few applications. It also smells great and you don't have to use a lot of it. I highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the 14 day L'Oreal Revitalift challenge. Sorry but I do not see any change in my skin or wrinkles. I wish I did. One compaint I have is that the cream feels heavy on my skin.
"I thank L'Oreal for the chance to try it, but the Cream is not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pills up and accumulates and feels very greasy, too. I'm very disappointed since I've been a fan of L'Oreal in the past. No way I would use this product again. I tried and gave it a full two weeks, but it's terrible! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample in the mail & didn't think too much of it. Then I noticed the results. It leaves your skin soft all day, but not oily (I have oily skin). It leaves the texture perfect for when you apply your makeup. It seems to go on easier. I also noticed fewer lines. I don't have many, but the few I have were less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i am using the sample pacs (around day 8 or so) and my skin definitely looks more moisturized. i almost want to say that it has reduced a bit of my heavy under chin, lol. i'd also like to comment on how sometimes the lotion kinda does this ""roll"" thing where it rolls off my skin if i rub it hard enough. is anyone else experiencing this? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I couldn't get past the first day of the free trial challenge. I don't understand why there is a perfume fragrance in this. I can't wear it without my eyes watering - my nose keeps running and I keep sneezing. This would have been a wonderful product if it weren't for all of the unnecessary scents that smell like cheap perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is one of the few moisturizers that I've used in three different climates and it worked beautifully. My skin always feels soft and has a nice glow because it's so moisturized. I'm a huge fan and will continue to use the L'Oreal Revitalift for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
it moisturizes well my skin and makes it look younger. i wish that it would have spf also...
"Love this moisturizer. Feels nice on the skin. But, the scent is overpowering and a bit nauseating."
"This is very hydrating and not heavy, I need a moisture level to be moist but light in these extreme weather changes that the south presents and this is perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I liked the feel but did not see any change in skin over the 2 week trial. Another issue for me is that I need a sun screen during the day so using it in the morning doesn't work well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Great product to apply before bed. Very moisturizing. Good smell. Does not work well under make up. Make up balled up. Loreal Wrinkle expert 45 is much better for use under make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received a complimentary trial of Revitalift. I love how it feels and smells when I use it. Also, have noticed a brightness and smoothness in my skin that I haven't seen for years. Am only disappointed that it does not have a SPF as I hate having to layer many creams to get all the effects needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the Revitalift Challenge and was diligent about using it for 14 days. Unfortunately, I did not notice a significant difference in my skin tone or wrinkles. It felt good going on. I would not refuse to use it again, but I probably would not purchase it."
"I received my samples and used daily. I love the smell and the way it feels. You must be sure it is dry before you try to add any type of makeup or it will create a gooey texture. My skin feels great, I think I would need to use a bit longer to really be able to see a noticeable difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't use many creams but after three days using the sample I knew it was the real thing. It feels soft and smooth, disappears butcontinues to feel great, and makes my skin look fuller and smooth. It is especially effective on my neck [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I entered the 14-day sample challenge and loved the product so much I purchased others in the line and will continue to use. It definitely improved the texture of my skin and some crows feet that were starting have all but disappeared. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this item as part of the 14 day challenge. I did like the way my skin appeared smoother and softer to the touch. However, I had to cut back on using it twice a day to just using it at night. I have very oily skin and the cream is a bit too rich and creamy for me to use twice a day. That being said, I would still recommend this product to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the 14 day challenge sample pack and it was not love. First of all, I have when I have to leave a sample blister open all day and ration for the day and night. Next the smell wasn't that great, not rancid, but way too perfume-chemical. Next it tingled in a bad way when I put it on. The next day I had 4 huge zits that I am still trying to clear up. I gave up after that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Strong perfume scent! I am on day 5 of the 14 day challenge but can't see going on at this point. Really should have a light, fresh scent if anything but typically unscented is much desired in the skin care market. The product feels nice and makes my skin smooth though so I am disappointed."
This product is part of my holy grail. Ever since I started using this product I seen a drastic change in my skin. My skin feels firmer tighter and hydrated I use it before my makeup and it does wonders. I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to any friends or family I ran into. Did I forget to mention I received this free from influenster.com!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample for the 14 day #Revitalift Challenge. I love the way this felt on my face. It's smooth and creamy and doesn't leave a residue. It smells great and left my face looking and feeling great after use. It's a little more greasy than I would prefer but not enough to turn me away. It had such great
results my mom noticed and wanted to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this for two weeks and didn't really notice a difference. My fine lines didn't disappear or look better. I have combination skin and this worked great. It didn't clog my pores or make me break out. It felt slightly oily when I first put it on, but it felt great after a few minutes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was fortunate enough to be selected to take the Revitalift 30 day challenge and I was sold in just one day. I absolutely love this product. I have seen immediate results with this anti-aging cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this for 6 weeks. What I like is that it isn't heavy or overly greasy so I didn't break out. I am sensitive to smells and can't use anything scented.This has a slight fragrance but after a few minutes I don't notice it. I do not notice any change in my crows feet or fine lines. As a moisturizer I like it very much. I can't see that it does much else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received these samples in the mail so I tried them. I can truthfully say that this is the best my skin has looked in years. It really makes a difference and I will continue to use it. Great on smoothing fine lines. No one is more surprised than I am because I was pretty skeptical! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just finished using my 14 days trail packet. I don't normally have dry skin so that was not an issue. But the moisturizer seemed to make my skin much smoother and my smile marks a little less prominent. (1/2 a packet didn't seem to completely get absorbed by my skin no matter how much I rubbed it in, however.) I've never used moisturizer before but loved the smooth feel of my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the 14 day samples of this product, and i loved it. It was so soft and creamy and was so easy to massage into my skin. Not sure if it did away with any of the lines, but the skin on my face is so much softer and looks more even toned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the 14 day challenge and have noticed a difference in my skin's appearance. I could feel results almost immediately. I used it as moisturizer under my makeup and could feel it tingling throughout the day. I'm taking that as a sign that it's working to tighten and moisturize my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product about a 2-3 weeks ago. I have been using it twice a day, as instructed, for 2 weeks and noticed the difference in my skin since day 1. I noticed the softness my skin had, I noticed more moisture most of all! Before my skin was very dry and now i can say, yes, this product does work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the 14 day challenge, and overall was happy with this product. I am not a fan of scented products, and hope a unscented option will be available. Other than that the product did soften and plump up my skin. The texture was also improved. The product is ""heavier"" and will be better used as a night cream for me, or I might use a much smaller amount for daytime use. Compared to other product I've used, skin improvements happened fairly quick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm glad that I signed up to get the free samples for this product, because I hate buying stuff when I don't know if they work. I am definitely going to be buying this and I recommend every woman young and old to get this product (you will not be disappointed). I already told my fiance what this woman wants for Christmas. ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been noticing a lot of dryness on my face I've been out working with my dog. with the dog obedience and the members the women said you need something to fight the image sure wrinkles and sagging I don't have that yet and I'm not looking forward to having it so I looked into this cream L'Oréal and he was fine but I need to have something for a sunblock and cream auto repair [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. I honestly can say I saw a difference in my skins hydration level and firmness and lift. Though it is too thick to use under makeup, I loved using it at night and loved how soft my skin stayed until morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day sample pack which I applied faithfully morning and night. I was surprised to see the difference I wanted to see, More than the cream I paid double for. Only down side was the wait. The smell is so amazing. I was so desperate to see the fast change that I gave up but then quickly applied. Not bad L'oreal, not bad.

"I received a 2 week sample. Appreciated the quantity since I really got a fuller experience. My skin feels so much softer, forehead and mouth/lip wrinkles are less visable. Jawline is a bit firmer, too. Have received compliments from several people who see me frequently and have noticed the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day sample in the mail and began the challenge. I was worried at first because of the words “intensive and anti-aging”. The reason it worries me is because most of the time if moisturizers day that they are too thick for me and have a smell I don't like. This was completely opposite and through me for a loop!! It didn't feel think and it smells great. I am very impressed with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given the opportunity to do a 2 week challenge - I have 4 days left but have noticed a difference in my skin. The product did tend to make my skin over oily during the day but worked great at night. I am pleased with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14 day sample and at first I was very skeptical. However, I finally tried it the ful 14 days and it was very nice and did see a small difference. Its smooth and creamy and my face did shine a little more and felt smooth. I would try it again but for me cost is too high. Thanks for the opportunity to try it!

I enjoyed trying this product and will purchase it now that the challenge samples have been used. Using it day and night was convent not to have 2 separate jars. It felt wonderful on my skin.At this age you don't expect miracles but felt it improved the texture of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical due to my sensitive skin, but so far, I haven't had any problems. The cream is light and not greasy. It also has a pleasant smell. I am only on day 3, but I can already see a difference in my skin. It is more plump and bright, and less wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my Revitalift Triple power when I have my allergies. My face skin was so dry and crumpled. Because of my excitement, I still go on with the challenge. The product is adorable, it made my skin smooth, glowing and my wrinkles - oh, it was really tamed. I can feel and see the difference right from the start [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I must say I was always skeptical about these products but upon receiving my free samples and doing the challenge my skin is so soft and silky. I really can see and feel the difference in the skin on my face and look forward to buying my first jar to continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried many many high end products! I can not even compare them to L'Oréal Revitalift! My skin looks and feels it's best! My husband loves touching my face. He says that if feels hydrated and super smooth. I feel that it is as well! My tone is very even and I only used it for 2 weeks! A friend asked me what procedure I had done. I brought her a jar of Revitalift and told her to let me know in 2 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I requested the fourteen day trial, I didn't expect to see any results. You see, I'm sixty-five years old and basically felt that it is what it is. But, I did notice some firming along my jawline and some contouring along my cheekbones. I'll continue to use this product."
I think this cream is comparable to a high end anti aging cream. It was moisturizing and seemed to plump my complexion. It had a good texture and a little goes a long way. I would purchase this product to be able to hopefully see more advanced results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day sample from Loreal as a revitalift challenge. The cream smells so amazing, not greasy and moisturises so well that I was impressed with the first use itself. I used if for 14 days continously and I can say I feel a difference in my skin's texture and elasticity, fine lines seem to have faded and I love the effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the #revitalift Challenge and I'm so happy I did. I don't think I would have tried it otherwise. My skin was softer and firmer after using this cream. I only wish it came in a fragance free version. While the scent isn't bad it was just as times a little strong for me. Having said that I did buy this product after the challenge was over and it is something I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day sample and absolutely love this product. I have found most moisturizers leave a greasy feel. This product was absorbed completely leaving my skin soft to the touch. I also found fine lines and wrinkles were reduced. I will purchase this product. Thank you for the chance to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did the 14-day challenge and really didn't expect much improvement in my mature skin. I liked that the cream was quickly absorbed, wasn't heavy or greasy and had a nice, light fragrance. My skin was softer, but not much plumper or firmer. I'll give the serum a try."
I received this product and I was so skeptical you see a review that says after one use you could see a difference! So I tried it and after the 4th day I could see the changes! I looked younger and it was like my new Best Friend! Revitalift is my new Best Friend! Thank you soo much!
"I love this moisturizer! It not only made my face feel smooth and soft, but it wasn't greasy as others I've tried. This is a keeper! I use it twice daily, and am super happy with the results. I feel younger and look more refreshed than ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has quickly become my favorite. With its thick creamy formula and smooth application this lotion is the one for you. My face feels fresh and smooth everytime after applying. Overall have seen great results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm just beginning my 14 day challenge, but thus far, I am in LOVE! Finally a moisturizer that works for both day and night without being too heavy or greasy, yet feeling luxurious! I'm excited to compare my before/after pics at the end of the 14 days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It felt smooth and went on well and I think I saw some differences in the fine lines around my eyes but I think I would need to continue using it to see if it was the cream. I didn't know the price until coming to this page and I think it may be a bit out of my budget. May be I should suggest it as a Christmas gift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the 14 day challenge and am so glad I did. I am always skeptical of any product claiming to make my face feel and look younger. RevitaLift did what it claimed. My skin looked and felt better the 2nd day of using it. My fine lines were so much less apparent, my skin just looked so much better. I will definitely be purchasing a jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got the 14 day trial samples. I was bummed I lost my coupon but bought anyway. I really love this product. My skin is dry and usually by the end of my day its dryer. This kept my skin soft and it felt moisturized. Seems brighter and tighter. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It hydrates and has a nice slip 30 or 60 day supply when offering samples for feedback would be more realistic. I liked that it hydrated but cannot address the anti aging benefits based on the trial period [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried the challenge and saw visible differences in 3 days. However, I have incredibly sensitive skin and disliked how ‘heavy' it felt. The scent was nice and it didn't cause any skin breakouts, I just didn't care for the way it felt on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got the 14 day challenge and I love this stuff! You can tell the first day you put it on that it is good for your skin! I have missed a few days and the trial packs for the challenge ... I used the whole day pack at once . But will definitely use this everyday and can't wait to see longer use results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Invited to use product for 14 days. Dramatic difference in the overall look of skin; less dull. Fine wrinkles are very faint and some are gone completely. My skin is glowing. I feel ""safe"" with going with little or no coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day challenge and was skeptical at first,but after a couple of days,I could already see changes. I'm 51 and my skin isn't as tight as it used to be,but this stuff worked wonders!!!. It's a bit sticky until fully absorbed,but a small price to PAY...UNBELIEVABLY AWESOME!

I loved this product from the first morning I tried it. You could notice visibly tighter skin and visibly less fine lines around the eyes it even helps with the dark circles and puffiness under the eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used my trial samples and I do like the difference I see in my skin. However the one issue I had was that the product left a film on my skin that rubbed off and felt cakey. No matter how much I rubbed the product in this seemed to happen everyday that I used the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this as the 14 day challenge sample. I have dry skin,this makes my skin hydrated and smooth.was not greasy.it was really absorbed to the skin and skin felt soft.But there was a slight burning sensation for few minutes soon after the application.

"I enjoyed the 14 day challenge! I used it twice a day for all 14 days, and it made my skin much softer. I usually use a lighter weight daytime moisturizer that contains a sunscreen, but I would like to continue to use it in the evening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I already look young, but my wrinkles were creeping up on my eyes. I just didn't need my eyes making the rest of my face looking old. This worked wonders. So surprised at how quick it worked and you could see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thank you for sending me the 14 day free trial, but I am 55 years old and I think this product is for ladies in their 30's, according to the description. Did not notice any big change in my skin, was a bit greasy hours later. No difference in texture of skin and fine wrinkles still exist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin was looking very washed out lately and the Revitalift samples out a glow back into my skin that I hadn't seen in such a long time. It also moisturized very well. I don't have many wrinkles to begin with so can't be certain it diminished them at all. But over all I would say I would use this product again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a fourteen day sample direct from L'Oréal. Having very dry sensitive skin I can say that Revitalift is a wonderful,budget friendly find. My skin stays soft all day without feeling either oily or dry. Definitely a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm almost thru the 14 day challenge. My skin does feel softer and I like way it goes on, but it didn't help my wrinkles or firm up my skin. I will consider trying another Revitalift product as I do like the quality of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample supply and proceeded to use morning and evening. I first noticed that a little went a long way. The product was smooth and was easily absorbed into the face and neck. I used the samples and then went out and bought a jar. Worth the investment
"So excited to be a part of the challenge I was eager to start immediately upon receiving!! Using twice a day morning and evening by day 14 I did see amazing results. It made my face soft, more firm,, brighter, an actually took my wrinkles n lines almost completely away. I don't find any products that work and I can't say this one does I'm Amazed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow I took the 14 day challenge and Revitalift proved to me, it helps a great deal."
I'm always trying new product that will help to improve the appearance of my aging skin . Lord knows I've tried many brands But.I always come back to L'Oreal products because They WORK [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received some samples in the mail and have absolutely loved the product. I am a steadfast Mary Kay user, however, I really love the way my face feels after using RevitaLift. I may just be a new fan.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product and it does leave your skin soft, healthy looking, but I get the exact quality for less, using Jergens Hydrating Coconut Cream for a lot less...Sorry, I was really expecting more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Maybe you have to use this with the serum and the overnight mask because on it's own I didn't see any significant changes, for my 50 year old skin the only thing that I saw was a more even tone on my skin, the texture is thick but it just sat there on my skin, if you touch your face the cream turns into little balls and falls off your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I just finished the 14 Day RevitaLift challenge and was very suprised! My face feels very moisturized. This did not have that oily greasy feeling. It doesnt take much & your face just soaks it right up! I use it morning or night & sometimes both depending on how my face was feeling. I put it on before my makeup & was amazed by how my makeup didn't run! I would recommend this, what a great moisturizer that has benefits of anti-aging! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Got the free trials in the mail, and did it every day. While my skin did feel softer, firmer, and with less wrinkles, I had two issues with it. First, it was heavily scented, and I am allergic to most scents. Second, on certain days, it would flake on my skin, and I had to wash most of it off."
I was part of the 14 trial of Revitalift. At first I was skeptical of the benefits being touted but by the 8th day I could tell a visible difference in the wrinkles under my chin on my neck. I was very pleased that it was much smoother! My face does feel softer and smoother. I can only imagine that if I used the product on a regular basis that I would continue to benefit from it. I would definitely recommend buying it. I'm 55 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a 14 day sample to try out this product. I liked the product, although I didn't see a difference in my face. I would use it at night, but not during the day. It is thick and tends to peel off which doesn't work with makeup. Overall I didn't like it and wouldn't purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the smell of this product. It is very thick and creamy, which was different from what I'm used to ( Revitalist is what I normally use). Even though I wasn't a fan of the creaminess, I could see it being something I would like in another ten years. I didn't see much of a difference in my skin from Revitalist, so for now I'll stick to my usual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried it for the 14 days but I like the regenerist better. It is a little lighter on the skin and my face felt greasy at the end of the day with the the revitalift. It may be better suited for someone with drier skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this free via the Loreal 14 day challenge. I did not see any visible results. It did not minimize the lines or wrinkles. It is a good moisturizer, rich, creamy, good for dry aging skin. If you have not taken care of your skin and this is the first time you have moisturized then I can see where it would be a great improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed taking part in this Revitalift challenge. It is easy to apply and you don't need very much. My skin felt smoother and firmer, almost as if I had applied primer. I used my L'Oreal Rosy tone after and my skin looked great. Thanks for letting us try this product. I plan I buying it soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently received a 14day trial. On my third morning of use, I could see a difference in my neck. On the 5th day, I could see a difference in my facial lines. This product has made my skin so soft and young feeling. I am truly amazed by this product and I will definitely buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day challenge sample and started using it immediately. I love how soft it made my skin feel. I did notice a little skin tightening, and I'm only on day 11 of 14. The only issue is in the morning when I apply it and than a primer, it balls up on my face. But i just use a tissue and gently whip them off. Then it's perfect! Thank you Loreal for the sample! I will be purchasing a jar! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took part in the 14 day challenge and I can honestly say this is a good moisturizer. I would definitely consider purchasing it in the future. The cream absorbs easily and it doesn't leave a greasy feeling like others I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 2-week sample pack, I had my husband use it and I could see a big difference. Every day his skin was looking more radiant and fine lines were disappearing. I too tried a couple of the samples and my skin just soaked up the creamy moisture and I was left with soft, radiant skin. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've finished my 2-week trial of REVITALIFT Moisturizer, and I must say I do see a difference in my skin. Not a drastic change, but the lines around my eyes and mouth seem less noticeable, and my skin appears firmer. Not bad results for a 71 year old ""broad"" :-)."
I absolutely love this product. I have oily skin but I do know that hydration is very important for all skin types. This product is very hydrating yet not greasy at all and absorbs quickly. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this in the mail as a sample and this is the best cream I have tried! The only con I have is that It has a perfume sent to it but it does go away after a while. This worked great for my skin it smoothed out all my dry areas on my face and kept it hydrated all day and night! I also put it on my neck and my chest, I'm a side sleeper and it helped my chest not have so many lines in the morning I was actually surprised! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this 14 day free sample, but didn't get started right away. I am on day 4 now, and so far so good. It feels silky on my skin, not greasy. I have no ""roll off"", I wait 15 or 20 minute's before putting makeup on. I love the way my skin feels!! Will let you know more after my 14 days are up."
"In just 14 days, I cannot believe the difference in my skin tone, softness and glow to my face. Although with having acne prone skin, I do think it clogged my pores, so I had some breakouts while taking the 14 day challenge but overall I think this product is wonderful and I will continue to use.

"I can say this works wondoers on my skin. I am a male, could not beleive the results ! I let my daughters use some of the samples and they loved it ! I have not finished the samples. I will be buying it ! Please send me some samples for my daughters please ! Thanks Luke [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this creme to be too heavy to wear during the day, under my makeup. My make up did not last as long when wearing it. Also, it didn't have any UV protection. It was very nice to wear at night after I take off my make up, which is why I gave it a 2."
RevitaLift is wonderful for my face so I started trying it on my hands! It really makes my hands soft and smooth...the anti-aging properties seem to work everywhere you apply it. I'm very happy with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It seems as though my skin is more hydrated, but will continue on through the 14 days."
"Although I love the concept of what this product does, I personally do not like the texture... very thick, and the smell is a bit nauseating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 14 day challange and eaventhough I did not expect miracles at my age I liked the way it made my face feel smooth, I have sensitive skin but had no problems with this,I will definatly continue using this and hopefully see some change, only one concern though is that when I run my fingers over my face i feel little wax like particles.

"I got this to try because I really need a good moisturizer. I LOVE this so much!!!! Not only does it feel great on the skin, it leaves my face feeling very hydrated. I was a little concerned at first it was gonna make my skin ""greasy"", because I have combination skin. Boy was I thrilled when it didn't, and I love that!!!! I will be purchasing this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my free sample and have loved the results. My face has a new glow to it my wrinkles do not show as much around my eyes . I will definitely recommend buying this and would recommend this to my friends . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day sample to try and I really like the way it made my face feel. This is great for the winter when my skin is drier, but I think it might be a little heavy for summer months. I can see using it at night with a lighter moisturizer for day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

In all honesty I can say that my skin and neck stayed nicely moisturized. I feel that my skin had a more even tone. I would only be able to wear this at night to bed since it's much to tacky or sticky for daytime wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product from a 14 day free sample. Didn't notice much change at first, but all of the sudden, on about day 10, WOW! lines are smoothed and skin tone appears more even. Will definitely buy this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have oily skin and had some break outs when using it but I did see noticeable improvement around my eyes. My crows feet did lessen in intensity as well as the wrinkles under my eyes. It did work like they claim it does. I recommend it for anyone who doesn't have oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I signed up for the free 14 day trial samples and was pleasantly surprised at the results. Nothing earth shattering, but after 14 days my skin felt and looked much firmer and brighter. I even got compliments! I've just purchased this product so I can continue using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would not buy this product after sampling it. First off, it has no SPF, so I wouldn't wear it during the day. Second, it sort of ""rolled up"" as I was putting on my foundation with a sponge. And lastly, I'm not sure, but I think it made me break out a little [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
From the day I received the sample I could feel the difference in the texture of my skin to a slow but gradual change in my fine lines and puffiness around the eyes. Looking forward to purchasing more and getting more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved a 2 week sample and was surprised by the results. At first it felt like it was going to leave my skin feeling oily but it didn't. My skin felt soft not at all oily. And my skin looked better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received a 14day trial sample and I have to say, I will be purchasing it again. My face felt smooth but not greasy...(I hate the greasy feeling).

I was surprised at how nice this cream applies. It feels rich without being greasy at all. My face was fully hydrated after each application. My skin looks smoother and silkier after using this for 2 weeks. I would buy the full size jar when I finish my samples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day sample pack. I was very happy with the way the moisturizer glides on and feels so silky when it's on. The problem I found is after I washed my face my face was very dry. The moisturizer did nothing to repair my dry skin when not on. I will not buy this product since the only visible difference there was was only if I was wearing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just completed the 14 day challenge. The cream has a nice scent and did leave my skin soft to the touch after applying, however, I did have issues with it running into my eyes, pilling under SPF and it did not soften the lines above my lips. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I completed my 14 day free trial using it morning and evening. I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised! My skin is much softer looking, my smile lines and lines above my lips are look so much better. They don't look as deep as they did prior to using it. I am a"
young 60 so of course I have wrinkles but I definitely look younger. I love this product and will continue to use it. Thank you loreal for this free trial. I'm a believer!
"I signed up for the 14 days challenge. I applied the lotion twice a day on a clean and dry face. I have been taking care of my face for quite a while, basically since i was around 22 because prevention is the best treatment. Other than good smell and silky feeling it did not make any difference on me. It may fix something on someone else but honestly for me is a zero."
"I bought this because I did not get the samples in time to start, I would put this on in the morning and put my makeup on, it would just roll off in chunks, one side off face had the chunks that I did not notice and I went through the day that way. I use Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Intensive Skin Revitalizer Serum + Moisturizer and love it, that one works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received my sample and did the 14 day challenge. I'm shocked at how much I loved this product. I don't believe in these type of products, but this made me change my mind. I've now purchased my own and it will be apart of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I couldn't get past how strong the perfume smell of this moisturizer, especially at night before bed. It is such a strong floral smell, which turns me off from wanting to use it at night. The cream is really thick, which made my skin feel smothered. Didn't really notice a difference on wrinkles, or anything. The last product from L'Oréal made my skin feel tight and dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was lucky enough to try the recitalist moisturizer 14 day challenge. It was wonderful. This is such a nice feeling cream and worked wonderfully. I have already bought my full size to continue using. Makes your face and neck feel so hydrated. The challenge was a success for me. I would recommend everyone to try it for 14 days and fall in love with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can tolerate scents fairly well, but this was so heavily fragranced that I had to get up out of bed and remove it. The product may feel good on the skin, but the fragrance is unnecessary. I did not complete the 14-day packet I was given. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to do the Revitalift 14 day challenge but the scent is so strong and harsh that I would not put in on my face. The scent is not at all pleasant. I washed my hands three times and it was still there just as strong. I had to soak my fingers in vinegar to remove it. Anything that goes on the face should be fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wanted to like this so much, the smell I could not take, it smells way too strong and I had to wash it off after 10 minutes. My skin felt really soft but I have problems with smells of any brand. Wish there was a non scented and I would use every day, Sorry! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have just completed the first week of the 14 day challenge and I am really amazed at the results I have already seen. I have fair skin and live in Texas so I have my fair share of wrinkles. Within a few days I noticed how the wrinkles were not so evident. My skin has a glow about it and I have stopped wearing any foundation. I can't wait to see what the next week has in store [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Invited to accept the Revitalift challenge and so happy that i did. Love the product, my skin felt so soft and hydrated. in a couple of day looked nice and with a healthy glow, diminished the fine lines. The scent is nice and fresh. Definitely will buy it.

I only used this one time and felt it was too heavily perfumed and greasy for me. My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily so I was afraid to use it any more. I realize that only using it once was not a fair review of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a free 14 day trial of revitalift and really liked it. I thought my face felt a lot more moisturized throughout the day than with other moisturizers I have tried. As far as the fine lines and wrinkles go, perhaps 14 days is not a long enough time but I can't say that I really noticed a difference."
"Thank you #loreal for this product. The first time I tried the product I knew it felt different on my skin. I applied it at night first. When I woke up the next morning, my skin was smooth and silky. Each day after that my skin felt nourished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how L'Oreal Revitalift moisturizes the skin. I also like how you don't need to use a lot of the product, as only a small amount was enough to cover my face and neck.

"I received my 14 challenge and the first day I used it I saw a difference! I love so much I bought the face cleanser, I using Olay and never saw any change with the cream or cleanser. Thank you L'Oréal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream is relatively thick, but it dries up fast. I could still feel the grease from the cream. (It has more grease than clinique yellow bottle but less grease than neutrogena sunscreen, if that make sense to the level of grease). I couldn't tell significant changes, but the skin does feel real soft after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Revitalift I got as a sample to try for 14 days. I really enjoyed trying this. It feels wonderful on my skin. It's not greasy. It makes my face look fresh, bright and youthful.

"I've become quite the face cream/serum/moisturizer skeptic over the years and when I took the 14 day RevitaLift Challenge, I had no great expectations. On on day#3, and I have to tell you my skin texture has improved and I can see my pores have diminished in size. I've even gotten compliments on my skin!

"Although I found this a bit heavy for under my bb cream it's an excellent night cream, my skin looks soft and luminous. I'm pretty sure I saw a difference in the first few uses. The 14 day sample really made my mind up for me. I'll stick with my Hydra Genius for daytime wear but my substantially more expensive night cream won't be repurchased, it's being replaced. I appreciate being able to try a product before spending my hard earned money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely dry skin and I apply this product in the morning and it last through-out the day. I spend a lot of time outdoors in the elements and it holds up very well. It does reduce the wrinkles and firms my skin. My face feels much softer since I started using this product.
I purchased this and the cleansing cream and within one day saw results especially around the neck and throat area. I have very sensitive skin and this was smooth and calming. The scent is not overpowering and you feel supple and smooth. I have used 100.00 creams and this is much better. I would however suggest that you wait a few minutes after you wash your face to apply the cream. IT WORKS WONDERS!! Especially for 60 yr old skin!!
"I really, really like this product. Blur minimizes flaws and once I apply my makeup I really think it makes my skin look very youthful. I have had several compliments on how lucky I am to have a nice complexion. This doesn't happened often now that I am over 60 and I am sure it will be just as effective on younger skin."
You sent me a sample of this Triple Power and I haven't sent a review back . I have just about just it up and my skin looks as young as when I was in my 20 's . It is so soft yet firm and the brown spot have just about faded away . Thanks to you for caring and I have never used one of your products that I didn't love .
I tried this Moisturizer for 5 days and used it 2xs a day and I love it. I noticed it is not greasy like most moisturozers are and made my skin feel refreshed. I get red spots all over my face after I shower from the hard water we have around my house and I have tried hundreds of lotions before and none have worked as well as this one has.
Love this product!! It makes my skin look great!!!
"Thought this was pretty good, but prefer Olay because of the price."
i use this after every wash and before i go to sleep.

I got a sample from LOREAL to try it out and I realky liked the texture of the cream. It does not make you feel like you have oil on your face. It helps with wrinklea and fine lines. You need to be consistant.
I received samples of this and was not impressed. It dried my skin instead of hydrating it and the smell of the lotion is not pleasant. Will stick with my old lotion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried Revitalift and I found that the product did work. However, the smell was to strong for me and it took too long to soak into my skin compared to other products I've tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using this 3 days, and I already see results! I love this product. I'll have to check back in after 4 weeks to let you know the results at that point!"
This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used!! My skin feels better and looks younger and at 51 that is a wonderful feeling!! Love the light fragrance too!
"Love this cream! Had been thinking I was due for another dose of filler, but after using Triple Power for several months, I see a huge difference. And way less expensive than another trip to the doctor!"
I love the smooth texture of this product. It makes my skin feel soft and supple without any greasy feeling. After a few weeks I noticed my skin feeling tighter and looking smoother too.
I tried a 5 day sample of this product to help keep my skin looking younger. Ii lotion is non greasy and absorbs but the scent is overpowering for me. I could not do the full 5 day sample becaue of the scent.
I received as a sample and after the first night I could see a difference. My skin was soft and my skin had a glow. I love the scent and would definately purchase.
Thank you for the sample I very much appreciate it.

"I am really impressed with this cream. I received the 14 day sample card, and gave it a try. I loved everything about it, but the best was all the compliments I received. Everyone wanted to know what I was using, because the difference was that noticeable."
"Got the free sample and used it every day.Went back to my regular skin care lines-Christy Brinkley and Consult Beaute.Got better results with my old brands,although your product has good ingredients.Just didn't see the same results that I get with my brands."
I use this cream every day. It is absorbed by my skin very well and has a dreamy scent. I have received complements about my skin looking young. It especially helps the neck area where I really need it. Works as well as the high-end department store brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying this for 2 weeks, I am impressed. It smells great, goes on smooth without a greasy feel, and made my skin feel wonderful. I only applied at night, not 2 times a day like recommended. I wouldn't say it removed any wrinkles, but it definitely improved the overall look of my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the 14-day sample pack of this moisturizer as a night cream. It definitely lived up to L'Oreal's reputation for superior skin care products. I love ALL L'Oreal skin products....that being said, though, I have to say that I still personally prefer using the Regenerist Night Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the 14 day challenge and have notice my skin texture literally changed overnight. The fine lines and dullness is a worry of the past.I can say it is thick and I chose to lightly apply at night time only. It says you can wear under makeup but was to greasy for my oily skin. The softness and firmness is a plus for me and helped cut down on my skin regimen products. If it helps I am 32. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I participated in the 10 day challenge and BOY did I give the product a thorough test. I live one mile above sea level (very dry setting), I went hiking to 7,500 feet above sea level (sunny and arid), went on an airplane, and swam in a pool with chlorine. My skin was very dry and the product nourished my skin. Yes there was a fragrance but it was floral and feminine, the creme was thick, not Oily, and it was an easy approach to a beauty routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just completed the 14-day trial and I truly did not notice any reduction in my fine lines. I'm assuming it's because this product is the same as the other Loreal products I currently use, (which prior to this trial I was using Revitalift Anti-aging Firming Day cream and Age Perfect Night Cream). I also have used Youth Code products, which I love. All give me the same results. I plan to continue to use Loreal Products because I do feel they prevent me from appearing my age, 56. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this 14 day challenge. I could see some improvement with fine lines. I did find the product to be heavy and hate the word greasy, did not seem to absorb the way I like. My skin felt like that all day. I was hoping for a lighter product to apple that left my skin feeling soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just finished the two week challenge, and while I really wanted to love this, afraid not. It went on smoothly and didn't irritate my skin, but it did nothing for me. No lifting, redensifying, etc. Ah, well, back to the search. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm 49 years old and have lived in the Deep South my entire life. I've always had combination skin with dry patches. RevitaLift Triple Power is WONDERFUL! No more dry patches, no problems with it being to oily, the soft fragrence is a very nice plus! Firmer, smoother, clearer skin, what more can a girl (okay, grown girl) ask for?"
"I couldn't believe the difference with this cream. I applied it twice a day after cleansing my face. The cream has a nice light scent and did not feel heavy on my skin. My skin was softer, smoother and I noticed a difference in the fine lines especially around my eyes. This 14 day trial made me a believer and a customer. It really works to give me healthier, younger looking skin. Im so glad I tried it! #Revitaliftchallenge [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a 14 day sample of this moisturizer and it lasted me about 2 months. I used it day and night every day. I did not get this for anti-aging. I have very dry skin and I don't like watery moisturizers and this is the complete opposite. I love this moisturizer! Great for dry skin! and it didn't make me break out which is another plus!

"I am in love with this skin cream. Within one week of starting daily use, I had a major change in my skin. No longer dry, now smooth as a baby's bottom and quite a bit of firming going on ! I will use and recommend Revitalift to all my friends. Thank you so much for the chance to try this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loreal sent me a 2 week supply and I'm halfway through and it's great my lines are softer my skin looks brighter I bought a jar for when I'm done with the 2week challange I used to use Olay regenerist Loreal u have a new convert lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I bought this for my mom a few months back and she adores it! She does have dry skin and well into her mid-60s. After a few weeks of using this product, she certainly saw improvement in skin texture; much softer and even color. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I took the challenge offered by L'Oreal and loved the product. It so easy to use, same product day and night and it works. I am 54 years old and was looking for something that did not take too much work and this is it. I can really tell a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received free samples for 14 days ... well, it's not bad, it's not greasy, but it's like the other creams, I do not see how different it is. This is my tenth day ... I think I will not buy this cream, I will try other cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using “Triple Power” Intensive Day Cream Mousturizer for about 10 days and can already see a difference. The “laugh lines”( also called wrinkles) seem to be lessening. I have had friends ask what I've done. They actually say my skin looks so good. So I recommend you give it a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
They sent me a sample of this moisturizer and I have not liked many that I have found but this one is different. It feels wonderful on my skin. It is not to greasy or to light. My skin feels really soft after I have used it. All day long it stays nice and not sticky. I'm sold. Now I just have to find it in the stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the challenge and was impressed with the texture and application glide of the product, much like a high end facial moisturizer at a reasonable price. I also liked the fragrance, which is important to me...I won't use a product if I dislike that element. I would definitely consider buying this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was fortunate enough to try this 14 day trial. This stuff is awesome!! I have dry skin in the winter and this made my skin soft and smooth. Makeup goes on nicely over it. Does NOT make your skin greasy. I was able to get more then one application out of each packet. I went out and bought it after the trial! I highly recommend.

"I completed the 14 day Revitalift Challenge and was BLOWN AWAY by how amazing this product was. It instantly felt soothing and nourishing on my skin, as if my skin was waiting for it all of my life, and immediately saw results. Results included plumped up and glowing skin, brighter and softer skin, and smelled great."
I absolutely love this item. It feels great on the face and really truely amazing.. I would love to have some more. I will be purchasing this product. Thanks and hope for more samples sent my way.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product as part of the revitalift challenge and after using it for 14 days I feel my skin feels smoother and tighter. A little goes a long way and it leaves your skin feeling moist all day. Some face products irritate my eyes but I had not issues with the Rivitalift at all. I will be adding this to my daily routine. #revitaliftchallenge [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the Revitalift Challenge and I can say that I see a difference in my skin. The moisturizer is thick and creamy and has kept my skin from drying out as it does each winter. My skin looks smoother and younger. The only downside is that I did get some acne after a couple of days of using it, but it cleared up after a couple more days. I think this moisturizer would be a little heavy though, during the southwest summers where I live. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the challenge and fell in love with it. I was a VERY dedicated Oil of Olay girl but I am now a L'Oréal lady. This cream absorbed into my skin quickly and my skin was so much softer the next day. I now have the serum to go along with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was able to do the two week sample program and I'm really happy with it so far. It go on really smooth and a little bit goes a long way. My face felt really soft, however the only thing I didn't like was itbwoukd take a few hours totally soak in. If i started to sweat my face felt like my skin couldn't breath so to speak. It felt cakey and uncomfortable. I would suggest a lighter moisturizer for day time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a sample of this in the mail and it made my skin feel amazing! I loved using this stuff, after using the samples i am more then likely going to buy myself some more. Did feel oily putting it on so I was worried about my skin breaking out but it didn't!"
"I took the revitalift challenge and it's has been wonderful. Great texture and very pleasant scent. Doesn't feel oily or leave behind a residue, my skin looks and feels better, and it's only been a couple of days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I actually saw results the first day! My lines were diminished and each day I saw a gradual decrease. I've spent so much money on other products that were guaranteed to make a difference only to be dissatisfied, this stuff really works for half the cost or more. Well worth the money and it leaves your skin feeling amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the revitalift 14days challenge samples and as directed I used twice a day . I am beyond pleased with the product . From the very first day you can feel a difference. However I am now at day 12 and my face glows ! Truly amazing product that keeps your face hydrated and glowing . I am on my way to purchase it and it is worth every penny. As always L'oreal ,Amazing !!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first the lotions consistency made me nervous it seemed oily. After 2 days I completely changed my mind. This lotion is great and my skin feels better then ever. Even in the dry fall/winter weather. I have actually received many compliments and asked what I was doing differently!!
"I took the 14 day challenge and I have to say I was pleased with the results. I love that I can use it morning and night, this cuts down on the number of products in my medicine cabinet! It visibly reduced the fine lines around my eyes and plumped my skin so my foundation went on nicely. I just used the last sample packe and I plan to purchase this product next time I'm at the drug store. Thank you for sending me the samples! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent the 14 day challenge and was skeptical . I am excited to say it works! My main concern is my neck and after the first week my skin is noticeably firmer and smoother. At 53 everything starts to fall but this gives me a fighting chance to look alittle younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the 14 day challenge and I was kinda surprised by the outcome. For the sample to be used both day and night I felt it was not enough for both. I have a round face so I felt I used a little more in the morning and did not have enough at night. My skin did feel softer, I don't notice much of a difference other than that. I will be buying in the future to see if I can get better results with a full size jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started the 14 day challenge and I found my skin to feel softer and softer(never greasy) with each new day. It absorbed quickly and face looked slightly younger; the crows feet were reduced. I applied it under my makeup and makeup seemed to go on smoother too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It smells wonderful. Have my skin feeling great. I seen a big difference in how awake my skin was. It gave me a little glow. Work wonders under make up if do wear or not. I will be using this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample pack, and began using immediately..I am a mature lady and have always loved all types of cosmetics.. I now find that I need a little help. Your product was just what I needed. Though I'm blessed with great skin,i never dreamed it could improve so much.. Thank you, thank you.. It is incredible."
"I received a 14 day sample, and I have 2 days to go but I just love it! The fine lines around my mouth are all but gone, and the smile crease (or puppet mouth lines) are greatly diminished. I bought the Triple Power night cream and the Triple Power Serum and moisturizer combo and will begin using them as soon as my sample is finished. I expect to see more improvement with my new purchases!"
"I am about to finish the 14 day challenge and I will be buying this product when I am done. I used to have to use two moisturizers to have my skin not feel horribly dry. This moisturizer does the trick all by itself. It smells great and does not leave my skin oily. I can't say that I have noticed a whole lot of difference in my appearance, but being so dry that my face itches is enough for me to give it a thumbs up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received the 14 day challenge sample pack. Although I did not notice any huge differences, the product provided plenty of moisture without weighing down on my skin or making it feel oily. Great for beating the winter dryness and ears well under make-up. I did not notice any differnce in overall texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this quite a bit. It did seem to lessen the appearance of the lines across my forehead and it is very moisturizing. The only thing I didn't like was that it was so heavy. I can only use it once a day or my skin feels wet and tacky all day long. It also kind of pills up when you touch your face. The scent was really nice, and it feels luxurious on your skin.

"This cream is a definite re-buy for me.. From the first day I used it, it made my skin silky soft and the smell added a luxurious feel to it. I will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. It seemed to help even my skin tone, and it was very light. I don,t like the heavy feeling of some lotions, but this was light, and did not leave my skin shiny or greasy feeling. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"well L'Oreal did it again. This stuff is amazing. The smell is wonderful, and it leaves my face so soft and rejuvenated. but it doesn't leave my skin greasy, clogged, and shiny like most other moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It is very creamy & smooth. Spreads easily on face & doesn't feel oily. Using it day & Night kept my face moisturized & seemed like some of my fine lines disappeared. Will definitely buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would like it better if it was scent free. Some people have scent sensitivities and some have asthma. This product didn't really absorb in to my skin. It felt like it sat on top of my skin and felt sweaty feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got the chance to try this product and I'm blown away! This product delivers on its promise to provide visible results! I would recommend this product to whomever wants to see results or who may be interested in trying something different. You will not be disappointed with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using my free samples and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. It seems more hydrated and dewy. The fine lines seem less noticable. I like the overall effect of this product. I will have to use it longer to see where I rate it. But so far.. So good..
"I was able to participate in the trial for the Revialift Moisturizer. I have tried other products and I really don't believe that any of them worked. I tried this product and let me tell you, I noticed the difference the very first day. My skin did feel tighter. After the 14 day trial, I have a significant difference in my face. My face feels and looks much younger and uplifting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little skeptical initially because there are so many products on the market, but was blown away by my results! I noticed my little crows feet to be less noticeable as well as my skin a little more taunt within a few days of use! I will definitely continue to use this product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! I received a two week sample to use in the morning and evening. I could see the difference in the way my face felt, it was soft and moisten. When i applied it, I looked less tired. I loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day Revitalift sample package. From Day 2 I noticed a difference. My skin was smoother. The patchy dry areas I felt on my face are now smooth and soft to the touch. My lines are visibly less. I love this cream and plan on purchasing! Thank You Loreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a 14-day free trial of this moisturizer. It's heavier than any product I've used before and I wasn't sure at first that I liked that, but after two weeks, I love the results! I needed to buy more moisturizer yesterday and this is what I chose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am happy w/ the results. I have great skin but Revitalift actually made my skin look more luminous and even felt so much smoother. I have now purchased the serum too. I've always used Clinique but now L'Oreal Revitalift is far more reasonable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Revitalift Intensive Moisturizer by Loreal was life changing for me! I accepted the 14 day challenge and had no idea this would he a total game changer for me. I threw my $40 night cream in the garbage after two days of using this. My acne has reduced, my skin tone is more even, and my pores are back to normal... nothing that my other night cream, I so religiously applied, had done for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the 14 day RevitaLift Challenge. My skin was hydrated almost all day. My skin became soft and smooth. I really didn't care for the scent. Just a bit too strong for me. I'm glad that I go to participate in the Challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using Revitalift daily and improvements in my skin are obvious. It's smoother, softer, plumper and I have less fine lines. I'm 57 and looking better than ever. #revitalift challenge a great success. This is a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I compleated my 14 day challenge i think moisturizer is thick and creamy. Goes on smooth and amells great. Minimized pores leaving a beautiful finish to my face allmost as if i had some make up on....my face was very soft....around day 10 of use my face disnt absorb it as well leaving semi oily spots around the noze and forhead but great to use before applying make up....over all satisfied with product amd recoment it.

"I received some samples of this, so I decided to try it. I love it so much that as soon as I ran out, I bought some! This smoothed the wrinkles around the corners of my mouth and eyes and it lifted my neck. I feel better wearing it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Revitalift, I gave it try for the full amount of time recommended but sadly did not see much results. I found the cream rich and hydrating but it was also a bit sticky for me and after a few minutes it would pill up if I touched my face. I am still a big fan of L'Oreal and will continue to use their products and even suggest others try the Revitalift, it just wasn't for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received and used the 14 pods as directed and absolutely loved the way my skin gulped it up. The product I currently use, requires the application of 3 products which can seem like forever in the morning on my way out to the world. Your revitalift triple power moisturizer gets me on the go much faster. I love the product overall; it would be perfect, the stuff dreams are made of, if it contained an SPF of at least 20. Thank you for the privilege of trying your product."
I did not use it daily as it was recommended. I used it more like every other day and i could still notice the change in my skin's over all health. Its a thicker lotion but it feel more silky than oily. I would definitly recommend as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the Revitalift challenge for 14 days. I will admit I am impressed with this product. It goes on smoothly and my skin stays moist for the majority of the day. I noticed my skin seemed smoother with less noticeable flaws however after I washed my face the lines, etc were noticeable again. The price is great compared to similar products available. I like it enough to buy a full-sized product and continue with daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the RevitaLift challenge and received a 14 day trial pack. When using this product my skin had all-day hydration and was smooth and soft. My only complaint about this product is the fragrance is way too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've had stubborn frown lines that have bothered me since I was in high school. I tried high-end department store anti-aging creams and serums for years without seeing a difference. After using the loreal product for just a few days, I noticed the lines were much less deep and skin was overall tighter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this. It's such a nice moisturizer. It's so rich and creamy and smells amazing. The only thing is I wish is sank into my skin a little more a lot faster. But at night I don't mind it cuz I'm not putting my make up on over it. I've never used a moisturizer that left my skin feeling so nice and dewy and glow like this does. I'm so glad I was one of the people that got to sample this in the #RevitaLeftChallenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the way it goes on, very smooth and silky and plumps my skin up. I think it's a great product,, but I need something for toning and evening out my skin tone.It is great if you are just looking for a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed the results of the 14 day challenge! My skin felt better, looked better and stayed moisturized even on the more sensitive areas of my face without irritation. I must have this for winter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the #Revitaliftchallenge and I'm so glad I did. My skin feels softer than it has in ages. I haven't noticed a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles yet but my skin already looks and feels better. I will continue to use it and look ford to even more visible results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It had very strong smell, reminded me of hair care products. Most nice creams don't have much of a smell at all. When wore with other products even primers it would like ball up and flake off. So that makes me think it wasn't really soaking in. I'm in my 20's so any aging difference would proof it's worth but I saw nothing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved a 7 day sample to try for my honest opinion. I actually loved it. It felt smooth and silky going on without feeling tacky like some do. I only used it for 7 days but I feel like my skin is softer and smoother. I do notice a slight improvement in the visibility of my fine lines. I think with a longer term regiment I would be able to see much more noticeable results. I loved it. I will definitely be buying some and recommending to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the sample and tried it that night. My thirsty skin loved it. My skin is hydrated, soft to touch and this is a product I see myself using for a long time. Thanks for allowing me be part of the challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm an older woman who has spent considerable time outdoors so I have many lines & wrinkles. Although it did not remove those,it feels very nice on my skin. I have mostly used your products over the past 6-7 years & I like them very much. Since I had very ""good"" skin when I was younger,I never used much of anything on my face & I've lived in some very dry areas of the country. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 2 week challenge, and after only a few uses I could tell a major difference. My skin was smooth my wrinkles were way less visable. I could instantly see years just taken off with the usage of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my samples a bit late I guess as I am not completely done with my samples just yet. I have been using the product about a week now. I can say that I was skeptical but my skin feels and look great!!. My face looks very healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall I didn't notice much of a change in the way my skin looks. I also didn't like that this felt like it left a film on my face that would ball up and come off while applying makeup. If I were to keep using this, it would be as a night cream when I wouldn't want to apply anything else to my skin. I found the smell to be quite pleasant but a little strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample of Revitalift. My skin appeared firmer, smoother and more radiant from about the second day. I have already purchased more. I do wish that you made a fragrance free cream, sometimes I have sensitivities to fragrance-this went away when the cream began to absorb. Wonderful product!"
"HELLO MS.WILLIS TOOK THE CHALLENGE , AND I LOV E THE PRODUCT AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. PLEAE FEEL FREE TO SEND ME SAMPLES BECAUSE I LOVE THE WAY IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL. PS PLEASE MAKE THE PRICE GOOD FOR PEOPLE ON A LIMITED INCOME BECAUSE THEY CANT AFFORD IT, SO PLEASE KEEP SENDING SAMPLES."
"Using half in the morning and half in the evening and so far it's going well, I wish I had more samples to go by so I could see if it really did do the job this is an amazing product though thank you very much for sending me samples [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only received my samples 7 days ago so I didn't get the full time to use it. What I have noticed in that time is my skin feels smooth and lines are less visible. I really wish I would have had the full time to use it before I had to review it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the challenge samples and I am so thankful to Loreal for giving them to me. I loved this moisturizer,my skin is softer and i have less wrinkles. Thank you so much!! Great product!!! I recommend all women try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this free to try, & honestly wasn't expecting much from it, but I was wrong. I absolutely loved it. I have combination skin, & this worked great for me. Moisturized my face really nicely without leaving my face greasy or weird. My skin felt smooth nd nice. highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received samples as part of the #revitaliftchallenge. At first I was worried because it felt a lot heavier than my usual moisturizer, but I had no breakouts and my skin looked fresh the entire period I was using it. I'll continue to shop around for favorite moisturizers and I would definitely consider buying this again. Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got this as the 14 day challenge and I'm glad I got to apart of it. I did felt my skin become smoother as days went on. I'm not 100% sure about the wrinkle lines, but I am more likely to buy it now. As I'm sure with more time I will see more results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample for the #revitaliftchallenge for 14 days. I started using it and my face was smoother and brilliant. I feel the hydration in my skin. I don't have too much wrinkles because I am still young but in overall is a really good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved a 14 day sample to try and I am more than impressed. I expected longer than 14 days to see results, however I started to notice a difference within the first three days!!! I was shocked! I really enjoy the scent of this product and its not overbearing.The product itself has an almost silky texture to it and it makes your skin feel incredibly soft with the very first use. I will absolutely continue to use this and I highly suggest this to anyone who has doubts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product morning and night and I'm so impressed with the results! The skin on my neck is much less crepey and the area around my eyes is much smoother. The product lasts from one application to the next keeping my skin smooth and soft day and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Challenge and results are impressive. But I can't force myself to endure the very strong frangrace. No one, No one at all, wants fragrance soaked in your face. Ever!"
If it becomes available in frag free I will definately add to my skin care routines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Definitely a great moisturizer, very thick. My skin doesn't feel as dry as it was before. I would rather put it on in the evening because when I put it on before my makeup in the day, I would have to wait 10-20 minutes or else all my make up and moisturizer would clump up and roll off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product will work. However, I am highley sensative to perfumes and could not use this. On a positive note. It did not break my skin out like other products I tried, so I think if it did not have the perfume it would be good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Did the 14 day challenge, what can I say other than I love it. It has nice hydration without making my skin oily. Visible results and a pleasant smell. I am 44 and have been really looking for something to start using on a daily basis and I believe I have found it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this cream only at night because it's too thick to use under makeup. I liked that it's very thick and doesn't take much to cover my face and neck, but I can't get over the heavy floral fragrance. It's way WAY too strong! After a few nights of trying to get used to it, I gave up and went back to my old lotion. I also didn't like that it never really absorbed into my skin, causing my face stick to the pillowcase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this cream about 3 weeks ago. I've never really bought creams like it because I didn't notice the difference, but with RevitaLift, I did notice. Fresh, smooth skin from the moment I put it on and it actually did what it is suppose to do. Thanks Loreal!! I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a free sample of this product to try out in return for my honest opinion and I was impressed from the very first time I used it! I was shocked how good it worked and how immediately I noticed results! I am definitely going to keep using this as part of my daily routine!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After two weeks of daily morning use, I find that this does provide a moisturizing first step for my skin. Despite the numerous 'alcohol's in the ingredients, it does not dry out my skin. There is dimethicone in this product, which I don't like, but it does it's job. There were days when I skipped primer and my makeup held up well. I have dehydrated sensitive skin and did not experience problems with this product even when I applied it on eyelids. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my 14 day trial and was very excited to begin. Although it smells great and made my face feel soft the product came up short. I really wanted to believe that my face was smoother and the fine lines were less noticeable but there was no change whatsoever.
I know that L'Oréal has some great products as I'm loyal to their makeup line but the revitalift is not something that I will invest in.
I tried this for two weeks and must admit that my skin definitely feels more resilient and has better elasticity. I coupled it with a facial scrub and the results were excellent. Loreal has terrific products that give great results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a free sample of this in mail weeks ago. I am very happy with the product and the results. My face has never looked or felt better. Thank you for the free sample, i will be purchasing this product (fullsize) in the next couple of days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day free trial and started using it. after just a few dys I noticed that my hands were looking younger so I took a good look at my face and fond it looking brighter. A friend, out of the blue, said, ""You look like you are feeling better!"" I looked sort of startled, and she continued "" your face looks brighter and sharper."" I told her about the trial and she said it must be working. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Revitalift challenge and was impressed by the cream. It has a wonderful texture and pleasant scent. I like that it is thick & creamy, yet absorbed nicely into my skin. It made my skin feel soft & minimized my fine lines. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 14 day challenge and was waiting to see if the skin under my chin smoothed out. I think perhaps it has, but it is too early to tell. Has a light scent and moisturized well without being greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I requested and received a 14 day sample supply of recitalist anti aging moisturizer. I love how it makes my skin feel. It's like a serum. I have notice a change in my deep forehead lines. They appear to have decreased, not as deep. I can't say lines have disappeared in 14 days however I'm am pleased with the product. When comparing prices with Loreals Revitalift for those of us who can not afford high end. This is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I adore this moisturizer. In seven days my skin has improved in so many ways. My fine wrinkles are almost gone. My face feels firmer. My husband even noticed, and that is a first. On my way to purchase a jar, because I don't want to wait on shipping. Thank you Loreal for including me in this challenge. I have made a decided change [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 14 day sample of Revitalift Triple Moisturizer. The first thing I noticed upon applying it is how refreshing it felt on my face. It does not leave my face feeling greasy and is easily absorbed into my skin. I like how soft my skin feels when I wake up in the morning. The only change that I would like to see if for it to have SPF protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been a long time user of another brand of skin care. But after doing a 12-day challenge with Revitalift moisturizer, I'm completely sold on it. I noticed a visible difference after just 5 days. By day 12, my skin looked amazing and regained it's elasticity and smooth feel. And the compliments I received from strangers reinforced my opinion about Revitalift. I won't go back to my old brand again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received the 28 day challenge and am so happy I did it. I am older and my skin felt smoother softer and firmer day by day. My makeup went on easier. Non greasy and quickly absorbed. First time I really stayed with a product and actually saw results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the challenge and did not notice much change in my skin. I still had bags under my eyes. The formula was silky though. I used it on my throat and chest and they looked younger. However, the use on my face was no change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14-day challenge of this cream to try. The consistency is very nice. It is a little heavy for daytime but perfect for overnight. The scent is extremely pleasant. I like the product, but did not see much difference in my appearance after 14 days of use. I would consider purchasing the product if the price is comparable to other brands I like. I would add it to the list of products I recommend to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used my 14 day sample. It felt nice going on, but I didn't see any difference in my skin? Rubbing my face in the morning, product sluffed off? Thought it might bring out fresher skin, but didn't see it? Maybe at 70, I'm too old too expect a change? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received sample to use daily. Loved how smooth it went on and left my face silky smooth. Not sure about reducing wrinkles as I think I need to use it for a longer period of time. Would definitely purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've been purchasing Revitalift for roughly one year or so. I see amazing results and I'm 32 years old. I notice that my face stays moisturized, and the lift is incredible and it smells great. The price is good since there is usually some sort of coupon. I will continue to purchase and upgrade to the triple power. Thanks for the samples! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the feel and look of the moisturizer on my skin. The 14 day sample said to use it morning and night but I feel that I need a sunscreen in my daycream so it would be good for night only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a free 14 day trial. This product was very moisturizing. Good for winter time. May be too heavy for summertime humidity. Also the fragrance was too strong. Would prefer it to be fragrance free. Overall a good moisturizer that seems to improve the look fine lines and wrinkles. Would purchase if it was fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm glad I got to try Revitalift. Everytime I used it my skin would feel smooth and hydrated. The product did not clog my pores which is very important to me. Even though I am no longer a teen my skin is still prone to problems with the wrong products. I It was light in texture yet strong in doing it's job! Thanks!

"Took the 14 day challenge and was very pleasantly surprised at the results. Products may promise a lot, but usually fail to deliver---this product did not fail. I noticed a difference in fine lines and hydration after only the first week. I will definitely be continuing use of the revitalift line of products.

"I received this product in the mail. I was very excited to use it the first few days as it made my skin very soft and smooth. Continuing to use it, I noticed that my face would get greasy around my nostrils and other places on mjy face. Although it did not cause me to break out, I don't like feeling oily. But my skin is still smooth, so that's a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 14 day sample of this product and it did not work for my skin at all. It felt very greasy and rolled and peeled off of my skin. I ended up having to wash it off. It was too gross to leave on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received samples via mai and was very excited to try it. My skin is very dry and sensitive and I have to be careful what I use. This cream provided enough moisture to my skin to less all day but unfortunately it made my skin feel a bit greasy.

"I was apart of the revitalift challenge and i received the product for free. I just used it under my eyes, thats where i had the most problem, and i noticed a change in just a couple days.

"I received a 14 day sample and loved it. I bought a jar so I can continue using it. It is creamy, goes on very smooth and makes my skin feel soft. I don't have many wrinkles so can��t attest to that, but it is less expensive than the product I was previously using and feels good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just finished my samples and I HAD to go buy some! I was not expecting my feel skin to feel this good. After one week my skin felt firmer and I now have no issues with my skin being dry or oily and I've had trouble with both of those issues for years! This stuff is fabulous. So worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Revitalift moisturizer for 8 days and there is a noticeable difference in my skin. It is softer and never feels dry anymore; it is brighter and feels firmer. Other moisturizers are instantly absorbed into my skin and skin doesn't feel any different. Reviatalift effect lasts all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took part in the RevitaLift Challenge, and my skin looks so much less crepey, less wrinkley, and more youthful. I will definitely buy this product and recommend to friends."
"The only suggestion I might have is that it left a filmy residue on my face, which I disliked. It would be better if it was more of a gel than a lotion, and if it had a sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pretty good moisturizer I do have ecozma so my skin gets too dry even after moisturized my face my skin start Dry and some dry skin comes off but since I start this moisturizer it works great my skin is always moisturized all day and night my skin is followless I love this product I will go get more at store :-) thank you L'Oreal for gave me two weeks challenge.

I recently tried Revitalift moisturizer and I love the richness of it but the only issue is that the moisturizer left a whitish film on after I'd applied my primer. I'm not sure if I'd applied my primer on too soon after moisturizing or not. But other than that...I'd buy it. Its great to use during winter months!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received the 14 days sample in the mail and used it day and night and did feel a softness to my skin and my dark spot I noticed on my forehead is visibly lighter in color. Although I did have one issue with under eye area...became irritated under one eye only....otherwise all was good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been a Revitalift user for over a year now. Received the Triple Power sample in the mail. They are the most luxurious creams I have ever used. Other brands tend to make my eyes burn after a while, but not Revitalift. It feels nice coming out of the container. Makes my face feel good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Such a truly amazing product, true to their claims. I tried it out for 2 weeks and my skin is smoother, tighter and my dark spots are less visible. I love using it under my makeup during the day to moisturize and also wear it at night after I wash my face. Love this product I will definitely recommend it to all my friends and family!"
I just completed the revitalift challenge & am loving the results! My fine lines around my mouth have diminished and my crows feet are noticeably smaller! I also love the way my makeup goes on smoothly over the revitalift also
I received the samples for my review & am truly very happy with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Used the samples I was sent and very impressed with the rich and creamy moisturizer that I can use both day and night. I want to thank Loreal for giving me the opportunity to try this product for two weeks free to decide for myself it I wanted to continue to use it. The answer is yes, it makes my skin looked brighter more toned and soft to the feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for about a week and I love it! I have sensitive skin and I haven't had any problems and I love how it makes my skin feel. so soft and hydrated especially this time of year! I've found my new face cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given a free trial through the website. I can't say I found what I was looking for. The smell was overpowering and I didn't notice any difference immediately. I shared with my mom and she agreed about the smell but she was able to see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I participated in the 14 day challenge and the cream does appear to reduce the look of fine lines and I also noticed my skin felt smoother. I am thankful for the 14 day supply to try the product as I would not have normally tried this had it not been for the free trial. I would recommend this product to my friends and will be purchasing my own supply in the near future! Thank you L'Oreal!!
"A really great product that is reasonably priced. Great results for firming up sagging skin. I could actually feel the moisturization in my face and neck. This is my new ""must have"" cosmetic cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried it under makeup and it peels off while applying L'Oréal foundation and leaves little pieces of makeup and revitalift. I tried using the least amount possible still dealt with it rolling off in little pieces. It feels like it just sits on top of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day trial version of Revitalift. I have very sensitive skin and after 2 days of using this product my face started to break out so I stopped using it on my face. I did however continue to use it on my neck and chest which has had a lot of sun exposure. I definitely noticed my skin appears smoother, softer and even the color has evened out. I will definitely continue to use this on my neck and chest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for about a week now. The formula is very creaming and moisturizing. The smell is luxurious, kind of a perfume smell. I don't really have any wrinkles yet so I cant vouch for the claim it reduces the appearance. I can however say that after using this for about a week I have notice my face feels a lot more hydrated and it appears to be glowing. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day sample.It was great.I didn't even realize that my face was even in need of anymore hydration.My skin isn't dry.My face felt so fresh and rejuvenated!It had a great scent as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Got a free sample for 14 days challenge and I couldn't get pst day 2. Used this day and night but with or without makeup , it was still too oily. This moisturizes very well butfor someone with dry skin. I had shine on my face which is something it try to avoid. dont smell much, goes on very smooth and well, don't feel warm or tingling or tightening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day sample. Loved it at night, but it's too heavy for day use. The scent isn't bad, but a bit strong. I did notice a slight difference in my skin, but not a big enough difference to run out and buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was surprised this product didn't make my skin oily. This product is very thick in consistency. You really have to Emulsify In hands to apply. This product works. I think it's better for dry skin. Hope this is helpful. Also having the full regimen of products makes a difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started by using the 14 day sample from loreal and I was impressed. I bought myself a jar of this amazing product, along with the facial cleanser, miracle blur spf 30 and miracle blur eye pen. I have not worn foundation in weeks and my husband couldn't believe that I didn't have any on and told me how amazing my skin looks. So coming from a guy that was pretty amazing! I am totally impressed with this moisturizer!"
"I received a sample of this cream to try. The consistency is perfect and does not leave my face greasy. The scent is extremely light and pleasant. I did not, however see a huge difference using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the 2 week challenge. The cream feels luxurious and smells beautiful but i didnt see a change in my skin at all. The cream also piles and balls up on my face. If i touch my cheek or chin i feel clumps of it fall off no matter how little i use of it. I wanted to love tis but i will have to find a different treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm on day 3 of the revitalift challenge. Call me crazy but I already see a difference. My skin is brighter & glowing and the lotion itself smells amazing. I swear I feel better just after applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did the #lorealrevitaliftchallenge for 14 days!i thought it worked really well.i love the moisture level in this!i noticed my face looking brighter after 4-5 days using!i would love to try one of the pure clay masks with it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was able to complete the Challenge and I am pleased with the results. As I used the product night and day, I noticed how hydrated my skin was and more alert I looked. The fine wrinkles are still there, but were not as noticable while I was using the samples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved a free 14 day sample of Revitalift Triple Power by Loreal Paris to try and review, and I loved this stuff. Starting the first day I could tell a difference in the way my skin felt. My skin feels smooth and moisturizesed all day. I will bereplacing my other face cream with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed my skin is way more nourished and soft after applying the moisturizer. My face is more glowing even without make up! Thanks Revitalift for the amazing wonder you did for my face! Will definitely continue using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this new l'Oréal rivitalift moisturizing cream a week ago to try and I was very happy with the result . I usually have a dry skin I tried so many moisturizer but nothing works except the l'Oréal rivitalift cream I am thankful and happy with the results within couple of days using it you will already feel the result it make your skin lighter and younger looking.

I did the challenge and have mixed thoughts on this product. I love that it left my skin feeling moisturized but didn't see any other of the positive effects that others saw. Still would use for a wonderful moisturizer. One other small thing..the smell wasn't the greatest but I think that is a personal preference type of issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a dry to oily sase and I was hoping it would be more voiced arising then it was because I could put on and then a couple hours later my face would still dry again so really wasn't beneficial to me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14 day challenge and from day one was amazed with the way it made my face feel so soft. The moisture was immediately enjoyed, never feeling anything so wonderful before. All my makeup is L'Oreal, but I have failed in using the products offered for aging made by L'Oreal. I must fix that problem immediately. Thanks for the challenge. This is a sure winner, but L'Oreal always is! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this moisturizer does not sit on top of my skin like other extremely thick lotions. I am not sure about the long term effects yet, but I am excited to keep using it and trying out other products from the line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face drank up this product. This creme was light and absorbed quickly. It did not feel heavy or oily on my skin. Just a smooth, hydrated face that accepted my makeup. And I visibly noticed softening of the lines around my mouth and eyes. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product for 10 days. I saw some very slight results in my skin texture and lines. The big issue I had was it is so thick. Great for a night cream but for a daily cream I could not get my foundation to blend properly. I even tried several different foundations to try to work it out. Bottom line nothing worked so I gave up the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So satisfied. L'Oréal brings high-end products to the mainstream. I did not tell anyone that I was using a new product. Within the first 7 days people were asking if I was trying something new. I had people asking if I had gotten a professional facial. The RevitaLift reduced appearance of pores and fine lines. It saturated my skin with moisture. The creme absorbed well and had a great scent. I am a forever fan. It is a permanent part of my skincare regimen now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the 14 day challenge, and loved the results. My skin was noticeably softer and smoother. At my age (late 60s), I doubt that any skin cream can banish wrinkles, but I felt that Revitalift did improve the overall look of my face. Also, I loved the fragrance and how easily it blended and absorbed into my skin without a greasy, heavy feel. Thanks, L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received 2 week sample of RevitaLift. It was very moisturizing and it definitely stays true to saying that it smooths skin texture. I really enjoyed using this product and I would certainly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really didn't think a product could make much of a difference, but vitalift did! Within just a few days, my shin felt so so much softer and smoother. I kept making my husband feel my cheeks, I was so pleased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved the 14 day sample and i absolutely love it! It doesn't feel greasy or heavy. It leaves my skin healthy. I have a problem with dry skin on my face & neck in the winter but this did a great job fixing that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given samples for 14 days to use both day and night. My skin looked hydrated after the first use, my fine lines were gone after 2 days and by day 14, my skin looked healthier and firmer. I have recommended it to friends and family and bought some for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this as a 14 day sample and it is truly amazing! I am in my early 30's with dry skin that has sun damage and wrinkles. This cream is very moisturizing and it sits well under makeup, I noticed a complete resolution of dry spots and my skin feels younger and more plump. This cream smells nd feels so good! I'm hooked! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received enough samples to use for 14 days and I loved it! After using for only a couple of days my skin felt soft and smoother. Only a small amount was necessary to make my face feel hydrated and refreshed. Although it didn't get rid of the deeper wrinkles (smile and laugh lines) I did notice the small ones around my eyes were reduced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved my two week trial but was unable to use it because of the overpowering fragrance. It is like spraying perfume all over your face. I was highly disappointed because I use other products by L'Oreal and have had good experiences with them. You really should offer a line of unscented skin care products for those customers that don't want or are sensitive to highly scented skin creams.
"I received this as a 14 day sample. It was amazingly smooth when I applied it and the scent is wonderful. I loved the way it felt on my skin, very silky. Overall, after the fourteen days my skin felt and looked really good. Definitely buying a jar! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The word that comes to mind when I use this stuff is SILK. It's so smooth and silky, it leaves my face feeling amazing, even when I wake up in the morning. My face is still smooth. It also smells incredible! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for a 14 day trial. I was very enthused about the possibilities of what this product might do. However after using this for 12 days I see no noticeable change. I notice other reviewers in my age category have experienced the same thing. Sad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14 day trial and still have a few days to go. I noticed that my skin felt a little softer after a few days. Did I see a visible lift after a week ? No, I did not. The only thing I noticed was that revitalift makes my face feel softer and more hydrated. thank you, L'oreal, for letting me try it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little worried by how creamy the product was, because anything too thick tends to give me milia. But, not so with this! Perfect timing too, with the weather change and drier skin. I didn't really notice the anti-aging properties, but it's a great moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this as a sample pack and I did notice a change but I always had the roll off due to my dry skin possibly, not sure. I liked the smoothness and even skin tone from this product but I would not buy again cause it always had the roll off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using for about a week now and I can truly see and feel the difference in my skin. So soft. My skin gets very dry in the winter months and since I have been using Revitalift moisturizer, the dryness is gone. Can't wait to try the other products in this line. Thank you, LOREAL! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is showing signs of aging with lines and dryness...this product definately is deep moisture...I felt a difference in the softness and glow of my skin. There is a strong perfume scent, which I have sensitive skin and this did cause a bit of an irritation. Also, I did have to wait 10-15 min to put make-up on or there seemed to be still a layer or film of moisturizer still on the surface of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my 14 day trial of L'Oreal Revitalift and love it! I'm 60 and this cream hydrated and plumped up my skin and my forehead wrinkles have almost disappeared since using it. Thank You L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I participated in the #revitaliftchallenge and was pleasantly surprised. I received samples from Loreal for 14 days use. This moisturizer, although thick and creamy, did not cause breakouts and did not make my skin greasy. My makeup went on smoothly. Definitely a win for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this is a sample to try my wife always says take care of yourself to stay looking younger. I am very impressed have tried other stuff out there, but by far this is the best out there. It feels like it tightens your skin and the key thing that it does for me is keeps my skin feel like it's drying out. Taking care of yourself really pays off most people think I'm 10 years younger than I really am. I will definitely be buying this again I am sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product but have found it tends to ball up if I use it in the morning under make up. I recommend using at night and on days you are not using a foundation. It hydrates really well and my skin feels much smoother after 14 days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved 14 packets of this for th 14 day challenge. I was very pleased with the results. Each packet was more than enough for two applications daily. It's thick but not heavily greasy. Absorbs well. I noticed a difference in my skin texture and skin tone. I already use L'O'real firming neck and chest cream but used this in the place of that for 14 days and did not see a decrease in firmness. Perhaps an increase but I'm not really sure. I will be purchasing this product. It's great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I loved that your company sent 14 single samples instead of just one single sample. Since it takes 30 days for the skin to cycle I still noticed a change in my skin tone, more supple and didn't irritate my eye area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 14 day sample and used it everyday for the 14 days. It goes on pretty smooth but kind of weird feeling. My skin does feel and look a little better from using this product. I would buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the challenge in the mail, and I was hoping for the best. I am 60 years old and really need a good moisturizer. I was very pleased with revitalift. My skin felt so soft after the first use, also I can feel some tightening. I went to the store and bought some. Some people complain about it peeling off, but you have to apply it and let it sink in for a few minutes before makeup. Also don't use too much. I have no problem wit it."
i received the 14 day challenge and used as directed. After just a few days i noticed that my skin felt more hydrated and smoother. when the product was completely used i felt my skin was greatly improved in texture and luminosity as well. I liked the scent and the general feel of the cream..seemed very luxurious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this product I received for a 14 day trial! My skin seemed moisturized and smoother. I especially noticed an improvement on my neck. It felt silky smooth going on and had a pleasant smell. Only con: when applying my foundation it seemed to ball up on my skin. Possibly a super thin layer of it would help. I think this would be best as a night cream.

"I received this for free to sample, and did the two week challenge. I do feel like my fine lines have diminished somewhat; but I do feel like the product is a little thick and therefore my face tends to feel a little greasy for a while after I put it on.

"I signed up for this challenge and I have to admit I was skeptical. I was very pleased with the product and the results. I can visually see a more hydrated, fresher look to my face and neck. Even the few lines I have in my forehead seemed to be less defined. Overall, product was successful in what it claimed to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did try the samples for 14 days and absolutely loved the product, I will be purchasing as a daily product. Wish I would have done the day 1 to day 14. Thank you for the chance to try your products. Thank you, thank you, thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received a 14 day sample and was excited to try it. I noticed firmer skin within the first week! I went out to buy my own supply and was a little taken aback by the price. A little too expensive for my tight budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received free samples of this product thorugh Loreal. Being younger, I wasn't necessarily looking for a product to reduce wrinkles and such, but I fell in love with this product. It is an excellent moisturizer! I love its thickness and how soft it makes my skin. A little bit definitely goes a long way! I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My first thought about this product was how thick it was and I'm not going to like it. It did go on heavy which I do not care for but it absorbed quickly and did not leave my face greasy feeling. My face was soft and smooth. I would not use this product in the summer because I feel it is to heavy for me but during winter when air is dry it will be a blessing.

"I was chosen as one of the Lucky Testers for #LorealRevitalift. I was sent a free 14 day supply that I used twice a day, morning & evening. I was blown away at the results. I had a wonderful experience using it. It's a Silky Smooth, Thick Cream that Smells Heavenly. I've used a lot of Skin Creams and this is my new Favorite. My skin is Smoother, Tighter and a bit Glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the free 14 day sample and have to say that it did hydrate my skin. It plumped it in parts, decreasing visible wrinkles and made my neck look less crepey. The only hold back to adding it to my current beauty regime would be the fragrance. It is pretty strong and not high end. If they come out with a non-scented product, I will jump on it!

"I have been using Loreal's age perfect product for years and have been satisfied with it.

"I got the samples to try and I must say that at least it is working on my dry skin. Every year when Fall start my skin start peeling and it feels so dry, I hated because no matter what moisturizer I used it never helped until now. I'm so glad that I asked for this sample by the time I got it my skin was already peeling and after I started using the sample I noticed a big change. I don't have dry skin anymore.

I did the 14 day challenge and started seeing the difference in my skin after the first day. My skin feels well hydrated and firmer and looks younger. Before the 14 days were over I purchased the day cream and the night cream. Next I will purchase the serum. I also got a free sample of the cleanser with the night cream and I love the way it makes my skin feel so clean and fresh. I am very happy with the results after using these products and the price is reasonable.

"I received a 14 day trial of RevitaLise Triple Power and the change I noticed first was my skin looked and felt firmer and less dry. By the end of the trial find lines around me eyes seemed less noticeable. My oldest daughter remarked today how great my skin was looking!

"I just finished my 30 day trial, and am amazed! I didn't truthfully have high expectations when I started this, but am very glad I tried it. Within the first week I had noticeably firmer skin. By the third week, I had decided I would add this as an all the time purchase! I love my skin again! The fine lines around my eyes and mouth have deffinitly improved as well as adding a more radiant overall appearance. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I did the 2 week sample challenge and really enjoyed this product. It's a thicker formula than I am used to, but was surprised at how balanced my skin felt. I'm not sure if I would use this in the summer...but for this time of year, I would definitely use this."
"I really liked this product. I tried it on the 14 day review. It feels great on the skin and made my face look smooth and amazing. I would just recommend watching it around yours eyes if they are sensitive, but other than that I saw a real difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't use a moisturizer and didn't feel the need to start now. But I was total wrong, my face feels great, dry skin is gone and my face feels firmer, so I'm a believer and will continue to use this product! Thanks L'Oreal for the free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I normally don't try these kind of products because I am usualy disappointed but I have to tell you REVITALIFT is working I got a late start so I haven't finished 14 days of use yet but I love the way my face looks and feels. I will continue to use this. Everyone needs to give it a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was excited to try RevitaLift. I've been trying to minimize the age lines starting to appear around my mouth, eyes and forehead. After a few days of using RevitaLift, I started seeing a real noticeable difference. I'm excited to finally find a product that does work. I love the way it feels on my skin.

"I was pleased to receive a free sample. The quality of the product in the sample was excellent. I loved the results I got after using it for 2 weeks.

"I have very dry and sensitive skin especially in the winter time. The Revitalift intensive moisturizer left my skin hydrated and so so smooth. I love the way my skin feels and looks especially after applying powder foundation. No more dry skin, no more skin flakes. I did find the scent a little heavy for my allergies, could you please consider making a scent free version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received samples as a challenge and have to say that this cream hydrates very well...actually have seen diminishing of my fine lines over this two week period. It is a little heavier feeling as is a very rich cream compared to what I normally use but isn't noticeable once it's soaked in. Overall, I would definitely recommend.

"I received a 14-day sample of this product from L'oreal (#RevitaliftChallenge). Although the product feels great & is rather moisturizing, there is residue left only a few hours after applying (too thick of a formula for me, perhaps). I also have not noticed any changes in skin appearance. I'm sure that many others like this product, but it's not for me. I do, by the way, absolutely love L'oreal RevitaLift Double Lifting Day!

I received a 14 day trial pack and noticed a difference after only two days into it. I am 70 years old and take good care of my skin so I was surprised at the difference I could see. I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as the #14 day challenge and I love the way it makes my skin feel. Only problem I have with it is that it makes my foundation pill and it makes the application hard. I just started using it at night only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for 2 weeks. First thing I noticed is the smell is very clean almost like a great soap. Never felt greasy and I didn't get any blemishes. The only think I didn't like was it didn't help with age spots. Helped soften lines around eye. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a sample of this in the mail and I have to say, at first, I didn't think this would leave such an impression on me, but it has now been 4 days of my using it and I am already seeing results!

"I received my samples and used them for two weeks day and night. I really liked this product. It went on smoothly, left my skin feeling really moisturized and my skin looked healthy. I also like the fact you can use day and night. I will buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OK, so the only reason I tried this moisturizer was because it was a free sample. I have always used (and loved) Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair but no more. I now exclusively buy products in the Revitalift line. As soon as I started using my free sample, I noticed a change in my skin. My face looks more radiant and smooth - I am a sold on this product!

"i got the two week sample but it is going to last longer than 14 days because i dont need that much moisterizer on my face all at once(even using morning and night). I might purchase this product in the future but i will keep trying it out, i cant really say that I have noticed any results yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recived my 14 day sample pack and was sp excited to take my #RevitaLiftChallenge. I tried it on one evening and I felt like it was pretty heavy on my face so wearing it for the daytime use I wasn't really a fan of however it was a great moisturizer for night time especially in the winter when my skin is a little dry I would think.

"I received a 14-day challenge sample and I'm so excited to try it for myself since I've read great reviews about Loreal Revitalift! The product smells so good and my husband loves giving me kisses everytime. It's a bit thick on the feel so I use a small amount only. I've seen my skin very plump, and lines were minimized! I'd definitely use this forever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the 14 day challenge. Love the way it feels, creamy and goes on so nice. Think might have seen tiny bit of improvement but only used for 14 days. Did buy it and am hoping to see it working in next couple of weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received RevitaLift as a free 14 day challenge sample. I have to say it is thick and stays on the skin. In the morning when I went to wash my face, I could still feel what I had applied the night before. It takes washing your face for the product to wear off. It provides a great barrier to the elements. Might not be idea if you have an oily face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product is a miracle! It works just perfect starting from the very first day. I had received a 14 day sample, the results are amazing. But I have noticed normally samples are better in quality than the actual product. I hope that is not the case with Revitalift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful moisturizer! Since I'm getting older, I was looking for an anti-aging moisturizer and was happy to receive the 14 day sample of L'Oréal Revitalift. It felt great on my skin and helps with the dryness. I even used some on my hands and they look better. I probably will purchase this soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried this product for about 7 days and I can see an improvement of my skin and it feels very soft and more radiant and it feels great ! Received sample packets for 14 days and gave it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14-days sample. Used it twice a day as instructed. It moisturized my skin well and had a lovely scent but a few days after I started using it, I noticed a couple of pimples. I continued to use it and did notice that my skin was more supple and hydrated. My face continued to break out in a few other areas of the face. If not for the pimples, it would have been a good moisturizer for me to use. Would not recommend for acne-prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a 2 week free sample. I am only one week into trying this product but I am fighting a runny nose and after using this product only twice the rough red flaky nose that goes with a runny nose was gone. It is very moisturizing and rich feeling to mu skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm almost thru the 14 day challenge and I will admit, I was skeptical. I applied half a packet at night and half a packet in the morning. I noticed my skin was softer and smoother the first morning. My skin feels so hydrated all day long without feeling greasy. I will definitely be buying this in the future. Thank you L'oreal!

"I had used a L'Oreal moisturizer, since I stated noticing some new age lines on my forehead and saw good results. So many varieties and products thought I was doing good. But The challenge really made me take notice! My throat, as well as my facial wrinkles are almost amazingly firmer and younger looking. Noticeably softer skin too! I'm hooked, At 61yr. young, my husband says I look 45! Best compliment EVER!! LOVE this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the ""Revitalift Challenge"" and saw absolutely no difference as before I started. Had I started using this in my twenties, maybe my skin would have been in better shape. But, being 47, I guess my skin is used to stronger prescription, and pricier department store products. This might be effective for younger ladies to slow down the aging process, but it is by no means a miracle cream for older ladies."
"I received the 14 day sample pack and began using it. If I apply it before makeup the foundation pills up so I switched to using it only at night. I do enjoy the feel of the cream and apply it along my jawline and neck where my skin is a bit dry. I used to use this product several years ago, and I think I will go back to it for use at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It makes my skin feel great but I have the same problem as somebody else: it kind of rolls off. I thought my skin was falling off until I realize it's only after I apply this. Also, fragrance way too strong for me. I can smell it for hours & it was making me sick so I had to stop using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just finished my 14 day challenge. I like the look and feel of this product and intend to purchase it. Since the sample said to use both day and night, I thought there was only one product but when I went to the store I discovered that there are 2 types, one for day and one for night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given the 14 day sample of the new triple power Revitalift. My skin feels very nice, and some lines gone, but didn't see much difference between original Revitalift and this new product. Think I will stick with the original (cheaper) and Loreal's under eye cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted so much to like this moisturizer but it just didn't work for me. It sat very heavily on my skin rather than sinking in and was pilling all over my face. On top of that, I noticed no improvement to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am participating in the #RevitaLiftChallange and have been using this moisturized for two weeks now. I love this product! My skin feels fresh, young, and vibrant. And that's only from using this product for these last two weeks. What a change! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'oreal sent me the 14/28 day challenge of Revitalift. I'm so glad they offered this. I must say it works great. The bags under my eyes were minimized. The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth seemed to just disappear. I'm so happy. Thankyou L'OREAL. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day sample and after a week I can really feel how smooth and soft my skin is. As an older lady (68) I appreciate a product that can moisturize my skin so well. A good product and I will most likely be purchasing it in the future . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product and within a week could see visible results!! My skin was firmer, softer and fresh looking!! I received so many compliments people actually thought I had work done!! I would recommend to everyone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day sample supply to try for two weeks and I have been using it every day and am almost finished. I'm sorry to say but to be completely honest, I don't like the product at all. It didn't do much of anything but moisturize my face a little. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this. Revitalift is like a multi moisturizer. Ive used it the 14 days and there is a very noticable lift & firmness to my skin. my eye wrinkles are completely gone. I have to have more! Save your money & buy this instead of La Mer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved a 14 day sample of Renew and am so excited with my results! I love the hydrating feel of the silky soft lotion. My favorite part is i dont see my dark circles as much when i use Renew. That right there makes it all worth it. That and a tighter more youthful face makes for a happy me! Thanks a ton for my sample!
Even though I just started 8 days ago my skin looks moister. I'm 74 so I can see it smooths my fine lines and gives my skin kind of a glow. Can't wait till I'm further along with the challenge but so far it's working for my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was sent samples for the 14 day challenge. I liked the way it made my skin feel after using the product. It did seem to get rid of some of the fine lines & wrinkles on my face. Ty for allowing me to be a part of this challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I ordered a free two week sample and am very pleased with the results. I have very sensitive skin and was skeptical. The first 3 days my face broke out but after that all was ok. After two weeks of using twice a day I can clearly see an improvement in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I took the 14 day Revitalift challenge ......this moisturizer is one if the best....goes on silky smooth. Used for 14 days and after 2 days you can actually see the difference....the lines/wrinkles you can see diminish .......Will be using this product.........love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took part in the RevitaLift challenge and couldn't have been more happy. First of all, I loved the scent of it; very fresh but not overpowering. Also, a little bit goes a long way so it would definitely be a good value to purchase. It made my skin feel so soft and hydrated, and didn't make me breakout which sometimes happens with heavier face creams. Overall, I just loved it! Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a miracle lotion! I have “rosy” cheeks, I've had them for years! I couldn't believe the moisturizer has help lighten the redness in my face! This makes me extremely happy, as I've Been trying for years to do this! Also fine lines have started to disappear! All I can say is Thank You! Will definitely buy this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely LOVE L'Oreal products and have used them for more years than I care to admit. Unfortunately, I don't feel like this product was any different than others I've tried. Was really hoping to find L'Oreal's next best thing to brag about. Sorry, can't do it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was able to do a 14 day free sample test, but to be honest I have been using another Revlon product before the test. I love this one! What I love is I do my free greasy like some other types out there. Makes my skin feel great and don't have the greasy feeling going to bed or adding make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first time I used this, I could feel the difference in my face. The second time I used it, I started to see a difference. It's never made my face oily which is a first for me when it comes to products like this. I can actually say I have a moisturizer I love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used L'Oréal Skin care products for years and didn't notice much of a difference between RevitaLift and previous lines, like Youth Code. I've received compliments for years regarding my flawless skin, so L'Oréal has definitely been good for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have just completed the 14 day challenge and I do love the product. However, only as a night cream. I found that when I applied it in the morning followed by the loreal visible lift blur foundation, I did not get a nice coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day supply and used all of it. It did leave my skin soft. It claims to firm, but I didn't notice any difference. It might need to be used for a longer period of time. My skin seemed hydrated all day and night until I washed it off. I'm not sure if any of it absorbed into my skin, or just stayed on the surface. There seemed to be quite a lot on my face when I washed it off. Overall, I would recommend it for making my skin softer and keeping it moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I participated in the Revitalift Challenge and I am so glad I did! I love L'Oreal and this product is great! The texture of my skin is smoother and firmer since using it. It has a pleasant yet not overwhelming fragrance. I had no issues wearing it under makeup as some did. It wore great! My face seems radiant and this product also moisturized my skin just right. I love it and will be purchasing it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is perfect for the cooler weather, and I discovered a little goes a long way. It's rich without being greasy, and absorbed very quickly. My skin definitely felt smoother and firmer after a few days. I'm very glad I discovered it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day samples while on vacation so didn't start it till I got home. I loved the fact that you didn't have to use much, spread very well, I am not sure it made me look any younger but it worked well. The real test will be this winter, I live in northern Michigan and get extremely dry skin, will try a container of it and decide if it is worth continuing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day samples. Tried it out and before finishing using the samples I head to the store and purchase it. I used it to re-firm my skin and I also use the RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser
It gently exfoliates and nourishes my skin. I used it on ny face and shoulders and love how smooth my skin feels [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have doing the 14 day challange with this moisturizer with great results !! I am 54 years old and this product has definitly smoothed the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles!! Especially my forehead and around my eye! I would recommend it to everyone! I am def going to buy this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Honestly I thought this product was heavy for my face and used it on my neck and above the boobies. There was no information whether or not this was for all skin types (I'm combination) or if it was oil free (which I doubted). The scent also turned me off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this cream as part of 14 days challenge. It makes my skin smooth, soft and hydrated full day. I feel that my skin has improved texture now. But the cream has thick consistency and it takes times to assimilate into my skin so it is bit heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the challenge and found my skin's texture more refined. Wrinkles a little more refined but not much...the best is that my skin seems clearer. My breakouts have almost cleared up. For this reason I have purchased a jar. I believe this is a good product. I am 70 yrs. young and this seems to brighten my appreance. Glad I took the challenge!
I have been using revitalift triple strength for 3 weeks now and absolutely love it. I literally started to see a smoothing of the fine lines around my eyes within the first week and my skin just looked brighter and healthier. I love this day cream! Think I might just have to try the night cream now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received this as an incentive 14 day challenge. It smelled lovely and soaked in rapidly, unfortunately I have hypersensitive skin and it burned within seconds. I gave it to my sister and she raved about the feel of her skin after using it. So use caution if testing it on reactive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried a trial sample for 14 days. I was amazed to see positive results after the very first day - I have very fair, light skin, and some redness and spots that are due to sun exposure and aging. RevitaLift evened out my skin tone, lessened the redness and smoothed away lines. I will be buying a full size jar and using regularly!"
"I received these samples of revitalift from L'Oréal to test. I use this moisturizer already. I love it! It has a nice consistency, it goes on smooth and has a nice smell and makes my skin look very nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This really is a great product. My skin is in pretty good condition and I noticed a difference in just a few days so I can imagine those who are older or in need of it more will have drastic results from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used RevitaLift each and every day for two weeks and I've got to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with my skin. I've had zero acne, zero dry patches and my skin felt plump from the very first day. The price point is solid for the positive results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this for the 14 day revitalift challenge, it's such a great moisturizer. I felt my skin was so much smoother and hydrated, and the cream formula is perfect for the changing seasons. I would love to switch, but the smell is so strong it gave me headache a few times and didn't wear off easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have used it for 9 days now. I feel as though my skin is more moist. I like the smell, and it doesn't irritate my eyes. Not much difference in the wrinkles, but maybe after months of use it would look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have normal to combination skin and I normally switch up my moisturizer twice a year. RevitalLift goes smoothly on my skin although in the day time, I personally find it hard to layer up. I saw minor peels when I applied my spf blur primer. After two weeks, I saw my acne marks lighten up too. So, that's a great plus. I don't wear a lot of makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day Revitalift challenge and used the product day and night as recommended. After about a week of using the product I could see a difference in my skin, it was tighter and I was noticing the removal of dead skin cells. I will continue to use this product. Thanks L'Oreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this and it works great! It smells nice, not greasy and absorbs into my skin. I have been applying it in the am and pm. What a difference it makes! My skin is softer and blends well with my sunscreen and finish powder. I love it. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample, I used a small packet day and night for 14 days. I usually skip moisturizer as I am very forgetful and rushed in the morning but I figured I would give loreal revitalift a shot and boy am I glad I did. This product made my skin soft and healthy looking in only a few days. My dryness and redness in my cheeks disappeared and my skin looked younger as well. I plan on using this in my daily routine from now on [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my 14 day sample in the mail. 1st of all I thought that it was an excellent size sample to try.I tried it for the 14 days and went to the store to purchase it on day 15. I love the results! Makes me wish I had taken before and after pictures. My skin is noticeably smoother and softer. At 54 that's a big deal to me. I will be continuing to use this product for a long time I'm sure. Nice to be occasionally mistaken for mom when I'm grandma. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first try, I loved the product. Felt smooth on the face. A little heavy for my preference. After a day or so, makeup was not able to stay on all day after using this product. I even tried less product and only at night but makeup would slough off like puty in my hand. Will be trying the serum to see if that works better for me. Wish they had samples of the serum to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Initially I was impressed how well my skin felt after just one day. I have tried so many facial moisturizers but this one is hands down the best I have used to date. Fine wrinkles are less noticeable and my make up does on so much smoother. I felt like my skin once again has a glow to it. It did not cause any breakouts. I also like the fact that it can be used a.m. and p.m. Love it!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The challenge popped up in my email, I figured why not. I have to say this is the best product I have tried. I use another brand(very expensive) and doesn't go as far. I believe this is better and affordable. I have very deep wrinkles and this product makes them a little less noticeable which in turn makes me feel better and I thank you . I will continue to buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got my sample 2 weeks ago. I definitely did not think it would work but it does. It truly does. My face is so soft and it doesn't feel greasy at all like with other brands. It has a great fragrance I am much in love with this product. I know what I am getting for Christmas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A nice, rich cream that is not too heavy to use in the morning before applying makeup. I would give it a few minutes to settle into your skin before starting to use foundation. It helped make my foundation go on more smoothly that way. And my advice to all out there is stay out of the sun! All the lovely creams in the world will not help if you are tanning yourself into leather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a free sample with 14 little packets for the 2 week Revitalift Challenge. Today I used the last of my product and to be honest, it made my face look wonderful!! My face is softer, glowing and much more moisturized! I will definitely be buying the full sized container. Thank you L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm torn on how I feel about Revitalift. I found that the sample I received offered soft skin but didn't seem to soften facial lines as much as other users stated. And it doesn't soak into the skin. If you don't wash your face between uses it cakes up. I'll finish using my samples and see how I feel then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this to do the Revitalift 14 day trial and I can say I truly loved it! It gave enough moisture to my face and it didn't dry out my skin. It also gave a really nice glow.

"I had been using this product for about a week, and a coworker asked me if I had been using a new makeup, that I was looking younger. Except I had on no makeup! I said, really?

Received this free for the 14 day challenge & It was amazing used it when I woke up and before heading to bed. It was very moisturizing the formula was very thick but perfect for my dry skin.

"So I received the 14 day samples in the mail for the challenge, I was excited to see if I in fact would see results similar to those of other women who have reviewed the product, but I didn't.

I did notice that once I applied the moisturizer if I didn't let it set before I applied my makeup it had a flaking effect. I didn't notice any difference with my fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely loved this. It feels so smooth and creamy going on. Hours later my face still feels smooth and like it is just applied. I was more impressed with the quality of this product than some of the more expensive products I've been using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Revitalift challenge and I will say it has made my skin very soft and I can tell hydrated. Did it make me look younger, um, no. If anything during the past 14 days, I realized I am getting jowls. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for 1 week and already see a noticeable change! The product is a little heavy and I have had a couple of breakouts but will continue to use, slightly decreasing the amount especially during the day when I wear under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got free samples of product. It's good cream, nice hidratation, smooth. I didn't notice less wrinkles, but I'm happy with product, that I'll buy full size. Then I'll see after longer time results at skin. Thanks for samples! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried it for 2 weeks and definitely saw a difference in how smooth and moisturized my skin felt (as compared to using no facial moisturizer). I've got fairly sensitive skin, yet I was able tolerate this product very well. My only hitch was the scent. I'm sensitive to perfumes and synthetic fragrances, and while this product smelled pleasant, I was wishing it could have been more subtle, or better yet fragrance free.

I just finished my fourteen day challenge and my skin really does feel wonderful. Before I started using the Revitalift moisturizer my skin was dry and dull. In just two weeks my skin is firmer and feels much healthier. I would absolutely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was part of The Revitalift 14 day challenge. This is my new favorite face cream! I could not believe how it transformed my skin. I could see a significant difference in my skin's texture and skin tone. The tiny wrinkles around my eyes and, the big one between my brows have evened out, some are gone. My skin looks plump and fresh. Then there is the price..buy it, you'll love it! I sure do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I. took the Revitalift challenge, I was very impressed at how soft it makes your skin feel. Luckily I don't have many wrinkles but I was pleased with the results I did get! I only wish this would have had more instructions (I would have liked to try it under my eyes, but wasn't sure that would be a good idea) - I have puffiness under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product. My skin looks visibly younger an more even toned. Love the fact that its not greasy and blends well into the skin. My skin feels soft and looks brighter. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream leaves your skin feeling incredibly smooth and hydrated. You can visibly notice your skin getting hydrated and healthy. I love that it's so lightweight that you can wear it under makeup without feeling like your pores are clogged. My only dislike and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the scent. It smells amazing, but my allergies get triggered very easily and this did not pass my test. The scent lingered and did not fade causing me lots of sniffs! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. My skin is smoother now. Can't tell that it did much in the re-firming the skin, but then I am 73 years old, so it would take a lot to make my skin firm again. I still have wrinkles but they are not as deep and my face feels and looks a lot better. I really do like this product and have purchased the night cream also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day trial packets. Definitely heavier moisturizer than what I normally use. I am 58 and did not see any difference in lines or wrinkles. Skin did feel more moisturizer. As with other Loreal products, too heavily perfumed. Prefer scent free facial products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the sample Packets and used it night and day as directions indicated. I loved it on days I didn't wear makeup but didn't like wearing the moisturizer under makeup. it caused the makeup to not look as fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The received a sample and used it for 14 days, I could see and feel a real difference so I'm going to continue to use it and see how much more I will see and feel. I am so excited, I cannot believe the difference in such a small amount of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really very happy with the noticeable difference in texture of my skin after just a few days! Didn't expect anything to really happen but when you feel a change this quickly you are encouraged to continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my 14 day challenge samples from Loreal, and was very skeptical at first. But, after day three I was able to see an amazing difference in my neck and chest area. My skin was like crepe paper in those areas, but is now visibly smoother and hydrated. My face feels silkier and lines have diminished. This is a truly remarkable product, and I already bought a jar since I used last sample yesterday. Thank you Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the 14 day challenge. Although I did not use this twice a day for the entire challenge because it's a little heavily then I would normally use. it has definitely made a difference In my complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I took the Revitalift Triple Power 14 day challenge and I am so happy I did. My skin looks and feels wonderful! I don't know what they put in it but my face has cleared up from having adult acne at least 95%. I was so happy with it I went out and bought some. It's a miracle. Thanks L'oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day sample and found this cream to be very good and worked well on my skin. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. Worked well on my fine lines and dry skin....I am very pleased with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using the 14 day trial of Revitalift, I feel like my face is much softer and brighter. I plan to continue use of this even though at 77, I do not expect it to remove the wrinkles and lines of years of living. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This works great if you have really dry skin,but what I did not like was 2 things.. First,it left a greasy residue behind and made me look and feel oily,and it also balls up on my skin and comes off in little pieces. Not sure what caused this for me,but it has never happened before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free 14 day sample that I used every morning and every evening. Although my skin type is normal, the thickness of the moisturizer felt good and surprisingly, I didn't break out. Unfortunately, I didn't see results like many stated they did. I took before and after photos and didn't see a difference. I do like the product, though, and felt like long term it'll be good for an aging facew. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the 14 day challenge, night and day. I must be honest and say that I really haven't noticed a difference. I do not have extreme wrinkles, but do have some fine lines around eyes and laugh lines around mouth. I don't feel there was a noticeable difference. I'm disappointed, as I had hoped for better. Always good to moisturize, but for wrinkle reducer or skin tone/firming, I don't think this is the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a very dry skin that needs a lot of moisturizing and RevitaLift does an excellent job to achieve this. It goes on my face very smoothly. It feels rich, but not greasy. After using it for 2 weeks my skin looks healthy and happy. Overall - an excellent product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the fourteen days challenge and I must say when I started spreading the Revitalif Moisturizer I thought it was going to feel heavy on my skin but surprisingly the moisturizer absorbed really well on my skin, I can't feel it, it's just perfect and leaves my face ready to apply foundation. My face feels nice and most of my fine wrinkles have disappeared just after two weeks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the challenge and could not go past day 3 as this made me really break out! I wish I could use it but the cream is very heavy and just too heavy for me! I may try to use just around the eye area because it does feel good on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the Revitalift samples sent to me, for 14 days. I noticed a difference after"
"a few days of use. My skin was softer, less dry, and fine lines were less visible. This is an another excellent product made by L'Oreal. I would recommend Revitalift for women want a definite improvement in their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Even at my age(over 65) I could see results. My skin felt hydrated and firmer. Surface lines melted away. I have combination skin so was careful to avoid the ""T"" zone when applied.Will continue using after sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the way this makes my skin feel. I also like the way my make-up goes on after II put this on my face and then a little primer over top of it. I am definitely going to use this product and watch the results over the next several months.
I received a 14 day trial and I loved the moisturizer. Maybe it was wishful thinking but I think my skin looked plumper. I am 59 years old and trying to keep my youthful look. I sure wish the price was cheaper because I would use the whole family of Loreal from face wash to Makeup. Thank you for the trial of your product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is smoother and brighter. All the wrinkles are still there, but I am 70 after all!"
"It seems to be a good, light moisturizer for nighttime. I don't like it for day because no matter what brand of (liquid/cream) base makeup I use the Revitalift turns the makeup into little balls that have to be brushed off. Then I have to add another type of moisturizer to help smooth everything out again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the 14 day Revitalift challenge and can feel the difference every day. As for repairing wrinkles and fine lines, I havent seen any improvement. But my face feels great and much smoother every day, so it is likely to prevent further damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the 14 day challenge. I love how it gives me moisture without being greasy. A little goes a long way. I have dry skin and usually use a heavy cream. My face seems softer. I'm 54 and did not notice any change in the wrinkles but that may be because I was already working on them with other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I agree. My skin felt was absolutely softer and firmer as well. It's amazing how little is needed per application to see these results. Thank you, L'Oreal, for an affordable, effective moisturizer with benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Tried the 14 day challenge and am glad I did. It went on smoothly and kept my face moister looking during the day and was a great night cream enabling me to wake up to very smooth skin that was not so dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used my 14 day sample & was fairly pleased with the results. The product absorbed in my skin quickly & didn't leave any stickiness. My jaw line looks & feels firmer. The only drawback is (& in my opinion a huge drawback ) no SPF protection. I want sunscreen included in my day cream. Every day I use a serum, eye cream & day cream. I don't want to add another product to my morning routine. Include the SPF in the product & I'd give it 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received the 14 day Revitalift Challenge. The product is thick and creamy and goes on well. Did not break me out which is always a concern for me. Made my skin feel moisturized and noticed fine lines decrease and skin more plump. Would love the product to have a sunscreen for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Seems to help wrinkles, but can only use on my forehead (where I don't put any makeup). When I applied to my full face and then tried to put makeup on- the moisturizer pilled up and I had little balls flaking off my face. I have to use other moisturizer all over for where I wear makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt a wonderful difference in my skin from using this twice a day. I am impressed that it is affordable skin care that show results. Nice fragrance, not greasy. I can wear under make up. Revitalift is an excellent product that I will continue to use as part of my daily skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used Revitalift faithfully, every night for 14 days. It's quite heavy, and has a pleasant fragrance. It is very moisturizing. After washing my face after waking up in the morning, I could still feel it. I noticed no noticeable reduction of lines, or increase of firmness of my complexion. It was fine, but not a lot different than the night cream I'm currently using (that costs less). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is truly amazing. Within a couple of days of using this product my boyfriend told me I looked younger. I suffer from combination skin and some redness. After using this product my skin glows. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have just finished my 14 day Revitalift challenge. It was silky smooth when i put it on. I loved the way it just went into my skin. I didn't think i needed as much on my face as the sample gave to use during the day and night so i also used it on my chest and I think it helped with that also. I liked this product and hope you don't stop making it. It is a winner in my book! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the free 14 day trial and used it morning and evening. The first morning I woke up after using it the night before, my face felt quite greasy/oily, like it was just sitting on my skin. I tried using much less if the product next time and It did seem to absorb better. I'd say my skin is soft, maybe a bit firmer now. I don't see much change in fine lines and no noticeable difference in visible pores. Overall I'd say it was a good moisturizer though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer. It feels really great on my skin. It is smooth and has a pleasant scent. I usually buy Lancôme Renergie, but this appears to be just as good but much less expensive. Still waiting on that fountain of youth, though. ;-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a weeks sample and I am so glad that I did. My face was dry and flaky and when I used RevitaLift it relieved the dryness and flakes without making my face too greasy. I would purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received my 14 day Challenge supply and started using right away. I'm really picky when it comes to what I put on my face. I've preferred lower cost products over higher cost ones because of the ""feel"". I do not like a heavy feeling cream. Revitalift feels very good and I've noticed an improvement in wrinkle lines and puffiness. I am now retired and the cost is higher but will buy it as I can afford to do so.

"Hello. My name is Marci. I took the RevitaLift challenge and left with great and noticeable results. I love how it makes my skin feel, so soft and moisturized. I am a believer and now a user. Loreal you have proven yourself to me and to my sisters. I would love free samples mailed to me anytime. I just got laid off and money is tight. Thank you very much [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After completing the free 2 week trial, I was trying to determine if there was a significant change in the fine lines on my face. I thought I noticed an improvement but when you look at your own face everyday, it's hard to tell. Then I had a women ask me what I used on my face because I looked so young and had no wrinkles. Well, I'm 53 and NOBODY has ever told me my skin looked good so I guess I have to believe that this product made a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had received a few samples of the moisturizer and have been applying the product for a few days now . . . once in the morning and once at bedtime. My skin feels very smooth and hydrated now ! It also seems to feel a little firmer ! I really love what it has already done, so I have gone out to purchased a full size. I am looking forward to seeing future improvements with my continued use !

Took the 14 day challenge. Noticed softer skin immediately after applying. I wasn't a fan of how thick the cream was though. Unfortunately some of my wrinkles were to deep already to have a noticeable effect on them. But I loved how my face felt [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I finished the 14 day challenge and my face feels so soft and moisturized. I have very dry skin and usually have a hard time finding a moisturizer that will work for me. I will definitely be purchasing this product and I would like to try the other products in the line, as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in the process of using the free samples mailed to me. I like the product - the ease with which it smooths over my face & neck. Upon occasion I have felt a burning sensation around my eye sockets & on my lids after I have applied it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't finished my 14 day challenge yet because I can't apply it every day. I have to apply it every other day or even wait 2 days in between because it is clogging my pores. I do feel like my skin is softer, but I'm not seeing any ""lift"" or tightening of skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before the 14 day challenge ended, I purchased the full size jar. Very pleased with reduction in wrinkles and age spots as well as improvement in firmness along jaw and neckline. It's an excellent makeup base too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 14 day challenge with Revitalift and was so impressed! My skin is visibly smoother, softer and younger looking - no joke! I will be purchasing my own jar of Revitalift because I am so impressed with results! I have never seen such results with a face cream. The scent is great, it doesn't leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy. I definitely recommend this and it is affordable too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am trying the samples I was sent I have found that they don't break me out (which I am VERY thankful for because so many things do) They make my skin look much better and I feel they have firmed it up (yay as I was see a little bit of a double chin; boo) I am definitely planning on purchasing the product when the samples are gone. Great job on this one.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just finished the 14-day challenge. My skin feels smoother and softer, and the lines/wrinkles on my forehead are much less noticeable! That right there is what sold me, because I haven't seen such dramatic results with other moisturizers I have tried in the past couple of years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received RevitaLift as a sample and love how soft it felt on my skin. However, I have very sensitive skin and it was to harsh for a couple of spots on my face. I would have given this 5 stars but unfortunately it was not right for my skin. If your skin is not as sensitive as mine, I think this would be a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day trail pack & decided to follow through with it. This moisturizer does what it says! My only problem with it is the fragrance. I would prefer none. That is the only reason for the 4 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day sample. The first 2 days I didn't like it. The smell was too strong and it rolled off my face like lint. I figured what the heck I'll keep trying. Then today day 6 I noticed the small dark spot on my cheek was much lighter and my skin was smoother. That's it I'm sold. I am buying the full size. So if you don't like it at first don't give up. Keep going . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 2 week sample of this and was amazed at the results! From day one I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin, it felt softer and smoother. Each day I noticed the wrinkles softening on my neck and face more and more, especially on my forehead where I was most unhappy with the lines I'd been noticing lately. I'm very impressed with the results and I've already ordered a full size bottle because I love this stuff so much I do NOT want to run out of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the revitalift challenge sample and I just had to leave an early review. I'm only on day THREE and in LOVE! My skin is so hydrated and soft. I can clearly see a difference and I'm excited to see what is to come in the next few days. I can't say thank you enough! I'll be purchasing this soon.

"I am on day 8 of the 14 day sample test. I am not seeing any significant results from what I was already using. What I do like is the simplicity of having one cream for everything. My regular regime includes face, then eye cream and neck/decollete lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 14 day sample to try at home. It is a great moisturizer and my skin always felt soft. I didn't care for the scent very much and didn't really notice any changes in my skin. I might decide to buy it once my other moisturizer runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only been using this product for 9 days and i see a very big difference in the laugh lines and sagginess at the jawline. My skin is so soft and much smoother. i will definately be continuing use of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I took the 14-day challenge and this is a good moisturizer. Did notice a difference wrinkles are smoother. It's not a miracle worker; but it is affordable and does better than some of the really expensive moisturizers. I will continue to use it and encourage people to try it.

"So i got the 14 day sample pack aka #RevitaliftChallenge and i do notice a difference in my face! This moisturizer goes a long way with just a little bit. My skin feels firmer, looks brighter and stays hydrated all day. It blends perfectly with my makeup as well and smells wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried via 14-day challenge. Skin felt super moisturized, but didn't notice any reduction in fine lines. I thought it was a bit thick. I had to spend more time than I liked rubbing it in. I normally breakout after trying new products, but so far I have not. I did feel a very slight stinging after applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using it at night, after applying tretinoin cream. I have noticed that my skin is more hydrated and less flaky. The only con I can think of is the strong fragrance in this moisturizer - I wish it was 50% less strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the 14 day sample. It went on smoothly, felt great on my skin. Absorbed quickly, didn't feel greasy. I like how soft my skin feels and looks, even around my eyes. I already use L'Oreal products, but I will add this one to them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I did the challenge and was actually pretty upset with the results. It leaves my sister get soft and hydrated and hopefully it will also help with the fine k. My mother in law and sister did it too and also like the outcome so far. I would definately buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying the samples, I knew I had to purchase. It works better than some of my high end products and is way less expensive. It made my skin smoother, more firm, and younger looking after one week of use. I am extremely happy with this and so glad I took the #revitaliftchallenge [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I gave the samples to my mom at her age you could start noticing fine lines . I started to see that she had a younger looking skin and fine lines seemed to disappear. She felt her skin feeling hydrated and smoother. I love it I'm definitely buying it for her !

"Though it's not the miracle in a jar that I always hope to find, it was better then most products I've tried.

"Love the way it goes on. Not greasy at all. I did notice some smoothing, but nothing major. I reallly didn't expect a lot.

"I am so in love with this product! #L'Oreal's Revitalift Moisturizer is the BEST! I #gotitfree as a 14 day trial in the mail and used it right away! It instantly went along perfectly with my daily skincare routine! It smells wonderful, made my skin soft, youthful and helped make disappear those awful fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and smile/frown lines. Thanks so much #L'Oreal! I will def be buying more of this product once my #samples run out! Highly recommend 100%!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is amazing. I am 66 years young, and my skin was starting to look sort of droopy. The second day I used it,I could definitely see a difference. I wish I had a photo, but I can tell you that I look so much better and it has only been a week.Prepare to be amazed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how L'Oreal Revitalift makes my face feel! My skin is very soft and smooth. I haven't noticed any change to fine lines, as promised by the product, but I still like the softer results. Fortunately, the scent doesn't linger long, because I dislike the overpowering perfume. I was worried that the strong fragrance would irritate my sensitive skin, but so far I haven't had any problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my sample and did the 14 day challenge. I loved that it wasn't so greasy and thick. My face felt smoother and softer. I could tell the difference in a couple days. I definitely would recommend this product and would purchase this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing I noticed when I applied RevitaLift was how smooth & creamy it was. I love the gentle fragrance. It made my skin feel wonderful, immediately. The results to my fine wrinkles progressed with daily use and my skin felt firmer. I really appreciated this opportunity to test this product. I will gladly continue to purchase LOreal RevitaLift . It is a staple in my cosmetics cabinet. . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the 14 day challenge and was very pleased. The fine wrinkles around my eyes were less noticeable. My skin was tighter with a more youthful shine. I am almost 66 and people think I look much younger. I have been a L'Oreal user for years. This is another great product now provided! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am not quiet through all my samples yet but I wanted to write and say how I love the creamy feeling my face feels when I put this cream on daily. I don't have a lot of wrinkles on my face but you do feel a youthful feeling when you put the cream on. I also have some dark spots on my face but I haven't noticed them fading much but the product doesn't really say that it fades them either. As a moisturizer i would very much recommend this product.

"Received my 14 day challenge ! Great full to receive it ! I do love the feeling , very smooth , but a little on the heavy side , I can get two days out of one ! I do like how when I sweat it doesn't run into my eyes and burn . It has a good fragrance, I'm happy with this cream ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal provided me a 14-day sample. I used it day and night and after just one day my skin felt softer and fresher. I have very dry skin and felt like I finally had a moisturizer that gave me 24 hour hydration. My only complaint would be the slight scent; I'd prefer it be unscented, but it would not deter me from purchasing the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my sample a week ago and started using it the next day. I immediately liked the thickness and smoothness of the cream. Since I have dry skin, I normally would use a serum, eye cream and mosturizer twice daily. I used only the sample for 7 days. My skin is softer, clearer, and less dry than it has been in years.

I received my 14 day trial and I'm on day 8 and not only have I seen a difference but my friends have too! They asked if I was doing something different and I told what I'm using. Can't wait to use some of the other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given a 2 week trial of the Revitalift Moisturizer. I can honestly say: I'm sold. It moisturizes without making my skin greasy. It made my skin soft. My skin felt tighter and my wrinkles weren't as prominent. I went out and purchased immediately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My life, at age 64, can be hectic. I know I should use a moisturizer on my face twice a day, but honestly there were days when I only used RevitaLift once, instead of the twice daily recommendation. And yet I quickly saw results. And I can really feel the difference!! My skin is so soft now - I keep touching my face to see if it really is that soft. And yes - it is really that soft! I love this product! It works! Thank you Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the samples for 10 days. I found that my skin was firmer expecially around the eyes. The cream was creamy but I found it a little too thick to apply without my skin being pulled so I we my finger tips and then smooth it on. I wish it came in unscented since I have allergies and didn't like the over powering scent. But I would definitely buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't have deep wrinkles but I am starting to get a few lines on my forehead. After 3 weeks of using this product I can't say that the lines have been minimized but they're light to begin with. I do notice that my skin has an overall smoother feel to it. The formula is quite thick and goes on really nicely and I had no issues with breakouts while using it. I would recommend trying it.

"I received my samples about 1 week ago. Let me just say how pleasantly surprised I am by the visible differences in my skin. My complexion is much brighter, and age spots and fine lines are quite visibly reduced. This is my new go to moisturizer and I'm telling all my friends about it."
I have been using RevitaLift through a 14 day challenge. I am so impressed. My skin is smoother and softer then before. I have been very impressed with how light this moisturizer is. I will be buying this in the future so I can continue to keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product produced a smooth, soft gleam on my face and neck. I found the product to be heavy. I used the product before applying makeup. More often than not, my crayon eyeliner would not draw the line above the eyelashes that I was familiar with. The revitalift smoothed out the contours and lines around my eyes but I found applying makeup after the revitalift did not work for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the revitalist challenge. I like the feel of the moisturizer but the heavy framgrance was a bit overwhelming for me. I have oily skin and using this product twice a day was to much for me personally. I did like it for my hands though! They're prone to cracking in the colder months and the thickness of the creme was lovely for that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I gave the samples from the challange to my mum and she said that after just a few days she could feel such a difference in the texture and fine lines on her face. She is going to buy the full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was fortunate to be able to try this product for 14 day and have to admit I liked it so much I purchased it and continue to use it. I've been lucky to have smooth, unlined skin at 62 and want to keep it that way as long as I can. The results I have had with this product makes me believe that using it will keep my skin youthful and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I participated in the 14 day challenge. I suffer from very dry skin and struggle to keep my skin moisturized all day. I used the samples with a moisturizer that I bought and didn't work very well. The two combined worked fantastic. If you have issues with dry skin try this with something that didn't work before and you might have a homerun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had the opportunity to participate in the 14 day RevitaLift challenge. For some reason, the change of seasons to Fall and Winter dry my skin out overnight. This cream was rich and thick and I noticed softer skin by the second day! I only needed a very small amount, applied day and night, to maintain the softness! Would very much consider making this my go-to moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the RevitaLift 14-day challenge and was pleased with how moisturizing and rich the cream is. Application is easy as the cream glides onto the skin with a silky feel. It made my skin feel hydrated and left my skin glowing. I didn't notice a difference in the appearance of wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given the 14 trial samples. How soft my face is now! The only thing I didn't see a difference in was fine lines; didn't really fade or disappear. Best thing...my face hasn't ever been this soft. This was also great on my eye lids; they dry out and cause issues. I'm grateful for the opportunity! Thanks!
"I received a 14 day sample to try. I saw a change in my skin after 5 days, especially on my throat. This is the first time I have tried a product that results stated was true. This product works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream feels so luxurious! I used this at night and it made my face feel really smooth for the entire day! However, it didn't provide that much moisture and I haven't noticed a difference in the appearance of my wrinkles yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried Loreal Revitalift as part of the Challenge for better skin. It is non greasy and it has my skin firmer and my skin tone is much brighter. I am very impressed with this product and I will replace my current anti-aging moisturizer with Loreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the 14 day challenge and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! First, a little goes a long way. Secondly, I actually did see some results- mostly during the day, a nice glow all day even through my foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loreal RevitaLift is one incredible moisturizer! My skin is softer, has less fine wrinkles and the pigment spots have faded. I can not believe how smooth my face feels. My makeup goes on beautifully. I will continue to buy this product. Great value! I got it as a free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free 14 day sample packet. The product is awesome! My skin is silky and feels firmer. The only down side for me is the smell, it is too strong and sort of perfume like to me, I am sensitive to smells. If Loreal can make this product without the particular smell I will definitely buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the Revitalift Challenge and after 14 days i have got to say that my skin has really improved. My fine lines between my eyebrows have faded and my skin glows. I have always looked young, but I'm almost 30 so it is starting to show. I really feel like I look young now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a two week trial. It left my skin very soft and moisturized. However, I did not notice a difference in my pores or wrinkles. It's really just a nice basic moisturizer. I would recommend for people without wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thank you so very much for allowing me to 'test' Revitalift. In a very short time, I saw visible results. Your product absorbed quickly, with results in 2-3 days. I will, indeed, be purchasing Revitalift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved using this product, I could actually see a difference in my skin. The wrinkles on my cheeks were diminished. Unfortunately I had to quit the ""challenge"" because I was getting whiteheads from the cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample and overall, it isn't a bad product. Light fragrance, goes on beautifully but for me it felt too thick and a bit greasy on my already oily skin, and sadly...I broke out on my forehead and cheeks. I would recommend it but I would have to mention my personal experience as well just in case someone has similar skin. Love L'Oreal and their products, but this one isn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got to try it as part of challenge and Happy I did it was great overall feel is awsome a bit hard to apply so here is the trick do it right after you shower it keeps skin looking good and has nice healthy glow.Loreal should go easy on the scent though but over all I was happy with product and wanted to continue to use it thanks L'Oréal for sending my sample so quick! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got samples in the mail & I am on day 6. I started with a few blemishes on my chin & it has helped on clearing them up. They are almost gone! It has made my face feel softer & smoother. So far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14-day sample. My skin appears smoother and soft after 4 days of use. It did cause a bit of acne - so younger in two ways. Smells pleasant. My only concern is when I use at night before bed, it burns my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the samples which I used twice a day for 2 weeks, and liked the results enough that I bought a jar today. You need a very small amount to smooth on your face and neck (I finish by rubbing it on my hands), and it makes a lovely smooth finish to put your foundation over. I believe I see fine lines receding as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I disclose I received free product to facilitate testing, however comments here are my own. In just the first 14 days, Revitalift has made a visible difference in my skin. I look forward to continue to moisturize with this hydrating product morning and night to hopefully take even more years off my Baby Boomer face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received asample of this product to try. It had a strong fragrance when I put it on. I was afraid that I would be allergic to the fragrance because I am allergic to many scents. However, the scent quickly dissipated and I was not allergic to it."
The moisturizing aspect of it was really wonderful. I usually have dry skin around my nose but this took care of the situation and left my face moist but not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this in the 14 day trial. Since I just received it Saturday, I've only used it 4 days, but I'm very pleased with the way it makes my dry skin feel! It is a little heavy but I think my skin must need that because it absorbs very well. I'll definitely be purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Revitalift is a very good moisturizer. It left my skin feeling and looking hydrated all day without being too heavy and without being greasy. I liked that it had a very mild fragrance. My skin looked smooth and supple. My forehead lines are still there, but no moisterizer has ever eliminated them. Thank you for letting me participate in the trial"
"I tried this product when I was sent samples. I did love the smell, and thickness of the cream when I applied it. It felt good on my skin, but unfortunately I could not tell a difference in the lines on my face. Also after pricing the product, it is too pricey for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for a 15 day trial. I used the product as instructed and enjoyed the smell and feel of the cream. It makes my skin feel great! Not oily. I started noticing my neck wrinkles are less apparent than before using the product. I also used it on my face and ear lobes. I like the product and will purchase it soon. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm On My 13th Day Free Sample.I Have Laugh Lines Along Both Sides Of My Nose,I See Some Decreation After 13 Days,Maybe I Need Another 14 Days Of Appling A.M And P.M. To Really See A Difference. ( I'm African American) I'll Definitely Make A Purchase In The Future. Thank You. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the samples for 14 days and have the most improvement on my skin ever! This is so fantastic and feels so wonderful. It works almost immediately and you can feel positive lift every day that you apply it. I have already bought a full size container so I may continue to use this every morning and every night. Thank you L'Oreal for a fabulous moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I still have a few days left on my challenge as my samples go here after most started. I am seeing definite results to my neck I am a huge fan of L'Oreal products and this product is a perfect example why. Thank you for the opportunity to try your skincare product.

"I love that Revitalift totally smoothed into my skin without leaving any kind of residue feeling. My skin was seriously dull, lifeless and just generally in bad shape. I am very happy with the feel and look of my skin after only a week. I am going to make Revitalift a part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was part of the 14 day challenge. I was really surprised at the results. My skin did feel much smoother and some of those little wrinkles are starting to fade. I actually think it also helped with my enlarged pores. So yes, I did notice a difference in my skin in just 14 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After taking the 14 day challenge, I have noticed a softer feel to my face and a slight firming to the contours of my face. My face makeup goes on smoother and my skin seems to have a ""younger"" look. I was so pleased with the challenge that I went out and purchased the product!"
"I received this as a sample and LOVE it. I have sensitive skin and have not been able to find a moisturizer that will not irritate my skin until now. This makes my skin soft, no dry patches and even helps with the redness I get. THANK YOU!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was so happy to be able to try a free sample. It feels so smooth and work as well or better than the ROC I usually use. I will price compare when I need to buy moisturizer. I am sincerely surprised at the results. The wrinkles are not visible. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the samples I received in the mail and I'm not completely happy with the results. My forehead and nose becomes very oily in the morning and I have to keep blotting my face throughout the day. I haven't had this issue before when using any L'ORÉAL face moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received revitalift in October and I was skeptical about this product at first. But after trying this product I must say it is amazing. It left my face feeling moisturized and feeling form & intact. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Tried Revitalift and it does reduce wrinkles and make my skin feel soft. The bad part is I can't stand the smell of the product. Had to quit after 7 days; just could not stand the perfumy smell under my nose all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a two week sample pack ignore this moisturizer in the mail. First of all, this stuff smells amazing! After roughly one week's time I was able to tell a difference in my skin. It felt firmer & just overall BETTER. Normally, my skin starts to dry out once the weather gets cooler but I haven't had that problem since I started using this moisturizer. I do wish it was a bit cheaper, but it works so well I most certainly will be purchasing it in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. I even really appreciated the way the sample was tpackaged, so I knew how much to use each day. I really liked it for my face and eye area, but Loved what it did for my neck !! The whole area looks better and firmer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the Loreal challenge and used the samples I received. This is a great moisturizer. Do I look younger - not really! However, I don't look any older, and my skin feels smooth and soft! I love the smell! It's a little thick, but overall, I love it and plan to purchase!"
11-01-2017 Received samples 6 days ago. Have used 5 days. Very good moisturizer. Looking forward to end result. Would have waited until finished samples but have had three requests to do survey. So here it is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using 2 week sample sent to me, I am pleased with this product. Skin is smoother, lines are less prominent. It did make my skin oily but I cut back on the amount I used which helped."
I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have really dry skin and loved the thick texture of this lotion. I use it day and night. It is light enough to go under makeup. I did notice I had some more than usual pimples pop up compared to my usual clear face. I'm not sure if this was due to the thick creamy texture or not but for me I have to compromise due to moisturize my extra dry skin. So far I'm loving it and recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a really good moisturizer, does a great job without being heavy or greasy. But I really wish it had SPF protection in it. I currently use Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Day Cream which has SPF 18. I don't want to have to use another sunscreen product on top of the Triple Power cream, then it could be too heavy or greasy plus an added expense. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the 14-day challenge and the main thing I noticed was the softness and moistrizing of my skin. I did not notice a reduction in my “tired” appearance. I don���t think this was a good product for wrinkle or line reduction or lifting in anyway. Disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this trial product in the mail. I started using it the next day. I was surprised I started seeing results after only two days. I had to look twice before I realized it had already improved the moisture and appearance of my skin. I used my last sample last night but I had already gone to the store and bought more so I didn't have to miss a day without using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received samples and participated in the revitalift challenge. It did smooth out my skin and relax it, also was a good moisturizer, but at times it did sting. It is a semi thick cream, which is good, and what makes it a good moisturizer. It has a fragrance to it, (so so). But overall, I liked it, and I would buy it after trying it out through samples. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff is amazing!! I noticed a difference after 2 days! I will be buying this from now on and have told all my friends about it.Now they are trying it. Love it and would absolutely recommend!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the 14 day challenge and am on day 12 and enjoy the smooth texture while applying it however it is a little oily or greasy feeling to it. I did notice it leave my skin feeling softer and has a nice aroma to it. The only think I am not sure of is the slight breakout I have had since using it. especially around my cheeks and forehead area. I would consider purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day sample of this product from Loreal and found it to be interesting. Each day for 14 days I cleaned my face, applied my toner and then moisturized with the Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer. It felt a bit greasy and heavy on my face. When it dried it felt tacky to touch. However, I feel it made my skin better, more moisturized and plumping. I would probably purchase this product on a long term basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I still have three more days to do the trial but so far my skin does feel much smoother. I have already purchased a jar in order to continue with this cream. It smells nice, too which is good for me as I have a very good ""detector"" and don't like strong or chemical scents. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of this from L'Oréal for 14 days. I'm only on day 8 and I'm already loving it. I use it every night before bed. I put it all over my face and on my neck (which was my trouble area after having my son). It's worked wonders on my neck! I only use this product every other night and I'm still seeing a difference.

I participated in the Revitalift 14 Day Challenge. I found the cream to be creamy and easily absorbed into my skin. I have nothing negative to say about this product but I noticed no difference in my skin. I will continue to use the product I used prior to participating in the Challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this as a free 2 week sample. On the first day I noticed a change! My skin was so soft and smooth. The directions said to use it morning and night. I thought it would be too heavy under my makeup but I was wrong. It even makes applying my foundation easier. At the end of 2 weeks my skin feels smooth and soft and looks brighter. I do not have any dry spots. I will be purchasing a full size jar [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Actually, my challenge isn't over yet. I didn't receive my samples until about a week and a half ago. However, even in that short amount of time, I'm seeing results. I also use it on my neck and chest and the lines on my chest are visibly reduced. By the way, I saw that you recommend this for women in their 30's. Well, I'm 60 and it's working!

"As much as I wanted to give this cream a fair trial and love it (like I love other L'Oreal products like Magic Perfecting Base and Revitalift Miracle Blur), I don't like it at all for one reason and one reason alone. This cream visibly pills on your skin. Reminds me of the Smashbox primers, which pills even worst. I use these products for film work...it can't pill.

"I received 14 day sample of this cream and I like it. It's a nice moisturizer, skin seems to be firmer, has fragrance but it dissipates, haven't noticed a huge difference in wrinkles yet, but will keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the #REVITALIFTCHALLENGE and I am very impressed. I just love how smooth and silky it feels and doesn't leave that sticky residue I've experienced with other moisturizers. I could really see a difference within a couple days. This has become a new addition to my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the 14 days of Revitalift that was free. It went on smooth and felt really good, however, the product did not perform as stated by Loreal. My fine lines could be seen in great detail in the mirror. I would have to pass on this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love it. Extreme moisture, Dewey look and plumps skin so lines and wrinkles seem to disappear. Don't have to use a lot so it lasts a long time. I am switching my moisturizer and will use revitalift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I more day left of the 14 day samples. The textue of the lotion is good, skin is a little smoother. Did not really see a difference in my line and wrinkles. Also, after applying in the morning and putting on makep I noticed balling on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not sure I saw any visible difference. It was a nice, average moisturizer. I liked that it is not greasy. That said, even if I loved it, I probably would not buy it because of the jar packaging. I really prefer tube or pump - much more sanitary, and the active ingredients are not exposed to light or air. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OK - nothing is magic and long before retirement I had a good income and bought expensive moisturizers (basically I wasted money!). I love this product for 1) appears to brighten 2) definitely hydrates and 3) value for money. I am going to purchase the other products in the lines (night and serum).

Was happy to receive a sample of this product. Noticed my beginning stages of fine lines start to disappear after 5days . Product doesn't have a greasy feeling n didn't leave my face feeling oily . Loved this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of this moisturizer as I apply it (it glides on easily and is absorbed quickly without any shine). My foundation applies easily afterward, too. After less than 2 weeks of consistent twice-daily use, my skin definitely seems brighter and more even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the revitalift challenge and I am on day 4 and I have already saw a difference in the fine lines on my face and I couldn't be happier! I definitely can't wait until I finish the challenge and see how much more has changed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received 14day trial sample of this cream. I would highly recommend it. Goes on smoothly. Little goes a long way. Has a very pleasant delicate scent. My wrinkles were invisible on day 3 if use. Thank you L'Oréal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product for only two days I found my foundation application went on like silk. After using Revitalift for two weeks I don't think I can live without it. My skin looks luminous, smoother, more youthful, perfectly moisturized and without a greasy or sticky leftover residue. I'm on my way to purchase more right now.

"I received samples from L'Oreal in order to participate in the RevitaLift Challenge and was so pleasantly surprised by the results. This cream is super moisturizing, long lasting and minimized my fine lines. My skin is firmer, smoother and looks better than before the challenge. This is a great cream that offers significant results in a short period of time at a great price point. I will definitely be buying this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been getting facials every month to help my skin. Once I started using Revitalift, even the facialist noticed the improvement and said my skin tone and texture had really improved. My skin feels and looks great and I have stopped getting facials and now just use these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly tried to hang in there for the entire 14 days but just couldn't stand the constant greasy feeling on my face. Even after washing my face, it took days to have it feel normal once again. Sorry, but I prefer Neutrogena. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the 14 day sample, it's great! It made my skin so soft and moisturized really well except it didn't agree with the south Texas humidity. It left my face at the end of the day a bit oily. It works great when I used it at night but a bit heavy for day time. All and all it's a great product I'll just use it at night instead of day time.

Smells great silky smooth skin doesnt feel greasy . I break out with everything but this one didn't make me break out at all and I didn't feel like I had to wash it off right after it felt so good on my skin nice and moisturized [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received a 14 day challenge packet and have been using religiously for about 9 day's. I know I will continue when I am done with the challenge. It removed fine lines and wrinkles and has made my skin smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I participated in the 14-day challenge where I received a free sample from L'Oréal. This product completely exceeded my expectations. The product seemed heavy but absorbed right into my skin leaving it silky. Most moisturizers leave me with oily skin soon after applying, but I woke up the morning after with only moderately oily skin for the first time. I highly recommend this. It also smells great and a little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the samples provided regularly and I can just barely tell a difference. My eye bags are at least 90% as noticible as they were before I started using this product. I had such high hopes and really wanted it to make a difference but for all intents and purposes it didn't. I would not buy this moisturizer especially at the price you charge for it.
this product did a great job making my skin look more alive and bright! i really liked the light texture and feel of it on my skin too. its easily absorbed and works quickly. i used for two weeks the little sample packets and went out to buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received two week samples of this fantastic cream. I have noticed an improvement in skin texture, tone and elasticity. It replaces three high priced products I was using; a serum, a retexture and a triple moisturizer. This product is a savings of $300.00+. Thanks, I'm a believer and will sing its praises [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did the 14-day challenge and could not be more pleased! This cream is so silky smooth and gentle to the skin. I saw pleasant results within a few days, and will now be purchasing this regularly. I'm very fortunate to have ""younger"" skin (as did my mother), and this cream is simply ideal. This cream, as well as other L'Oreal products that I use regularly, proves that L'Oreal skin products are for mature women and younger women alike.

"I was surprised with the results after using this face cream. I noticed my skin was smoother and softer with the very first application. After using it for a little over a week, my face has become firmer and looks even more healthier than before. I will keep using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i would say the product delivers on its claims, it works really well. the only downside for me is that i hate thick mousturizer formulas , i prefer the hydragenious formula. but i use this only at night and it does absorb fast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the free 14 day Revitalift challenge samples by mail. I was very excited to try this product. It says to use day and night for best results. I tried during the day but it was too heavy for a day product on my skin. It made my skin look very oily and felt heavy. For night, it worked very well. It was very moisturizing.

"Absorbs quickly, a little bit is enough otherways will make my face looks shiny and greasy, my skin is smooth now and even toned. I will buy it again and again. I got it as a sample, as soon as i finish with the sample I will buy more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 14 day sample for free through Loreal. I loved how it felt on my face. A little goes a really long way and it was creamy and thick and absorbed well in a couple of minutes. My skin definitely feels healthy. My only complaint is that I broke out a little more than usual during this time but that may be completely unrelated. I was recommend this to others.

I got a 14 day trial and it was amazing! Loved the way it went on and made my skin so soft. I thought it might be a little heavy and greasy since it was so creamy but it was not. Will purchase in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample from Lo'real a few weeks ago and given it to my mom to try it out as she has more wrinkles than I do. My mom has noticed a dramatic change in her skin. Her face has less wrinkles and is less aged. In addition, because she loves the product so much, I have bought her the full sized product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the scent of this product which is very important to me. I love the fact that I can wear it both as a day or night moisturizer. It works well under make up or just as a stand alone day cream. Doesn't feel greasy, absorbs well and makes your skin feel hydrated for hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the challenge and I like the cream to wear at night but it is too heavy for me to wear during the day. My face looked oily by the time I got to work and my makeup was almost non existent by days end. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I requested a sample of this product and have been in love ever since! It makes my skin feel amazing, I see wonderful things happening and love the way my make up goes on on top of it!! Should have done this YEARS ago!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I participated in the revitalift challenge and even though I am only 22 and don't have many wrinkles or aging, the product helped my skin feel very hydrated and seemed to diminish what damage I did have. It has a pleasant smell and smooth, creamy texture. It didn't leave my skin feeling oily, like other products of this type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent a sample pack that would last 14 days. I have used this product before
and liked it. It feels good on my skin and helps make my face soft and smooth looking. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the 14 day trial in the mail and have been fairly happy with the product. It seems to have helped with some of my wrinkle issues but has done nothing with the wrinkles around my upper lip. I do believe I will probably buy a full size product though and continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have naturally oily skin so certain moisturizers do not always cooperate with my skin. This is a great product because I get complete moisture and my skin feels baby soft! It is lightweight and doesn't seem to clog your pores. I was using it day and night but I found for my oily skin it's better to use just at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am now diabetic, so where I once had an oily complexion, my face is now very dry.This absorbed quickly, but was initially a slightly heavier weight than I usually use.Overall, it did a nice job moisturizing, though I am unsure if it combatted my mild wrinkles.Worth a try for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had already been using this product before I got the sample but I was thrilled to get more. It has made a huge difference in my skin bringing back natural mouse thus making me look younger. Great job, L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 14 day challenge. I did notice that my skin stayed moisturized all day and felt smoother. I did also notice, as mentioned in another review, that when I put on my makeup over it, it would peel off a little, and I had to smooth out the makeup. I also noticed when I showered in the morning, I could still feel the moisturizer on my skin. I would recommend this product, but I would use it at night vs. in the morning before applying makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample for 14 days and im so glad i did. Since the first use you can feel a deference in your skin, and after 5 to 7 days you noticed a change. My skin looks hydrated and is feel smooth. I got no doubt to buy the regular size! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Revitalift moisturizer for two weeks and when my YOUNGER sister came to visit. She noticed a difference in my skin immediately! I love how Revitalift feels going on and how smooth my skin feels since I began using it. I can't say enough positive things about this moisturizer! Thanks Loreal for a wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am into day 7 of my 14 day trial. The results after just a week are great. I am 63 yrs old and have smile brackets because of my high cheekbones. In just one week, ONE WEEK, I can see improvement. I will continue to use Revitalift and have already bought it. Thanks L'Oreal for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day sample challenge pack, i liked the consistency of the cream and I felt my skin softer hydrated, I will buy it to see better results but if I recommend it, thank you for considering me to try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I participated in the 14-day #RevitaliftChallenge - thank you L'Oreal! My skin felt very moisturized after applying this product. However, I like a lighter texture to my moisturizer. This felt very heavy and a little greasy after application on my face. It was more of a 'night' moisturizer for me, although the packaging says a.m. & p.m. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer has left my skin very firm and with a soft texture. Iam very pleased with my results that I have received from this moisturizer. I will be purchasing more in the future, I highly Recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given a 14-day supply to try out this moisturizer. Within two days, I noticed that my face was looking younger and firmer. The skin wasn't sagging anymore. And it softens my skin and helps with my wrinkles. It is great! I already brought some more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day sample challenge pack & boy am I glad I did. This is an amazing product. It smooths my skin. It moisturized my normally dry skin as well. This is my new favorite moisturizer! I saw a difference from day 1. I am never going back to my old brand again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Revitalift 14 day challenge and I was determined to be diligent and also to like it. I stopped after 3 days. My face felt sticky all day long, I was shiny, and my makeup didn't go on the same. I know I need to use moisturizer since I'm getting a little older and I have some wrinkles that could stand some smoothing, but this product wasn't it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow so I tried the 14 day trial of this product and it is so amazing. It's so moisturizing! I have fairly dry skin and pretty fine line and wrinkles. This helped so much with it and I swear helped my crows feet lightened up. I will definitely be buying the large container of it for myself and my mother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received sample of this product.. I used it for 14 days and I must say that I was really surprise that I could see the difference after just 14 days.. my skin looks much healthier, mosturized and the area around my eyes looks much better.. I will definitely continue using this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 14 day challenge and loved the feel of my skin. I did not though see a lot of difference on the lines and wrinkles. I am 59 years of age and was hoping to see more of a change, great product, still. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"#RevitaliftChallenge I participated in the Revitalift Challenge. The product felt rich and think going on my skin. My skin instantly felt softer. After two weeks, I saw improvement in fine lines and my skin felt softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I signed up for the 14 day challenge and love this product. This was a very clever campaign. You didn't have to jump through hoops to try the product, L""Oreal just had faith that is was the best. I am almost 60 years old and have a few age related wrinkles (one or two lol) and your moisturizer was just fabulous. I bought the night and day cream this last weekend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using for 9 days now and even though my skin feels softer to touch, there is has been no visible difference. The moisturizer is thick which I think contributes to it lasting all day, but the smell could have been a little less poignant. Overall, I would recommend for someone who's skin type is a little more tolerant than mine. And I might consider using it just to keep my skin softer, but not at the price tag that's on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was a bit harsh on my skin, however I have extremely sensitive skin, so some products work wonderfully and some products tend to clash with my skin type. I am sorry this product was not the best for me, but I do look forward to less harsher products in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 14 day free trial to try. I liked the product overall. It was great at keeping my face hydrated. It was a little heavy going on until it dried completely. It worked better if I was not wearing makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the 14 day revitalift challenege and I have mixed feelings about my results. While it did mosturize my skin nicely I did not notice any significant changes. I even took a before photo and there is not a real change. I was hoping it would help with my skin's elasticity, but I actually got a few pimples during the challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample pack. I feel that it made my skin look smoother and more youthful by smoothing out fine lines. However, I experienced more breakouts after using this product for a few days. Overall, my skin feels great and has a more refreshed look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was part of the 14 day challenge and I was dubious that I would see any real changes in just two weeks but I can see a real change it both the texture of my skin and the appearance of fine lines. Great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just finished the 14 day trial sample, and I absolutely will be buying this product. The cream is thick and moisturizing, but it absorbs quickly without leaving skin greasy. Instead you are left with hydrated, healthy skin. I could tell a difference in fine lines after the first few uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample of RevitaLift and used it mostly on my neck and jawline. I liked that it quickly hydrated, but was not greasy at all. The cream absorbed quickly and lasted all day. My skin felt hydrated and firmer. I would definitely purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Three days into the trial and my skin was softer than ever. Wrinkles and lines are are almost nonexistent. Skin is firmer as well. I feel 5-10 years younger. It's not greasy either. Definitely will buy RevitalLift. Thank You for letting me try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the product now for only 3 days. I love the smell and the way it makes my face feel. Soft and vibrant. But to be honest I can't seen any difference in facial lines or plumpness. But then after all, I am 77 years old so I guess I can't expect miracles. But honestly. it feels great on my face and I will continue to put it on every morning after cleansing my face.

"I first noticed how thick and creamy it was. It was so smooth and rich and easily spread over my face. I loved that not much is needed, it does not make my face feel greasy or oily. My face is feeling lovely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Loreal Revitalift is a nice moisturizer that leaves skin feeling well conditioned. My skin is normally very dry and Revitalift eliminated the flaky skin and dryness that I normally experience once cooler weather sets in. I did find the fragrance a little overpowering and wish there were an unscented version available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received this as the 14 days #RevitaLiftChallenge. I really didn't notice much change in wrinkles/fine lines, but I loved the how incredibly moisturized my skin felt. The one thing I did not enjoy, as I've read some other reviewers had experienced, is this skin peeling/rolling. It seemed to not want to allow my makeup to layer over top and it sort of rolled off. While I loved putting it on at night, I certainly did not enjoy the way it made my makeup look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way it felt when I put it on...but it totally tore up my skin....I kept peeling and drying out, even when I used it only once a day every 2-3 days. Just too strong a product for my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample and I was really surprised because it didn't make me break out or left my skin feeling greasy. It actually left my skin moisturized and feeling vibrant. I would honestly buy this product for everyday use and recommend to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the sample and used it every morning and night for 14 days and found no changes at all. I previously used a moisturizer in the morning and at night which did the same as this product. There were no changes to my ""flaws"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received samples of Revitalift in the mail. I am truly glad I sent for them. My skin looks and feels amazing after a week of use, plus it has a lovely fragrance. I definitely will continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received a 14 day sample. Only used part of the first packet. This product is far too greasy to wear under make-up, but the main reason I won't use the remaining packets (or buy it in the future) is the overwhelming odor. After a few hours, I developed a migraine and had to wash it off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have dry skin and this product really provided hydration. When applying at night, it felt like the daytime cream was still there. The product has a pleasant scent.

I received 14 days sample of revitalift triple intensive moisturizer to try. It left my skin smooth and hydrated. Skin was not greasy at all. There was no improvement in wrinkles however I'm sure it takes more than 2 weeks to show signs of reducing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free 14 day sample from Loreal of this moisturizer. It goes on exceptionally smooth and lasts all day. However I did find it a bit too heavy most days for my oily skin and I had several pimples break out. I do love the feeling of it though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using RevitaLift for 14 days and my skin is amazingly smooth. The best part are the wrinkles on my face are noticeably less. As a 60 year old woman, I have tried so many products and nothing has worked as well as L'Oreal RevitaLift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have definitely seen a difference in my skin after just a few days. I am always skeptical of products that say they work in 14 days and I can honestly say that it did! My skin looks and feels really nice and smooth. I don't have the redness that I normally have and I even put it on my eyelids without any discomfort. I am going to buy the product line and try it and hopefully see even more radiance in my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To begin, I wish the smell of this product was bottled as perfume! Such a nice fragrance to wake up to and go to bed, as well.I have always loved my Revitalift products but had never tried this particular one. Thanks for the generous free samples! I will definitely be purchasing my on jar."

I got my L'Oreal revitalift samples in a challenge. I've been using them now for about a week and I can definitely say that I have noticed some great changes in my skin. My skin looks more useful less tired and brighter. thanks L'Oreal for the opportunity to try revitalift!
I'm on day 10 of the trial. My skin is soft and supple and the fine lines are diminished noticeably. The fragrance is delightful. The Cream just glides on your skin with most luxurious feeling. And living in Florida under the sun your face does not feel dry all day. It feels wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried the 14 day challenge and I will be going to the store to purchase more. I love this wonderful cream so much. Its silky smooth and goes deep into my skin to make my skin moisturized and youthful looking and feeling. Smell is nice and doesn't feel heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was part of the 14 day challenge of the Revitalift and love how moisturized my face and neck are. The cream was a bit heavy so if you have oily skin I do not recommend this cream. if you have dry skin then this is perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"But it didn't seem to really do anything to affect the fine lines and wrinkles I have on my face and neck. Also, even long after applying it, if you rubbed the skin where the revitalift was applied, it, like...rolls up and 'pils' in chunks on your face. I really didn't like that about it."
I received the 14 day trial. I do feel like it had a smoothing effect but I did not notice any other changes. The samples seem quite large and I would assume you wouldn't want to use that much in a day or it would be costly. I was not sold on purchasing this.

"Fortunately for me, I was chosen to receive this moisturizer as part of the #RevitaliftChallenge. As I expected from L'Oreal, this is an excellent product! I have been using it for two weeks and my skin is more moisturized and it feels more supple. My wrinkles are somewhat diminished but I seriously don't expect to be rid of them without surgical intervention! LOL Thank you for the trial sample, L'Oreal!

"I'm on day #5 and I love this stuff!! From the 1st day I loved the feel, the texture, honestly I didn't care if it did all the anti-aging it's supposed to do...the feel of this moisturizer is fantastic on my skin! It's not greasy and it smooths in so well with my skin!! I love the Revitalift Triple Power!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am glad that I took this 14 day challenge! This is my first day of using this product and my skin feels so soft. I like how my skin feels moisturized all day too. I also like that you don't have to use a lot of this product. A little amount goes a long way. I'm excited to see what the next days in this challenge bring.

I have used the free 14 day sample and am a fan. The cream goes on smooth and seems to go right into the skin so am able to apply makeup right away. I have notice that my wrinkles are not as prominent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My experience with RevitalLift has been an unusual one. I had a TIA (mini stroke) on 10/8/27. I was left with drooping on the entire right side of my face. I have been using RevitalLift on the right side only, making sure to massage it in an upward motion. For this, I have been using a regular moisturizer on the left side. My ""experiment"" is working! There is already noticeable lifting on the droopy side. So yes, this is my special ""miracle"" face lift. Thank you, L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product and each packet was labeled for ""2 uses - Night and Morning"". There was SO much product for 2 uses, even with moisturizing my neck."
"I used a smaller amount and the product went on easily and smoothly. With what I felt was a reasonable amount of the product, it felt light on my skin and I could apply my makeup over it easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took part in the 12-day challenge and can tell you that the skin on my face and neck looks like I've been taken back in time to my 30s! This product is a MUST HAVE for women in their 30s and even in their 40s (like me!)! So smooth, so rich, and lasts all day. My fine lines have mostly disappeared! I am so pleased with this adventure that I've already bought 2 more containers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this for about a week now, into the challenge. I have noticed that my skin is very soft, and any dryness has vanished. I also enjoy the scent. You don't need to use much of this product, as it spreads well. I will be buying some in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am halfway thru the 14 day Revitalift challenge. I am so glad I took this challenge, the product is a little thick, but I figured out less is more. The sample is small but I found I can use half as much. So far it is helping with my dry skin, my dry patches are disappearing it has a nice sent which is always a factor for me. More to come!

"I am about 8 days into the challenge and I'm amazed! I wasn't expecting much, other products I've used didn't deliver as promised, so I was skeptical. But wow! I can't wait to see what 14+ days look like!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got 14-day samples from Loreal and totally in love with it from the first time.

"Received Revitalift as a challenge trial and knew after the 1st day I would be enjoying this product. Noticeably less wrinkles, especially my crows feet area, always my hardest area to respond to moisturizer no matterthe amount used. The trial tubes could easily be used for much longer than the time allotted. Love that it takes such a little amount for big results a d so quickly too. Highly recommend!

This product was great at hydrating my skin. Without a good moisturizer my skin would be as dry as the desert I live in. L'oreal Revitalift not only put plenty of moisture into my thirsty skin but it also gave it a refreshed youthful look. I noticed a difference in just a few days of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wish it was packaged in a way that would not expose the product to air, germs, and light. It's ideal for people with normal to dry skin but too heavy if you have oily skin. Nice, creamy, non irritating [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm currently doing the RevitaLift challenge and am on day 9. I was having one of those bad breakouts when I started the challenge and it has given me amazing results. My skin looks healthier and fuller as this has helped with my acne scars and enlarged pores. I've been using it on my neck as well and my neck lines aren't as noticeable as they were before. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I only really started this today, but I already love this. It's so silly and smooth when you put it on, doesn't have the greasy feel most aging moisturizer have. My skin felt fresh and tight. Definitely replacing my current one with this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a little over halfway through the Revitalift Challenge and I can feel a difference in my skin already. It feels softer and I don't have the dry spots I normally start getting this time of year. I like that it's not too heavy. It did cause me to get a couple of small blemishes when I first used it so now I avoid the T-zone where I have those problems. It works great on the rest of my face though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried a free sample of this product and was left undecided. Product smelled great. Left my skin feeling heavy and coated almost greasy. Even several hours after application, my face felt like it needed to be washed. Product did not cause break outs like other products have."
"I received this product as a 14 day challenge and I was amazed at how great my skin looked and felt at the end of the trail. My large pores appeared to be smaller, and my fine lines appeared to almost be gone. Thank you for the opportunity. I have already purchased the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I normally won't put anything on my face that isn't expensive and from a high end brand. But I'm a sucker for samples so when I received a free 14 day trial I decided to check it out. It really worked! As good as some brands that charge twice the price. Its definitely worth the price and then some.
"I have been using this 2 times a day for about 14 days and yes my wrinkles around my eyes, look a lot less noticed and my family asked me about what I was using. I told them and they are going to try it also. I have already went out and bought more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love L'Oreal products and fell in love with the Rosy Tone Cream Age Perfect Cell Renewal. I tried this for 14 days but don't see any difference at all in the feel or look of my skin. When I use the Age Perfect I can actually feel how soft my skin feels, not just when I put it on but throughout the entire day. I will stick to this right now but thanks for letting me try it!

"I received the 14 day sample packets and did not notice a difference in my skin. This moisturizer left my skin feeling greasy and I could still feel the greasiness when I washed my face in the morning, like it had never sunk into my skin. Also, I prefer to use a day cream with SPF in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day Sample from Loreal to try this, I must say I was skeptical as mu skin is combination skin and it is hard for me to find a moisturizer that works for me. I must say I was impressed, not only was this not greasy feeling but it left my skin feeling soft, hydrated and supple. My skin has visibly improved its overall complexion looks better as well.

"This product takes too long to dry and when it does it just feels like I'm wearing a mask over my face all day, not to mention it gives your skin a purple undertone while using it.

"I took the 14 day challenge although I'm only on day 9. My face is super soft and moisturized and I noticed yesterday that I have a healthy glow that I didn't have before I did the challenge.

"I received samples to last 14 days it was for am and pm each day. Since my daughter's wedding is less than a week away now I've been extremely busy and sometimes only used once a day. I started noticing a difference by the third day, my skin was more radiant, people started commenting more on how good I was looking. This product is definitely worth the money and I'm only halfway thru my 14 day samples [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and see no real difference in my skin. It does moisturizes well but has no spf in it so you have to use a second day time product with it. You also can not use this with the night mask they do not mix well together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I completed the Recitalist 14 day challenge. Overall I was happy with the results. I did notice that my forehead and brow lines were a little less noticeable.

"I tried this only for two days. Having naturally oily skin, this product only made it worse. I wore makeup on top of it on day two. By the end of that day, all my makeup had come off and I could just feel the oil on my face. It was disgusting!! I really think L'Oreal needs to rethink this product and make it for all skin types!

"I was sent a 14 day trial. I'm about half way through the trial and haven't noticed any difference so far. I already use anti-aging products on my face, so not sure this is any different. My skin is no worse, but no better either. I'll review again when the entire trial is over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical about the Revitalift's claims, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised! I noticed after the first application that my skin felt smoother and my make-up went on so much nicer. After repeated use, I have noticed the skin under my eyes has gotten less wrinkly. I really like this product and am so thankful for the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I began my 14 day trial I was extremely worried due to I have rose and almost ALL beauty products cause flate ups. I was WRONG!! My samples have been wonderful for my skin and no problems have arrived. My skin is so smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample and I absolutely loved it. I don't wear much make up unless I go out but being a stay at home mom I noticed a difference in the tightness and wrinkles I have. The only thing I had a problem with was under my chin when I applied my make up after the Revitalift it started to roll and peel in places. I still wouldn't trade it for anything because I don't wear much make up like I said before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14 day sample of this product to use. Made my skin feel smoother but as far as making wrinkles disappear, that didn't happen. While it might lessen fine lines, it doesn't do much for deeper wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm unemployed so it was greatly appreciated when I received the samples and I am so impressed on how much tighter my skin is as soon as I get myself situated I will definitely use L'Oreal skin products again then again thank you so much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had the opportunity to sample L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power and boy am I glad I did! RevitaLift Triple Power goes on my skin smoothly and doesn't feel tacky or heavy. It almost feels as if my skin is drinking it in! My complexion felt brighter and revived. Good stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This past year I began feeling chapped & chaffed skin all the time. Nothing, not even exfoliation was helpful. Some moisturizers only helped slightly but by next day it was back to chapped skin. I tried #RevitaLift & experienced smooth skin from day one! It has a very nice fragrance & is not oily or greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Goes on smooth, not greasy or sticky and I could really tell a difference. I wore it after taking off my makeup at night and under makeup in the morning. Replaced my primer with this for the challenge and it worked great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this about 14 days ago. I mean it's a great moisturizer I noticed a little bit of a change but not anything to be excited about. Maybe need to countine using hopefully the result will be come better [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day sample of this product and it is amazing! My skin feels smoother, more hydrated, and it even helps to even out my skin tone. It does not feel greasy and easily blends into my skin. I have also noticed that it helps reduce the size of my pores. Thank you for letting me try this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the 14 day RevitaLift challenge and I cannot believe the results. After using this product for 14 days I feel a dramatic change to my skin and my face looks radiant! I have used some of the most expensive face moisturizers including Dr. Perricone, Perlier, Lancôme, Este Lauder, Clinique, Elizabeth Arden and did not have the same results as with L'Oreal. This will be my new go to face products at a fraction of the cost!"
"I received the 14 day free trial. I used it after cleansing and toning my face before bed. I was immediately taken back by how perfumy it was. I hoped it would dissipate after absorbing, so I waited about 10 minutes. It was still very strong smelling (even my cats reacted from a couple feet away from me) so I washed my face again to remove it and switch back to me normal products (which are not unscented, so it's not like I'm just used to no scent). Seriously, that much fragrance is ridiculous and unhealthy!"
"I received a 2 week sample of this product in the mail. I have used most of it and I like how it makes my skin feel AFTER it soaks in good. To me the product feels very heavy when it is first applied, but that is my only con. I read that it rolls up on some people's skin, but I didn't have that problem at all. Maybe they used too much or rubbed into the skin too long. Overall, I do like this RevitaLift moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using revitalift triple power for two weeks, morning and night. I am so happy with the results! My skin is so smooth and radiant compared to what it was. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always have trouble finding a good moisturizer for my oily skin. I decided to give this one a try and let me tell you im glad i did. I love it, you can see results right away. My face feels so clean, it looks younger. I can't explain it all i can say is give it a try and you will know what im talking about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was part of the 14 day challenge. I have to say that I did notice a difference after a few days with the texture of my skin. After the summer sun, this is just what my skin needed. I will continue to use this through out the coming cold weatger. Thanks for the opportunity to try this great new product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 14 day trial of this about 3 weeks ago. Use in the morning and evening after you wash your face. I noticed almost immediately my fine lines under my eyes were smoother and my face wasn't as dry. By the 14th day my skin looks great! My face is firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a free sample in the mail it smells really fresh but I didn't notice much of a difference in the smile lines, however I will buy it on my own and try it for a longer time period to make a better desision. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product to sample for 14 days. I seen so much difference in my skin what short time i used this product. My skin after a few days started feeling smoother and more firm. What tiny lines around my eyes arent noticeable at all hardly now. My pores are also much smaller. This is on my shopoing list for tomorrow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like using L""Oreal products and this was amazing. I did the 14 day challenge and the results were fantastic. My face is smoother and the lines are almost invisible. I will be using this again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In the first week of usage I began to see a few red blotches,but not terrified by them,I continued to use the samples. To my amazement the blotches had disappeared and what remained of my facial skin was miraculous. No rough patches,no dry skin to moisturize after every bath,and I didn't need any if my facial serums either. This creme really worked wonders for me,and I am sold;as well as thankful for the opportunity given me. Loreal rocks!!! Oh how I wish I had taken the before and after pictures!"
Received a 14 day sample of revitaLift. I have been using it and have noticed a little of a difference. This cream is not heavy or cakey. It goes on smooth and does moisturize very well. It also does have a nice mild scent. The only down fall I have is the price. It is more expensive then I can normally spend on such products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am currently taking the #RevitaLiftChallenge thanks to a generous sample from L'Oreal. I have several issues that I've been monitoring. I'm 1/2 way through the 2 week supply and I have definitely noticed an improvement in the skin along my jawline. I haven't seen any noticeable with dark circles or my sagging eyelids but I still have hope for that and I think it helps with undereye bags.
"I received a 14 day sample to try and I am always skeptical. This time trying a new product paid off, it works! I noticed a reduction in fine lines, especially on my forehead. It was not greasy and felt nice on my skin. My skin felt hydrated. I can't speak to it firming as I don't think 14-days is long enough to evaluation this. It did make my fine lines less noticeable which in turn made my skin look smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just finished up my first bottle of Revitalift (which lasted over a month) and I am so in love with this amazing product! My skin is more vibrant and tight after just 2 weeks. Revitalift is must try! You wont regret it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed trying this product. I went on smooth and kept my face hydrated all day. One thing I did notice is if I only applied once in 24 hours(like at night after shower before bed) instead of two times morning and night it stayed on and did not curl off. My skin felt wonderful all day. Thank you for sending a sample :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing! I received a 14 day sample pack, I'm not done using it yet, but the results are amazing!!! It smells great, a lightly sweet scent, goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly! It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and reduced the appearance of my wrinkles ....."
Love it!!! Plan on buying some and highly recommend!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the RevitaLift Challange and am absolutely amazed at the difference in my skin. My skin is firmer, smoother and more hydrated as pormised! I'm thrilled with the results of thes cream and who quickly I saw results! Thanks you! This is a keepre"
"I have just finished my 14 day use of Revitalift triple power intensive moisturizer and the difference in my skin shows, it is softer and seems more firm. This provides great moisturization all day long and leaves my skin so smooth. Also smells wonderful. I love the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this everyday and like how soft it leaves my face but I did not like how it made my face feel greasy. It goes on heavy, which is good for dry skin, but not so good for my combination skin. I did not notice a lifting of the skin. It did not cause any irritation or breakouts. Other than the heavy feel, I liked this product as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free 10-day sample for Revitalift moisturizer, and it is an excellent product. It goes on smoothly without a greasy feel. It made my skin look and feel younger (I just turned 62). It even smoothed out fine wrinkles in my forehead. I am quite pleased with this fantastic moisturizer."
"Thank you for the 14 day trial of Revitalift. Cream is really nice, perfect moisturized my skin, great fragrance. I applied morning and night and the results were visible in a couple of days. even though is not very aggressive treating my wrinkles i am satisfied with the results. I would recommend this product specially for moisture skin."
I received this is a trial and I was rather impressed. I have combination skin dry/oily and it makes my face feel soft and clean. I normally don't like these kind of products so to be very satisfied is pretty darn good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the free sample for 12 days; and I see no difference in my skin. I don't have many wrinkles for my age(73); but this cream didn't make a difference. Also, I didn't like the fact that it did not contain sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is very fair and to me, seems to show every flaw I have. This product did work well, but it seemed to barely make a difference over the 2 weeks period. Maybe I just need to use it longer?"
"It did go on smoothly with NO irritation, which was wonderful. I liked the rich thickness of the product itself and blending it into my skin was very easy. No odor or stickiness, either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure at first what to look for , but as little as 3 days I could see , feel and people noticed how my skin was glowing, tighter and pores were unnoticed . This product did what it said it would and more. Thank You so much for the chance to try this awesome product. TY , Katie, from South Carolina [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin was feeling dry and stressed when I started using this cream and it has become much smoother after 8 days of use. I would say that I prefer a day cream with sunscreen but this cream has had a big impact on the look and feel of my face. I like it a lot! It feels much softer and smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the challenge although only on day 4...took a long time to get. This time of year, my skin gets dry; my skin feels moist & hydrated. I noticed a difference on my neck - less of a waddle look. After application, I rub it on the top of my hands - they look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 sample packet to try. Presently I use Garnier Anti-Aging Moisturizer Serum. I have to be honest and say I really didn't see any difference in the two. I thought Revitalift has a stronger scent (my cats wouldn't go near my face when I put it on) and is thicker in consistency which felt heavy when applying. Would I go out and buy it, not to sure. I will stick with my present product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have T-skin even at my age, so for me this was very greasy. I used one pod for 3 days instead of one, and it still was too greasy for my skin. If you have dry skin, this would be wonderful for you. It was VERY hydrating, smoothing, but I saw no difference in my skin as of yet, maybe because I did not use a whole pod per day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample 2 weeks ago. I loved the richness of the cream and it's a wonderful moisturizer; non-greasy and fast absorption. My dry patches have improved and I would consider purchasing (have not priced this product as of yet). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this for the past week and I am excited with the results! I am always cautious when products claim to be amazing when it comes to my face and skin. This moisturizer is a welcome addition to my beauty supplies on my bathroom sink. I have really smooth soft facial skin without any added grease feeling. I have noticed a few smaller wrinkles decrease with the use of this moisturizer and I am hoping to further reduce more with continued use
i participated in the 14 day challenge. sooo glad i did. this is the first time in a long time that my combination skin felt moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy. absorbs very well and my skin looks fresh and young! i love this and will be going to get my own bottle like right now!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this and day after day it stayed smooth on my skin and didn't get goopy or grainy after a while. I like the smell and I hope with continued use it will help at least a little. I like it very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product made my skin feel nice as your putting it on but it left a film on my skin. I do not normally have oily skin and it made my face so oily - I didn't lather it on I used it sparingly. It does have a nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very excited to try the revitalift challenge! After four days of use, my skin felt smoother and more even. I have very sensitive skin and have not noticed any redness or breakouts. Excellent at adding moisture back to my dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Went on skin smooth and good feeling. It worked better if my skin was wet. My skin is very dry so the moisture seem to go away fast. If you have normal to oily skin you will really like this product. It is a little to drying for me. I have used for 12 days & I do not see any improvement in my skin. I don;t think any otc product can do much for you skin in 14 days. This is a good product & would recommend for anyone with normal to oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got the 14 day sample on the mail, I was very impressed by the product and the amazing result, defiantly worth every penny, the result after every day use is amazing, I would highly recommend it to anyone, this would be the only moisturizer that I would use for my face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Revitalift challenge and although I still have a couple of more days to go,I noticed the change after about 5 days. The lines on my forehead and around my mouth have improved and my skin feels tighter. Definitely works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took part in the trial. L'Oréal sent me samples to try for 2 weeks, and I used the cream every night. This is a great product. I am older, and while I have few wrinkles, I do have so spotty photo aging spots. While I expected this cream to lift and minimize wrinkles, it has really improved my skin. I plan to continue using it and try some of the other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the convenience of a single cream for day and night. smells nice, softens and brightens well. I have combination skin and have noticed a greasy feel and shine I wasn't having before. Can you make it with a mattifier? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I still have a full week to go because I just received my samples a week ago but I can say that for me personally the Revitalift is quite heavy and it seemed to weigh down my skin. For someone with very dry skin it will probably be great. I had to wait a good 20 + minutes after applying in the morning before applying eye makeup which is all I wear. I would only recommend it to someone with very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my 14 day sample in the mail and even though it hasn't been 14 days ( on day 6) I can tell a difference in how much smoother my face looks! If this continues through the rest of my sample use, I will definitely purchase revitalift products and recommend them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Did the trial,I started seeing results after first use.my face appeared Fuller,skin was glowing and tone appeared more even. I am completely amazed with this and will be purchasing. I look years younger,in a couple weeks of use! Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I completed the Revitalift challenge using all 14 samples. I noticed a difference after just a couple of days. The product is nice and thick, and not greasy. I would consider purchasing and using as a daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this trial very late. But I've been using for six days and my skin is very smooth. My make up literally glides on. The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that so far I'm not seeing a difference in my wrinkles, but I will continue to use it and hope to see better results shortly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got the Revitalift free to try. I liked the softness of my skin. Fine lines did seem to disapear. Even out my tone a little better. But i didnt like the way my foundation make up looked. The two of them was not a good mix. Not sure what it was.. But over all it does do what it advertises.
I just received my free samples for the challenge and have only been doing for about 3 days but I can honestly say my face feels so smooth and soft that I'm looking forward to finishing the 14 day challenge to see what happens by day 14. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is likely great for some skin, but didn't work well for mine. I found it to be a bit too thick and prefer a lighter (or no) fragrance and spf. It also peeled off of my skin. I would not wear this as a day moisturizer, but perhaps as a night moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received samples in the mail and I used them daily. I'm in love with this product. It makes my skin feel smooth and I have a glow. I've always used Loreal products now I've just added a new one to my regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I signed up for the 14 day challenge. After only using for 7 days I did notice a minimizing in the appearence of these deep wrinkles I have in my forehead. This stuff also smells great!

RevitaLift® Triple PowerTM Intensive Anti-Aging Day Cream Moisturizer adds incredible moisture and restoration to my tired face at the end of the day especially. I love how it refreshes my skin and prepares me for the next day of beauty. I love this product! Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried it and to my surprise, I started seeing the difference in 1 night! simply love it! I went ahead and purchased the full size right away so I would never run out. Love the feel, love the fragrance, love the difference. I am already in love with it :))"
I like the product and I think it works well. It has made my skin softer and seems to have made the lines on my face not be so prominent. The only thing I didn't like is that right after I put it on it feels like I have almost like sticky stuff on my face even after it dries. It didn't last all day though. I still like this and think it's a great product. I will buy just for the fact that it helps my skin look healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14 day challenge samples of this product from loreal Paris. I was skeptical, as I have never found a similar product that gave me good results. I am thrilled with the results I have seen in my skin after using this product! Great reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture much improved, and much softer too! I will definitely buy and use this every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used RevitaLift for 14 days. I liked how it made my face feel. It felt firm and supple. My skin looked healthy and hydrated. I am very sensitive to scent and while the scent was good, it was a little too much for me. I know others love it, so I think it's just a personal thing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I also just received the samples just 4 days ago. Since it's only been 4 days, I can't give a proper review. So far my skin feels slightly softer, but again too soon to tell."
Only drawback would be that the product comes in a jar. Should be in a pump or tube so that the cream doesn't become contaminated from sticking your finger in it to get the cream out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the sample Revitalift I received. I will definitely be buying this in the future. I could tell a difference in my skins moisture within the first two days and MY skin now looks great! Thanks L'oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using it for about a week and a half, morning and evening. It feels nice but I wish that my skin would absorb it more quickly."
I think that my makeup goes on smoother and I do like this product overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Received samples for a 14 day challenge. I did not like the feeling of the product on my face. It's thicker than I prefer. I did not notice any difference in my skin at all. Plus, it's price is more than I care to spend for face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product morning and night. From the first use my skin felt silkier. I noticed after evening uses, my skin was still nice and silky when I woke up. After using it as a sample, I am going to pick up the full size RevitaLift the next time I go to the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just received my samples. I have sensitive skin, so started slow. In the 3 days, I have noticed fine lines smoothing out, and deeper lines, diminishing.

"I receive the sample pack and since I've been using it I have notice my skin is beautiful again. It goes on smoothly and has my face feeling completely hydrated and now I have softer, smoother skin. I would definitely recommend this product ☺☺☺ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the 20 day challenge and am half way through. I don't really see much improvement to my skin. I tend to be oily and this cream is a bit “heavy” for me. I will continue to use it on my neck as to not waste the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample and for 14 days I used the product. The consistency of the product and the results are great. Fine lines are truly diminish is also a great moisturizer. I used every day on my face,neck and decolletage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the challenge, and I really like REVITALIFT just as a moisturizer. My skin felt soft all day. I didn't really see the anti-aging benefits in the couple of weeks that I tried it, but I would buy it just as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have found me a new moisturizer. This moisturizer has done everything from help my fine lines and wrinkles to really make my for head lines start to go away. I am so glad that I received this as a free sample. I will be purchasing this over and over. I didn't use this 1day because I was sick and could totally tell a difference. My skin was not smooth and soft like usual. Thank you so much Loreal for sending me this free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day challenge pack in the mail and love the product. At first I thought it would be a heavy moisturizer, but once I rubbed it on it was very light. The scent is pleasant and after two weeks the wrinkles on my forehead are starting to fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank you for the sample! I love this product! I have used Oil of Olay products for years and to be honest I was reluctant to try your sample. Im sixty years young & I saw & felt the results the first day. I love this product and I'm a loyal customer for life . I have recommended this to my friends Thank you !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day trial on the mail to try. I've only used it for about 5 days. Based on that time period I've noticed my pores seem to be smaller. My skin is fully hydrated all day and the smell is amazing. The creme itself is a silky whipped texture and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. Just don't over rub! Allow the product to absorb into your skin or you'll end up with a crumbly mess. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am on day 5 of the 14 day sample sent to me to try and absolutly love this product. Im in my early 60's and have had people wonder if I changed my makeup because something seems different. I will diffently continue with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day trial supply and this anti-aging formula is definitely a product I will purchase. I am an older woman, so my wrinkles are a bit defined, but this product went on smooth and seemed to reduce the appearance of my wrinkles after about a week. I have the AM/PM moisturizer and I am looking forward to continued use of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had hi hopes for this product. I loved the way it felt on my skin, the easy of absorbing was a plus. As I got further into the 14 day challenge product started to lose effectiveness. My skin no longer accepted the product it began to pill. Nothing worse than looking like you have had a sunburn that is peeling and you avoid the sun at all costs. (I am a read head with very few freckles.) I took a before photo to base a comparison for product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got sample of triplelift Mosturizer and thought to give a try. I found my skin gets smooth and hydrated .. no flacky skin . I will definetly buy it as it suits my skin perfectly. Thank you very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like texture of this product. Doesn't feel oily or greasy. It actually feels silky smooth. I like
"the way it feels on my skin and the way it makes my skin feel. As far as making any difference in the way my skin looks, no visible difference at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Just received my 14 day trial. Day 2. So far so good. My skin feels softer than usual. The smell is a little strong for me. I am very sensitive to smells. Would prefer a less noticeable fragrance. Will continue for the remainder of the 14 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got the 14 day challenge and now in day 8 My skin is amazing. It's firmer, hydrated, and the extra skin on my neck is going away."
I love this product and would recommend it to anyone... Even with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Was sent a 14 day trial....on day 12 and I've already purchased the full size.
I love how this makes my skin feel plumper and softer and my makeup goes on much smoother without clinging to dry patches like before...smells great and not heavy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recently took the two week challenge. Much to muy surprise this stuff really works! Hands down the best moisturizer I've used and you really can't beat the price. My face is normally really dry, but with this it wasn't at all. Plus the smell is amazing. LOVE this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This anti aging moisturizing cream on RevitaLift is best I've ever used. Its got a all n one affect and the smell is amazing! I took he 14 day challenge and it's the best thing I've done for skin in a long time! A must have! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was happy I was able to participate in this 14-day challenge. I don't think I would have purchased a bottle without sampling it first. I can say this much it has a great scent. It also helped hydrate my very dry skin. I have noticed a bit of a difference in my face over the past 14 days but I can't say I saw a major difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am using this product for the 14 day challenge. I am currently on day 8. I have noticed an appreciable difference int eh wrinkles around my mouth and neck. I can't wait to finish up the 6 more days. I will definitely this product. and recommend it to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the 14 day sample It lasted 7 days for me due to my very dry skin. I am 59. The product is for skin in its 30's. It is an excellent product but the older you are the more you will use. My face and neck felt very soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this about a week ago and I can honestly say I love it! It has a beautiful clean smell and when I put it on it actually feels like silky and not thin and watery. From the very first time you put it on your face flows with this dewy, pretty complexion. I've only used it a week so I can't say much about wrinkles yet but I already know I won't be dissapointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14-day sample pack four days ago and it's working well so far. I like the texture and the improved texture of my skin (plus my skin is so soft!). The drawback to this product is that the scent is overwhelming, especially if you use cologne/perfume after the morning application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm on day 9 of the challenge and I have really noticed a big difference in the condition of my skin. It feels much smoother and firmer than before. I have oily skin so I love that it does not leave my face greasy. I've been using in the morning and bedtime as directed. Will definitely purchase this product and add it to my face care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this sample and started testing it the day it came. While after about a week, I did start to notice a reduction in fine lines on my face, I also found my face to have an over shiny look, almost a little oily looking that I really did not care for. I think this would be a great product for someone with a little drier type skin. Other then tsht, I liked the smoothness and the feel of it when it was on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the 14 day challenge. Honestly, I didn't see a change in my skin but it really is a thick heavy moisturizer. So that is a positive. The scent was WAY too strong. I would probably buy and use this if it was fragrance free and I just needed a good moisturizer for the winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was awesome for three days. My skin felt like buttery soft and glowing. But then it start braking out. I think it cloged my pores or something. Alas.. I thought this was the one for me. I would still recommend it for those whose skin is not prone to pimples.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just received the product a few days ago and I am starting to use it. So far I can feel my skin a little bit more oily than before this. Probably I would not buy it because I do not want a shinier face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I sent for the 14 day free trial. I'm on day 10 and love the results! My skin is firmer and more supple. It even looks more radiant! I've always had a Difficult time finding a product that wasn't to heavy on my sensitive skin and actual works! This is it! Thanks for making such a great product!!
I have been using this product for almost a month and I'm so pleased with the results. My skin feel soft and smooth. Most of all it feels very hydrated. I can't say enough good things about this product. It is going to be a regular part of my skin care routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this as a sample for the #revitaliftchallenge and let me say that the moisturizer is amazing. The smell is nice and not overbearing. It feels thick and that's good for my liking. The only thing I don't like is it makes me extra shiny after a few hours with my make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did the 14 day Revitalift challenge and I am impressed with the results. My skin is very smooth, soft, supple and glowing. As some others mention, it is a little thick for someone with oily skin such as myself which is probably the only drawback. Other than that, the product works great and the price is decent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Recieved the 14 day sample. Finished using faithfully twice a day for a week. Liked that the suggested amt. was contained in each day packet. Always wonder how much to use. I generally don't wear make up so this made my face look brighter, smoother. One area under my right eye has deeper wrinkles than the left. Product noticeably lessened a particularly stubborn wrinkle in about 5 days. Will most likely purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been doing the 14 day test and am in my second week. From day 3 I saw and felt improvement in my skin. Great for the neck too.
I am continuing to use it. I would recomend to anyone who asked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for 4 weeks and so far I don't have any complaints. The product absorbed easily into my skin and did not leave my skin feeling shiny or greasy. My face looked and felt moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got mine as a free trial and to me it kinda burned my face. But in all fairness I'm also on acne retinol treatment and I was just looking for a cure for my dryness because retinol makes my skin flake. So this product did help me a little bit without being too greasy. I really dont like smelly moisturizer on my face. I dont like bring able to smell my own face if that makes sense? So yes it helped but it was too smelly for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I got the sample in the mail and use it as directed at first I really liked it. My husband even noticed, sarcastically but he noticed lol. After using it for about 6 days my skin constantly seemed to look shiny or oily I personally don't like that look others do. Wrinkle wise works wonders I really like it."
Just wish it didn't make my face shiny [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day supply of this cream to complete the Revitalist challenge. It moisturizes my skin very well, better than other products I have tried. It also helps with my crepey neck. I had no issues with the fragrance. This is a very good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product blends into the skin well and gives the skin texture more ""fullness"" and moisture. It has staying power overnight or throughout the day. The odor is a tad overwhelming if applied around the eyes and nose and is also persistent for several hours. A nice, subdued scent would make the moisturizer near perfect. It does work very well, overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free 20 day sample approximately a week ago and have been using it every day since. I like the thickness of the cream and the way it hydrates my skin without leaving it greasy. my makeup seems to go on smoother as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the 14 day challenge and am so happy I did! I really like this product. It made my skin soft, made my fine lines disappear and leaves my face with a nice healthy glow. It also has a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day supply to try this product, and i have to say i really liked what it did for my skin. It never felt greasy, it absorbed nicely into my skin, and it left my face feeling soft and ready for make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this as soon as I received my samples in the mail. My 65th birthday is in 2 days and I've had several friends and several strangers tell me that my skin looks so good they don't believe i'm 65. Now that's a compliment. Thanks for the samples. I've already bought a jar.
"I've been using this for years, but as I have grown older decided to switch to Age Perfect. Big mistake. The Age Perfect seriously didn't work well for me. Decided to take the challenge to see if it was my imagination. Nope! Love after a week I could see the difference. Will not switch again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Within a few days of using this product, there was a noticeable difference in my skin's hydration and smoothness. The samples were generous, and found that applying exactly half the packet was too much. Cut back a bit and found that it absorbed right away and did not leave a greasy feeling. The challenge is now completed and I can say that my skin looks dewey and is more hydrated, just in time for winter! Thank you for a great product.

I recently was able to try out Revitalift by L'Oreal and I'm impressed. I've used it for almost two weeks and I love how my skin feels and looks. This product is not greasy and it definitely makes your skin look so much better. Excited new customer !
I received my 14 day sample and am on day 8. I have been only using only at night because when i used in the day I saw like exfoliating skin and it was hard to get my makeup on. It does make my skin softer and wrinkles are less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It took a month to get my samples so I only have been using it for a few days. I can say there's a visible difference in the fine lines of my forehead as well as a glow on my cheeks. My chin broke out but I do have very sensitive skin. All in all I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin has always been dry. I tried a lot of hydrating and moisturizing creams but none worked as efficient as revitalift! It worked for me in multiple ways, made my skin soft and moisturized all day, and it smells good too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how soft this makes my face feel. I don't even need a toner anymore because this cream does it all. My skin feels moisturized and hydrated all day long. I most certainly can tell a difference. Amazing skin care. Thanks Lorel:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got a 14 day trial of this and it is a wonderful product. It smells wonderful and my face feels great. It is thick but didn't leave my face greasy and my skin can be pretty sensitive to certain products. I would absolutely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanted to be part of the trail. I must say I am 55 years old and the result to me was surprising. I noticed and loved the fact that I did wake up with a greasy feel on my face. I seen firmer jaw and neck line on me. My lines around my mouth seem less. I will continue to use this product. Very pleased with results ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I ordered a free 14 day trial and I love it! I have sensitive skin and tend to break out when I use moisturtizers bur I didn't with this. My skin feels so much softer and is definitely more smooth. I absolutely recommend RevitaLift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After only a few times using this i am pretty sure that I saw results. Unfortunately it broke me out. I stopped using it and tried again to make sure it wasn't something ekse. I wanted this to not be the cause! Alas, it was the moisturizer. Bummer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"#RevitaLift 14 challenge, I received the product and started using it right away, it made my skin look and feel smoother. I love the ease of use my only concern is the price. Otherwise great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. The cream went on nicely, but it took a while to soak in. If I tried to rub it in during this ""drying"" time, it would rub off in crumbs. I didn't see the amazing results others have, but my skin did seem firmer and brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used a too powerful exfoliator that left my skin dry and uncomfortable. After using Revitalift for 2 days my skin was soft & smooth. I didn't see any reduction in wrinkles but it plumped up my skin nicely [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am part of the RevitaLift challenge and received a 14-pack to use day and night. I immediately noticed a difference in my skin tone within a few days. It was not greasy under my make-up and felt like I was treating my skin with a silky, moisturizing facial treatment everytime I used it. I will be replacing my current moisturizer with RevitaLift immediately! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recvd your 14 day samples in the mail. First I want to say Thank You for the generous sample sizes. First I love the way it makes my face feel after I apply it and yes it is already making my face lines appear more diminished. Also I noticed that after my makeup has been applied my face looks better and has a more finished look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this product and after only a few days was able to notice a visible difference in the appearance of my skin lines simply disappeared my facial tone evened out and I was left with a youthful vibrant healthy glow I even ditched my concealer & foundation after two weeks I'm in love with this product & will be purchasing more in the future this isn't my first & only product I'd recommend to every woman I know [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very skeptical when I got this because lately nothing is making a difference in my skin. I was surprised to find after just a week a very noticible difference. My skin looked and felt very soft. Fine lines were diminishing and my skin all around looked better. This is definitely a repeat on my beauty list. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample and he I felt my skin feel moisturizedalmist immediately. After a week use I could feel and see a difference my family even said I looked rested. Moisturizing, wrinkle free formula you can't go wrong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product definitely made my skin softer in the two-week period that I tried it. It also made my fine lines less noticeable while wearing it; however, I noticed that they became more prominent again after washing my face, so the improvement isn't necessarily permanent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Revitalift for 3 days and I am already noticing a difference. My skin appears smoother and has a natural glow. I love this cream because it hs not caused me breakouts and it soaks in beautifully. 2 thumbs up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I took the challange for using Revitalift Intensive Anti-Aging Day Cream Moisturizer. My skin felt amazing after the first day. No more fine lines or dull looking skin. It was almost like a face lift in a jar. This my new daily face cream. Thanks L'Oreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received samples and tried the Revitalift 14 Day Challenge, and I am impressed."

"I'm about half through the Revitalift Challenge and I ha e to admit that I do think I see a difference in my skin. As I write this review I have it on for the night and my fave does feel moist. I'm not sure about seeing any ""lift"" but maybe a little more hydrated and plump. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Good moisturizer. the cream itself left my face feeling very nice. The scent was too strong for me. Unscented for something so close to my nose & mouth would be better. I felt more youthful after using for 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used RevitaLift for 2 weeks and noticed a difference in 4 days. My skin was visibly firmer, with fine lines less visible. After 2 weeks, I received compliments from co-workers, who asked if I was wearing a ""new base make-up"" (I was not) - just RevitaLift! The texture of my skin skin continues to improve - I am thrilled with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is very nice. It's a nice consistency; not runny but not too thick. It feels great on my face and doesn't leave it feeling or looking oily after several hours of wear. It has a pleasant scent. I've only been using it for a few days, but I can see the fine lines and wrinkles getting less noticable. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It really works! I love the scent and texture of this moisturizer. It is so soothing to put on. It makes me skin feel great. The best part is that it really works to fight signs of aging! My skin looks and feels firmer and I notice fewer, smaller wrinkles. After just a few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I waited until I was almost done with my 14 day sample to make a review. The product is rich and creamy. It has a pleasant scent. My skin appears brighter , soft and silky. The cream absorbed quickly and didn't leave my face feeling greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the 14 day trial and I am on day 10.. It does seem to make my skin soft but there are some days it will not absorb in to skin,,It feel like it sits there and if you rub your skin it starts to roll in to a small ball and for wrinkles I have seen a few small ones fade but for deeper one it never touch them at all ..And for the price I will not buy it cause it really does not work like it said..Thanks for the sample..

"Received the challenge, an i used it. im 61, and have some lines an wrinkles."
"this glides over my wrinkles, instead of settling into them it has softened the lines around my mouth n overall, it softens well an even lifts around the eyes, an jaw line. Would recommend it, an will continue to use it. thanks for the challenge! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Fourteen day trial received in the mail. I'm on day four. Noticed softer and smoother skin since day one. I have dry skin and my face and neck felt good all day and not greasy. Haven't really noticed a change in my wrinkles. Overall the product is good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent a two-week sample of RevitaLift Triple Power Intensive Anti-Aging Moisturizer. From Day 1, this amazing lotion made my face and neck feel softer and smoother. I love that it is very readily absorbed, and that it has a soft fragrance. I have seen a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth, and in the texture of the skin on my neck. RevitaLift is all that a day cream and noght cream should be - and more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received revitalift moisturizer as a 14 day sample, I was skeptical at first yet when I used it from the first day I noticed a difference in my skin! My skin is smoother & my fine lines are less noticeable!! I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really appreciate the opportunity to try revitalift. I have very sensitive skin and do not wear anything usually, and I did like the feel and look but I broke out after the 2nd day so I couldn't go any further. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I participated in the 14 day challenge and am so glad I did! I normally have slightly dry skin and Revitalift has made my skin feel silky. After trying so many skin products and leaving them half empty I feel
I have finally found something that I need to use everyday! It goes on smooth and my skin feels so moisturized! Not to mention how great my skin looks! I definitely recommend anyone to try it and experience the great results waiting for them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I took the challenge. Maybe it is because I have very few wrinkles. I am fortunate to have genetic smooth skin. I. already use a vitamin e creme Swiss collagen complex creme morning and nights I see no difference in results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Revitalift 14 day challenge, and I am thrilled with the results. I have had several comments that my skin was glowing. I found the revitalift to be smooth and creamy, but not oily. My skin did not dry out later in the day, as often happens with other moisturizers. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal is a tried-and-true brand and this product lives up to its expectations. I like the smell and my skin did feel better after the challenge was complete. It may have looked a tiny bit better as well. I only gave it 4 stars, however, because it pilled up when I put it on my face. I thought that was kind of weird. Normally only microdermabrasions do that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day trial of L'Oreal RevitaLift. Today was my ninth day using this product. I love that it is not runny and applies so smoothly. My skin did feel better, but I have't noticed a reduction in fine lines yet; I still have five days to go though. Overall, I like the product as a moisturizer, but I really disliked the way it smells. Fortunately, the fragrance fades quickly."
I'm on day 9 of the 14 day challenge and for the most part I believe my face and neck look and feel firmer. My only dislike is the smell. It has a bit more fragrance then I prefer for being on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm participating in the #revitalift challenge and have only been using this product for 4 days. However, I can honestly say my skin feels plumper, hydrated and has a dewy glow after day 2. I did not expect to see such a dramatic change in the appearance of my skin, but must say you need to give Revitalift moisturizer a try!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received your package by mail yesterday and tried it last night. The cream was smooth and creamy and the amount provided was abundant and saturated my skin. I was very impressed - Now, I want to see the outcome after I finish all the applications. So far, I thought it was great."
I've been using this cream for two weeks and noticed that my skin felt smoother and softer after a couple of days. I'm allergic to most perfumes and scents but this cream has a nice smell that doesn't bother me at all. I recommend this cream to young and more mature women who want to look and feel better about their faces. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The 14 day sample I received was generous. I felt it was a bit 'fatty' not exactly greasy but did not absorb into my aging skin like my preferred and less expensive moisturizer. I love some of the L'Oreal products but this one I would only buy if my usual one was no longer available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this every morning and night for 14 days. Love the way it goes on. It's not too thin or watery like some of the other brands, and even though it goes on thick, it does not leave a greasy residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm only on day 7 so far and noticed that my skin tone is more even, skin is more hydrated (nice dewey look) and wrinkles are less noticeable. Doesn't feel greasy and my makeup isn't sliding. I like it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Samples were supposed to be enough to use am and pm daily. I found they were a little shy for full coverage. I also would have liked the product to be more moisturizing. Luckily, I'm a huge loreal customer, so I had other products to supplement with. Not very impressed with product. I do LOVE your Age Perfect cell renewal!!!

"I have four days left on the 14 day RevitalLift challage, but my face and neck are alot smoother looking since starting the challenge. I would definitely recommend this product and I'm planning on buying the product for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample through the mail. The first thing I noticed it wasn't oily, it was smooth on my face. I used it at night and my face felt softer and firmer in the morning. I did feel the 14 day test wasn't enough time for me to soften the fine lines and wrinkles. I probably will continue to use Olay due to the fact that Revitalift Triple Power is more expensive. I have recommended to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 5 days into the 14 day sample that I received in the mail. Have been using every morning and evening. I have been really happy with the results. I find that my skin has a nice texture to apply make-up on in the morning. My skin is oily and I have not noticed this making it even more oily. Happy with this, and plan to buy after my trial is over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really was skeptical before I started using it but a few days in I was convinced. This is the best anti-aging moisturizer I've ever used and I could tell a huge difference almost immediately! My skin was brighter, no dark circles it just looked so fresh. Seriously unbelievable product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth which is a must with any product. It seemed to reduce the appearance of lines on my face while reducing dry spots. It also has a pleasant smell compared to some moisturizers I've tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day free trial for L'Oreal Revitalift and I LOVE IT!!! I'm 46 and I have the usual crow's feet, little lines and wrinkles here and there and I started using the L'Oreal Revitalift and all of that just disappeared! My skin is softer, moisturized, the lines are disappearing, my skin is smoother, and I actually have a glow again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After the 2nd day I felt that my skin was softer and smoother. I have noticed a reduction in crows feet i.e. skin around my outer eye feels softer, plumper, smoother. Would be interested in seeing what a full body lotion of this would be like. As some have noted, there is a scent to the product. For me, it was not so strong, as to be a deterrent to use. I will be purchasing this product after the trial is complete. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only just started using Revitalift about 4 days ago . I use it once in the morning and once at night and my skin is so soft and supple ! Pores have diminished plus my skin tone is more even . And it doesn't even take much product at all ! The benefits are wonderful ! Thank you ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my 14 day samples in the mail about a week ago. Started using right a way, seen results within 24 hours. I'm a 44 yr old mom of 6 and have 2 grand babies and it was really showing. It's lifted my face, it looks and feels much healthier than last week. I'm impressed. I will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was chosen to do the 14 day RevitaLift challenge. I LOVE IT! I am 44 years old and in the past few years tried many different products for my face. I am getting the crows feet and laugh lines around my mouth and on my forehead. I never believed that I could find a moisturizers with the power to tighten and reduce my age lines. No matter the cost or where I need to go to purchase RevitaLift I am now a very happy customer!!!!! THANK YOU LOREAL!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the revitalize left challenge in the mail I am on day nine and I have noticed that my skin is firmer and it is smoother definitely more hydrated and some of the wrinkles are less visible now. I am going to continue to the end of the challenge and see how it goes if it continues like it is I will definitely buy this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This provided a good level of moisturizing. I personally did not notice any change to my fine lines, including crows feet. My face felt soft & hydrated. It did not bother my eyes (contacts) like some do. The smell wasn't great, but barely noticeable. It did cause some breakouts on my chin. It may be too heavy for me in the summer. So I guess it would depend on the price to purchase it as a good fall/winter moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a sample of this good for 14 days and honestly I don't have wrinkles or what but the first time I use this I can feel that the product is working you can feel it is tightening your face. So for the price and the effect I would go for this. It's really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far so good, the Revitalift Triple Power Intensive moisturizer is pretty decent! I wish there was an option to update my comment after I finish the challenge but I do not believe it can be done on this site. I will say that my skin feels very nice after my morning and nighttime routine. Maybe it is just me, but I think the cream's scent could be a little lighter. Overall a pretty decent product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the 15 day challenge and was impressed by the item for the price. I use a lot of higher end products and this one was right up there with the others. The only thing I did not like was the consistency. It is very thick and felt heavy on my face. I recommend giving it a try. I just purchased the full size to see what changes I can see while using it at least for one month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am involved in the Revitalife Moisturizer 2-week sampling challenge. I really like how hydrating the moisturizer is. It leaves my skin soft to the touch. I have not noticed a reduction in wrinkles, but perhaps I need to use it longer to see such results. I would prefer a formula that offers SPF protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm impressed, it only took a couple of days before I could see a visable difference in wrinkles and firmness. I even look better in the mornings after I wake. L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power has become my new favorite moisturizer , it works and it doesn't feel too heavy on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had just finished trying out a expensive face routine. I saw better results with Revtalift within a few days then I had two weeks with the other. Best yet is this cost only a quarter of the price of the other stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got the 14 day sample. About one week in and don't think I see any change in my skin. It is very thick and I don't mind wearing it alone. When I try to use it under my make up or tinted sun screen it made it ball up or roll off my face. It does have a strong fragrance but not offensive to me. Disappointed, I like other L'Oreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I ended up receiving a 14 day trial challenge. I LOVE this product. I am only on day 5 of the challenge but I can see a huge difference in my face. It looks and feels smoother and has more hydration . I wpuld recommend this product to friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This creamy, white formula firms, moisturizes and makes the skin look and feel great. I especially liked how it helped my aging chin and neck area and even tried a bit on my hands as well. No side effects from the RevitaLift, just nice results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im a week into the challenge now and I must say my skin is GLOWING its much firmer and look so smooth and beautiful...I have been told I have skin like a baby in the last two days...I see a huge difference myself my wrinkles are slowly disappearing...I Love this face cream so much 5 STARS [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was lucky enough to receive a 14 day trial. I am only on day two and I can see and feel a difference already. I am eager to see what miracles that continue to surface, Maybe I will start getting carded again at 50 years of age!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Revitalift. It reminded me to wash and mosturize my dad every day and night. I would have givin it 5 stars but one day I was running late and thought ""oh I'll just mosturize"" well bad idea it clumped up and flaked off all day! So from them on I made sure to make time to wash and moisturize everytime! Besides that one day it made may face look great! So when I look good I feel good so I will have to keep this in my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my 14 Stay sample Friday and have only been using a few days. So I can't speak on anti again results just yet.This is my first time EVER using drugstore skincare on my face as I have always used expensive premiere brands and I'm impressed so far! The product smells great leaves my skin soft and hydrated my only issue is that I have oily skin and this may be a little to heavy for my skin type in the day. But I do think it's awesome as a night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received the 14 Day Challenge pack.
I am on Day 9 now and have noticed a huge difference. I apply this product in the AM and PM. My face and neck are so smooth and hydrated. I have noticed a small reduction of wrinkles around the eyes. Loving the RevitaLift so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't really pinpoint what has changed, just that I look younger! I did not have any wrinkles to begin with but my skin was ""saggy"". I have used lots of products promising results and I have never written a review on any or them. After using this product I needed to write this review. Do yourself a favor and try RevitaLift.

I started using RevitaLift just a week ago but already the results are amazing. I noticed a big difference in the look & feel of my skin on the first day. I'm looking forward to a long relationship with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So, I love the texture, and how soft my skin feels after I apply this. However, it hasn't done a thing for my crow's feet, and after it dries, it sort of flakes off my skin. Not sure if that's actual skin flaking off (eww) or if it's the lotion itself, but it's gross. Don't think I would spend a lot of money on this, considering I can get moisturizer that does exactly the same thing at my local pharmacy for a mere fraction of the cost of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, I've only been using this for a week but I can tell a difference already. My skin feels so soft and smooth. I can feel a firming lift that I like after applying it. My mom has used this for a long time and loves it. My boyfriend also likes the way it smells. That's always a bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my 14 day sample about 7 days ago and have been using it. I like the way it goes on and it works well on my face at night and also under makeup. I can't tell if it did anything at my age (75) yet but I would repurchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My face and neck have not felt this smooth since I was 20 or so. Believe me, after 56 years of fun in the sun, neglecting my skin until I started to notice changes in it, has left me with fine lines, some age spots, etc. This has been great... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample for 14 day challenge. Fell in love with this product. My skin is smooth, feels refreshed and nourished my skin. I noticed my aging skin seems tighter and wrinkles aren't so defined. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I signed up for the 14 day Revilalift challenge and I am so impressed!! I love how great the cream feels on my face and how fast the results show within one day I was already seeing huge improvements with the elasticity in my face! I'm a True Believer and will be referring this product to anyone and everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am on day nine of the Revitalift challenge and I can already say that I love this product! It is silky and smooths on and absorbs quickly. It has a wonderful light scent as well. I can already see a noticeable decrease in my fine lines. My skin is much smoother. I used this all by itself with no other serums or products in order to see the true effects. I wold recommend this to anyone!
I receive samples of this RevitalLift product 2 weeks ago. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I can already notice a difference in the texture of my skin. I had to go out and buy the product because I was so impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample of this product and was kind of skeptical. After trying for 2 weeks I am a believer. This product makes your face feel and look wonderful. It goes on smooth and creamy and leave your face feeling soft all day long even after applying makeup products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got the 14days trial and it didn't disappoint me. I'm 39 with a no-blemish, dry to normal skin type. The moment I apply it, can see and feel the instant effect which is smooth , firm and assuring. Today is the 6th day of the 14 day-trial and I've zero complaints ! I'll be back after 8 more days with before and after pics .."
keep glowing :*
I got this as a sample and have been using it for 10 days. It makes my skin soft but I too find it doesn't absorb all the way into the skin. I am 66 so maybe this is just a problem for older women. I probably would not buy this either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this as a sample. #revitaliftchallenge . I'm loving everything about this! The smell, the texture, the skin benefits etc. I have no complaints. I have acne, scarring, discoloration and dryness. This cream has helped in all areas [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm on my 3rd day of my free trial and I have to say that so far I really LOVE this product... it smells amazing and it makes my face so soft!! When this trial is over I WILL be buying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love it! Loreal is my go to for facial care and this product doesn't disappoint. The cream goes on smooth and light. It has a pleasant fragrance. Immediate results. My pores and fine lines faded leaving my face looking soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am on day 7 of the 14 day challenge and I love the way my skin looks and feels! I also experienced the flaking but realized that I had used too much of the packet on that day. I love that you can apply a light layer and have hydrated skin that looks tighter and toned!
"I received my Revitalift as a 14 day trial. I have used it only for a couple of days, so I don't have a lot to say now. But, I can say, after each use my skin feels so soft! I cant wait too see all the benefits by day 14 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a free sample in the mail to try Revitalift for 14 days. I am only 8 days into my trial and I can already see a difference. My skin isnt oily. Its softer and healthier looking. I love it! My new secret weapon against aging! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i got my free samples in the mail and started using the cream 4 days ago. i love the texture and the way it works into my skin. but once i put it on it looks like it is totally drying out my skin and it my wrinkles are more visible. i will continue using up my samples and hope it will be different the more i use the cream. because i really love l'oreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this for two weeks and I can already see a difference in my skin! Even after the first time using it I could tell that it was going to be a great moisturizer. My skin is soft and smooth and even though it is a heavy moisturizer, it did not make me break out. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use Loreal Age Perfect as my every day moisturizer but was quite impressed with the sample of the Triple power moisturizer. It leaves my skin smoother than my normal skin. If any critic remark I could say is that the moisturizer leaves a tacky feeling on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did the challenge and I would most defiantly buy this product .. her a just a few reasons why .. it's smells amazing , it feels amazing and a little goes a long way. My skin felt better instantly ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my sample of REVITALIFT Moisturizer and am on day 8 and I look forward to putting this product on my face.It goes on smooth and feels nice on my skin.I am seeing a lot of improvement in my fine lines on my face! IWILL purchase this product! Thank you for letting me try it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am in the midst of the 14 day trial. I thought because it's so thick that it would be heavy and sticky on my skin, but it wasn't! It does tend to clog my pores but I have oily skin. I use it sparingly now and the results are nice. I do feel so far that my skin has a softer appearance, softened my fine lines and is a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received RevitaLift sample pack in mail and starting using it right away. I could actually feel the skin under my eyes tingle . I felt my skin become softer and more radiant. The only downside is that I used RevitaLift on my entire face and having Oily T-Zones I should of only used on certain parts of my face. As it made my TZone area a big shiny and oily. Overall I loved RevitaLift and will definitely purchase . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is by far the best anti aging cream I have ever tried. I can feel the tightness on my face and neck but yet my face feels very moisturized. Believe me I have tried a variety of face creams and so far the RevitaLift is and will always be my first choice. I have even gotten a few compliments about how my face looks more refreshed and it has a glow to it. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try this amazing cream.
"I'm on day 8 of my 14 days free trial. The results are amazing, definitely great moisturizing. My skin felt softer from day 1. By now I notice my crow feet wrinkles are a little less visible, less harsh and overall skin appearance has improved, my face looks smoother and firmer, the complexion is more even. The cream itself is quickly absorbed, not greasy, has pleasant texture. I am planning to by a version with an SPF as to increase protection to my skin. Awesome product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free 14-day sample pack from L'Oreal, allowing me to use the product twice daily. After 12 days of use, all I can say is it's a lovely moisturizer. My fine lines are still there and I see no visible 'lift' or change in my skin. My skin is soft and that's nice, but I don't see any anti-aging effects, and for the price, I don't think it's worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received samples of this in the mail. Was a little disappointed that it didnt come with instructions. I used the product day and night, the samples were much more than I needed for one use. I did notice that it was kind of greasy and that I broke out a few times from it. I could feel and did notice my skin was a little firmer. I just received the product not long ago, so I am still using it. I would recommend and continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in the 14 day trial package and have really enjoyed it. It was difficult to find enough in the packet to cover my face and neck for 2 applications. I am thankful to have been chosen to try. I noticed a brightness in my tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I felt and could see an immediate change on day one of using RevitaLift. The previous product that I had been using for many years had never left my skin feeling this good. RevitaLift leaves my skin feeling smooth to touch and not sticky and my liquid makeup looks more fabulous than ever using on top of this moisturizer. My skin and makeup has not looked and felt this good since I was a teenager. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did the 14 day challenge. I would say I am impressed. My skin was soft and moisturized the whole day. I also had a cold, so even with all the nose wiping I didn't get a sore nose using this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 2 week sample of Revitalift Moisturizer and i'm 1 week into it. I tend to break out easily and woohoooo i have not and my skin feels so silky smooth! I will definitely be making the switch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my 14 day sample for the revitalift challenge 5 days ago, my skin feels great looks better and my eyes where crows feet live they have softened. Only complaint is the acne that has appeared on my jaw line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am doing the 14 day sample trial. I thought that the amount allotted for each day look insufficient. Well, I was wrong. Just a small amount does the job! It almost makes my skin feel more dense and ironed out. My face becomes smooth, like peach skin."
I don't wear foundation. It I imagine it would be a great primer.
I have to admit I was skeptical but the trial made me a believer. This product made my skin firmer and my wrinkles less noticeable.
"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it left a sort of residue on my skin that rubbed off weirdly. I thought my skin was peeling but it wasn't. I discovered that as long as I didn't rub my face, it didn't happen. So 4 stars but I great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Excellent product. I have used a few of Loreal product in the past but truly love how my skin looks and feel. i can see the difference. Thanks . I have already purchased and will be sharing this with my girlfriends.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so pleased with the Revitalift samples I received, (enough to actually know if you'd like it) I could tell after the 1st couple of uses that it was a great moisturizer. Absorbed quickly, thick creamy and smelled light and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received free sample to do the challenge. I am overjoyed at the way my face feels and looks. The skin is softer, more hydrated and looks amazing. This is now my new product that will be used daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm only 29, but was born and raised out in the brutal Florida sun. I'm an active outdoors woman, and have a bad habit of not protecting my skin. This stuff is wonderful! I noticed reduced wrinkle within the first few days. My face felt awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I just received the 14 day samples so I can't give a full revew now. So far so good though. My skin feels softer. I like the scent of this product. Not overpowering. I will check in again after the 14 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used it for one day but I couldn���t stand the scent. I have allergies to scented products and I only use un scented because of that reason. I didn't realize it was a scented product until I applied it to my face. I gave it to my sister to try since she can use scented products.
"Oh my Goodness! This stuff is FABULOUS! Within the first 3 days, family and friends were asking me what I was doing to my skin. I feel like it took ten years off my age! I absolutely love this stuff and I'm hooked! I'll be keeping this in my skin care inventory from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how moisturizing this creme was, it did not irritate or dry my skin out, which lots of products I have tried have done in the past. It is easy to apply and use on the daily. I would recommend this product to everyone and use it as part of there skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very impressed with this product! It has a pleasant scent and it smooths on silkily, without that ""greasy feel."" My face appears to be less wrinkly after using this for the 14 days....Thanks for the free sample, it was truly worth my time and effort to apply daily!"
"Received my sample pack & couldn't wait to try it. Easy to apply & use - results were slow at first but then just keep getting better & better, what could I expect at 66 yrs old - If that's 14 days can't wait to continue on - Thanks for the trial sample [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 8 days into my 14 day trial routine and I love this moisturizer. With combination skin it isn't easy to find a light weight moisturizing routine until now. RevitaLift is not watery but is not heavy. Smooth to dry and no oily residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was part of the 14 day challenge, but did not receive product to participate all 14 days, but after 7 days I can see benefits. As a 63 year old woman I am starting to see some cheek and forhead wrinkles. The Revitalift helped fill in and smooth wrinkles. I have always had two deep wrinkles between my eyebrows. It also helped with those, I wish I had been using this product years ago. I will definately continue to use. Thank you for the opportunity to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I requested the sample of the 14 day challenge. It hydrated well enough, but there was just way too much fragrance. It was just so overwhelming and irritated my skin. Sadly I couldn't finish the challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have super dry skin especially on my nose but after using this for a few weeks I no longer have much dry skin! This is the only moisturizer that works for me! I haven't noticed a ton of benefits when it relates to fine lines but the moisture part is spectacular! I like the smell too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent a 7 day sample to try, and let me tell you I could tell a difference on the first day. My face was needing some tinder loving moisturizer. I believe I've found a moisturize that gives my skin that Revitalift. My face feels firmer and softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did a 14-day challenge and I have to say I am very pleased with the results. My skin and neck feel baby soft! I love how hydrated my skin is. I have used oil of olay since I was a teenager, I must say this is right up there with my favorite Olay moisturizer. The price is high but you get what you pay for if you want your skin to feel it's best you have to be willing to pay a little more. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product recently as a 14 day trial so my review is only based on the past few days. After day 1 I did notice a little bit of a change. I noticed it lifted my skin and made it feel not only smooth but tight. I used make up right after with no problems either, but I did wait until the product was fully dry before applying my make up. I can't wait to see what happens after the trial period. I will right another review then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im not done trying this and it wanting me write view to early so far its ok only making my skin soft and moisture some what smooth cant tell much at the time with aging maybe using it even more but will buy this product im only sampling it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my samples of Revivalist about a week ago. My face and neck feel considerly softer since I started using the product. The area around my mouth has begun to firm up and the creases have lessen in that area as well. Thank you for letting me try this cream. Looking forward to finishing the samples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Though no cream can make my fine lines disappear or truly firm my skin back to youthful its days, Revialift left it more radiant and much softer to the touch. It is creamy and luscious without any heaviness. Felt like an expensive cream, and I felt pampered. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm on day 10 of the 14 day trial and I am pleased with the results so far. I love the fragrance of the moisturizer. I'm very pleased with this moisturizer, it also works great for my neck and décolleté area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is very rich and it is lightly fragranced. Very nourishing to the skin, left me with a smooth, glowing complexion. I used it day and night for about a week and I got a few pimples. Not the product's fault, I think it is just too rich for me. I believe this would be great product for someone with dry to extra dry skin. it felt wonderful especially on my neck and décolletage. But I have to keep it off my T zone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I also received the 14 day trial for RevitaLift. It works pretty well. I can see a difference not just in the small lines, but the overall appearance of my skin. Can't say that I'm crazy about the scent though. I'd prefer unscented or something lighter scented. I am considering purchasing the product to use it for a few months just to see if it continues to help. Thank you, Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for 14 days and can notice an improvement in my skin already. I use it all over my face and neck including around my eyes. I can see less fine lines and wrinkles and my skin is so soft. It's the only product I'm using now when before I used several different layers of products. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using a 14 day trial of Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Intensive Anti-Aging Moisturizer, my face feels soft, supple and oh so pampered! Just applying it twice a day has been an immense pleasure. I enjoy the light scent and a few minutes of pampering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm only on day 5 and so far I love it. On day 1 I love the way it made my skin feel soft without feeling greasy. I have noticed a slight difference with improving my fine lines. I will update on days to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day trial to sample and give my honest opinion on my results. I absolutely love this cream! It smells good and it's so soft and luxurious! I have used creams and serums for 3x what this cost for a jar and they didn't come close to the hydrated soft and supple skin I got from using this for not quite 2 weeks yet! I will definitely be buying this when I am finished with my last couple days worth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After receiving the free samples, I used as directed and my face is feeling softer and moisturized. I don't know how much firmer it is but it feels great putting it on. I think a longer usage would have more results showing a difference in the firmness and overall look and feel of my skin. I loved how creamy and non greasy it was also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream made my skin very soft. I am prone to break outs on certain creams. This was my first time trying this cream and no breakouts. I have oily skin and it didn't make my skin feel anymore oily. I didn't notice any visible changes yet cause I've only used it for 2 weeks this far but it will be a cream that I plan to continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the thick luxurious consistency of this cream and it was pure pleasure adding this cream to my beauty routine. Although the cream was thick it never felt heavy on my skin and in a few days I could tell a dramatic difference in my healthier and more vibrant looking skin. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends and keep it as “our secret!” [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the 14 day Revitalift Challenge, you had me hook line and sinker after my first day. I love the feel, and what Revitalift does to my aging face skin. I feel so much better and after purchacing a full jar Revitalift, I will use it for the rest of my life. My wrinkles get less and less with each and every use. 5 stars all the way."
I am so glad i was able to try samples of loreal revitalift triple moisturizer it is one of the best moisturizers on the market it definitely works well and i was able to see results almost immediately! i have already recommended to friends and family and will buy myself very soon!

"I am on my second week of using RevitaLift and it is wonderful. I have extremely sensitive skin and there is no redness, irritation or break-outs. My skin feels smooth and soft. I can't wait to put it on and feel so good without heaviness or shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this to be a heavy moisturizer with great staying power. The texture is very creamy and feels cool on the skin. For me it is a bit too rich for daytime under makeup (hard to blend makeup in over it) but I find it exceptional for a night cream. After using this for two weeks, my skin feels very soft with plenty of moisture which can only be a good thing. I will be using this as my new night cream moving forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 2 week sample of Revitalift in exchange for an honest review. I saw an improvement in my skin tone and my skin looked smoother. My only complaint was that it didn't have SPF and I had to add another layer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my sample about 10 days ago. I have used it every day and evening. I like the feel of my facial skin, but have seen very little improvement with my fine lines and wrinkles, and although the instructions state to use the cream on my neck, there was not enough in the sample to do both daily treatments and my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great moisturizer. At first I was a little put off by the scent, it smelled too much like perfume for me, but that does quickly fade. The moisturizer is nice and thick. I have only been using for about 10 days, but I do believe it has helped reduce the redness on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am almost finished with my 14 day trial. I use Lancôme and Este Lauder products and this product certainly holds its own against the high end products and for significantly less in price. I love the fragrance, and consistency. It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I prefer a serum to a cream, this was a bit heavy for me however it improved wrinkles around my mouth and in between my eyebrows after 7 days. It faded an age spot somewhat and it appears smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a 14 day trial sample; I'm only on day 7, but I can say I've seen a difference in some of the fine lines around my lips and eyes. It absorbs well into my skin under my makeup in the mornings and softens my skin in the evenings after I remove my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free two week sample of RevitaLift and will purchase more when my samples run out. Skin looks healthier, more supple, more radiant and more youthful. It goes on smoothly and liquid makeup can be applied on top without a mess like some products. I'll be sure to tell my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent the 14 day sample pack challenge via USPS and I loved it it made the really hard to remove frown line in between my eyebrows become less visible. This is a great product and I will be using the enclosed envelope to buy more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the 14 day samples and had enough to share with my Fiance. I was a bit concerned because I have very sensitive, dry eyes, but this was perfect. We both spend a lot of time out in the sun and were surprised with the almost immediate results with the lifting and smoothing of deep lines caused by the sun. Thanks so much Revitalift. We will be purchasing more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this to try as a 14 day challenge. At first I was skeptical, but RevitaLift Moisturizer is really silky smooth to apply and I can use it night and day. I didn't have break outs, and I did notice changes in my skin right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this has been an amazing product to use for the last 14 days. first thing that i noticed was the smell i love it, then i noticed how my skin was still so moisturized the next day, it is a lot better than more expensive creams i have bought in the past. i will definitely be buying this product again and again so glad i took the challenge.

"Revitalift is an effective wonder product that does produce some results for skin. The problem is that it is too heavy and oily on my skin, my pores cannot breath, and it seems to clog the pores, which can cause problems. My skin is already oily so I don't think this is for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample. My skin has never felt so soft!! I have noticed some of my fine lines under my eyes have tightened and look much better. I always have trusted L'Oreal products, but they have a amazing one here. Will keep using!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the RwvitaLift 14 day challange and I am pleased with this product. Thecream absorbs quickly and is never sticky. While I can't say I look younger I can definetely say my skin feels smoother. Thanks, Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using REVITALIFT for 2 weeks (AM and PM). I'm not sure that things are lifted, but I have noticed an overall improvement in my skin. It feels and looks softer and smoother. I noticed a difference after the first use ! The smell is very nice and my skin drank it right in. It definitely moisturizes instantly. Great product. Thank you !

I did the 14 day challenge and wow what a difference. My face has never felt smoother or softer since using this product. I was amazed that my oily skin didn't have any breakouts while using this. I will keep this as part of my daily facial routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Revitalift before and it so well for me. Maybe as I have gotten older,my skin has become more sensitive but every time I used it, I broke out like a teenage hypersensitive prom queen. Sorry,I cant use it. I know it is a very good product and I use Loreal quite often.For this reason I rate it 4 stars,still would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this facial moisturizer so much, especially when combined with L'Oréal Revitalift Cleanser. It is so smooth, the perfect consistency and it goes on effortlessly, even around the eye area where the skin is thinner. It feels so great on my skin and leaves it feeling super hydrated. The light clean fragrance makes it seem like such a luxury when I use it. I love these products, and they are so affordable. Thank you L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a sample for 14 days. I am so pleased once I started using this product. From the feel on your skin to the brighter tone and the reborn softness. This really does bring some of the lost youth of your skin back! Please give this a try I'm sure you will be as happy as I am. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am on day 11 of the 14 day challenge received an email asking for my review. Honestly, I haven't noticed a difference in my skin at all. It leaves a sticky, tacky feeling on my skin hours after application. Sadly, I won't be purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my samples, and used RevitaLift moisturizer for 2 weeks, twice daily. The fine wrinkles in my forehead started to appear again, so I will no longer use this. The L'Orieal Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition cream works beautifully for me, and I'm going back to it today. The RevitaLift would work well on younger skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample of this, I'm on day 10 and I notice a big difference in the firmness and brightness in my skin! Very thick and creamy but doesn't leave my face oily, I can hardly tell it's there once it's been rubbed in. It smells amazing too, not too powerful and overwhelming. I would purchase this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a 14 day sample of RevitaLift and I'm 5 days in and my face feels great. It has made my face feel softer and I can tell it's working on my fine lines. I finally found a product I know works instead of buying something else and have that not work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of this product and I'm so glad I asked for it. I can't say enough about it. It refirmed my total face. It helped me with my wrinkles, my skin is so soft and glowing. I love it and it will be a part of my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received my 14 day sample and I'm on day 3 using it. For me, it's a bit thick than I'm use to, so I am able to use my samples longer. My skin does feel smoother. I prefer to use it at night, because I feel like it's to thick for the day. I live in Florida and it's hot right now. I'm looking forward to see what happens in another week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a more than generous 14 day sample. It was amazing! Day one, my face felt so silky smooth. I'm on day 8, and it looks like some of my fine lines around my eyes and mouth are less visible. I have found my new favorite moisturizer! Thank You! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received as a 14 day sample. On day 1 I was pleased with it's silky texture and the scent was light. Day three I noticed even skin tone and no break outs. Day 7 wrinkles were less vivid, less visible to the eye and selfies were better visibly. Day 9 was asked if I had something done to my face, told I looked refreshed and YOUNGER!! Day 13 went to purchase RevitaLift before running out of my sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the L'Oréal Revitalift Triple Power for 24 days. I would like to recommend this product to every one with dry or aging skin. It made my wrinkles less noticeable and my skin was softer and less dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am on day 6 of my samples. It does make my face feel smoother, but has done nothing for the lines or re-firming my skin, yet. I love the fragrance. I'll continue to use the sample & see. The price of this cream is too expensive for my budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm really loving this Loreal RevitaLift I participated in the 14 day challenge I faithfully used this product and I'm loving my skin is brighter hydrated soft smooth and my overall complexion has improved I noticed results right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my 14 day samples on Oct 13. I have used Loreal products before and they make my skin soft smooth and hydrated, so did this one. I used this twice a day and without any toner or serum and it gave me the same effect. Only problem I noticed one or two age spots developing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, I received this as a 14 day 'challenge' promo. I have to say, its very moisturizing, creamy and greaseless!! I noticed my skin's overall appearance improving after a few days of use. I hope to continue use of it. I will see what my budget says Lol. It is a bit pricey, but the quality speaks for itself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin feels smoother, I look younger then I did before, I'm in my fifties, but Revitalift has made me look like I'm in my early forties. Can't count the gray In my hair, since I had that since I was in my early twenties. Have 3 sisters I will be telling about this amazing moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am finishing my second week of using this product and can't say enough great things about the product! I am asked why I my skin looks so great and what I've had done. Great application, no irritation and best of all results! Can't wait to see how much more my skin will improve! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the RevitaLift for a 14 day challenge and I couldn't be more satisfied with the results. It made my skin feel soft, smooth, and firmer. It reduced the appearance of wrinkles and made my skin look so much younger. I absolutely love this product it made my skin look and feel wonderful! I will definitely be purchasing more for myself and would recommend it to anyone that wants a more youthful appearance and firmer skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a diabetic with really dry skin, and this Revitalift triple Power has made a noticeable (to me, anyway) difference in the appearance of my skin. After 13 days of using this at night, my face is smoother and not so dry looking. I really like it :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't receive my 12 day challenge samples on time. So I am on day 9. I have to say that I have noticed a visible improvement in my skin. My skin tone seems more even and a bit brighter. I have to say I have noticed enough of a difference to purchase this product for regular use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received samples of this to try out for 14 days and let me just say I love it, my skin is a bit firmer and my skin is smooth and moisturized and soft my face looks smoother and healthier and definitely not as dull as it was.. I will be buying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using this a.m. and p.m. for over a week. Love how moisturizing it is, but I think it's better for p.m. application. It is so thick and moisturizing that when applying in morning it was too slick to go under my makeup without a lot of shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I immediately started using my Revitalift two week challenge when I received the great sample sized packages. Upon applying the moisturizer I knew that the formula was what my skin needed! I love seeing my skin healthy and glowing. I feel like my complexion doesn't even need coverup! Love the results and am sharing with my friends and family the good news! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am on day 8 of my 14 day trial and I can say that I can see that my skin is visibly smoother and firmer. I don't have any issues using it with foundation like others have said since I use a primer before I put on any makeup. At age 50 many people comment that my face doesn't show my age at all. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product and while I don't have excess wrinkles I do have dry skin, and some crows feet. I feel like this did a great job at reparing my dry skin and plumping my skin. The only thing I didn't like was the scent. I would prefer a more fresh scent to the floral scent. Floral really isn't my thing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 2 week supply and was shocked that my face and neck felt awesome and young. When I received it I was not sure what to expect and at 48 I thought it would not change my skin. But to my surprise, I love how it made my face and neck feel young and great. My skin feels like it is the skin of a 20-year-old.I have had several people say that they think I am in my 20-30's. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a skin care lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the 14 day challenge. I got my product a week late so I'm only on day 7 but I see a change for the better. I've used a lot of different products and this does what it says. It's not plastic surgery but for a bottle of face cream it's worth the price [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I did the 14 day Challenge and let me tell you this product is amazing not only does my skin feel amazing the wrinkles I was starting to have now have almost completely vanished I can not get through to you have much I love this stuff going thank you loreal
"I've been using it for 5 days and my skin is way softer than expected. It really works. I tried several different moisturizers and none of them got this results. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because my skin gets shinny after 4 hours using it, so I need to re-touch my make-up more often that with other products. Nevertheless, it is perfect for the weekends when I try not to use make-up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin and typically use Pond's (which works great and less expensive), but this product made my skin feel super hydrated as well as tighter. I really like this product, but the price is steep! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was part of the #revitaliftchallenge and am now on Day 8. I noticed results probably after Day 2 and it just gets better everyday. The moisturizer is so silky and makes my dry skin look alive again. I will definitely be a loyal user from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day free trail of Revitalift. A little went a long way and it did moisturize my skin and make it feel good. I tend to get irritated skin with a lot of products but this didn't irritate me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this anti aging moisturizer from RevitaLift. I took the #RevitaliftChallenge and used it for 14 days. At first I was a little bit skeptical, but over time I was very impressed on how my skin felt after using it. My skin was very soft and smooth. My complexion looks brighter. It's the only moisturizer you will need, night and day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only gave it a 4 because for some reason it burns under my eyes after I wash my face, but nothing else burns or feels off. It is a little oily but your face is so smooth and soft when it's soaked in and especially after the 14 day challenge it feels like a whole new face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am only on day #4, but it is making an impression on me. The frangrance is subtle and pleasant, and the moisturizing action is powerful. In fact, I am hoping that the increased ""hydration"" does not cause skin eruptions. We shall see. So far, I do not notice any effect upon puffiness or darkness around eyes nor wrinkle improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great product. It does what says it will do. My face is lifted and firmed. But it's not really any different from the Neutrogena product I was already using. And my product was less expensive. Thanks for letting me try it but I'm sticking with my previous product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day challenge samples in the mail. This is such a great product. My fave and eye area was so soft after applying the product. The scent smells so good. I will definitely be purchasing this product. I can't image using anything else to keep my face soft and supple. I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful with using new products. This lotion is perfect for even sensitive skin. Really happy I got to sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Example I have used the Revitalift for only a short time but am already receiving remarks about how great my skins looks. My skin looks revitalized..lines have appeared to have lessened and skin looks so much softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the smell of this, Its not super strong but nice and subtle. The forumla is creamy and not to thick which makes it easy to rub in. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave my face feeling oily or tacky. I've got crows feey around my eyes from squinting and this helped diminish them and make my skin look more plump and a nice healthy glow. I'll definitely be buying more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely ran out to buy this and hope i never run out or you never quit selling this product. This has made a huge difference in my skin in only a few short days. I love that my crows feet are hardly noticeable and my skin actually looks luminous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was sent to me in the mail as a free trail for 10 days. My skin is visibly brighter, and the wrinkles around my eyes faded. The dream it self is very light feeling yet extremely moisturizing. I highly recommend giving this a go is you are looking for am affordable face cream to reduce wrinkles at an affordable price. I will be ordering the full size, I love it. I've used loreal face creams, eye creams, oils etc..and I love them all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a week as part of the RevitaLift Challenge and am very happy with the results. My skin feels moisturized, fine lines and wrinkles appear smoother. I even see a tightness in the skin under my jawline--my chin is a bit more prominent than it had been just a week ago! Very pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this revitalift cream free to try and see if I like it. I don't just like it, I love it. It actually does work. It doesn't leave your skin oily. When you apply it at night and the next morning your skin looks and feels great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product & I am very pleased with the results. My skin looks and feels amazing since using it. I am always looking for great products for my aging skin & I believe I found it, will continue using in my every day routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream has a thick yet blendable texture that I love. After I apply it, especially under my eyes, I like to pat my skin and feel how soft and dewy it is. It makes an excellent night cream, as I find it more emollient than similar products. Would definitely recommend giving it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using RevitaLift now for almost 3 weeks. I love the scent, I love how it glides on your skin. I really am seeing results, my skin is polished, firm, uplifted. It feels and looks great. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received my 14 day trial and I just have to say this product is amazing. just after 2 days skin was noticeably firmer and felt so much softer. I can absolutely say I will be purchasing this product soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Used for the 14 days morning and night. It was super thick, heavy and greasy feeling. But my skin did feel moisturized till the next application and firm to the touch. Fine lines around eye were less noticeable and makeup didn't crease there as much. I don't see it doing too much for deeper wrinkles tho. It does smell nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm only on Day 10 of the 14-day Challenge, but I have noticed my skin has extra moisture. This is great for the winter months' drying cold. The lotion's texture would be a little too thick for summertime but I'll appreciate the layer of protection in winter. Thanks for letting me participate in the 14-day Challenge...I'll certainly be purchasing a bottle when it's done! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used it for several days with no issue and seemed like a great product. then it started having the same weird reaction with my makeup as I have read in other reviews. Not sure what changed, maybe its not fully absorbing any more or something... I will give it a few more tries but I can't keep wearing it if the issue continues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream applies and absorbs easily. Feels really good on face. Not greasy.
"I used a 10 day trial and although I don't see a big improvement in the appearance of my facial skin, I probably would buy it to extend the time of use and then see how it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample product of Loreal Rivitalift for free. I absolutely love this product. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin hydrated. It also helps some with the little lines I have. This is a great product and I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"L'Oreal provided me with generous samples to complete the RevitaLift Challenge and requested an honest review. After using the samples for 14 days and even though my skin definitely falls into the category of 'aging', I found that this is not a product I can use in my regular routine. I still have somewhat combination, acne-prone skin and unfortunately, this product caused my face to break-out. I can say that the product felt nice on my skin, though, and truly felt hydrating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use Revitalift so was excited to try this new product sample. My skin must be too oily for it to absorb properly. It felt much too heavy and then when I tried to put on my foundation, it just rolled off in long white coils. I am still trying by using only small drops of it on my face. It seems to be clogging up my pores. I will continue to use it, hoping for some success on wrinkles. It's too early to tell yet."
"I got a free, two week sample to try this out. I am only half-way through it. Even though I have only been using it a short time, I feel like it's decreased my pore visibility on my cheeks and decreased the visibility of fine lines around my eyes. The only negative things that I have to say is that it's a pretty thick cream, so I used it after I got out of the shower, before bed (like a PM cream ) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did 14 day challenge, it did moisturise my skin better, I still got slight dry spot on top of cheeks sometimes and in first few days got some.spots until skin got used to richness of cream, all in all now that skin has adapted, I would buy definitely as some issues I have with my skin are resolved with this cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a 14 day sample, and although I have not completed all 14 days yet, I have found this product to be extremely moisturizing. I can tell that some women might want to only use this as a night treatment because it is very saturating and leaves my face a bit shiny before makeup application, but because my skin tends to be on the dry side, I don't mind at all, I like that extra moisture layer under my primer and makeup. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the #freesamples provided by @LorealParis. I absolutely loved the way it made my skin feel so soft, and smooth. My fine lines, and wrinkles started to go away. I also noticed my skin felt firmer. It doesn't leave a greasy feel behind, which I really liked. A little goes a long way, so it's definitely worth the money. A great product that delivers great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I want to start by saying I'm a huge fan of all Loreal Paris products and I had the chance to try this amazing product for 14 days and I want to say I love results because my skin looks and feels great, my skin is firmer and is smoother which I love. I received a 14 day samples in the mail to try for 14 days from Loreal for testing purposes. Everyone needs to take the #REVITALIFTCHALLENGE to see for themselves.

"I am on day 6 of the 14-day Revitalift Challenge & do like the way that this product makes my skin look and feel. I use it every morning & evening after I wash my face, but find that the scent can be overpowering. I would be more inclined to buy it if it came in an ""Unscented"" variety. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day supply to try for free. I love this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling so soft and moisturized. My skin looks great after 14 days of use.

"I've been using this daily and have been happy with it. I have pretty sensitive skin that doesn't react well with many products on the market; however, this product didn't irritate my skin at all. It feels nice on the skin, not heavy and absorbs well. It has a slight fragrance which is nice, but not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Received a 14 day trial, and I am only a few days in. I can say this product makes my skin feel super soft and smooth, when used as nightime moisturizer. It is a bit heavy for me for this climate, but in winter--it will be a winner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got the 14 day trial of RevitaLift and I must say this product is Amazing. The 1st time I used it you could visibly see a difference, it tightened, smoothed and made skin so soft. It didn't cause any breakouts which is a definite plus. I would highly recommend RevitaLift!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being a male I thought it would be interesting to see the affects first hand this marvelous product had on my skin. WOW, I was truly surprised by the affect it had on my skin. Now I see why this product is so highly recommended and regarded by women of all ages and walks of life. I not only recommend this product but, shall I say dare other men to give it a try. Your significant other will be pleased by the outcome, mine was."
"I was pleasantly surprised with how much plumper my wrinkly forehead felt after using this product. It made it feel much softer and less wrinkled. The other softer lines on my face were less noticeable, also. The scent was too strong for me. I tried not to use it around my nose, but felt that I should use it around my mouth, because like most women I have fine lines around my mouth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from L'Or��al as well as from influenster in the past. This moisturizer is so nice and thick & keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated. If you tend to have oily skin I can see this being a little too thick, but it is definitely perfect for dry, cold winters! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have the 14 day challenge kit, it's really sticky feeling on my face, I was really excited to try it after seeing people's results but I am a bit disappointed. I am currently on day 7 and can not see any visible results yet and like I said it makes my face feel sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample and after 2 days thought it was a great product. On the third day I started having a clumping up or flaking off type issue. I'm still not sure what the cause was, but when I stopped using RevitaLift the issue went away. Not a good product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My mother has sworn by this product for years and I have to agree after using it that it is wonderful.

I received the revitalift challenge samples in the mail and after using this product for two weeks I didn't notice any major changes in the aging department but it did leave my skin feeling very soft.

"I made sure that I followed the instructions. One packet is to be used on clean skin in the morning and evening. The product isn't to greasy and feels nice going on. However after a few hours, my skin no longer felt hydrated like it should. I didn't see much of a difference in my skin or as we call them smile lines. This product may work for others, but not for me. Thank you L,Oreal for letting me try out your product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14-day sample pack of Revitalift Triple Power Intensive Anti-Aging Day Cream Moisturizer about a week ago. I trust the L'Oreal brand, so I didn't hesitate to start the Revitalift Challenge. Right from Day 1, I felt an immediate difference in the smoothness of my skin, and after a week I could actually see a difference in the reduction of fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been trying this for 5 days. It's ok. My skin feels too saturated though and the product rolls when I start applying foundation. I wait for it to be absorbed but sometimes it just stays there. When it works well, my skin feels amazing. I wish it was less expensive in the market as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a 2 week sample as part of the RevitaLift Challenge and I have really enjoyed using this product. I can already see a difference in just 2 weeks. The product is light not greasy on your skin. I'm always careful about which moisturizer I use because I am prone to breakouts but this did not cause any breakouts at all. I particularly like how soothing it felt around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm been using this product for the last couple of days and I can definitely see the difference my usually oily face has been so dry and I was trying everything under the sun to help my dryness but this was the the only product to help.

"I am still using my 14 day trial offer. I love that my skin is much softer but I have had a few breakouts so I have cut it back to using it only at night. After about two days, I was told several times at work that my skin looked really good. That never happens so it must be the RevitaLift. I am definitely going to keep going with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for almost 2 weeks. I have noticed some change in the wrinkles under my eyes, they are softer looking. As far as the rest of my face, it feels very sticky. I tried with and without makeup and had the same result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample kit and I am in love! My skin feels smoother, dark circles have lessened and I feel like I look younger! I am in my 40's but have always suffered with deep dark circles under my eyes and uneven skin tones. Revitalift has helped with all of those things and more! It smells nice and goes on really smooth. Makes my hands soft as well! Will definitely be purchasing this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only had this product for about a week, so all results are not in yet. I see much improvement in moisiturizing my skin, but no reduction in wrinkles at this time. I wish it weren't so expensive. Doesn't fit into my budget at all. Overall, it is definitely worth trying, if you can afford it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started the 14 day trial and I noticed improved skin appearance the first day. My skin looks and feels soft and smooth. Looking forward to the final few days of my trial! I did notice if I used to much it would roll off on my skin once it dries. I adapted the amount I used and everything was great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the Revitalift Challenge and I am so glad that I did! I will be purchasing this product and using it from this day on. My skin around my eyes is firmer, hardly any wrinkles in just 14 days. IT is amazing. If you have not tried it I highly reccomend. there is no greasy or oily feeling when it is applied and you will see the results in days.

I took the RevitaLift 14 day challenge and sad to say I did not notice any of the improvements that others had claimed they did. I did like the texture and the way it felt when I applied it. It was not oily nor did it leave a greasy feeling on my face. Would I purchase it the answer is no.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the Revitalift challenge, I'm now on 10. This stuff is great. I love the way my skin looks and feels. Super soft. It's a little heavy when you put it on but it dries quickly and doesn't stay greasy. I recommend this product! I really like the way my skin looks.

"I was recently sent a free 2 week sample, Updates & Shipping we right on time. As for the product it had a very nice smell, it didnt clog my pores amd made my face feel smooth. I noticed quickly the small change in my skin. I give it a 4 only because it wasn't as dramatic as the product was advertised. However it did do what it said it would & with a larger supply i guarentee it would give you the results you would expect. Overall I'm satisfied & may purchase this in the future.

"I was a little hesitant in the beginning, because of the texture of the cream. I was used to wearing a Clinique water based moisturizer. I'm very happy I tried the Revitalift! My skin is super soft and my fine lines hare all but gone. It plumped them out! I bought a jar after my sample ran out! Love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am nearing the end of a 14 day trial. This moisturizer has a very pleasant odor. It does seem to help make my skin softer a bit, but there is some product that seems to be peeling off, leaving fragments. Although this is a nice product, there is no way they can justify the price. Plain coconut oil works better."
I received this product as a sample. I used it for 14 days straight and definitely saw a difference in my skin. It was softer and smoother. I looked forward to putting it on every evening. It has such a luxurious feel to it. I feel that for me it is a little pricey but could definitely fall in the splurge category. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am in the middle of doing the 14-day challenge. I am on day 5. I am extremely pleased with this. Sometimes moisturizers, especially those with fragrance, will cause me to break out even though I have normal to dry skin. This one did not. My skin looks soft and dewy, even after only four complete days of using this. I will continue to use it. The fact that I can get it at the drugstore makes it even better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I took the revitalift 14 day challenge and I am loving this product so far. I thought at first that it was too thick and heavy for me but once it's all rubbed in and dries down it is actually very light. My skin is softer then it's been in a very long time even with the weather changing which causes my skin to become super dry. I have sensitive breakout prone skin and I had absolutely no problem while using this moisturizer. I loved it and would definelty recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"first off this moisturizer smells great, very creamy, long lasting effects. A little bit goes a long way making this product go further. After using this product for several days I noticed a softer smoother appearance on my face and neck."
I have a tendency to break out when trying a new product and this did not cause any blemishes or redness. I would definitely use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed using this product! For me personally I like the night application better than the morning one. The morning one made me feel a little greasy for a while afterwards, but the nighttime one helped me relax. My solution was to do a very light application in the morning and a little heavier at night. I would recommend this product to my friends. Thank you for letting me try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received samples of this in the mail as part of the Revitalift Challenge and I love it. I had a wonderful smell and a silky feel. I noticed a difference right away. My skin looks and feels healthier. I would recommend this to every women who wants to feel her most beautiful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the #revitaliftchallenge and I am a happy person. I love this moisturizer. It gave me more beautiful skin after just a few days in. It has a nice texture and applies well, it's silky and absorbs well. My sagging skin looks firmer. My complexion is clear. My skin looks smooth and hydrated. It smells really good too. I normally prefer products with no scents but I like this one, almost like perfume. Another great product from L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of the L'oreal RevitaLift Moisturizer, and decided to give it a try. The good news that it didn't break me out, but it also didn't really do anything. My skin complexion kind of looked dull, and the moisturizer would leave a sticky film on my skin. Every time I would need to apply foundation, it would smear. I stopped using this the L'oreal RevitaLift Moisturizer and went back to my regular face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using this for 5 days, but I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel! It's not greasy, absorbs quickly and my makeup glides on. I can't wait to see the results in a couple weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample to review. Though I received my sample late I was able to use 7 days. Morning and night. My skin feels great. Less wrinkles. Smoother skin. I'm impressed. Great fragrance, non irritating. Light non-greasy add to the buy list!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using it for 10 days. There is a definite improvement to my skin texture and wrinkles have been reduced. The downside is it does not work well under my foundation. The product tends to cause my makeup to bead up and roll off during the day. Would highly recommend it for night-time use only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my free trial and began using it the next day. I have used it everyday and my skin looks and feels so nice. I am 61 and have a few wrinkles that really bothered me. Since using Revitalift I have noticed that the wrinkles are not as pronounced. This will be the only product that I now use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 2 week sampler for this product. from the very first day on , I could feel the hydrating properties of this wonderful creme. it gives my skin a more radiant look, hydrates to perfection. it goes on very smooth, without leaving any residue and smells simply delicious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is awesome! The feel of it as my combination skin drank in the moisture making my skin soft, smooth and youthful. I think, what I call, ""the plumpness of youth"" came back into my collagen deprived face. My face even seems to look more rested which makes it look fresh and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did the #14dayrevitaliftchallenge and tried this free sample on my face. It smells great and makes my face really soft. The only thing I didn't like is it made my face a bit greasy. Other than that I love it. Makes me look younger! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product from a trial promotion. I have noticed a general softening of wrinkles and brightening of complexion. However, I have oily, acne prone skin, and it is too moisturizing for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got the sample packet the other day and I love it my face feels softer and it doesn't make my eyes burn when I'm working out and start sweating and plus it doesn't have a bad smell to it. To me it works great I already see the results. Love this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product really softens my face. I love the sense, and the creamy texture. I can notice a difference in my neck more then my face, maybe because I have more wrinkles on my face. Really the only thing I don't like is the price, it is a bit pricey for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream feels fantastic & smooth. I saw some plumpness and smoothing but it seems like its because of a layer of residue from the cream itself is just leaving its layer, not really changing the skin. But that's my impression so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. I love having the opportunity to try this product. This product left my skin so soft and appearance of seeming firmer skin. Very happy with my challenge so far and considering going to my nearest drugstore and purchasing the full size. Thank you L'Oreal Paris! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't like the scent. It doesn't need to be scented to work well. My neighbor couldn't use it at all because of the scent. It has a nice rich and creamy texture and I think it did help my skin but I couldn't use it everyday since my skin is super sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a late start on it and am on the 5th day. I can see a very visible difference around my eyes, jawline and neck. The only problem I have with it is that my chin broke out. I stopped the treatment for a few days at first because of this. When I started it back up it did the same thing. It feels heavy on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried and have just completed the RevitaLift 14 day challenge. I am delighted with the results. It softened, hydrated and visibly improved the overall texture of my skin! Definitely a winner in my books. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm not a makeup wearer so I was nervous about trying a facial product. This one is lovely! Blends into my skin with no greasy or sticky residue. I didn't even know I had it on! Highly recommend this product to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am on day 9- I can certainly see a major improvement when I use the Revitalift under makeup, but doesn't seem to be making any progress on the fine lines and wrinkles around the eye. Will see what happens. Am very pleased with the smooth appearance under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff works! My skin is moisturized and visibly softer and plumper in the morning after i sleep in it. I received a sample and used it 14 nights. It is too thick to use in the day under sunscreen, in my opinion, but as a night cream it is a WINNER. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the 14 day RevitaLift challenge and I must say I loved this cream. It was luxurious and rich but didn't leave my skin greasy. It smoothed and lifted my skin all while really moisturizing. I wil defiantly by this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal RevitaLift for a quite awhile. This is a great addition to their product line. Hardly any wrinkles at 62, and I hope to keep it that way with the help of L'Oreal RevitaLift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Using the Revitalift twice a day for two weeks, I saw an amazing difference. I was not expecting to see a remarkable difference; but I did. It made my face smooth and diminished the fine lines and crows feet that show prominently. My face and neck look rejuvenated and glowing. This has become a daily favorite. My husband has even noticed the difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love a luxurious, thick, rich face lotion and this is it! My dry skin drinks it in without feeling greasy. I went all out and smeared it on my face, neck and shoulders. Used all the samples, supposed to last 14 days, but I went thru them in half the time. This is my new forever moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the 14 day challenge and I have to say, after day 6, it makes my face feel so soft. I too have the crumbling after I apply my make-up. I have not noticed a difference in my wrinkles. This product is extremely to pricey for my budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how soft my face felt after trying this product. I saw fine lines disappearing and my face felt and looked more hydrated. I would definitely recommend this product to any woman regardless of their age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample of this to try for to weeks. I could tell after the first application that it was a great product. It's rich and creamy with a nice subtle fragrance. It goes on so smooth.I noticed my skin was more dewy and soft within just a few days of using this. I saw a visible reduction in finelines on my forehead within a week. I will definitely be buying this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received Revitalift as a sample, and I am so pleased with it. At first I didn't expect much, but I was surprised at the smooth texture it left my skin. It gave my skin the moisture that I needed while making it so smooth. I love Revitalift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Lotion from a survey I filled out to try for free and Ive loved it from moment I tried it! Revitalift made my skin feel soft and help with the fine lines and wrinkles I've developed over the years. I will be getting this product at the store! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do love this product. Makes my skin so smooth. I have noticed that I am breaking out a little bit more, so I'm not sure if it's clogging my pores, but I still really like this product. I don't know if 14 days is enough to tell if it really lifted, but I do like the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 7 days into a trial of this product. It is wonderful as a moisturizer, but it does nothing for my ""fine lines"" or wrinkles. I will probably continue to use, but only for the moisturizing effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I entered the 14 day Revitalift challenge. About 4-5 days into the challenge I started getting positive comments about my skin/complexion from people who had no idea I was trying the new product. I've never had compliments about my skin !! I've used more expensive products and never observed such positive change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the sample day one . It immediately tightened the skin on my chin . My skin felt warm but was ok . Day 2, application 1, I got a rash. The mild rash lasted 3 days. Would highly recommend the product, just not for sensitive skin. Today, the unopened invidual packs will go to a local women's shelter. My chin stayed tighter for over a week."
"I received the 14 day challenge for this face cream and was a bit skeptical at first. What makes this different from other expensive face creams? While it had a very rich creamy texture, it did not make my face overly oily or greasy. It does have a strong perfume smell, but I really enjoyed it. Overall, it has made my face feel softer and smoother. It might just be the placebo effect, but I think my face looks more youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this as a sample & was surprisingly pleased. I love this product. I have very dry blotchy skin. It really helped smooth it out. I found that if I put it on first thing in the morning & let it soak in before I shower my foundation goes on much smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just completed my Revitalift Challenge and couldn't be happier with the results! My face feels like silk; it's smooth and I see visible results. My wrinkles are diminished and I have more self-confidence. This is definitely a MUST BUY! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first glance, I was concerned the cream was too thick for my sensitive, blemish-prone skin, but after consistent use day and night for 14 days, I am happy to report my skin looks and feels smoother and more hydrated than it has in quite a long time. The scent is lovely and it only takes a little dab for full, even coverage of face and neck. I highly recommend Revitalift moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received RevitaLift as a free sample and was very happy with the results. It is a great moisturizer and it did seem to reduce my wrinkles. I wish it had ingredients that would help with dark circles under eyes. If the product was less expensive I would buy it. Thank you for the opportunity to try RevitaLift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a 14 day trial pak from Loreal. After just a few days, I noticed my skin was visibly firmer and plumper. Smooth and creamy, it is a one stop moisturizer that really works. Thanks for the sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using this even prior to receiving the 14 days trial packet, so I can honestly say I am happy with the results. I am an African American woman in my late 30s and this is working really well for me. My skin feels softer, well moisturized and really rejuvenated. I will be using it for a long time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very lucky to receive the Revitalift Triple Power 14 day challenge. This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. I love how soft my skin feels, fine lines have begun to fade and it is not greasy or oily. I also love that you only need to use a small amount. I bought a full sized jar after only 6 days into the challenge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product for free for testing purposes. I have been using it for a week and I can see how different my skin looks. Is very smooth and easy to use and has a nice scent. My face looks fresh and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thank you for the 14 day challenge - I am on my 7th day and see visible results, my face is soft and glowing, my age spots are lighter and my skin feels great. I would recommend this to all my friends and relatives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was worried about trying this lotion because I have oily skin. I really liked the feel of it and it did not make my face an oil slick. I have seen some results with one of my deep wrinkles. For the price it is definitely worth a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I took the challenge and being in my 40s, was a little skeptical on how it would perform. I am super pleased! Dramatic difference in fine lines and wrinkles over 14 day use. I loved the way my skin just felt drenched and nourished. It is very hydrated, more than anything else Ive used. My skin was smoothe all the time and I tend to have dryer skin during dry fall months but so far I havent. I fully intend to purchase this and use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started the challenge. The first day my skin looked great. By the third day I broke out really bad and had to stop using it. I wish it would have worked out for me and I'm sure it will work well for others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of Revitalift about ten days ago and so far I'm loving it. The dry areas of my skin are well hydrated and my skin feels slightly more supple. One thing I will say is that a little goes a long way with my combination skin. I have to use this very sparingly when my t-zone starts acting up, but overall I like my results. I think this would make a better night cream if you've got combination or oily skin, you'll probably need something lighter during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am just over half way of a 14 day trial. My face feels softer and looks smoother. I made the mistake of using too much the first day, it tends to ball up. Also, if you use foundation, don't use too much moisturizer, it will defiantly ball up! Make sure you give it plenty of time to dry before you put on your foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a few months now and I wanted to use it a while before I give a review. After using it I've noticed that my skin was a lot softer and smoother and I have not seen any signs of aging like fine lines or even crows feet and I'm 38 years old so that's a good age to start using anti aging cream. I really love this cream its been working great for me so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my samples and started using right away. Feels nice however I really don't see or feel a difference in my skin. I don't think I can pay that much when olay regenerist is so much smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did the 14 day trial and loved the results. I can see my skin doesn't look so tired and dry around my eyes and forehead. It was a little heavier than I'm used to so had to adjust makeup. It has a lovely fragrance also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a 14 day trial and it has been amazing so far. Had some laugh lines around my mouth and they have been diminished. I love the smell and little goes a long way. This makes my skin feel fresh and vibrant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am currently doing the Revitalift challenge. It's been one week since I received it in the mail, The packets are divided for you and I am using a half a packet a day as they suggest. So far I have not seen a difference. Its very thick, but not like a good lotion, I noticed it can almost be peeled at some points if I wipe my hand over my face. I will update as I continue to use."
"I received a two week sample of Loreal RevitaLift from Loreal to try in exchange for my honest feedback. I really liked this moisturizer. It left my skin feeling soft, moisturized, and after two weeks I could tell my skin felt a little tighter, as well. It went on a little wet feeling, but after it dried, it did not feel greasy at all. Very happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this sample last week and I've only used it for a few days. My skin gets really dry during this time of year. #Revitalift helped with that. After only a few days my skin no longer feels dry and itchy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of L'oreal #Revitalift for the #revitaliftchallenge - And I'm impressed! At 34 years old, I'm noticing changes in my skin & this facial, anti-aging moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth & firmer & after just 2 weeks of using it, in the morning & at night!! I'd recommend this to anyone noticing those changes in their skin, be proactive! #ReviataliftChallege #Loreal #freebie #loveit [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I accepted the 14 day challenge for the L'Oreal Revitalift and all I can say is it's AWESOME !! I love how soft my skin is... I no longer have sagging frown smile marks !!

My skin is really dry and I've tried alot of products but I can say that Loreal Revitalift really works for me. My skin is moisturized and I noticed that it lifts my skin too.

I have been using the sample packets and have noticed a renewed smoothness of my skin. A big plus for me is the reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles. I just like the way my facial skin looks and feels. My husband thinks I look younger! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always loved Loreal products. I use the makeup, facial creams and I really like the way the facial revitalift tightens my skin and feels refreshing. I use after showering, before bed and in the morning and it I feel like it blocks dirt etc from getting in my skin especially my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a 14 day sample of this moisturizer. It is a very good moisturizer. It sinks in complete and provides all-day moisture. It is not greasy and does not make my make-up run like some intensive moisturizers do. I haven't noticed a change in my fine lines or wrinkles, but I am not done with my 14 days yet.

"Its been 2 weeks so far that I have been using the cream so I'am not done with the Challenge yet . So being Midway threw my results at this time are , I do like the cream it feels nice on my face , it leaves my skin feeliing hydrated and smooth . The scent is pleasent and I feel aa little goes a long way . I do not find I have had a remarkable difference compared to my other creams I use but I still have a full 2 weeks left to complete Challenge so I will see then . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel this moisturizer is too heavy for me during the day but as a nighttime creme it works really well. My skin does appear firmer and well hydrated. The big issue as far as a negative is the smell. It is too strong a perfume smell. It detracts me from thoroughly enjoying this otherwise good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanted to say so far so good for the results I am feeling and seeing. #RevitaliftChallenge is doing great so far. I have notice my face firmer and feels and looks better than before it is not dull as in the beginning. I recently just received my product so i have not completed it.

I received my 14 day trial sample an after 4 days my neighbor has noticed a big difference. She actually thought I had makeup that is just how much this product has already changed my complexion.

"I am on day 3 of my 14 day challenge and I can see and feel a difference in my skin. From day one the skin on my face felt really soft and more elastic. Some of the finer lines around my eyes seem less noticeable. I am looking forward to using RevitaLift for the full 14 days, twice a day and I will report my findings at the end, so keep tuned. I am really excited trying this product, my 74 year old face really needed a lift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm on Day 4 of the sampler I received in the mail...I've already noticed a smoother feel to my face and slight plumping affect. The only negative I have is the scent of the cream. Fortunately it dissipates after a short while. I will continue to use all of the packets and will decide if I will purchase a full size jar. I appreciate the opportunity to sample before buying....It's a real PLUS! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been on Revitalift 3 days now. My skin looked very dull, with little sheen. After the second application, I have noticed a healthy glow returning to my face. It tingles and feels unbelievable. I have always been blessed with good skin, but I in a very short time getting glowing skin. I will post a photo soon, with no make up (gasp) to show how nice my skin is looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Two days ago I really put this product to the test. I had a busy day..Sunday morning worship, gathering and playing tennis at the park for a few hours. I was a hot mess by the end of it, but my face still glowed. I was given the 14 day supply, but I'm going to hate to use it all up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I failed to take a before pic with no makeup and have only used the product one day so far. I LOVE how my skin feels. Not greasy. Just smooth, soft, and supple !

So I got a fourteen day sample of Loreal-RevitalLift form Loreal. I've only been using it for four days. And so far what I have noticed is that its very moisturizing. By face is no longer dry and peeling. I haven't noticed and lifting or deference in my fine lines. But its only been four days.

I am even seeing some of my fine lines smoothing out a bit. So far this is a good product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using it for 2 days and it has kept my skin from drying out on both days. I have extremely dry skin on my face but I didn't have to reapply it until before I went to bed.

"First of all, thank you for the opportunity to try this product. So far I have used it for two days. I am loving it! I don't know how to explain the change it is making but I see something good. I like how the product feels on my skin. I like the scent. It leaves the skin a bit sticky for a little while. After wearing it overnight, the skin feels refreshed in the morning.

I got a 14 day sample to try and not even 14 days into the challenge but already noticing a difference. My skin texture is smoother and I like the lifting effect on the jaw line. I haven't noticed a difference in wrinkles yet but I am hopeful that as I use the product over the rest of the trial I will see positive results. I only have one dislike regarding the product and that is the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm doing the 14 day challenge and I'm on day two. It's crazy that I can see results, and feel them so soon. I will no longer be using what I was and this is going to be it! I can't wait to see after the 14- days what a difference it will make to my skin. Thank u!"
"I received samples in the mail a couple weeks ago.It is a bit thick but a little goes a long way and my skin does not feel oily afterwards. Usually thick creams tend to break me out but this one does not.I haven't seen a drastic change in lines yet, but I am only 5 days in and I already do see improvement(my tone and smoothness) Can't wait to keep going! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am doing the 14 day samples, so far I like it for a night cream. For under make-up would not work for me as the cream rolls right off my skin and would make my make-up come off. It is very heavy but does go on smooth, the scent is pleasant enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Got this as a sample and I'm only on day 3 but my skin feels smooth and hydrated. I have a brand new baby so I wake up inthe mornings looking like a wreck from lack of sleep anyways. This definitely helps! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this lotion a bit heavy, so I used it as a night cream, even though they said it's for day or night. That's my only complaint, though. Otherwise, it does remove fine lines and wrinkles as promised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and in the winter it gets very dry and itchy. I need a moisturizer that is not going to irritate my skin even more. I loved that L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer worked great on my sensitive skin. Not only did it leave my skin silky smooth but it also helped reduce the appearance of my wrinkles. I love that the cream is lightweight, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling firm, hydrated and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin gets really dry in the winter and few moisturizers work for me. I usually end up with dry, flaky skin in the winter. This moisturizer not only worked but made my skin look soft and supple. It also goes on light and smells nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and really enjoy it. I use it before bed after washing my face. The moisturizer is not heavy and does not leave a residue on my face or pillows. Even my son likes it! ""Mommy , your face smells good!"", he said after I applied it one evening. It is light and leaves my face looking refreshed in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I typically don't buy a separate day and night moisturizer because I'd prefer to just have everything in one. However, my mind has been changed since using this deep-acting facial moisturizer. I can feel a huge difference in my skin when I wake up in the morning as it doesn't feel so tight and dry. Using this plus the serum, seems to amp up the effects even more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. It smelled good, goes on smooth, and really moisturizes. Not greasy. Easy and no mess at bedtime. Dries enough to wear under my makeup. Without cream, my face is dry and flaky. Not a problem after using this product daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this daily moisturizer! Just weeks after trying it for my first time, combined with the Serum and Day Lotion, I had some pretty amazing results. My fine lines had diminished around my eyes and mouth and my skin was much more taut. I will definitely be telling anyone who will listen to my story. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the feel of this it's not super thick or at all greasy. However, I've only used it a couple times. Mostly because I prefer a tinted moisturizer to even out my skin tone. If this came in a tinted version I would certainly continue to buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the L'Oreal Paris RivitaLift Triple Power Deep acting Facial Moisturizer. I used it every night and some mornings for just over 2 weeks so far. I like the light scent. It leaves a non-greasy feel. It absorbs great. I have not noticed a change in my skin as of today. I hope to see smoother and younger looking skin as I continue to use the products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great. My face and neck areas feel soft and radiant. I can tell a difference while using these products so much more than the brand I had used in the past. Thumbs up and high five most definitely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had never used a ""serum"" product before, so I had no expectations going in. Either that or I expected magic and miracles... Now I'm not sure. I used the product for three weeks. The first thing I noticed was that for a week, I couldn't wear it under make up because my face would peel. It stopped after a week and I learned to use less product. My most noticeable result was on my freckles. It lightened them! Like for real!! How rad is that?!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this as a night cream because it was very thick and moisturizing - in a good away. It doesn't say it's just for night, but it's so thick and moisturizing it works well to leave on all night. I'm not sure how make-up would apply over it since it was a little on the heavy side and I didn't use it during the day. I had a some issues with breakouts when I used it so perhaps it was too thick of a formula for me personally, but if you have dry skin that isn't sensitive you will love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before trying this product I had pondered upon how well the product worked, whether it was going to be worth the investment or not. It is very much worth it my skin is more radiant and youthful looking than ever. I give it 5 stars on how well it works it is a very high quality product that works as described. Thank you L'0real for another great product in the line of your already outstanding products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product applies well. It's really creamy and absorbs fast. The smell isn't as intense as the serum, which is nice. I haven't noticed much difference in my skin as a whole, but my make up goes on much more smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the deep acting moisturizer pairs awesome with the other products in the same line, they do not tend to get overly greasy which is HUGE with moisturizer. It doesn't cause you to break out which is a major problem I personally was having. I have already recommended this product to many people and I will continue to do so. As well as buy more for myself! I am so happy i was able to product test this and voice my opinion, I think alot of people will benefit from this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer on dry skin days and at night, and I've noticed that my skin is particularly hydrated - even with the dropping temperatures (when my combination face gets especially dry on the cheek area). I love this stuff! It's very rich, so I tend to only use it on my cheeks and neckline, but I highly recommend it for dry or combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLife Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. I'm used to a lighter type of moisturizer, so I found that a little of this product goes a long way. I was happy with the way this product moisturized my face. It went on smooth, with no greasy feel. It also absorbed into my skin quickly and left a smooth finish. I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer has become part of my evening routine every night. It leaves my skin feeling smooth after cleaning and using the RevitaLift Serum. After just a few weeks of use my skin looks better than ever. My favorite part is, the moisturizer doesn't leave my skin oily or sticky. When I get up in the morning my skin is in much better condition too. I will be trying more of this line and adding it to my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This hydrates my skin perfectly, so much so that I don't need my face cream. If you have oily skin, it might be too much for you. After two weeks my skin is more even and my makeup goes on super smooth on my former rough patches. The smell is nice, clean and crisp. I highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a good product on the cheap. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using this product for 2 weeks... feels great on my skin. No breakouts and my skin doesn't feel oily. Not sure I see any reduction in wrinkles or dark spots however. I'll continue to use it though for now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I appreciated this moisturizer so much! It was light-weight and non-greasy. Once applied, my face felt rejuvenated and moisturized. My face did not feel dry after I applied the cream and continued to stay that way for the entire day. Some days I wore this underneath my makeup and felt that it did not interfere in anyway. I can easily see myself adding this moisturizer to my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this one also. This can be used day and night. A little heavier and prefer to use at night. Although I did use it both morning and night for awhile. Noticeable difference in only a few weeks. Skin is smoother and feels very soft. Wrinkle/frown lines look better. Only gave 4 of 5 stars because not me but some may be bothered by the smell of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer leaves my skin silky soft and smooth ! Not only did my skin look more fresh and youthful , but it also seemed to stop the pores from being plugged up which has been a major problem as I age. I highly recommend this moisturizer !! By the way, I just turned 56 !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before I started using this lotion, my skin had blotches and fine lines. You could not help to see my pores. Within days of starting to use this lotion, my pores looked smaller. The red blotches and wrinkles started fading. After several weeks my skin is evenly toned. Wrinkles are less defined. My face looks fuller and smoother. I have tried other brands before from department stores, and none have worked as well as Loreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried L'Oreal Paris Rivitalift Triple Power deep action moisturizer and found it to work very well at rejuvenating the look of my skin. The face looks and feels firmer and smoother. It's a great product and I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Sometimes, nighttime moisturizer can clog my combination pores and make me break out, but this was a great product. It really plumped my skin and never felt greasy. I woke up with smooth, soft skin! Great product at a great price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oréal Paris recitalist triple power DEEP acting facial moisturizer is an amazing product! I have been using it consistently for the past two weeks and have seen amazing results! I like that you only have to use a little and it goes a long way! The texture glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly so it does not leave an oily or sticky residue. Although it may be a little expensive I think it may be worth it since it seems to last a long time even with daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had been looking to a good moisturizer that I could add to my routine before bed. I tried the L'Oréal revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer. When I first applied it to my freshly cleansed skin it felt heavy. Not what I expected to feel. After about a week using it my skin felt hydrated and smooth but it still felt pretty heavy. I didn't mind too much since I was only using it before bed. I did not care for the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this cream nightly for about two weeks. So far, I like the generous amount of product in the package and the consistency, which is thick but still smooth and non-greasy. It has a mild fragrance. It's too early to tell if it works to reduce fine lines, but it certainly hasn't broken out my skin, and my skin feels smooth. I carefully examined all the ingredients to make sure they are safe for my skin, and I was pleased with the ingredient list. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried all 3 as a whole. The first day I wasn't sure what to think. Because as it started to work my face was a little tingly. But as I started using it daily my face is more soft and moisturized. I will be recommending this product to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'Oreal Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is awesome. My dry face is now a healthy looking face. Thanks Bzz for giving me the opportunity to meet such an amazing moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I shared the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer with my Mother. She liked it a lot and so did I. It replenishes our skin with the moisture before putting on our make-up. We enjoy using it for our faces. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved getting a chance to try this product! My skin felt unbelievably smooth with the first application, and that feeling lasted all day. I woke-up the next morning to skin that was still smooth even though I'd used a rough facial cleanser before going to bed; it took 2 days of not applying the moisturizer before it felt like I needed to moisturize again. A little goes a long way when applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer in I could honestly say it has been doing a great deal for my face and neck area.

"Since I received the triple power deep-acting I haven't stopped using it day and night. I love it! It is light scented, easy and thin going on and doesn't irritate my skin AT ALL. On top of that, I've been using the product for a few weeks now and I've noticed my skin feeling and looking healthier, fine lines diminishing and my face feeling moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is a deep moisturizer. I have tried many that felt oily or heavy. This product gives my skin the same treatment but with a lovely soft texture. My skin feels and looks more youthful and firm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product caused my skin to be extremely soft and looking fresh. When using the facial moisturizer my skin didn't feel caked on or oily. I didn't even feel the need to wear makeup due to already having fresh and bright looking skin. I will definitely continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i will be using these products from now on. THANK YOU! I've tried many many products in my lifetime, but as I age my skin changed and products i used to use no longer work. I never used Loreal products before, but since using these i'm never going to use another different product again. easy to use face looks and feels really wonderful and i look and feel younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was picked to try L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. Truly I'm impressed. This is my favorite part of my night time routine. After washing my face and applying serum to ""problem"" areas. This moisturizer is super thick. it only takes a very small amount. my skin loves it and soaks it all up. Makes it very soft. I will buy this forever. I love how smooth and hydrated my skin feels [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the products a lot. I was surprised because I was sure it would cause an allergic reaction but it didn't. My skin felt smoother and plumper after a few days. The only thing I don't love is that it is highly scented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was thrilled to get a chance to try L'Oreal facial moisturizer as I already use many other products offered by them. I love this facial moisturizer. It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth, especially during these winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is so soft now!!! I have lost a lot of the redness in my cheeks. I would recommend this product to every one. I used the L'Oreal Paris Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer in the morning and in the evening. Even applying over L'Oreal Concentrated Facial Serum the product was still light weight, and non greasy. Works perfectly under my make-up too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for a few weeks, I definitely notice a difference in how soft my skin is. Drawbacks of this product are: first, it has a strong perfume smell, and second, it is quite thick and the excess doesn't absorb into your skin. First time I tried it, I applied it liberally and in the morning I could literally scrape it off with my fingernail. The next time, I applied only a small amount and got better results. This also means the product will last you a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am really enjoying using the L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! It is a thick cream that works easily into my skin. I feel softer after. It does not leave my face feeling heavy or greasy though which is a plus. I have only been using it for two weeks but I can see a decrease in the depth of my forehead wrinkles.

"I live in a very dry climate and I thought it was just something I had to live with, but I have found a product that really really helps. I like the feel of theL'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. It goes on smooth and does not feel to heavy to me. I don't like to feel covered up in lotion and this product fits the bill. I probably would have never bought this product without being able to try it first, but L'Oreal you have scored a new customer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I've 5 found a new staple in my facial care. The combo of all three products is awesome. The moisturizer leaves your skin feeling baby soft. There's no unpleasant smell or over powering odor. The cream goes on smoothly and spreads well. I can tell the difference when I don't use it. I have no more dry dpots on my face. If you're looking for something to rejuvenate your skin this is it. Definitely a new staple in my skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As with the serum, I found the lotion to be smooth texture but heavy very thick. I've been using it for about 3 weeks or more and I don't notice much of a difference. It does provide moisture but I'm not a fan of the smell. It goes on smooth but I feel that I have to rub it in more because of the thickness of the lotion. I don't feel that it is natural feeling.

"i tend to get really dry patches in areas of my face that can look quite dull even when i moisturized....until I started using the L'oreal Paris Revitalift Triple ower Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer...now my skin just glows to the point where even my BF mentions it. The biggest plus of this, apart from younger looking skin is that it contains an spf that doesn't feel heavy! love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the moisturizer every morning and my face felt so amazing. It was so smooth. I would recommend this product to people who have very dry skin and trying to help with their dryness will love this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin seems to get really dry during this time and year, and this product has been a godsend. I apply a light application after cleansing my face in evening and it absorbs quickly into the skin without residue. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and actually a lot firmer. The overall appearance of my skin has improved greatly. The slight scent is clean and refreshing. I would buy this product over and over again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great Product! after I applied the serum I applied this Facial Moisturizer. My skin loved it. My skin was moisturized all day. After a few weeks of trying this product, there is a noticeable difference in my skin! It is so soft and has a glow. Would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

L'Oréal's Triple Power Deep- Acting Moisturizer is a luxurious cream that delivers moisture to the skin's surface and penetrates to improve the look of aging skin. I especially like the active ingredients of Hyaluronic Acid and Pro-xylene. The fragance in the Moisturizer is pleasant yet I would suggest L'Oréal cut it by half for wider acceptability among those who have allergies to fragrance in cosmetics.

i think that the triple power facial moisturizer is great on the skin it makes the skin smooth soft and very and clean. the dark spots on my face is starting to vanish i have never found anything like this before that gets rid of black spots like this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this for a month now and I absolutely love this product. It's not greasy like other facial lotions on the market. My face is a lot softer then it was before I started using this moisturizer. The best part of all is that my face is really hydrated which really makes a difference in my skin's appearance. I have already recommend this to my mom. So far she's been using it for a few weeks now and is in love with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product is hands down my favorite moisturizer that I own. I have such flaky dry skin and even the mall brand moisturizers couldn't repair it but this did it nearly overnight. Within a week, my dryness was completely healed. My skin was soft and supple. I will most DEFINITELY buy again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This hydrates my skin perfectly, so much so that I don't need my face cream. If you have oily skin, it might be too much for you.

I highly recommend this, especially for those looking for a good product on the cheap. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the serum for three weeks and I love it. For me, it has worked better than any other I have tried thus far. This product helps with frown lines. I have tried this product for 10 days on the deep deep lines on the sides of my mouth. Little by little the area has become fuller, smoother. This definitely did what it said it's going to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As soon as I could get in the habit of using it twice a day, I saw results. It helped the ""crepy"" skin on my neck & the fine lines around my eyes. It's so light that my face wasn't greasy or oily! I always wanted to try it but without wasting money on a product I wouldn't use. Perfect for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the Triple-Power Facial Moisturizer from L'Oreal. It is thick and hydrating without feeling like it sits heavily on your face. At the same time, it's creamy and rich and does not leave my face dry. I also loved the fragrance of the moisturizer. At the end of the day, I felt like my face had been nourished and protected for the whole day and felt smooth when I washed my face at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like it! After putting this on my face in the morning and evening, I started noticing a difference within a couple of weeks. It's non-greasy so you don't feel like you're adding oil to your face and neck. I will continue to use daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to agree with other reviewers and would be happier if this were in a pump container. Dipping into a jar isn't my favorite and can lead to bacteria. That said, the lotion itself is deeply moisturizing as advertised. The scent is a bit heavy for my liking, but overall, I enjoy the fragrance. Coupled with the serum it kept my skin soft and glowing all day long - always a plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am still undecided about these products and continue to use them. I think I see some improvement in my skin but not positive yet. It has been about 3 weeks now and I think my skin tone has improved and one wrinkle between my brows seems less. The only thing I do not like is the products seems to block my pores, when I sweat I feel very greasy and more uncomfortable than usual so I may just use it at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been sick and on top of that my husband had to be put in the hospital so I have just started using mine. So far I can't tell a difference but it hasn't been enough time yet. Still waiting for results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is fine, but i don't like it more than my normal moisturizer, from Olay. I'm not nuts about the scent or how this sits on my face. I have combo skin - i don't think this makes me look greasy, im just partial to the scent and consistency of my normal moisturizer. This doesn't sit under my makeup as nicely, either.

L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep'Acting Facial Moisturizer is wonderful! It feels great and works great. L'Oreal is such a trusted and respected brand that I am excited to try any of their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Nice, light and not too heavy for my skin. I'm not a fan of the scent. Very light, but floral. It seems to go well with the facial serum, doesn't plug pores. It gets along very well with my skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreals revatalift Deep Acting Moisturizer looks great and smells fantastic. A small amount is enough to apply generously. For me, my facial skin is not dry enough for this product. I believe if you do have dry zones in your face, this would absolutely help with that. Upon applying it before bed, I could still feel it in the morning. The moisturizer has great staying power. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My sensitive skin loves this night time moisturizer. It is gentle, softly fragranced, blends in quickly, yet works hard to keep my older skin soft, supple, and looking younger than its years. I have started receiving compliments on my skin, and at my age of 55, that makes me feel beautiful again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I have been using this moisturizer at night after using your cleanser. I used to wake up with dry skin patches on my face but have not had that happen since I began using this moisturizer. My skin feels so smooth, much better than any other moisturizer I have tried.

"The deep-acting facial moisturizer is pretty good. I liked how it felt on my skin when I was putting it on. I could tell the difference in how my skin felt after using it all this time. The moisturizer smells good, though just a tad overpowering. However, the smell does get less immediately after pouring it on. I have had the experience of it peeling though. Over all, it's a great product. It's worth using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial moisturizer rocks! At first the scent was a bit strong but has now dissipated with use. It is rich and creamy, not greasy and simply easy to apply. If you want a moisturizer that isn't too heavy for daytime wear, yet is thick enough to restore your skin at night, this is certainly it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a perfect daytime moisturizer paired with the L'Oreal Revitalift Serum. I tend to have dry skin and this has definitely regulated my skin. I have used this product for 2 weeks now and have noticed more even skin and subtle tightening of the skin. Would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this moisturizer. It was so creamy and silky going on then it took no time for it to absorb into my facial skin. Like all the L'Oreal products, it has a nice, clean scent. My skin felt beautiful and moisturized. I plan on using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In my opinion, this is the best product in the RevitaLift line! This is an excellent moisturizer! A little goes a long way, which is always great when you're on a budget. I felt that this is the deepest moisturizer in this line and it's great as part of either your morning or bedtime routine. It is great base for women that have normal to dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the moisturizer after letting the serum soak in a bit. The product was so creamy and spread so smooth. I believe the product would last a fair length of time because a little goes a long way. The moisturizer made my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. I also believe that the wrinkles on my face are not as deep and it seems the small wrinkles are smoothing out. I would absolutely recommend Loreal revitalift. It is a high quality facial product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is an amazing product. It is so silky to touch and so smoothly to feel. The scent is very refreshing and nice. I like to have my face soft and hydrated all day and night and this product does the job pretty well. I will keep using this product and will be recommending it to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found this moisturizer to be very light and quickly absorbed into my skin without making my already oily skin more oily. I appreciate the SPF protection. My skin is getting more on the sensitive side and it did not irritate it at all. I think this is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is my new-found favorite facial cleansing system regiment. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth, which is something that my facial skin was lacking prior to the start of my using this product. It goes on smoothly and only takes a few small dabs of the product to cover my face. When I finish applying it for the day or night, my face feels refreshed and younger looking. I will definitely start using this product on a regular basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is great, and super lightweight. I had another moisturizer, and I have officially changed to L'Orellana because I like a lighter moisturizer, and it has worked great. This product left my skin feeling soft, and my pores small. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is great for use at night before bed! In the morning my skin felt so much softer and healthier. I love the scent too.

I loved these products. I used the Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer and the Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. These products have left my skin smooth and soft. I could feel the difference right away. I could see the difference after three days. It's light and non-greasy. My make-up went on smoothly over it.

"I used to have dry areas on my face. Day one of using this product changed that! My skin is moist & even-toned, something I have tried to achieve, but had almost given up on. I was worried by the thickness of it because I am prone to breakouts from moisturizers. I had no need to worry! No breakouts or dry patches, I am hooked!

"I love using this especially at night, it leaves my skin soft and smooth, and it's light weight, it doesn't feels heavy. My pores look smaller and clean. I will definitely buy it again. You have to try it to believe it yourself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin feel incredibly soft. It has a very light fresh sent. A little goes a very long way. Which is something I look for I a product to make sure I am get my money's worth. I use the moisturizer both day and night and have never had any problems with it. It doesn't have any greasy feeling to it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this a few times so far and really do like it. It has a light floral scent that's not overpowering, goes on smooth and fairly light. It felt good on my face though it did feel a bit sticky on my hands after so I did need to rinse them for comfort. But on my face it didn't feel that way. I've not noticed a change in my skin yet but it does feel good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face can get pretty dry, especially during the winter. Simply put, L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer does an excellent job providing much needed moisture. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the serum and moisturizer so far. I love both of them Both of them are great. The moisturizer is not greasy at all like some of the moisturizers I have used in the past . I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is nice on its own but all 3 products together make a bigger difference. I love the way it goes onto my skin and makes it feel softer. I can see a difference in the fine lines and what few wrinkles I had have diminished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was super soft and smelled amazing. I used it for a week and thought my complex was softer already. Can't wait to continue using it. I wore this at night and it did not make my face hot at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Really loving all of the products but I would say this is my favorite! My face and wrinkles (LOL) are softer and less defined. It absorbs into the skin without feeling greasy! It has a clean fresh scent which a woman can appreciate! I definitely recommend L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Facial Moisturizer as you will see a more softer, not shiney look to your whole face!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a little over a week now. I love that it provides sun protection. It feel great under my makeup and my skin feels firmer. It absorbs quickly which is great for me since I am always rushing around! It isn't greasy and I really like the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To start with, this stuff smells great. Very lightly scented, not overwhelming at all. I love the texture, too. It goes on nicely and makes my skin feel great. I've been using it for about 2 weeks and right off the bat I noticed how soft and smooth my skin felt. Just recently I've been seeing my skin tone has been evening out. My only complaint would be my skin did get oily for a while. I had to cut back on my use and is seemed to have gotten better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a somewhat thick, moisturizing cream. It is very emollient and leaves you skin feeling extremely hydrated. I think this would be absolutely great for dry skin. I have normal/combo skin (oily in t-zone) and this just has too much moisture for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Loreal Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer is very luxorious. The cream itself is rich and velvety. After the first use, I found my skin was so much softer. I use this at night and my skin is so smooth I the morning. After continued use I notice my skin stays hydrated and it appears brighter. I will definitely continue using this product. I do wish it came without a scent, though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was looking for a new line of products to use as I was using another line. When I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer, I LOVED it!! It is so rich feeling and my skin soaks it up and feels luxurious!!! My skin feels pampered while using it and it is very rich and a great moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the feel of this moisturizer. It almost feels like it dries instantly with a powder smooth feel. I love the scent as well. I've noticed that the bags under my eyes are gone and my crows feet have lightened. I have even received a compliment on my skin and I have only been using the moisturizer for a little over a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At my age, blemishes have been replaced by wrinkles. I was surprised after using this product for a few days that I started breaking out on my neck and cheeks. I thought it might be a fluke so I continued using it a few more days and the breakouts got worse. Once I stopped, everything cleared up. I am very sorry to say that I could not recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a really nice moisturizer. Its not at all greasy and has a really light fragrance to it. I am particularly pleased that this product doesnt make my face oily or shiny throughout the course of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this after applying the triple power concentrated serum treatment. I only use this moisturizer at night. I found that no matter how lightly I apply the product, it seems to flake on my skin. Nonetheless, the cream feels very moisturizing and luxurious. It does have a perfumed scent that takes some getting used to. I do like that my skin feels soft and hydrated using this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a rather thick cream. It comes in a jar and little dab will be enough if you don't like it very thick on your skin. I have a combination skin, so it gives me a little oily feeling around my chin and nose when I put it on. It is perfect for the cold dry air during the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I also really enjoyed the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer (1.7 oz). I saw dramatic results immediately and my complexion was more radiant than ever. I again was surprised by how non-greasy the formula was. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great moisturizer. I've used this product twice a day for the past 3 weeks along with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer (Broad Spectrum SPF 20). It has a very subtle, pleasant fragrance and I can already see and feel an improvement. I'm looking forward to seeing how effective it will be during the coming winter months when I seem to have even more dry skin issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The pros of this facial moisturizer: it really does make my skin look healthy the next morning, and it doesn't cause any adverse reactions to my very sensitive skin. The cons: it is very heavy, which makes me worry that I'm clogging my pores (I may fall in love with it over the winter when my skin gets so dry it starts to chap), and the scent is not very pleasant and it sticks with you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Again, a nice L'Oreal face product. Non-greasy, absorbs well into the skin. I just wish they would do away with the strong smell. Make it more fresh or no-odor. I've been an Olay user for many years and I found this to be fairly comparable. I have fairly sensitive skin and I had no adverse reaction to using it. No additional breakouts or redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my final review I used the Revitalift serum and daily moisturizer for 2.5 weeks. I was on hopes that it would lessen the wrinkles under my eye when I smile. Unfortunately it did not, it does however give my skin a new soft feel. The effects that I reported in my first review still remain the warming sensation when applied. So for a girl who has never used anything but water on her face it was a pleasant experience after the first few days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Rich, creamy, beautiful light scent when you open this product. Goes on light, absorbs and drenches your skin beautifully. Repaired, re-firmed and left my aging skin feeling resiliently beautiful. Would highly recommend. Love this RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer. I so needed this. Thank you L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think threllese three products are excellent. They do not leave your face feeling oily and no breakout. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is the best product for those with dry skin. I have used this product daily and will continue to use this product in place of another moisturizer that I have used. The best uses for this product is daily usage after a shower for those with dry skin. I don't have anything but pros about this product: absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly, moisturizes well, not greasy, and lasts long. I would strongly recommend this product to a friend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the colors of the bottle and lids. Has a lightly pleasant smell, not over powering. Has a little sparkle in it that makes your skin look radiant and fresh. Not greasy or sticky. Used long enough to see some elasticity returning. Skin feels soft and smooth. I will definitely continue to use once this is gone. Nice product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer! It goes on easy and smooth. It doesn't make my skin feel oily or greasy. The fragrance isn't overwhelming and is just right. My face feels comfortable and isn't tight. The moisturizing cream itself is thick and creamy. I'm looking forward to using this moisturizer all winter! I'll definitely be using this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first tried I thought, ok"" another cream for wrinkles But I change my mind when I tried because the good thing about this cream is that's your face is not grease and have a great smell. It's to soon for make a review If it really works with wrinkles, but I feel my face softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great moisturizer for after washing face. Thicker than other serums and creams, but did not make skin oily or break out. Smooth and silky skin. I used more around eyes due to dry skin there from allergies... big improvement! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this moisturizer every day for the past two weeks and while I haven't noticed any dramatic effects I do see a change in the texture of my skin. I like the way this moisturizer feels and smells. It's rich, creamy and easy to apply (a small amount goes a long way). It's thick but absorbs quickly. And most importantly, it's not greasy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is a little too thick and greasy. I do think that it has worked to firm my skin and I do notice reduction in small wrinkles on my forehead and next to my eyes. I would recommend this product even though it is greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to say that I love the benefits that this product has: repair wrinkles, re-firm and redensify. And it has made my skin firm. My only issue with it, is that it flaked off when I first used it. However, it does make my skin feel hydrated and radiant. Other than that, it doesn't cause irritation, and it is a great product. I look forward to seeing great results after every usage! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried the moisturizer for 2 weeks now, and I really like it. The cream spreads very easily and a little goes a long way. It leaves skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling thick or heavy on the face. Already my skin looks brighter and feels hydrated all day. It has a very pleasant smell but it may be a little strong for some people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is amazing! I can't remember when my face felt this smooth. I kept feeling the smoothness of it during the day in disbelief. My biggest surprise was that it felt this way from the first day! Talk about fast-acting! Here in Florida the sun and salty air can play havoc on your skin, but this product seems to counteract that. I spend a lot of time outdoors and am glad to have this in my life now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I already have a face moisturizer that I use at night, so I'm pretty partial. This one is a little thick & heavy for me - I have oily skin and am not ready for something so deep acting. Could be good for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"really amazing the longer and more consistent use the better the results actually love it,at first limited results but still brings a freshness to your skin but after a while clean clear fresh amazing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer seems to be very concentrated. A little dab will do. I tend to have more oily skin and thought it was a bit to greasy for me. It definitely did moisturize. It had a pleasant scent . I would like to try this again in the winter months when I'm a little more dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It is so enjoyable to use. It smells wonderful. And a little goes a long way. It is hard to evaluate how well a product will work after only a short amount of time. But I do notice a softening of my skin and a slight improvement of fine lines. I am happy to be a part of this campaign. I look forward to using this until it is all gone! It feels so nice, it is not at all irritating to my skin and leaves me with a dewy feel and glow. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Still loving this moisturizer. I have been using this daily for a few weeks now and I love the results. I am 46 years old and have dry skin. This is helping me get through the day without feeling so tight and dry. It really works as it should and keeps my face feeling soft and less wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer does back up its' claim as being three times the product! Immediately after applying, my skin does feel hydrated...as if the moisture is going right into the area, giving it a healthy ""glow."" Also, the feeling, or texture, of the skin feels somehow smoother and softer. I will continue using this and am sure the other promised attributes will follow...younger and firmer facial skin is a great goal at my age....or any age for that matter!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is really good. I have been using it twice a day for over a week now and I do feel like my skin is softer though I am not sure if there is anything noticeable in terms of looking more youthful. I appreciate that it does not really have a scent but what I like about it the most is that it has not irritated my extremely sensitive skin at all. I have had no problem using this product for the last week and would consider purchasing it when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this for a couple weeks now. I use this at night before bed. It really soaks right in and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. It has been great with the cold weather which usually makes my skin very dry. I haven't experienced any dry skin. I gave this 4 stars because I haven't noticed any tightness or wrinkles reduced with this. It's a great moisturizer and leaves skin silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off I gave it 3 stars because in 3 wks of use it had just slightly softened the lines on my forehead but it has done wonders on the size of the pores on my face and evened out my complexion , made the skin super smooth and mostirized . I'm going to keep using to see if it helps the lines on my forehead [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you are looking for a product that hydrates your skin all day, doesn't irritate you skin and also helps your makeup go on smooth and flawless then this is it. L'Oreal's Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer goes the distance [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer . It leaves the skin feeling so soft and it still feels that way after all night. It states that it is deep acting and I can attest to that. My skin is so much smoother and more hydrated. I have used moisturizers forever and I must say this is one of my favorites as it works very quickly to soften and each time I apply, it continues to improve my skin's texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the serum is my favorite. It is night and absorbs in my skin quickly leaving no greasy or wet sensation. I have noticed a reduction in creases since beginning to use the product 2 weeks ago. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the smell and my skin feels amazing after using the creme. I have extreme sensitive skin but I don't have any bad reactions to it. I live in Alaska and my face gets so dry during the winter time. This product has made it happened a lot less this year :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This goes on very smooth and I wake up to the softest skin in the morning. I love the thicker, whipped consistency of this moisturizer. It does not cause my pores to clog; thus no breakouts for me. Just very soft, glowing skin. I look forward to doing my new facial regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is so creamy and smooth going on, I worried I would break out from it. So far, so good. It's super moisturizing and has a nice light scent. I'm starting to see some improvements in my fine lines, so I hope to have good results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was worried about using all three products, since I've had allergic reactions before. But, these were all very nice. My skin feels softer, more hydrated and looks much better after using for three weeks. I was really hoping it would help more with reducing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the consistency of the product as it was very thick and velvety. A little definitely goes a long way! I have very sensitive skin and after the first use I had some slightly uncomfortable tingling. It was less noticeable with subsequent uses and there was never any redness. I was looking for a nice soothing lotion and found it slightly uncomfortable so It may not be the best product for gals with dry, sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this three item system for the day. My skin looks new and refreshed. Bags under eyes are diminished. Quick and easy to apply. Nice items to add as 2 step system at night. Not to heavy or greasy. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this product from the moment I applied it to my face and neck. It was not greasy and a little went a long way. I used it with L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment. I had a dry spot on the bridge of my nose and it went away with three days using both products. I have used it for three weeks and my skin feels great. Cannot say that my wrinkles have disappeared, but for 71, it has softened them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this moisturizer has been the best by far that I have tried! I really enjoyed how it didn't make my face feel ""suffocated"". I'm not one to use moisturizers on my face daily or often, but once I tried this and started to get into a routine, I was able to tell the difference on how it made my face feel. It didn't feel as dry and oily like it normally does. I really liked the scent too, it was not over powering and it feels light weight when you apply. I definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Perfect with my combination skin! Leaves my skin smooth and breathable. No heavy or filmy feel, which I love! Under makeup allow to completely dry before applying foundation, the lotion will then allow your makeup to glide on smoothly. My skin never looked or felt better. This moisturizer is my new go to!Great light fragrance too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is similar to other overnight moisturizers I have tried a bit heavy. I used this with the serum at night and needed to give my face extra time to dry. The results were good with my forehead wrinkles not showing up as much. The scent was pleasant and did not feel it was overpowering. This product will be found in my future shopping cart. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While the fragrance is nice, it is very overpowering. Within minutes of applying, I had to wash my face... twice... and the scent still lingered in my nose. The positive, my skin did feel softer after washing it off. I will pass these products on to someone who may be less sensitive to the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is absolutely amazing. It is very light weight and doesn't clog your pores. I have very sensitive skin and this didn't cause any break outs or irritations. I noticed my fine lines starting to disappear after the first week! I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Since trying out the Deep-Acting Moisturizer my skin is now really hydrated. I have some really dry spots on my facial area normally around my cheeks and jaw line. Those areas are now looking firm and radiant. I also noticed less of a wrinkle in between my brow areas. This product I recommend and is now going to be part of my beauty facial line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I didn't have very high expectations, I have to say that I was very pleasantly suprised at how well it worked. It has a very light pleasant scent and it left my skin feeling quenched and soft. It did not feel at all heavy or greasy. I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This also felt very soft on the face and has a nice smell. It didn't help with wrinkles or poofy under eyes after 9 days of using this with Serum. I only used it at night, so maybe I needed to use it more. I was following directions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried it on my whole face first and didn't like the feel. As I don't have wrinkles, I thought I'd try it on my chin down, for the overall sagging. That was more tolerable. As with the serum, I noticed some benet after 1-1/2 weeks. I can only believe that I will continue to notice benefits from continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This L'oreal Facial Moisturizer is really great for the overnight hours. It goes to work and leaves your skin feeling really refreshed in the morning. Has a nice soothing scent and isn't greasy. While I can't say that my skin has less lines or more tightness, it is very hydrated and looks fresh, and at my current age, that's good for me. May have even better effects over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not sure about this product as I gave tried similar products in the past. But after three weeks, this product is making me skin feel refreshed and younger. As a mom who is on the go, this product helps out a lot, it's simple to use, and I look forward to applying it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product.. while I'm not positive I see a difference in the look of my skin so much, I love the feel and fragrance of this cream. I especially like it at night. I have used this cream in tandem with the revitalift serum and find it works nicely. It has a much thicker and luxurious feel than most creams I have used and I feel that it is moisturizing my skin. It is definitely a product I would buy and use daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I typically use high end skin care products and have for years. I was anxious to see how the L'Oréal products would compare. I used the serum and deep acting moisturizer for a week. The products did not perform as well as my current routine. My face felt less moisturized and the texture of m skin was not as smooth. I also did not care for the fragrance in these products. It was a bit overpowering and lingered for quite a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer! My skin is on the dry side and this product hydrated and absorbed beautifully! The only drawback I had was the scent was too strong but otherwise I love this product and the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually have big problems with moisturizers adding this oily/shine to my face that is absolutely not wanted. This moisturizer doesn't do that. It really sinks into your skin and doesn't disturb your make-up application. And, it is also amazing when I use it at night without make-up. I have combo skin (oily/dry) and I will continue to use this product after this campaign. It's awesome!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Moisturizer is just awesome! At first I thought it felt heavy and greasy. But as I continued to use it at night, I realized that it was just because my face needed it SO bad! I live in Texas with a ton of sun and heat and this is just what my skin needed. My skin feels softer and my freckles have faded :). Love it@ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this is a great product that helps with my dry skin. With the winter coming and the cooler weather, I feel like my face is getting drier and drier, but when I used this moisturizer, my face felt so smooth and not greasy. It stayed on all day and really helped my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After just two weeks of using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer I can see noticeable changes. My skin is looking much healthier, younger, smoother and it feels great. Prior to using this product I was using a more expensive brand and I can tell you this one is working better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I will admit I am a face care product hoarder. This moisturizer isn't my favorite but it is up there. I've been using Loreal Deep Acting Moisturizer for about 2 weeks at night along with the other two loreal revitalift products in the package. This moisturizer is so rich & creamy and yet blends and sinks right into my skin. With winter & colder Temps coming up I'm looking forward to keeping ahead of dry winter skin. This has made the complexion of my skin much more even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This facial moisturizer like others from the L'Oreal line works very good. I like it because is not greasy and you can use it alone or with other treatments. Not strong fragrance. You can see the difference, your skin will look smooth almost instantly. I have acne and this cream does not make it worse. I recommend it as well as all of these line products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved the feel of this moisturizer, it didn't feel weighty but it worked wonderfully on my skin without causing any irritation or breakouts (I have very sensitive skin). I was hesitant given all the various products and recommendations in the marketplace but I trusted the L'Oreal name and loved that I could buy it anywhere!

I recently received this buzz kit. I got it in the mail and couldn't wait to try it. I've just turned 41 and beginning to see the first signs of aging. This moisturizer makes those little lines fade away. If you have never tried this it is definitely something you will want to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the night cream. Its so thick and creamy, yet it doesn't feel greasy on my face. It smells great and I see a difference in my face just after a weeks time. I look more rested and hydrated. I'll definitely purchase this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This L'Oreal Facial Moisturizer is lightweight, non-greasy and smells great! I use it every night after putting on the L'Oreal Serum. Only a little bit goes a long way. The packaging has a a vibrant red color and the bottle fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the moisturizer for a few weeks now. I hadn't noticed a difference in my skin but my 7 year old was on my lap the other day and snuggled up to my cheek. She immediately told me how soft my skin was! I was happy to take that compliment! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is fantastic. I have been using it for two weeks now. I put it on before bed and wake up with very soft skin. It smells very nice and is very light. I love how fresh and rejuvinated my skin is now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product! Not only am I working on fixing my wrinkles by using this product I also get a moisturizer that actually works on my face! It is incredibly dry where I am from. I am very pleased with this product. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the scent. For someone who is sensitive to scents it is a little strong.

I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and i absolutely love the was this moisturizer smells. The scent isn't too strong but leaves your face with a great scent. I used this every morning after washing my face and my face looks smoother and feels softer. I did find it to be a bit greasy but i wil still continue to use this product. I really liked it.

"I will not be using this anymore. It made my skin feel very greasy. I used a tiny amount and it still felt greasy, I have oily skin to begin with. Also caused my face to break out. I do have sensitive skin though. It did have a pleasant scent though and not overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is amazing. Thick, creamy, almost velvety. Within minutes I could see a glow about my face, as if I'd put on makeup. My husband even noticed. Just in the past week I've started seeing the fine lines around my eyes disappear. Will definitely recommend to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy this facial lotion. The lid is a little slippery and hard to open if your hands are wet or have serum on them from your 1st product. This product smells nice and clean and is a thick, creamy lotion. It spreads nice and smooth. After applying it to my face, it looks dewy and soft. I enjoy the way it feels on my face and how easy it goes on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Triple power deep acting facial moisturizer works great for my skin. I wear this at night and my skin is all refreshed in the morning!

"I am using all 3 products and it has been just 2+ weeks. I use the twice a day and am noticing a difference. My skin seems softer. A dark spot is definitely lightening up. I will definitely continue with these products, as I feel my skin looks better already [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way these products are starting to feel on my face! It took awhile to notice a difference, but I am definitely seeing it! Less wrinkles, and less lines in my face. Definitely has improved the overall appearance of my skin tone, too! Like anything, it takes time to notice a difference. You can't try it once, and expect results. It's been nearly two weeks, and I'm finally seeing some results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Deep acting Facial moisturizer is a great product. I have been using it nightly for 2 weeks now. You can feel the moisture in your skin after using it. My skin looks 80 times better then it did. I have been telling everyone I know, (Co workers , my adult children, friend and family) about how great this product works to keep my face moist and not drying out. It's a great value, and when combined with the other products in the trio , is priceless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the best way to describe this moisturizer is super creamy. I am suddenly taking the time to take care of my skin. I have really enjoyed pampering myself and using this cream. Mostly I have been putting this on in the evening and I quickly forget it is there. It absorbs into the skin well and my face is definitely feeling refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this moisturizer for about a week now, and I have to say I LOVE IT! It makes my skin silky smooth and it absorbs quickly without being greasy. My skin looks and feels hydrated, while usually this time of year my skin is dry! I haven't noticed much in the way of fine lines disappearing, but it's only been a week! I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this. I never tried it before; I'll be loyal to this product. My skin is smoother than ever before. It's also like a primer, my make-up stays on perfect throughout the entire day! Now onto wrinkles, they've diminished a little, but then again, it's only been about 17 days, but it's more progress than with any other brand! All-in-all, very happy and would recommend this product to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a good moisturizer for it's price range. It goes on smooth and smells nice. It does not leave a greasy or oily residue on your skin. It absorbs quickly and well. It will keep your face moisturized for hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product! It is very rich in texture and feels cool on the skin. I have normal to dry skin and I can definitely feel it my skin soak up the product. It doesn't feel greasy, but when applying it feels a little heavy but once it drys, weightless. A great everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im in Love. No more wasting money. When your husband notices improvement you know it's good. My skin is now supple without being oily. The T Zone I've struggled with for so long seem to be fading. The adult acne is getting better. I'm starting to notice spots are fading. I just can't say enough good about this product. I'm so glad I tried it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It is lighter than the night cream or the serum I use. Also the smell is not as strong. I use it with the serum and it goes on smoothly over it. It does't leave a sticky feeling on your skin. After you put it on, you can see the shine on your face which makes the appearance of your lines or imperfection less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the L'Oreal facial moisturizer each day and my skin is so soft and silky. The first day I applied the moisturizer it absorbed into my skin immediately with no greasy feeling. Each day I felt my skin becoming softer and softer. I loved not having the greasy feeling after application. I was expecting to be greasy like other products.

"I think that L'Oreal RevitaLift triple Deep-Acting Facial Moistuier is a wonderful product. It makes my skin feel hydrated, and feel so smooth. Makes my complexion look a whole bunch better. I would recommend Facial Moisurier to any of my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer along with the Serum in this line I have to say I really did not care for this moisturizer. It feels great going on the skin, but is way over fragranced and does not have any sunscreen in it. While packaging is marked for daytime and nighttime use I would not use during day because of lack of SPF. Loreal uses almost same fragrance in a lot of it's cosmetic items. This one just has too much of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Over time, I have developed some dry skin, especially on my face. I put this moisturizer on after I washed my face, before I went to bed. I loved how it made my face feel and smell. It was creamy and thick enough to make my face feel hydrated, yet light enough to be super comfortable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the product for a little over a week and so far I like what I am seeing. While I haven't noticed any reduction in wrinkles, I do like how soft my skin feels since beginning to use the product. My skin also looks and feels healthier, less red. I do find that the moisturizer feels a little bit heavy, but so far, so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so horrible at remembering to put lotion on my face at night. I need to get better with a nightly routine and I think I've found something worth making the effort for. This night lotion is light and makes your skin soft and nurished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had neglected my skin for a while and it had become dull n unhappy. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment for 15 days now, my skin is already happy. It seems it has come back to life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"THERE IS SOMETHING IN THESE FULL SIZE L'Oréal SKING PRODUCTS THAT MAKE YOUR FACE FILL OUT WHERE ALL THE LITTLE WRINKLES ARE AND MAKE THEM GO AWAY, I HAVE ACTUALLY ASKED IF I WAS MY SISTER'S (8 YEARS YOUNGER) YOUNGER SISTER?? LOVING IT BECAUSE SHE'S 42 AND I AM 50! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for over a week now and have seen some good things and some bad things with this product. Here's the good 1.) It made my skin feel smooth & silky. 2.) It did re-hydrate my skin & tighten it. Now here's the bad 1.) After a few days I noticed that my face started to feel greasy. 2) Due that greasiness even after washing my face twice a day I started to break out. I'm not sure this is a product that I would buy on a normal basis to my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is a GREAT product! Living in Alabama, my skin dries out daily. So I was excited to try L'Oreal. With a SPF protection, I was stoked to first feel how smoothly it went on. It wasn't greasy and absorbed quickly. Going out in this sun, L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer protected my face and lasted for hours. This moisturizer is luxuriously pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would continue using the Loreal products such as the Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer After only a couple of days using the product I woke up to smoother, softer skin. I have mature skin and started to notice a rough feel to my skin which was upsetting however the Deep Acting Facial moisturizer used nightly has started to completely reverse the dry rough feel to my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After the first time trying the night cream, I felt immediate smoothness to my skin. It was a thick cream but went on smoot & had a nice scent. I have been using it for the last week and a half and have noticed my skin looking nice and firm and almost younger looking. This is definitely a product I will be using for a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt like this was too rich for my skin. I'm starting to break out by my ears and jawline where I don't get breakouts. The jar is heavy and pretty, but I much prefer a pump, and it's too heavily fragranced for my taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was Leary at first but now am loving this. My skin hasn't felt this great for years. The acne is not so much of a problem anymore. My skin is supple now. Why didn't I start this sooner? Glad I have now! Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the L'Oréal Revitalift Triple Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer and was disappointed that it made my face feel greasy and heavy feeling with a residue. I tried using this product several times to make sure that I came up with the best review. Unfortunately the product was not for me.

"I simply love this moisturizer for night time use. I put it on after washing my face at the end of each day. The moisturizer goes on cream and smooth without a heavy, greasy feeling. It is absorbed quickly so you don't feel like it's being rubbed of onto your pillows at night. I didn't use it during the day because I use L'Oreal's Facial Day Lotion, but it can definitely be used because it is not heavy. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a light moisturizer that works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a wonderful product. It completely transformed my skin so it is no longer dry. You do not have to use a lot since it absorbs well and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. I look forward to buying the Triple Power Eye Cream to use with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product two weeks ago because I am trying to find a good moisturizer with a fair price. I am 48 years old with dry skin. My face gets chapped very easily. My skin just loves this product! I use it morning and night. It is easy to use, not greasy and calmed my skin immediately. This is definitely a keeper! I like the smell, but I found if you use it with the other Loreal Paris moisturizer line, it can be too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for over a week and I can already see and feel a difference! I really love the facial moisturizer! I have been applying this product at night before I go to bed and when I wake up my face still feels as soft as it did when I first put on the product the night before! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I have been using this moisturizer for a lil over a week. The scent is nice. The texture is light, but covers well without being watery or too thick. I have combination skin, so I was a little worried I might have a few breakouts, but so far so good. I have noticed a healthier glow to my face, and I'm sure you will too!

"This is by far my favorite Loreal Revitalift product. It is super thick and creamy but soaks in deep, does not leave your skin greasy or wet at all. I've been using this as an overnight treatment for 2 weeks and my skin appears smoother and healthy. The jar is huge so go ahead and lather it on and watch for the magic. I love this and can't wait to see what happens in the next 2 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The moisturizer has improved the look and feel of my facial skin after using it along with the serum and lotion. I've been faithfully applying it morning and night and love how little product it takes to cover the entire face and neck areas; I was a little apprehensive at first since it is a more expensive product but I can see now it will last quite awhile because of the absorption qualities of the product. Definitely will continue using these L'Oreal products in the future!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the pump bottle that the lotion came in. I also was very pleased with the spf! I felt this had the right amount of coverage, and my face did not get greasy through the day. After 1 week of use my face is much smoother and looks healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer has done wonders in the 2 weeks that I have used it. My skin feels softer, smoother and refreshed since using this product. After applying, I usually wait 5 minutes before putting on make-up. It has helped a lot to keep those dry spots under control. Quick tip: You don't need a lot when applying, a little will go a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
", I can't get over how amazing these products are, I've been using this product along with the concentrated serum treatment , I have to say I'm extremely satisfied with the results , I've been using this product about 2 and a half weeks. My face feels great, looks great and my skin feels night and tight! I would highly recommend these products to all... give it a try! I promise you won't be let down.....

I have been nervous to use any kind of moisturizer on my face because my skin on my face has always been very clear. I am so happy that I did. This stuff is truely amazing. Its even more amazing how much it made my skin glow. It just seemed more healthier. My face has never felt this great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product and I looked like a glazed donut! I'm sure this is a great product if you have dry skin but if you have combo or oily skin I would avoid. It felt like I was dirty because of the oily feel/look. The smell wasn't bad or the texture but for me personally, no thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the feel of this moisturizer. Not oily or greasy, absorbs into the skin readily. Light fragrance. Can't really tell any difference in appearance of my 70 year old skin, but I do like the way it leaves my skin feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a nice finishing touch product. Love the creamy texture and smell of the product. Non oily and non drying product. I've used some spf products that have left my face feeling dry and cracked this product didn't. My face is soft and is not left with a shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is wonderful, I just turned 40 and I'm looking 30 again. My wrinkles are disappearing, my skin has smoothed out, it's like a facelift in a bottle. I actually felt comfortable not wearing makeup because my skin is looking so great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this lotion! it is a thicker cream you put on after the serum in the morning and at night after you cleaned your face. my face is sometimes affected with acne and it is just amazing how it cleaned it up! my skin feels so fresh and moisturized!

I have been using all three of the products for over a week. I like to use the products together because I think they make my face healthy. The moisturizer is nice and not too thick. The scent is nice too. I feel these three products from L'Oreal are worth the money. The amount that we get for the cost is reasonable. I like the deep acting moisture in this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer is a great product. I've been using it twice daily. I use it in the morning and at night before bedtime. My skin feels very hydrated and appears to have a glow. The appearance of my skin is definitely healthier after using this product. My skin feels very soft to the touch. I absolutely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! Being that I have sensitive skin and get dry spots in the winter months due to hot showers and weather, this product is GREAT!! It makes my face super soft and a little goes a long way. It does what its suppose to do, my face hasn't been dry in weeks and looks great. My breakouts have even stopped! Yay! And it has tightened my skin with my forehead wrinkles fading away. I would buy this product and recommend it to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this one in the evening after cleaning my face and applying the facial treatment serum. I let the two work overnight and wake up to a soft feeling skin. At first I was reticent, but after using it for almost two weeks, I think I can see some results. I plan on using it for a while and compare results after a month or two.

"This is a great product, it really keeps your face moisturized the entire day and even when it is colder outside it helps with all of the dry skin and makes the lines in your face seem smaller. I will definitely keep using this product and the ones that go along with it to make my face younger and more smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If I could describe this moisturizer in just one word it would be: luxurious. Immediately my dry skin was no longer flaky! After just one use! Not only did it help hydrate my skin and give it a nice smooth and soft texture, it smells great while doing it. The only thing I didn't like was it would sometimes get clump-like... Feeling the product ball up on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a full-time caregiver to my husband that has a Traumatic Brain Injury, it is very difficult to find time to take care of myself. Stretrgically placing this moisturizer right by my seat along with some facial wipes, I find that I am taking the time to apply this moistizer ngihtly. The feel of the moistuizer is very luxurious [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So after using this for over a week I find that the step two of the routine has a weird film that comes off on my make up sponge or fingers. No matter how long I let it soak in. It still keeps my face soft. I have really noticed much change in fine lines yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After trying the moisturize for a few days...I'm loving how it keeps my skin moisturized. I generally have combination dry skin but this really kept the dryness at bay. The consistency is just right. It's not runny or to solid. It applies to the skin perfectly. I would consider switching moisturizers for this one. It's very light on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried several moisturizers over the years, but I have finally tried the last one! I will not buy another brand! I feel my skin's softness all day long. While this is not one of its adervising points, my makeup goes on so much smoother because of this! Another great aspect is the value! It only takes a little bit for my skin, and so I know it will last a while! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't usually use products available in stores but decided to.give this a go because of the product name and reputation. So far I have started a routine using day and night cream,serum and day lotion. I alternate cream and lotion. I prefer the crexam vs lotion so far. Lotion left slippery feeling and cream does not [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is very easy to use you will love the way your face and skin feels after applying yet Bottles are very easy with directions on them No greasy feel if applied in small amounts would recommend this product to anyone and everyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've only used this product for 8 days every night. I found it a little too heavy to use in the morning even though it says day and night on the instructions. A little goes a long way and it covers well but for someone with combo skin I think it's best at night because it make my skin a little too sticky when I used it as a day cream. More updates coming as Revlon RevitaLift says full benefits are reached in 4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I think of a moisturizer I think of tons of dollars I have to spend so my face doesn't feel dried out and cracked. However after using this L'Oreal moisturizer I am a believer in the fact that a good moisturizer does not have to cost an arm and a leg. The creaminess of this moisturizer is amazing it went on so smooth and my face still felt replenished all day. I love the way it laid with my face makeup this is definitely going to be a product that I use for now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer left my skin glowing and sooo soft. After using it for a week my face feels smoother and I've received compliments from my husband on my skin. I would definitely recommend this 100x!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This L'Oréal deep-acting moisturizer lives up to the hype! It is moisturizing without being too greasy and works well under makeup and especially in the evening. I put the serum underneath for some extra umph and I love it. My skin feel plumped, refreshed and nourished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really am hesitant to try facial products as many of them make my face break out. However, I tried out the revitalift triple power facial moisturizer and absolutely loved it!! It did not feel oily on my skin, and smelled amazing. Even my boyfriend, who works outside, is excited to use it for the winter months. I absolutely loved this product!

"Triple Power. Yeah you can say that again! First the moisturizer sinks into my skin and became invisible(showing no white lines). Second, The Hyaluronic Acid did not sting or cause redness on my face, which i have had trouble in the past with other products like this. Third, my face felt good, smooth, refreshed & like it use to. Can't wait to see more results with further use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the thick, creamy feel of this moisturizer is luxurious. It glides on smoothly, absorbs into my skin well. After using this for only a week, my skin definitely feels softer, smoother, and more hydrated. I think the ""deep-acting"" name fits this product because I feel like it really penetrates my skin to repair and moisturize. I haven't noticed a ""lift"" yet, but I will continue to use it.

"I have been searching for a facial moisturizer for quite some time. My search is over. I have been using the L,Oreal Paris revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer for a little over a week and am very impressed at how hydrated/moisturizer my face is. A little went a long way and it was not greasy. This is now part of my daily routine. I have and will continue to recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the for a week now and in the mornings. I really love how quickly it absorbs into a the skin. My skin feels smooth, more radiant/glowing and overall healthier. I love using all of the products this line has to offer. If you are looking for a relatively cheaper (price wise) moisturizer, look no further! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It did an excellent job of adding and trapping extra moisture into my skin. I applied it nightly for 6 days. The day/night moisturizer is the perfect combination of thick and creamy. It absorbed instantly leaving my skin feeling softer and, more importantly, appearing more radiant. I gave the product 4 stars because it did not have any impact on my thankfully, few wrinkles. I will continue to use the product to see if there will be other positive changes with long-term application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was super excited to get these L'Oreal products and they did not disappoint one bit. I feel like i prefer I serum that is see through. But that's just my preference. This does really prepare my skin for my makeup products. It makes my skin look and feel very soft and super smooth. It smells of soft flowers but it's not offensive. As far as repairing...I haven't used it long enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the moisturizer application to my face. My skin really, really felt more refreshed. When your skin feels good I think your face kinds of glows. I know I do. I really feel little sample packets that folks could try at the cosmetic counter would feel what I felt on their face. Your face just feels good. I hope you do this. This would really help. I know when I go to the counter I'm really overwhelmed by the abundance of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This product is great - I applied the concentrated serum first and in a few seconds applied L-Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer every night.

This product is awesome. I notice after a couple of days that my face had a glow to it. It felt so soft and smooth. I have dry skin and part of my face is oily.

My experience with the deep power night cream was great. It felt rich and was deeply moisturizing. A little goes a long way. I used it in the morning as well under the day lotion. I love the benefits. It made my skin radiant and plumper. When used in conjunction with the serum I could see the lift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received his as a free sample! I am really impressed that I got a full-size sample! I have been using this for over a week now every night before bed I'm impressed at how moisturize my skin is in the morning. My skin is smoother & brighter. I think that some people would put off by the scent. Though it smells good some don't like a strong scent. I am really happy to have this in my routine!

"After looking for the right facial moisturizer to help combat the fine wrinkles i have,i finally found a good one.Used this for few weeks and i can see the difference.They seemed to fade and my skin feels tighter and firmer.used and very happy i did.My friends can see the difference as well.So if you are looking for a moisturizer to help with your fine wrinkles i feel this is the perfect one for that.

"This moisturizer is a good one. I applied the Concentrated Serum first then the Moisturizer over that morning and night. I didn't have long to review it so I can't really report on it's long-term usage. Short-term usage provided a very soft, supple feel to my skin, and even started working on smaller lines and crepiness around my eyes. I'd recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial moisturizer is amazing :) It has a thick, luxurious feel as it goes on and leaves my skin feeling hydrated AND looking younger and more vibrant. It is non-greasy so no need to cover my face in powder after I use it. The fine lines around my eyes are significantly less visable. I will be purchasing this product regularly in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't care for this product. I applied it in the morning before applying make-up. By lunch time all of my makeup looked clumpy on my skin and I looked very blotchy. I then switched to using it before bed on my neck. It goes on very thick and felt like it was wiping off on my pillow case. I think this will be my weekend moisturizer when I am not wearing makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is something I can use every day. I like to use it before and after bed. The feel of it is great. It dries quickly, so I'm able to put my make-up on fairly quickly after I put it on. It makes my face feel smooth. The best part is that it doesn't feel heavy, and that it isn't hard to spread. I think this is my new must-have moisturizer.

I started using this Moisturizer before bed and have really enjoyed it. I never used a moisturizer at night before and I love the way this one smells (not overwhelming at all). It has only been about a week so far but my skin feel smoother already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved trying this. Smells good and it goes on smooth. There's nothing about this that I didn't not like. I'm not big on using more than one thing when I'm cleaning my face. But using this with the concentrated serum works great together. I was skeptical at first, but the more I use it the more I like it. I'm definitely sticking with these.

"I love the way the jar looks but not a fan of the smell, it kind of reminds me of bug spray. The cream has a nice consistency and makes your skin feel smooth. I would only use this cream at nice though. If the company would take all the off smelling fragrance out I would love this product. I will not be purchasing this product in the future. I did not see any difference in the fine lines on my forehead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is a great product. I don't usually use any products on my face because in the past they have left my face feeling oily. This product didn't do that at all. I noticed a difference almost immediately. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I notice my face feeling softer and having a healthy glow to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am loving this line of moisturizer. I have oily skin but when I use this my face doesn't feel oily it smooths in wonderfully feels good also. And I can see a difference in my grin lines too. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never been a big moisturizer user, that was until I tried this product.It is non greasy which is a huge plus. It's smooth and does not have a strong fragrance . I noticed a difference within a week in my skin and how it had a glow to it and how it felt as if it was tightening up. This is now a part of my daily facial routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Been using for a week and I can't believe how smooth my skin feels. Also starting to notice a little tightening. Looking forward to seeing results in a few more weeks. So easy to use glides on not heavy feeling at all. Used morning and night, lightweight. Important to me might be to some but wanted to let you know the container is easy to open.

"I think L'Oreal revitalift triple power deep acting facial moisturizer is great. Before i started using it my face was extremely dry. After the second day of using it I had no more dry spots. You couldnt tell my skin was very dry days before. It is very easy to apply makeup over it. The only little bad thing is my nose gets a little oily through the day, but that doesnt stop me from using this great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm totally loving the feeling of my skin and I've only had it a couple of days, I'm sold! Due to severe osteoporosis, I've lost so much jaw bone and teeth, I can no longer were dentures so my face has srivel and deep lines, and I'm really hoping the whole bundle will show dramatic change, I already feel the tightening [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the texture of this moisturizer. It's nice and creamy and didn't feel heavy. On me, it burned slightly, and I noticed it caused some redness in a few places. Could just be that my skin is too sensitive for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this product or products from L'Oreal are wonderful not only do they smell good (witch is a huge factor of mine) but it feels wonderful on your skin and u actually see a big difference when using this product. For one i love any thing free #Gotitfree from #Bzzagent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was able to try this product and I noticed my skin looked firmer after use. I also noticed an smoother look to my skin. The only concern I had initially is that I had a little itch after applying the cream. However, it did not last long. I would recommend this product to those looking to lift their skin naturally.

I loved this night time product. My skin screamed for it's moisture and yet my face did not feel like it was drowning in oil. It went on silky smooth. Light scent. My face appeared refreshed in the morning with no oily or greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A little goes a long way with this moisturizer! I rub it all over my face and neck, it's really thick but leaves my face feeling great. I would definitely continue to use this fantastic moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I stopped my regular cream for this for several weeks. It is a good moisturizer. Your skin feels soft and smooth. It has a great fragrance too. My skin did feel a bit oily when I woke in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer every night for two weeks. I love the way my 58 year old skin looks. No more dry patches and my makeup goes on smooth. My skin actually looks firmer and more dewey. The moisturizer is just the right consistency. It absorbs fully, but is not greasy. I have tried a lot of products over the years, and this one is by far the best! No exaggeration here! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very skeptical with using the moisturizer when I first tried it as it was very thick. I have oily skin so I try to stay away from any thing that might make it look more greasy. But I have to say I am very pleased with how moisturized and hydrated my skin feels and look in just over a week of using it. I dab just a little on my face and neck and even just a little bit goes a long ways. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using Avon products for about a 3 months. I barely started noticing a difference. I started using Loreal for a week and noticed my wrinkles under my chin are going away. I'll be switching to Loreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is nice and think and I do feel that it is very moisturizing. I haven't been using it very long but have noticed some smoothing out of fine lines. I'll continuing using this moisturizer for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the lotion the first time I used it. My combination skin was no longer dry on my cheeks and my face felt moisturized all day. And the lotion smells great. However, after about a week of using it, I noticed my nose and chin were very oily. I had to apply powder far more often to keep the shine down. I think this would be a great lotion for someone with overall dry skin. It's s very rich lotion and doesn't require you to use much to get results. Which makes it a great value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product every day for a week now, and my skin feels so good! I'm always dry and flaky, especially in the fall/winter. I usually slather my face with moisturizer and hope for the best. I actually use about a quarter size amount of this product, and it soaks into my skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth. I will definitely be buying this once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this L'Oreal Revitalift Deep Moisturizer is a great product. It helps reduce wrinkles. I never thought I had that many wrinkles until trying this product because now I can see a big difference in my face. I always swore that moisturizers like this that helps wrinkles never really work but I will no longer say that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for a week at night and my skin is tighter and brighter in the mornings. I have also noticed my forehead lines seem less visable! Hurray for THAT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's great for mature skin. Very fresh, soft and feels great. It is so easy to ""neglect"" your skin, but this product quickly showed me that a little time makes a BIG difference. My skin is softer, feels less tight, and is very refreshing. I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My aging skin is very dry in some areas. I also have some brown spots which are normally very dry. after the first day, I could tell a difference in my skin. It was softer and smoother. No dry patches and the brown spots are softer. Really like this product. The longer I use it the better my face looks and feels. It only takes a little each time you use it so it will last longer than you think. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Loreal Deep Acting Moisturizer is great.I love it. I have been using it and the Facial Serum along with the Facial Lotion for 4 days and have noticed my face getting firmer.I will definitely be using this from now on. Thank you Bzz Agent and Loreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm loving this facial moisturizer! I was in the market for a new facial regimen and using this moisturizer along with the serum is doing wonders for my skin! My skin in visibly smother and more hydrated. Living in dry weather, I need a product that can nourish my skin in the driest of conditions. I will be using these products from now on! So happy to have gotten the opportunity to try them. Try these products, you will not be disappointed!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for a week. It goes on smooth, and feel wonderful. There isn't that greasy feeling, or heavy feeling. I tend to have dry skin, and my face seems more even in tone, and healthy. It is easy to use, I put it on once out of the shower. I have used other products in the past, and this one feels so much nicer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love love love this moisturizer! It has a great lightweight and my face feels smooth and I love that it will minimize fine lines too! My only complaint is that it does. It contain a SPF! However I have been using it at night and using the day mositurizerin the morning:) I would highlyrecommmend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved trying this! It's a thicker moisturizer so it was perfect for my nighttime facial routine. My face felt nice without that weird caking that some moisturizers have done in the past on me. Will continuing using until it's gone to determine if there were any major changes to my appearance, but in the meantime, I'm enjoying the product very much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the facial moisturizer and I must admit that I didn't like it at first but that is because clearly I used too much. A lot goes a long way with this and when I put less on, my skin felt fantastic! I love this as it moisturized and didn't make my skin feel oily. I will definitely purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am lucky to get my face washed everyday so a second step is a little annoying. When I opened the jar, it seems that the product isn't filled all the way to the top which forces me to use less than I think I should. It DOES leave my skin really soft which is excellent and it makes my skin look healthier. This product is really good, I just hate the time it takes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Beautiful packaging, but I prefer a pump type product that I don't have to put my fingers into. This product does not have sunscreen, so I've only used it at night. It went on smoothly over the serum, but I did notice some exfoliating effect shortly after applying. I have used the product for one week, however I haven't seen any remarkable difference in my skin's appearance. I wanted to know this said it was for day or night, yet it contained no SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product felt heavy when I first applied, that freshness I was expecting never arrived and the heavy feeling stayed with me. I was very disappointed. I did my normal facial cleaning and the feelings of heaviness was still there. I had to do a deep cleanse before that feeling left my face. I do not recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far this product has exceeded my expectations!! I've been using this daily for 6 days and I notice my skin feels and looks smoother! It was scary to turn 35 I started looking into products to take care of my face and skin L'Oreal is the best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer does hydrate the skin well, but has a very heavy texture and leaves a slip to the skin. This product also has a heavy scent to it that is not appealing to me. I have sensitive combination skin and this product did not clog up my pores, even though it felt a bit greasy on my face. This product does do the job of hydrating the skin, but I would not recommend it, due to the heavy texture and scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this moisturizer for a little over a week and it is amazing. It smells wonderfully and it has left my skin extremely soft. A little goes a long way so I see this lasting me a long time. I would definitely recommend this product, you wont regret it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I actually love this sunscreen! It smells great and it works. It doesn't hurt that the bottle was lovely. I used this product in conjunction with the Serum and My skin felt smooth and never dry. I do have very sensitive skin and other than a slight tingle that went away after a day or two, I had no problems! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this moisturizer for about a week everyday and love it. After the very first use my skin felt amazing. You only need a small amount to moisturize your entire face and neck. I am a former smoker and have been looking for a product that will bring that youthful glow back to my skin and this product does the job. I can not wait to see the results after further use of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am always a skeptic when it comes to moisturizers. Will it leave me with red skin? Will I be greasy? Even worse will it cause breakouts? Well I can definitively saw the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer doesn't causes any of those worries. This cream is gentle and light and leaves my skin refreshed and glowing. I couldn't be more in love with the Triple Power Products!! Run out and try them for your self. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product and the brand as well. The moisturizer is wonderful and I could feel and see a difference after just a short bit of using it. I would definitely recommend this product and most any of their products. I have never been disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always been a fan of L'Oreal skincare products and this is no exception. I love finding a moisturizer that is great for both day and night and moiturizes well without being greasy, this fits the bill! The scent is light but pleasant and it's very comfortable on the skin. I put on a bit more at night for extra moisture, but it works great day or night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this Facial serum. Gives me soft smooth skin. I've used it for 10 days now and my skin feels great and looks younger ! I will continue to use this. I am a tennis coach and get a lot of sun on my face . This product is taking away that weathered looking skin. Thank You [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What can I say, I am in love with this Moisturizer!!! It's silky when you put it on, it makes my skin feel dewy and soft. I love the way my dry face feels smooth and supple. I can see a huge difference after using this moisturizer for a short amount of time, already. I do use this twice a day. Living in the harsh heat of Arizona really dries my skin out and this product is working like a miracle. Yep, I'm a fan for life!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very oily skin and also very sensitive skin. This moisturizer is thick but it does not break me out and doesn't feel thick on my face. It absorbs very nicely into my skin and my pores have diminished. Unfortunately, the very strong fragrance is a no-go for me regardless of the effectiveness. If L'Oreal could remove the fragrance, I'd definitely be a fan. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was impressed by this product. It is not to oily, not sticky and the smell is soft and nice. After a week of use my skin feels a bit softer than before and the product does not feel heavy. On a bad cold day I used twice because my skin was super dry and I like how it feels after used [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is something I can use nightly and not get a greasy face that starts breaking out. I typically cannot use moisturizers because I always break out, but after a week of using this on problems. I can see that my face is looking healthier with it and I don't have any dry flaky patches. I am excited to see how this looks after long-term use. The only thing I didn't like was it smells really strongly like perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product a little late due to travel, but have been using it for the past couple of days. Here are some of the things that I really like about it so far: 1. Goes on smooth 2. No Stickiness 3. Nice smell to it. 4 . A little goes a long way I can't wait to see if I continue to using it will it really improve my aging. It does seem like my skin has a nice glow to it. More to report back on after more use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of the 3 products I tried, I enjoyed this one the most. I like the way my face felt for the most part. It did leave me a little more oily than usual. What I really did NOT like was that this moisturizer is heavily perfumed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I will and am going to continue this L'Oréal facial regimen. I have been looking for this type of combination for a while without success. The L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Trio. Two day creams , two nightcreams , and a sunscreen I use over my make up. My skin feels and looks better and is just more comfortable. I think this is a wonderful product and have been using it just a short while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer was easy to use, went on easily, but didn't seem to absorb very well. My skin felt too wet. I have been trying to use less and that helps. So maybe I used too much at first. I do notice that if I use it in the morning, if I get over heated or the weather is too warm it runs into my eyes. So I haven't been using it in the morning, just at bed time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisturizer is very thick and creamy. It feels great at night, but I think it is a little too much for during the day. I adjusted the amount I used and tried a couple more days, but it's still too heavy for daytime I believe. My skin is very soft now though and I would definitely use this product again.

Only used product one week and love every step of it. All 3 work well together and gentle on skin. Usually this time of year my skin gets extremely dry and burns. Will not have to worry using this product. Smells and feels good on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"SO far is has been great! I love the way it makes my face feel after its been applied, has made my face so much softer than it was. I haven't used it very long now and will review more when I've been using for about 4 weeks, I am hoping it helps with wrinkles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There is no other way to describe this than to say it feels this like silk. I've never had a lotion feel this way. Luxurious in feel and look. Even the container is beautiful. You feel as if you are using high end skin care. It's amazing stuff. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and super soft. The only thing I dont like about this product is the scent. The scent is rather strong and lingers for some time. It does not dissipate fast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loreal deep-acting moisturizer feels cool & creamy to the touch. I can already see my brighter & firmer face & neck. I'm excited to be given this opportunity to try this Loreal Paris product!!! Keep them coming!!❤️❤️❤️❤️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this is an amazing product. L'Oréal Paris Revita lift facial moisturizer is great, I have very sensitive skin and actual avoid trying new products for fear of a strange reaction. I am so glad I tried this my skin feels better and even my husband noticed a difference, he's a truck driver so he's gone most of the time. I am very happy with the product. I will definitely purchace this regularly thank you BzzAgent for the opportunity to try before I buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this moisturizer daily in combination with the L'Oreal Revitalift serum and I am very happy with them so far! The product goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It does not leave any greasy residue. So far I feel like my skin looks more bright and healthy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this in combination with the serum. I am really enjoying this product because it leaves my face feeling fresh & smooth! I don't have any greasy look or feel to my face. I haven't been using the product more than 3 weeks so I'm not too sure if it actually benefiting my skin but I do like the feel & look that I am getting to this point!

"I really like the jar that this moisturizer came in. As far as the Triple Power 3-step regime is concerned, though, I'm not sure what this step is doing. I think the first step, the serum, does the most work and the last two steps are moisturizer, which doesn't seem completely necessary. I really like how this cream smells and feels good on my face. My face looks better, but I'm not sure this is what is doing it? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product along with the triple power concentrate serum daily, sometimes twice daily. I've only used it for a week and already notice an improvement in my skin tone, plus reduced appearance of wrinkles. Feels great going on, not too heavy under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the triple power concentrate and the deep acting day/night cream in the evenings and the facial day lotion with SPF under my makeup every morning. I have been doing so for about one week and have noticed a refreshed loom with fine lines beginning to show improvements. I have normally had trouble with breakouts when trying new facial treatments, but I have not had a single one with this great series! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer about a week ago when I received it. I use it after the serum and it makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. I enjoy the fragrance! In the places where it was dry, it is no longer dry and the places that were oily are not oily! I expect to see even more results the longer I use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product went on feeling great and smelling amazing! I felt like it really moisturized my face without leaving it feeling icky and wasn't too heavy! I would totally recommend it to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the smell of this cream. It's not heavy and you feel fresh. I apply the deep moisturizer when I'm not leaving the house. Halloween weekend it came very handy after washing my facial makeup that made me feel icky, sticky. Very little of the cream covers my face and neck. I love this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is the best I have used in a long time, probably ever. Completely non-greasy, absorbs quickly and my skin has felt amazing. Looks great under makeup and doesn't give the skin a wet appearance when not wearing makeup. This is a product I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new facial moisturizer. I will be buying this product again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has been a week now, and my already face looks more youthful and healthy. This moisturizer clearly makes a difference in my skin and it is very noticeable.

I love this moisturizer! I have dry skin and always find it hard to find a moisturizer that works all day long .

"I really like this facial moisturizer. It has a very pleasant scent, not too strong. It comes in a nice size jar, and will last because you don't need a lot. I really like how smooth it feels, not greasy or oily. I have been using on my entire face. It makes it feel very smooth. I have had to use lightly on my chin due to some acne breakouts. I like that this product is affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this L'Oréal facial moisturizer and I love it! It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so good! It works really well with the L'Oréal Triple Power Serum! I have been using this moisturizer at night before bed and my skin still looks fresh in the morning. It is making my fine lines not so noticiable and my whole face looks much better using this product along with the other L'oreal triple power products. Try them and you will love them!

"The L'Oreal Revitalift Cream is such a wonderful product. It is very easy to apply. You dip your finger in the cream and apply with fingers on face and neck. Immediately, the face feels soft and smooth. After a couple hours, my face looks clean, bright, and refreshed. It even felt soft. For me, it is really hard finding a perfect face cream that doesn't harm my sensitive skin. This product has really improved the quality of my skin.

"After using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer for one week, my skin is feeling the effects. My skin is softer, and small dry patches have disappeared. The moisturizer smells good, and feels nice going on. It is not heavy, or watery, just right. I will definitely continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The quality of this moisturizer is great and my face felt great after using it. The one reason I would not buy this product is the smell. I prefer the scent of my current product and that is enough for me not to buy. I received this product for free in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this as a daily moisturizer after washing my face. It has a great scent and goes on smooth without feeling oily. I really like the product so far... but would like to see how my skin responds to it over time. It has not caused any breakouts and I have sensitive skin. I would like to see if it helps smooth eye wrinkles. So far good though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is light weight and needed for UV protection. I use a moisturizer before I put sunscreen on and this was light enough that my pores did not feel clogged. I really liked that it did not leave a white tint like most sunscreen does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very impressed with this product. I have been using it along with the facial serum and am very pleased with the results. It has worked better than I ever thought it would. The lotion is thick and does not leave a greasy feeling after applying it. It rubs in nicely and your face is left feeling fresh and clean. I highly recommend these products.

"So far I really like this moisturizer. I use it at night before bed because I heard that's when it's best to use face products. I used it in combination with the serum. I will try using it Day and night for better results. Overall, very happy with product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is amazing! Usually night creams are quite a bit heavy and it sort of feels like your skin can't breathe. But this L'Oreal Paris Revitalift has a light airy feel that is just wonderful. I've had night creams that have left like grease spots on my pillowcases before, but not this. I give this 2 thumbs up!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This facial moisturizer does lift, tighten, and tone. I use at night because I use the day lotion with spf20 for protection during the day. This cream feels really rich going on and you wake up feeling soft but toned. Use it with the serum treatment and you'll start to see and feel results in less than a week. As I continue to use the lifting, tightening and toning is more pronounced. My color has evened out because dark spots are fading too. This is a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all the smell is wonderful. My skin has never felt so soft. I have noticed reduced appearance in wrinkles under my eyes,and more even skin tone. The texture of the product is so velvety, just can't say enough about the way it makes my skin so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Deep Acting Moisturizer for about a week now. I have dry and oily parts to my face. And now I don't thanks to L'Oreal. My face fells like it all belongs together. No more combination skin. My face feels smoother and looks firmer. The puffiness under my eyes has been reduced. I actually can't wait to see the differences in one more week.

I trird the Deep-Acting Moisturizer along the the serum before bed. My skin felt well hydrated & soft when I woke up in the morning. It has a nice clean scent to it. I have sensitive skin & I did notice a redness to my skin and I had to be very careful not to get it too close to my eyes or my eyes tended to be irratated and they would water. I would recommend this product for a night moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Been using for a week now and am so impressed with how well it works! Hydration and beautiful skin are something that is high on my list of gotta have! Being a mom I need something that is easy to do and in just minutes I am able to complete a routine that makes my skin supple and radiant!! I use the matching serum with it as well. I do recommend you buy all the products to work in tandem with each other, amazing products!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer along with the serum works great! It leaves your skin feeling fresh and smooth and hydrated throughout the day! I have only been using it for about a week so I'm not sure if it's working for wrinkles and tightening yet but my face looks younger and I'll definitely recommend this product and buy it myself in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a very thick product that had me concerned I would be breaking out. But that hasn't happened. What has happened is my skin is smoother and softer. The only reason I am not giving this a 5 is because it feels a little greasy for a while after I put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never used this brand of moisturizer before and I do like it. It goes on smooth and does not feel thick like some other brands. My skin feels softer and smoother. It does have a scent, but I don't think it is too strong of a smell like some other brands. I may consider purchasing more when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its been several days of usage now, both day and night, for the Deep - Acting Facial Moisturizer. I can notice that my overall skin texture is much much better! When I wake up in the morning my skin feels great and is noticeably more even toned. This moisturizer does have a light scent which I enjoy as it makes me feel clean and fresh. I definitely recommend giving it a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using RevitaLift facial moisturizer for about a week now and I really love it. It absorbs nicely into your skin and leaves your face feeling soft and healthy.

"This deep-acting facial moisturizer feels so wonderful to my skin! It feels so rich and smooth and like it should be a high dollar department store product. I expected it to cause breakouts in my acne prone skin but it didn't. I feel my skin looks healthier, more supple and feels so good. I would recomment this to anyone that wants their skin to look and feel better at any age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the serum along with the facial mosturizer. I got my package exactly a week ago and have noticed a slight improvement in my fine lines and dark spots. It was advised to use it for longer and I would potentially see more improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the serum at night it wasn't heavy or sticky and did not leave my fave feeling like it had a layer of oil on it I usually don't use stuff like this cause it makes my face really oily but this didn't I would buy this product I also liked the way it was packaged very nice and eye catching [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the moisturizer for the first time tonight and thought it had a hair product smell as well. However it was silky smooth and the product immediately felt like it was working but only time will tell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love everything about this moisturizer. It has a fresh clean fragrance and it feels so rich and creamy when you apply it to your face. It makes your skin feel immediately softer. When I woke up and felt my face, it felt so soft and smooth. I love this product very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is not my favorite item in the line of products. The smell is faint, and the feeling of the moisturizer is very thick. You seem to need more of this then you would think, it doesn't spread out very well. It made my face feel pretty oily and sticky, then after a few days I notice a change in my skin. My face did feel as oily and I notice the texture of my skin to have a better feel to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my first time trying the moisturizer by L'Oreal and I love it. I love that it does just moisturizes my face and not leave it greasy and oily after I put it on or even later in the day. Before using this I was using the old fashion moisturizer...Vaseline, it would moisturize but it would leave my face very greasy. I think I found the moisturizer that I been looking for. it makes my skin very soft and smooth, I have noticed the difference since using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product daily now I used to wear foundation everyday to cover up my face but since using this product I don't need to wear foundation I feel so much more confident with my appearance I would recommend anyone try this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer smooths onto my face very well. I use it after the Concentrated Serum Treatment at night and again in the morning before the Revitalift sunscreen. This cream has a very pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Especially when layered over the serum, this provides a nice level of moisturization without feeling too heavy. I appreciate that it contains hyaluronic acid, as I know that that has been proven to improve skin condition. I'm not crazy about the perfumey fragrance, but that's not a deal-breaker for me.

The Loreal Triple Power Sunscreen is excellent.. I am using this product as a daily regime and I can really tell the difference in my skin. My skin feels very good after 3 days of use. I'm not worried about too much exposure to the sun because my looks and feels protected. Our Louisiana weather can be tough on the skin but mine has a fresh feel all day with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is thick and thoroughly moisturized my face and neck with a small amount. It would be a very effective product for someone with dry skin. My skin is a bit too oily for this product. It left my skin feeling a bit too slick. I think it might be too much with the serum. As a stand alone moisturizer it might be fine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love loreal but this product not so much. It looked good on my face at first but its like my skin wouldnt soak it in. When i went to put makeup on or touched my face it rolled up this sticky goo & came off my face :/ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this for 3 days and really like it. I have very dry skin and this works great . I put it on after I wash my fave at night and wow it feels good. I woke up and my face was not dry looking. I will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I wake up in the morning my face is not oily (I have very oily skin). It is very lightweight but still moisturizing. I apply all over my face and neck and I have noticed a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Well I have been using this for a few days now and my skin feels much softer to the touch as well as firm. The fine lines are getting smaller and smaller but I haven't seen much change in the dark spots but the bags under my eyes have lightened a bit. I will update in a few more days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanted tolove this product but it wasn't for my skin type. I generally gravitate towards clear serums but decided to give this product a try. Unfortunately I broke out. I find that this was too heavy & could stand on its on as 2 in 1 type of product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer!! I have extremely dry and flaky skin, so moisturizing is a must for me. This moisturizer has already improved my skin, it feels smoother and my makeup actually smooths on evenly without the scaly patches that I usually have. I would highly recommend L'Oreal paris revitalift triple power deep-acting moisturizer to my family and friends or anyone no matter what skin type, mine is also sensitive and I had no reaction. Love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the Deep Acting Moisturizer at night time about a week ago. I have ditched my old moisturizer for this one. I really love to use this along with the serum. My face feel so soft now. However do note that you only need a little to cover your entire face and neck. If you use to much it will feel heavy. I will keep using this every night before bed. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think a couple of days is too soon to see long term results with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer but it makes me feel better already. I use it at night and in the morning I look more rested. I think it works well overnight and is softening my wrinkles. I would recommend it to anyone who is concerned about looking older.

I am currently testing the L'Oreal Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer. OMG I absolutely love the way it feels on my face. I was hesitant at first because of the perfume smell but I really love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical about this at first, the lotion is thick and a little bit goes a LONG ways. I was worried it would make my skin greasy, instead it was moisturized all day long and even helped minimize oil on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer. I thought at first that it would leave my skin oily but I have been using this for a little over a week and I am very impressed. I think this is the best moisturizer I have used, and I usually purchase one that is much more expensive. I am please with the overall feel of my skin after using.

There was a tingling sensation when I first applied the product and my skin did feel softer and look brighter after only a couple days of use. I didn't like the slightly greasy feeling that it left around my nose but that wasn't too major of a concern. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product. Feels great against my skin, non greasy, goes on smooth and moisturizes great. It absorbs great. Made my skin feel like I received a small facial.

"The L'Oreal Paris RevitalLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Facial Moisturizer is wonderful! It comes in very nice packaging - a glass jar with an easy to unscrew top. The moisturizer leaves your face smelling very nice and very soft. I have not noticed any extra grease on my face from this new product - which for me - is wonderful! I'll keep using it for a while longer and re-review then in case there are any changes. Overall, a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great product!! I try this moisturizer for 8 day. When you have a dry skin is so dificult to find a moisturizer that hydrated your skin for the all day. So far im really happy with the results i have. My skin feels soft and hydrated all day. I love ittt!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tend to stray from using moisturizers because they make my face feel heavy and oily. However I am thrilled with L'Oreal! A user for life! Even with the day lotion on top for added sun protection my face feels clean and pure. Amazing! Not only am I losing wrinkles and brown spots my face is soft and protected. What a win/win!

L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer is one of the best moisturizers that I have ever used. It makes your skin so soft with no residue.

"Of all three products, I love the way the L'Oreal Deep-acting Facial Moisturizer looks. It feels fabulous, too! (and a little goes a long way) However, I feel so classy when I remove the glossy, smooth metallic lid and hold the cool glass container in my hand. Lovely product!

This product feels so good on my skin and I can feel the smoothing and tightening of my skin after the first four days of use. My skin appearance has changed and is more luminous and radiant already. I am using also the moisturizer and say cream to optimize the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved the smell of the product and just the right amount to put on my face and neck. Feels so smooth and moisturizing on my skin. My skin feels real plump and rejuvenated.

"I was extremely happy with this product . I have very sensitive skin so there are few things I feel comfortable using. This had a very pleasant but not overwhelming smell.

After recieving as a sample I thought I would like L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Action Mosturizer as I am a fan of L'Oreal products. It smells great and does not feel stick when applying but towards the end on my day my skin became very oily and because I have already combination skin I didnt like how it felt. I don't recommend it for oily skin as it might cause skin to feel more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very dry skin to the point that its flaky and for the first time in my like my face is moisterized and it lasts all day. I use it in my morning and night routine and works wonders i really suggest it for peqple with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for the last 4 days. It smells pleasant and has a good consistency for a night cream. My skin seems to soak it up and is feeling softer. I hope in the coming weeks, by using it with the other Revitalift Triple action products that I can see good improvement in skin firmness, elasticity and wrinkle repair. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this lotion is great especially for the winter. it is a little thick so little bit goes a long way and you have to really rub it in. I think it's better it's for winter when skin us more dry. It does smell nice and makes my face soft and radiant. Goes nice after using the serum . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product smelled way too strong. 8 was very self conscious of the smell when my husband went to kiss me. I did however notice a difference in my dark spots on my face- I was having to use less foundation to cover dark spots after just a few days. The wrinkles on my face were still unchanged unfortunately. I'd like to see a bigger difference in my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this moisturizer. It has a nice, light scent and it isn't too harsh for my skin. Another good thing is that you don't have to use a lot of the product so it will last you a lot longer. I think it makes my face look smoother and it definitely feels smoother. I think this would be a great moisturizer for any skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer doesn't leave my face feeling or looking greasy. It isn't too thick or too thin, it's just right. It is really nice having sunscreen in the moisturizer so you don't have to layer on so many products. I think with regular use it will improve the look of wrinkles on my face.

"I love the L'Oreal Paris Moisturizer. It left my skin feeling soft . The nice thing was that it did not make my skin feel oily. I have pretty sensitive skin so I worry that my skin can become irritated from new products. This however, did not bother my skin at all. I can't wait to see if it tones my skin up. I recieved this product for free to leave my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been an Oil Of Olay user for years, 20 or more to be exact. Other products felt too oily or broke my face out. I can truly say I Love This Product! My boss has even noticed a difference around my eyes. I cant wait to try the other 2 products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What a great nighttime moisturizer. It is recommended to use the serum right before the moisturizer after cleansing. I have never felt a product so lightweight on my face before until now. I have tried other products and they made me feel like I had a mask on so I would take it off shortly after. I can finally use moisturizers every day and night without the heavy feeling, greasy feeling. I hope to see even more results in the next coming weeks.

"I really like the moisturizer. Does not feel like what the brand says of Triple Power because it feels very light on the skin and it smells very good. Very light and refreshing. Even though it says to put it on my face and neck, I just want to put more on just because of how light it feels on my skin and how refreshing. A perfect after product after the serum. Both smells very good and a delight on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way the product wet on, I tried it on the back of my hand first - checking for any kind of a reaction. The next day, I tried a small portion of my face - just to make sure. I am pleased with the way it felt, etc. So, today I used it on my whole face and it was fine, I LOVE it so far!! I'll keep using it and the rest of the products to see how well they work :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the first moisturizer that actually lasts all day! I love it! It goes on smooth and feels great on the skin. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy either, like most moisturizers I've used. Also, I've noticed a lot of moisturizers have an annoying fragrance, but the fragrance on this is very faint and quite pleasant! The lotion actually tingles a bit when you put it on, so you know it's working! You will not be disappointed with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Another product from L'Oreal that is going into my regular routine. My adult acne is staying away, which has always been a source of frustration with other moisturizers. It absorbs well and doesn't seep through my face makeup. I don't have to worry about running to the ladies room to dab the excess off! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Started using this product a few days ago. Love the way it makes my skin look and feel already. I have super sensitive skin so trying anything new is a little scary. I have had no problems at all. If my face feels and looks this good after a few days, I look forward to see results in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"So I've tried the moisturizer and it is not greasy which is a huge plus, makes your face soft and smooth. It has a subtle smell so you don't mind it going on your face, I payed extra attention to my forehead as thats the place with the most problems, Ive noticed throughout the time it has been on it has stayed moisturized and I will continue to use the product along with the others to see the end results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

So I tried the moisturizer and when I first used it I thought it leave a greasy or oily feeling. But after it was absorbed it didn't. It left my face soft and lasted all day. It has a nice scent and it doesn't make your face feel greasy if you sweat which is great. I will absolutely recommended this to others and will be using in the future. 4 stars.

"First, I want to say that this moisturizer does its job beautifully. My skin felt immediately hydrated and smooth. The smell is a bit stronger than the other products that I've tried in the Revitalift line. As someone who is highly sensitive to perfume, it did bother me some. I doubt I will use this in the future, although for people who are not bothered by perfume, I would absolutely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OK been using this for about a week now and I'm pleasantly surprised how it makes my skin hydrated and soft, I haven't noticed no smoothing of any wrinkles or my small crows feet in the corners of my eyes so I'm on the fence on that but if you have slightly dry mature skin this will definitely work wonders on that aspect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin feels GREAT. I've applied the cream to my fresh face and I can feel my skin being replenished. Normally my face feels dry and peels during the change of the season, but with this it's moist and supple. Thanks L'Oréal for making my skin soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the product smells nice. It also goes on very smooth. I thought my face would feel oily after application but it actually feels very soft and not oily.

I am 38 and super concerned about the appearance of my skin. I have fair skin with freckles and not everything works well on me.

"I really love the L'Oreal Revitalift deep-acting moisturizer. It has a nice creamy texture and isn't too greasy or oily. I find that it absorbs easily into the skin and has a pleasent scent that isn't too overpowering. It's too early to tell if it's helped my fine lines, but I can already tell it has helped my complexion appear brighter and helped the texture of my skin overall. It makes my skin feel so soft after use, I love it! I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am honest in my Bzz reviews, and I'm going to be totally honest here: This is wonderful cream! It's smooth and non-greasy. I put it on before bed and I wake up with softer skin. I have very dry skin and many lotions and creams don't penetrate my skin or they feel greasy or heavy. This cream is light but powerful. I buy expensive face creams and this less expensive, easier-to-find cream is actually better than the expensive ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am just starting to try the loreal triple power products so I can only review the fragrance which is light and the immediate way it makes my skin feel. My skin felt very cool and dewy right after using. When I woke up in the morning it still felt very soft. I am really curious if my skin tone will improve or wrinkles will lessen over time. I will write again after a week and also three weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It's fairly thick, which is fine for night time, but it's a little too thick for daytime use, so I've been using the smallest dab for daytime. My skin is somewhat dry, but not overly so, and this product may be best for skin that is super dry. I like that it doesn't feel at all greasy, and it absorbs into the skin quickly. The smell isn't too strong, but I'd prefer that there be no perfumes at all in my moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is wonderful. From the very first time you use it your skin feels so fresh and silky-smooth. You use it morning and night and you will feel refreshed. Your skin will look smoother. I just love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product a few times, and it is very moisturizing, which is perfect for my combination skin. I have a tendency to get flaky on and around my nose, and this has completely cleared that up. It is a slightly heavy moisturizer, but does not feel greasy. I would highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Leave skin feeling nice soft and smooth and moisturized. Would be better if it didn't leave me looking so shiny especially in my tzone were I am already oily. Also if the scent weren't so storng, doesn't really bother me but for those who are sensitive to scented product this is not for them [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the serum I applied the moisturizer. So far I love everything about it from the texture to the smell. It applied very easly and is non greasy. I used a qtip to get it out of the jar; the one thing Im not a fan of is opened jars because I feel like it can easily grow bacteria,especially when people stick their fingers in it. I also took a before picture and cant wait to see what my skin looks like after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this set is AMAZING. I tried the deep moisturizer first and my face feels like a baby's bottom. I have very oily and sensitive skin so its rare for me to find anything that doesn't burn or end up oily. First impressions are important and this one rocks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was thinking about purchasing a new anti aging product right before this campaign became available. I used this deep moisturizer applying the serum. I feared the combination of products would feel too heavy and greasy on my skin. But I was wrong, it has left my face feeling smooth and refreshed. I would recommend this product. Giving 4 stars so far, as I have not used it long enough to determine it's before and after results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Over the last few years, with the birth of my two children, my face has gone through many changes: combo to dry to oily to dry and back to oily. Oil free moisturizer left my skin dry and face creams made me feel like my makeup was going to slide off. The L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Day/Night is light without feeling too greasy. It absorbs well too. SO glad I had the opportunity to try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love a good, hearty moisturizer. And while this fits the bill, it manages to still feel light on my face. I put it on at night before bed and my face was still smooth as a baby's bottom 8 hours later when I woke up. The scent is great as well. This is only day 2 of use, so I'm excited to see what the next few weeks have in store for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I just turned 31 this year and have definitely notice the change in my skin. From fine lines to dryness this product helps them all. I love the scent and the texture of the cream. I would recommend this for anyone looking to restore their fresh face back to the day when kids, laundry and dishes ruled your life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal's Paris RevitaLift is the perfect moisturizer. I think this facial moisturizer is so creamy and soothing to my skin. I love it. It really hydrated my dry, parched skin and made it glow. Thank you. Abby [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First day of my trial and...WOW! I could feel a tingle instantly while applying to my face. It is lightweight, non-greasy and has an awesome fragrance. Not only that, but, immediately afterwards your skin feels amazingly softer and more supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how easy to use and how light it felt on my skin. The words deep-acting on my combination skin made me worried but there was no reason to worry at all. I use it at night so it has overnight to work its magic and I'm always very impressed how soft my skins feels when I wake up. Don't be afraid try this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff was awesome. I could not believe how smooth and silky it felt on my skin. I thought it would be greedy but it surprised me. It was not hard to apply or to clean off. Awesome. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this works great ! The weather has changed and my skin gets so dry n cracks when I wear my foundation, so I always need a thick moisturizer. The first time I used this it immediately turned my skin soft not greasy. Next day I used it under my makeup. My face looked good. So this was a great product my faces is also a little tighter. Loved this ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this as an evening moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way! If you use too much, you do get a little bit of oily residue. The smell is great, not too strong. Leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product far surpasses its claims! I could see results literally within days! L'Oreal definitely hit it out of the ballpark with this anti-aging line! I love it and will definitely recommend it to everybody!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think I really love this product! This product is the type of product where a little goes a long way. The product I thought smelled really good and fresh. I haven't tried a lot of different moisturizer and was hesitant because I struggle with oily skin and acne however after using this product for 4 days my skin is not oily but smooth and soft!. I'm definitely going to continue using this and am happy to say it will be awhile before I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't use a lot of different facial products as their strong perfumy odour bothers me. This skin care regimen has a soft subtle scent that enhances it's use. There was excellent hydration noticable after using just 3 days. I not only used it on my face, but on my forearms so I could actually see the improvement without looking in a mirror. It reduced the crepiness and made my skin taught and younger looking. I will be buying this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the revitalift products and they are very good!! They left my face looking much smoother and clearer. It left my face feeling fresh and clean. I really like that it helped smooth away some of my wrinkles too. I highly recommend these products to anyone that wants their face to be left feeling fresh and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is amazing! I'm only 32 yrs young, I ain't got much wrinkles but the little I do have this deep moisture keeps them from coming back and keeps my face soft, rejuvenated and looking new. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of this. However, as the day's gone on I've noticed if I rub my cheek (no makeup Sunday) it's rolling off. I use it over the serum, and let that set for several minutes. I'll give it a try for a few days, maybe use much much less. If not, I guess it'll just be the serum for me"
"I have to update my previous review, after using the Shishedo Super Revitalizing cream for only 4 days I am back to this Loreal cream, sometimes you don't realize how well something is working until you stop using it for a few days, I have even purchased the Loreal LZR serum to match, sorry I stopped using this, I have returned yet another $100 jar of ""luxurious"" cream for my favorite best ever Loreal LZR, thanks Loreal."
"To my diasppointment i had to stop using this product after 3 days.I have mature skin and it seems the skin on my face lost all moisture.From October thu may my forehead,nose,and chin are extremely dry and senitive, so when i did use this although if felt great the first 2 days i started to noticed the dry parts were getting worse.By the third day my skin was so itchy and red i couldn't wash nor touch my face. I do plan on trying this again once the whether gets warmer."
"I love this moisturizer, it's rich and a little dab goes a long way. On my first week it helped with my acne ( as long as I washed my face twice a day and applied the moisturizer) but eventually my skin started to get too oily, so I used it only at night still getting great results. I'm 28, so wrinkles are not much of a problem to me right now but I did see a big improvment on my skin. I would def. recommend this moisturizer but if you have oily skin or combination like mine, go easy with it."
"at first, i wondered if this was jus going to be another ""moisturizer"". i was surprised! i followed directions. went on smooth, not greasy. really seems to enhance my skin more than any other product i've tried. i have cancer (so prob can;t afford to buy more ;( )"
"I received a jar of ReviaLift Triple Power, Deep-Acting Moisturizer, 1st I was so surprised when I got it, 2nd I love it. My skin is always very dry nothing I have tried no matter how expensive seems to give me the hydration my face needs. Years of trying this and that and I have found my dream moisturizer, day and night. I saw a huge difference in my skin after just 4 days, and it keeps getting better, more radiant, suple, and moist. If you havent tried it buy it, you wont regret it."
"I received this moisturizer at the perfect time. I was on the hunt for a new product. I couldn't be happier with ifinding it in my mailbox. It is thick to the touch, glides on beautifully and most noticebaly my skin feels so much softer as well as looking smoother and younger. It has a nice light scent and I've found that a little bit really does go a long way."
"I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer twice a day for a few weeks now, and I highly recommend it! It's very thick and rich. It has a light, pleasant scent and is easy to apply. the cream absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it feeling silky smooth! The best part...? It erases fine lines as if they were never there!"
I am always weary of anti-aging moisurizers. This one is exceptional! I saw smoother more hydrated skin in the first 2 days. I also didn't have any kind of breakout as a result. That is usually why I don't use a moisturizer. Also it has a great price retail!!
"Received 5 one-use samples and I prefer using skincare for a minimum of 10 days (preferably 14) before reviewing. I don't really have wrinkles, so I can't attest to those results but for firming/redensifying, it works well. Moisturizer feels too dry which I find in many firming/redensifying products. Needed to use an oil (argan) underneath to keep my skin hydrated. Also, as with most L'Oreal/Lancome products, the fragrance is too perfumey for my tastes."
"As soon as I applied it to my face, I noticed how creamy it was and sliky. What really made me know that it was working, was the fact when i washed my face the next morning, I felt my face feeling different when I applied my face soap it felt like I just moisturized it, I swear my skin felt so moist. I LOVE IT."
"I received Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. I was skeptical, but after using this twice daily, I can definately tell a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, forehead, and around my lips. In my mid-fifties, I have been looking for something to make my wrinkles less noticeable, and this product has sure done the trick."
"In the winter, My skin on my face is so dry and cracked. Using make up everyday only makes the situation worse. My face is so tight and itchy during the winter, It's just down right uncomfortable. Since I recieved the RevitaLift, my skin is less irratated. It feels normal and doesn't look dry at all. In fact I went skiing today with my face exposed all day and it felt smooth and fresh, not dry"
"I have been using it for two weeks. I really like how my skin feels. I also notice that it seems to be minimizing my wrinkles somewhat. The fragrance is nice, and not overpowering like some other brands. It's not greasy and soaks in nicely. Now that I have tried it for free, I plan on purchasing it when I run out of it. Thank you for the opportunity to try it! I am very pleased with your product! I highly recommend it!"
"I wasas shocked to receive a huge beautiful jar of revitalift in the mail shortly after new years day 1/2/13. I was out of all my products. I love anything L'oreal makes and also, only use their paris hair dye. This product is thick enough you only need a lil each use, I am 47, 48 in april :( , lol and have no wrinlke's. It's a mystery who sent me this huge beautiful jar, but thank you for awesome products of every kind."
"Although I do like the consistancy of the cream and the way it goes on....it has done nothing in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on MY face. I don't know that there is ANYTHING ""out"" there that can help me... as far as a Product is concerned. I DO like the moisturizing quality of the cream and will most likely continue using it as the skin on my face has become extremely dry with age and menopause!!"
I use this product morning and nite. You only need a small amount and it makes you feel like you have done something very important for your skin. I have been using just over a month and I do see a visible differnce in my skin's texture and appearance.
"I have been using for about 3 weeks. My face is healthier and less dry, and wrinkles are definitely fading. I use it at night after cleaning and when I wake up, my face feels wonderful. Especially during the cold months, when my skin is especially dry. My makeup goes on so smoothly now, and I am now having acne breakouts either. This moisturizer is working great with my skin! I love it!!!"
"You can feel the difference after first application. My skin feels silky soft and hydrated. I use it in the morning before putting my make-up on and the effect can last the whole day. You only need a thin coat otherwise it will tend to clump when combined with foundation or other products. I still love it though and plan of using it as part of my daily skincare routine for a long period of time. I also use it at night as part of my skincare routine. So far, one of the best moisturizers."
"WOW!!! Really pleased with the NEW L'OREAL PARIS Triple Action, Triple Results, Triple Power deep-acting moisturizer. The lines around my mouth have smoothed out and the skin is more supple. The scent is lovely! Thank you for this fabulous product and will continue to purchase this in the future.."
"I was drawn to this product because it promised triple power. Instead of using 3 products this would do it all. I used it everyday for the past 2 weeks and while I don't see any dramatic results, I do think it feels and smells good. It is moisturizing and that alone is beneficial. I will continue to use it and hopefully will see more improvement in my skin."
"I have been using the new Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer for about 10 days. I have very sensitive skin and alot of products will cause my skin to tingle and become very red, this product however has not done any of that. I feel that I am already seeing some great results, especially in the elasticity of my skin, escpecially around the jaw line and chin area..I hope to see continued results from this product."
"I really loved the smell of it, the consistency, the feel on my face when I went to put it on, but the one thing I could not understand was why it wouldn't soak into my skin! =/ When I would go to put makeup over it, my foundation would slip off, and wouldn't rub onto my face... I usually LOVE all of Loreal's products, so I am not giving up on this one... maybe I put too heavy of a layer of cream on my face...? I will give it another shot using less cream!"
"I really didn't expect much, but I was really very pleasantly surprised. I used some on my eyelids, and they tightened up and ""lifted"" making me look younger. Thanks. Can't afford plastic surgery, and I'm so glad to find this works for me. No irritation of the skin either."
"After using this product, I've noticed a firmer, smoother, more youthful appearance. My face has more volume, and feels ""bouncy"" to the touch. My slight nasal labial folds are completely smoothed out, and unnoticeable. My face is back to how it looked when I was in high school, boyish, moisturized, firm, voluminous, and line free! I LOVE this product, and would DEFINITELY be using it again!"
"I like the smell of the moisturizer in the jar, on my skin is another story! I've been using for over 2 weeks now and don't notice any difference in texture, firmness or fine lines. I do, however, notice that when I use this, my face and neck smell like eggs :( I'm not sure if it's some sort of chemical reaction or what, but nothing else I use does this to me. Not sure if I will continue to use it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and leaves my skin stinking!!"
"I tried ReviatLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and I was thrilled with the results. It seemed to decrease my laugh lines. I loved the scent, and how easily it was absorbed by my skin. It didn't feel greasy or leave my skin oily. It's an excellent product! Although it is an excellent product, I can't afford to purchase it. It's very expensive for my budget."
"I recieved a sample 3 weeks ago. This is the best cream I have used so far. It made my skin look so smooth and felt smooth too. The frown lines I have have diminished so much. Along with the laugh lines I hated so much, they looked like the grand canyon. But now they are so much fuller and smoother. thank you loreal. I will definetly continue to use. I reccommend this to anyone that has fine lines or noticable lines, it really works."
I used the Triple Power Serum and Moisturizer together with great results. They both absorb into the skin and are not greasy at all. I saw immediate moisture restoral and over a month's time actually saw more firmness and softening of the wrinkles around my eyes. Love these products.
I just love this product it not only makes my face and neck soft younger looking but one day I had a little more product on my fingers than I needed and didnt want to waste it so I rubbed it onto the top of my hands and wow my hands look fantastic and feeel soft
I really liked the thick texture of Revitalift. It was a very good moisturizer. During the winter I often get dry patches on my skin and this product really helped with that. I got to try a one week sample so I cannot say if the anti aging aspect of this product is true or not. I did notice a positive change in the texture of my skin and I will definitely use this product again.
"I was fortunate to be able to try a sample of the product and with how frugal I am, I have to say that I will actually be looking for and buying this product. I am in my mid-40's and I live in Texas. The weather is insane and I am very fair skinned with sensitive combination skin...so I always need a moisturizer and one that won't make me break out or look like an oil spill. I was pleasantly surprised that it absorbed well, no horrid scent, and my face looked refreshed-not greasy. Happy me!"
"After using this product the first day I felt a very positive change! My face has been smoother and soft to touch. More imporvements were made with every day of use. I have had no braeak outs, redness, or dryness!! I would highly recommend this product!"
I have been looking for a great mositurizer that wasn't heavy or oily and would leave my skin feeling soft and looking radiant. I'm very impressed by the quality of this product and the results have been amazing! My skin is feeling/looking noticeable smoother and supple.
"I tried this product for the first time, and have been using it daily. I believe I have seen a visible difference in my skin - the thin areas seem plumper, and my face actually looks better hydrated. I intend to purchase it, switching from my present moisturizer."
"I think this is a great moisturizer. It went on smoothly and evenly. Made my face feel immediately soft and smooth and not a bit greasy. My face did not seem to get that shine throughout the day which is a good thing. I can see the benefits with continued use of this product. I imagine that wrinkles would diminish, my crows feet would become tiny lines. The skin was actually softer with this limited use, I believe it would become eventoned and healthier."
I really wanted to start using anti aging products and when I received the sample in the mail I was very impressed. As soon as I applied the product on I started noticing a difference around my jaw and neck area. The area seemed firmer and smoother. I have been using this product daily and I am very happy with it. I use it right after I wash my face and also apply it on my neck area. The packaging is very pretty and I love the color!! It is a great product and I definitely recommend it!
Used this around my eyes and whole face. It helped reduce wrinkles and bags under eyes. Also firmed my face. I like that you dont have to use a lot and the texture is smooth and not greasey. It makes you skin feel smooth and healthy. Got 5 smples in the mail. Love that they give you you enough to see how it really works. Will buy this for sure.
"I live in the West it is extremely Dry, along with the climate the dryness from the furnace to heat our home, I have very dry skin. I had to let others in my age group know that Loreal RevitalLift Moisturizer is AMAZING! I have noticed that my skin is so much more nourished. The flakiness is sloughed off and my skin is smooth and nourished. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
"To be honest, I thought this was just going to be a sample I put in the emergency ""outta moisterizer"" drawer, however, I used it right away on a whim and I LOVED it! It seemed to effortlessy glide right into my skin and, after using it twice a day, I was amazed at how much better my skin looked and felt. My makeup stayed fresher and the few wrinkles I have tightened up. No dry patchs in December!! Only con....it has a very strong fragrance."
"I will be 65 in a few days..and I received the best gift from Revitalift! I have bought very expensive creams with just minor results. I received the 5 day test and what a change! It's hard to correct 65 years of damage, but This did just great. I'm out today to buy my supply."
"Now that I'm in my mid 40s I'm always looking for products that make my skin look younger. RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer glided on my skin. After using it every night for a week, I'm waking up to a lovely dewy soft complexion. I love it."
I was really impressed with the results I got from RevitaLift. I started using it the first day and was amazed at the really thick and creamy texture. It melted right into my skin. My face felt great right away and throughout the rest of the day. I was looking forward to putting it on the second day and was not disappointed. My skin looks much more even toned and tight after the 14 days. I'm hooked for life!!
I tried this moisturizer and was pleased. It did moisturize my skin well. I live in a cold northern climate and am affected greatly during the long winters. I have been using this after my morning shower and it maintains wonderfully throughout the day. I can't say that I have noticed any change in firmness.
"I have tried this for a week now and all I can saw is wow! I have extremely dry skin that is very sensitive as well. Not only do I wake up with soft, moisturized skin that feels supple, I love the fact that I have had absolutely no sensitivy problems. Such a relief to know that I can put this on, and let it do it's thing while I sleep! Life having little elves on my face! And a little goes a long way. PS: my husband has used it 3 times during this time at night, seasonal dry skin."
"I am really enjoying this moisturizer. I have fairly dry skin, especially during the winter months. This blended right into my skin nicely. It feels to me like a thicker consistancy. Some moiturizers are so light or thin that it feels like you need to re-apply it more than once to do the job."
"Fast, effective, leaves skin feeling satiny smooth. Applied makeup over this moisturizer and noticed how much easier it was to blend. RevitaLift works better than the higher priced department store moisturizer I've used for over 15 years. I've changed brands...never thoght it would happen. Thank you for the opportunity to test this product."
"I live in a very dry climate, and my skin feels dry much of the time. Just after using RevitaLife Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer for the first couple of days, I could feel a huge difference in my facial skin. It felt revitalized and refreshed. Great product!"
Since I've received these as a sample- they have done wonders for my skin. I've even given it to my Mom and she loves it. The power of this moisturizer is that it's deep acting. Your skin feels good and it makes a difference in the other moisturizers that you use on a daily basis. I moisturize in the morning and at night for the best results.
"THis prodauct is wonderful for the price! I don't believe you could ever find a product that works as well as this for this price! I love the way it made my skin feel, so soft and smooth. If you try this peoduct I believe you will love it as much as I do!"
"I started with a sample, I knew then how this product is amazing!!! Immediately could see the difference in the hydration of my skin. My skin feels so smooth avery day. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to maintain or improve their youthful appearance. Best product e ever had!!!!"
"I have mature skin and the Loreal Revita lift Triple Power moisturizer is a nice moisturizer, it's not too heavy, smells great and feels good on my skin. I use it in morning under my makeup. There is no sunscreen in this product; just remember to add some type of SPF to the skin to prevent sun damage. I also use a little at night just after using the Revita lift serum. After using over a period of time I could see a slight change in the texture of my skin."
"I am a moisturizing fanatic and have used many different mositurizers in the past. Loreal sent me five days worth of their RevitaLift Triple Power samples. First off, it was thick which I loved. It went on smoothly and gave off a slight cooling sensation. Throughout the morning I could smell the fresh clean scent of the moisturizer. It was not overpowering but just strong enough that I would get a pleasant whiff of it every now and then. Even after a few days, I felt my skin was tighter."
"After the first day of a 5 step sample of Rivatalift Triple Powder Moisturizer, I purchased the full-size. That is a FIRST for me. I adore this product, it genuinely worked over night on my under eye bags and my skin felt so firm! This is a must-have for me and I will be repurchasing time and time again."
"I rarely take the time to write a review, but I feel so satisfied with this product I just had to write to say Thank you! I was so pleased to have received enough samples of this product to give me a chance to really see if I like it or not. After several days I knew it was the moisturizer I've been looking for. I have purchased my first jar. At 61 yrs old and I can look in the mirror and smile."
I so enjoyed using Revitalift Triple Power Moisturizer. It was so silky smooth to the touch. I liked how it made my skin so soft but not oily feeling. My skin stayed soft all day!!! I will be buying this in the future. You don't have to use alot of the moisturizer either so this makes it worth the extra money to get.
"I have been having problems with dry patches on my face. I have been trying everything. The RevitaLift Triple Power not only took care of these dry patches but gives my face a smooth, firmer looking skin. I loved this moisturizer so well I went out and purchased the eye and serum as well. I am hoping the results will be amazing."
"I have been using this product for about a week and a half and have already noticed a difference. Other products have burned or irritated my skin, but this one does not. When I wake my skin still feels soft and smooth, my pores seem smaller and my makeup goes on smoother. The only complaint would be the scent, it smells good, but a little too strong for the face area."
I absolutely loved this product and plan to keep using it. I love the way that it glides on and is absorbed without the heavy feel or alcohol burn of some moisturizers. The texture of my face feels like velvet and my skin feels nourished instead of dry and tight. Thank you for 5 days of this product so that I could get a comprehensive understanding of the difference between the good stuff and what I had been using.
"I'm 43 and slowly losing elasticity in my skin and my face looks tired. I used the moisturizer for 7 days to see if this one was any different than any of the others I've tried. I saw results within 3 days. The moisturizer itself is great; and the firmness of my skin had shown visable signs of improvement. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to anyone my age who is tired of all the ""next best"" products."
"The results of Revitalift Triple Power were noticable very quickly after I began using it. Using in the morning and evening my skin was much softer and refined.Revitalift also has a very plesant scent that is not over powering, I will continue using for my moisturizing needs."
"I was using another well known brand of moisurizer,but I will be switching! I love the way Revitalift makes my skin feel and look,with such little effort. I use it all over my face,even on and around the eyes.My former routine was 3 different products just for moisturizing. Revitalift is now my day and night moisturizer.In just a few days I saw wrinkles diminishing,my skin grew firmer and softer. It is not heavy,and soaks into my skin,leaving a younger,fresher,smoother feel. Nice scent"
I was hoping for a tightening in the jaw line but did not see that but I only used this product for 5 days. I did see a difference in the moisure in my face and the softness. I feel the 5 days may not be enough time to judge fairly as far as wrinkle improvement.
I had the opportunity to try the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and just want to say this is a wonderful product. I loved it and I especially loved the results. I'm 43 and starting to worry about wrinkles and fine-lines. There was a noticeable difference... I should say improvement... after using this product. I'm sold.
I recieved a sample of revitalift which i was happy to try. I loved the somewhat thicker texture of the cream. It was not greasy at all and absorbed quickly which i love! Smell was nice but not too overpowering and didn't linger for long. I love to have a light non greasy and clean feeling after using a face cream and this did it! Now time will tell on the softening of wrinkles and tightning of the skin but im willing to try.
"Well,it is winter here in Maine and I deffinately needed a better moisturizer! I got my 5 day sample at just the right tiime!I have to use a really good moisturizer in the winter and this worked EXTREMELY well!!I loved the way it made my face and neck feel soooo good ALL through the day and didn't make it feel like an oil slick!!!It even made my makeup look alot more natural!!"
"I used my 5 day free trial cream and loved it. Now I have 2 jars of cream. I don't want to be without it, it works great. I can already see the difference in my skin. Wrinkles have lessened and my skin seems tighter. You should try this at least once to form your own opinion. You won't be disappointed."
A few weeks ago I received a sample of RevitaLift. I've used it every day since then and there is a noticable improvement in my complextion. My skin is tighter and smoother. Now I know not all moisturizers are the same and I will only buy RevitaLift in the future.
"I really like the RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and will be purchasing it. It seems to be making my aging skin a little firmer and I love the scent! And it feels good on my sensitive skin. A little goes a long way, too. Thank you for making such a wonderful product."
"I received samples and tried them for the last week. Living in upstate New York in the winter moisturizer is a necessary staple. Loreal is not heavy, stickey or gummy like most. I can put this on in the morning and have soft, delicate skin all day. I have found my forever moisturizer . I should have known another Loreal product I have fallen in love with."
"I'm in my early 30's but I would recommend this moisturizer to ANYONE of any age group who wants a top notch product. I use this daily in the morning after a normal cleansing routine. It goes on light and smooth with a pleasant scent. I have somewhat sensitive skin and can break out easily but I've yet to do so with this moisturizer. I also tend to suffer from redness/ruddiness during the dry, colder months and haven't since using this product. My skin has never felt softer."
"I received at five day sample of RevitaLift Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer (which I stretched into 10 days)! I've been searching for a good drugstore product for my skin that would help with moisturizing and some deep lines that are starting to form between my eyebrows. I'm 40, but have been put into early menopause because of breast cancer treatments. This product was amazing! After only 10 days, the lines between my eyebrows were significantly diminished!"
"I received samples of this in the mail and have been using it for about two weeks and love it! I have always taken really good care of my skin and tried alot of different products. I use this at night with one of the L'Oreal Eye treatments. It's not too heavy, not greasy.....just right!! I would highly recommend trying it!"
I received a 5 day trial! I love the way my skin felt and looked. I have to get some for myself. I appreciate the 5 days to try it out. Most products give you one application....................you can't make a decision with one application of anything!
I requested a 5 day sample of Triple Power and was so impressed that I went right out and purchased a jar. It absorbs into my skin so nicely and does seem to lift. I saved one of the day smaples for my mom to try. I think she will really like to too.
"OMG. This product is amazing. It went on so smooth. It wasn't too thick or runny. As soon as I put it on, it worked. It lasted the whole day. It didn't leave my face greasy or sticky. My makeup went right on top of it. Moisturizer lasted all day, right up til I took my makeup off, then I reapplied it before bed. It lasted the whole night. Finally,something that works. It is definitely a little pricey for just a moisturizer but it is well worth it."
"I hardly ever take time to write reviews but since this product worked so well, here I am. I'm in my early 40's and starting to notice a loss of elasticity in my neck area. Before using this cream I could pinch my neck skin and instead of popping back into place like it used to, it would stay like that for a few seconds. Within 2 days of using this cream am"
"I'm a side sleeper and I had a deep groove on my right cheek. Nothing has helped it. I'm 54 and really looking for products that work. In less than 2 days, I was looking in the mirror and there was not a sign of this deep groove that was 3 inches long in a weird spot on my right cheek. i wish I would have taken before and after pictures. I'm buying all 3 products in this line. ladies, IT WORKS!!!"

I really like this product. The only thing I don't like about it is the scent. I find it too strong. I personally like scent free skin care. Other then that I love how it feels on my skin
"Smells very nice.very thick and creamy,I liked it alot,Only down side it stung alittle bit first couplr times I used it,But it definatly kept me moistuized all day"
"It really helps to keep you moisturized plus it does a good job at helping those fine lines that start forming great product, will definately buy this!"
Recently received samples of this product. I really don't see much of a difference so far. It does make my skin feel soft. This product does go a long way with a tiny amount.
"I received a sample of this moisturizer and I have to say I love the way it felt on my skin. This moisturizer is light, non greasy and a little goes a long ways. My skin felt smooth, moisturized and looked healthy. I used it at night and day."
"I loved this product. After the first use I could feel the the affect it had on my skin. Out of all the products I have used, I would say this is the best."
"i like everything about this moisturizer...the feel, the smell, the texture, but I would like at least a 15 spf included so that I could wear it outdoors! It's perfect for cool days and nights indoors."
"When I appled the RevitaLift Triple Power sample I received in the mail I was impressed on how well it blended into my skin. It was like it was never there, no heavy, filmy feel afterwards. Left my skin feeling refreshed!"
"5 Days just wasn't long enough to give a through review, I did find that the product seemed to work great , smelled nice , no greasy mess left on my face, hopefully my small lines and wrinkles will fade away with continued use."
The new Tripel Power Lift is great for the neck and throat. Was using the Double lift before and really like the results of the Triple Lift. I can feel it working as soon as I put it on.
I really like the way RevitaLift made my skin look and feel. I seen results in the first two days and I like the results a lot. I have told my friends all about it. Thanks
Nice scent! Makes skin feel smooth. I have very sensitive skin and it was not irritating. A little goes a long way. Moisturizer is very light...never know it's been applied.
I am very impressed with this product. My facial skin has never seen felt better. RevitaLift feels like a silky coating when applied. I would definitely recommend it!
"I am loving the Loreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer. It keeps my face feeling, well moisturized during the day and I beleive it has made my skin to look ""younger"" looking also. I am in love with this."
"I have used MANY products that claim to make wrinkles look dimished, to make skin look brighter but NEVER do any of that. This product DOES! I call it my Fountain of youth in a bottle."
I have dry skin on my face and it is especially noticeable in the winter months. I have used the moisturizer twice so far and was very pleased with the way my face looked. It not only made my face feel smooth
I liked this moisturizer. I thought it absorbed quickly and didn't leave a film on my skin. It also smelled nice and I would recommend it to other women.
This Moisturizer is so awesome. My skin felt so soft and moisturized like never before and felt soft for a longer period. With regular application even the fine lines disappear.
"Even though I only tried a sample of it, I noticed a difference. I used it at night right before I went to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my face still felt really soft and smooth and I didn't have any new breakouts."
"I love how my skin drinks this in. I wish it was fragrance free, however. I would have given it 5 stars if it had less of a scent. I would buy it again."
"I loved the immediate feeling of moisturized, soft skin. I haven't used it for very long..just a week or so, but I plan on purchasing this and see if I can get some of the fine wrinkles/lines back to the past!"
"I found the RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer absolutely fantastic! I am 58 and am often told I look 46! I could see a noticeable difference after just 2 usages. I will be a loyal user. Love, love, LOVE this product!"
I have always used Loreal eye and face creams. The triple power moisturizer seemed more potent and I know my skin was softer. It is a good value and coupons make it an affordable daily necessity.
I love this product because it leaves your skin very smooth and moisturised. You can really feel the hydration is going deep in you skin. It really works. Thank you.
"While I didn't completely hate this moisturizer, I did find it to be a bit too heavy. I felt like my skin couldn't breath freely. I definitely prefer a higher end (department store) moisturizer over this brand."
"It doesn't seem like giving a product only 5 days to prove itself would be enough, but within 3 days I knew this was a product that would become a part of my daily facial routine."
"Product is smooth and creamy. Goes on easily and soaks in properly. Provides moisturizer relief deep into the skin. Has a wonderful fragrance, not overpowering. Highly recommend."
This product is amazing! You will see results in 2 days. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy. My husband complemented me on how my face looks more youthful and bright. The fine lines around my eyes are less visibile. It does what it says it will.
I have been using Revitalift products for about 10 months now and I really like it. This RevitaLift Triple Power is very nice. Feels good and adds more moisture than the non triple power. Would definitely recommend to anyone
This moisturizer is great. The first night I wore it I woke up in the morning and my face looked so good my skin looked diffrent. I was glowing. I put it on my face and neck each and every night and it has made a difference.
"I tried RevitaLift Triple Power Moisturizer for 5 days, and it really helped to make my skin look and feel more youthful. I am definitely planning to buy. Thank you for the sample."
"I had the opportunity to try this moisturizer; and although I didn't get the great results that others received, I like the texture and moisturization of this product. I guess maybe I need Quadruple Power Lift. Scent is nice and fresh."
"I'm 56 and have worked in the cosmetic business and have used some of the most expensive products out there. I was really surprised to actually SEE a difference within 2 days. Like the other review here, I sleep on my side"
"I am 29 and have deep lines in my forehead. I have only used this product for about 2 weeks, and I recieved several samples to try from Loreal, an I can notice a difference. I am very excited to still continue to use it!!"
"This product is great ! It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated. It does not feel heavy or greasy . Also, my makeup goes on smoothly. Thank you Loreal."
This product worked great! I have extremely dry skin and this product made all the flakes and fine lines disappear. I have been looking for a good moistureizer and with Rivitalift I found one that makes my skin appear soft and younger.
"This product was easy to apply, felt wonderful, and I believe I could actual see a difference in the look of fine wrinkles after use of this product for one week. This product was gentle to my skin, and felt very expensive."
"I just love the way this product makes my skin feel.It has a great scent too not over powering.I love the creamy feel of the lotion.I use it every night before I go to bed,and when I get up.It's a great product!"
"So far so good. I've been using this for a few days now and it seems to be a keeper. Not sure that it is getting rid of lines, but my skin seems a little smoother."
"I love Loreal products and use them all the time. This cream had a different smell to it, but went away quickly. I really liked the feel of it after applying it to my face and neck."
"I just want to say that this is a great moisturizer i just loved it ,I defenitely will be recommending to friends and family I saw great improved in the texture of my skin and firmness"
This felt so good on my face. I love the way it made my skin feel so soft. It was smooth and easy to apply. I loved it! I went right out and bought myself a bottle
I have always loved Loreal products and this one is no different. This is probably the best moisurizer that I have ever used. I will definitely be buying this again.
I tried the samples and love the way it made my skin feel. I am also noticing a change in my skin. I love this product and look forward to coupons in the future.
"Have just finished trying a sample of this product and I am pleased with it. It seems to hydrate nicely and I intend to buy a full size and see how using it long term affects my skin, at which point I may increase the number of stars I award to it."
"Being a Redhead with fair skin, it has a tendency to dry out. I've tried other products, even Oil of Olay, it made my skin drier. Not L'Oreal's RevitaLift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer, it made my dry skin dewy and soft!"
"I was fortunate enough to obtain a weeks worth of samples of the RevitaLift. My skin absorbed it easily, and my skin, after a week was noticeably softer and more even toned."
"I have used other moisturizers in the past. But, I just love this moisturizer within weeks of using this product. My wrinkles had softened and I could notice visible firmness to my face. I will be purchasing this product from this day forward."
"I received this as a sample and I must say I love getting samples. However, this is no better than any other high end moisturizer I have tried. I didn't see any lifting qualities."
"This product really works , from the first time that you apply you can see and feel the results of your skin . I will swtich my current product for the Revitalift Triple Power works very well for my aging skin @ 49 years old ."
Thank you for the samples. I loved it. It is one of the best Moisturizers I have tried. It made my skin feel so smooth. I am 69 years old so naturally I have wrinkles but I feel the moisturizer will revitalize my skin. Thank you again.
I was looking for a penetrating moisturiser and L'Oreal came up with this deep-acting moisturiser..I liked the way it made my skin feel and the light scent. I like the results I acheived also.
So I may not be the target age for this product (I'm 24) but I love it! My skin feels so soft and moisturized. It also didn't break out my acne prone skin.
This cream is rich and thick and a great moisterizer to help fix and prevent wrinkles. I have kind of fair dry skin and this really helps to keep it hydrated all day.
"I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I live in AZ so I really need a good product for dry skin. This left my skin silky, smooth but was not heavy on my skin."
What is not to like in this product. I saw results as soon as I used it! It really moisturizes my skin without leaving any residue. I will absolutely continue to use it.
"So glad I had the chance to try this product. I'm starting to get some fine lines under the corners of my mouth...probably from smiling so much LOL. Anyway, this product seems to help and minimizes the lines."
"I am 37 and have tried so many moisurizers,and yet my face still felt dry. I started using Revitalift Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer and was amazed and won't use anything else now."
"This is the most wonderful product ever! After using, I can notice the difference in my skin. My skin is flawless and supple. Loreal has the most awesome products!!"
I purchased the RevivaLivt Triple Power a week ago. I can already see softening of wrinkles and more firmness around my jaw line. I will use it to the bottom of the jaw. I love the way it feels on my skin.
I received this a a 14 day challenge. Although I'm only on day 4 I can already see a big improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. It really looks smooth and it glows. The product is worth trying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I actually received a free 2 week sample of this product. I could tell a huge difference in my skin in the very first use. Definitely going to buy this from now on...(I'm actually switching from my usual brand, Clinique!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the sample in the mail and I was very excited. The minute I put it on my face, immediately I felt the difference. My skin is very smooth and soft. No greasy smell and it has good texture. I will definitely continue ti use this product. Thank you Loreal for the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm participating in the 14 day challenge and just wanted to let you know that this is fabulous. I have been using a pretty expensive French brand of skincare and this moisturizer has lifted, firmed and smoother in just a few days. Bravo thanks for a great product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Received sample packets for 14 days and gave it a try. This goes on smoothly and lasts all day. The only downfall is it tends to be a bit sticky-feeling, but that's not enough of a reason to not try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for almost two weeks. I have liked how my skin feels everywhere on my face except around my eyes. My eyes still feel dry several minutes after applying. I have gone back to my usual product for my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Immediately started the 14 day regime of applying morning and night. While I have been told I have a great skin/complexion, I noticed that my skin became softer as each day passed and no additional wrinkles appeared on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer was great for skin texture and getting rid of any dry patches. But that was about it. Didn't really notice any change in firmness or wrinkles Also, when used in the morning, my foundation didn't apply evenly, and looked splotchy. And if I rubbed too much in one area, it would gather and roll off. Because of this, I began using it only in the evenings before bed. A bit disappointed in that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to participate in the 14 day challenge and was really hoping I found a product that would do wonders for my skin. I was very happy with the creamy feel of the product, the easy way it applied and the light scent. It made my skin feel smooth but I'm not convinced it improved the visible signs of aging. Perhaps it works better for someone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was trying this product for 14 days for free and I really love the result. My skin looks fresher and younger. It is easy to use and plesurable to feel on the skin. I love a New me and want everybody I know to try it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My skin stays smooth and no dryness from the cool fall weather that has arrived. Great job at being in the know when it comes to skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After receiving a trial in the mail, I used LOREAL RevitaLift for 14 days and my skin feels wonderful!

This is a really great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After 8 days of my 14 free trial my skin doesn't look any different. I really wasn't sure what to expect, but so far this product isn't any better then the other anti aging products I've tried in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"On day 7 of my 14 day free trial. Revitalift is amazing! I noticed a difference on day 2! Amazing moisturizing properties! Sad the price point is too high. Otherwise I would purchase a jar. Highly recommend it, if you can afford it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start by saying i have been using expensive skin creams for years. After 4 days of using this cream my husband was looking at me funny and asked me to scrunch my forehead. Which I did and asked him what was wrong. He said your skin looks good I thought you had something done. I am 46 and after 4 days of using this cream my face is glowing. I feel foolish for spending so much on the expensive creams.. Im won over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
