"I've been using this product along with the day cream and night cream for a couple of weeks. My skin is smoother, brighter, and has a nice glow. I'm happy with these products. I'm 62 years old, and my skin looks better!"
I've been using this product for about 2 months now together with other L'oreal Facial products and I absolutely love this wipes. It removes all the dirt from my face and I have started seen my mustache area which I have a very dark spot looks a bit lighter. My face feels very clean and smooth. I use it every night.
I like this. Makes your face feel smooth and clean. Would recommend for dry skinned women. At least try it once!
"I bought these Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Peel Pads over the weekend. With only one use so far, I've instantly seen results! My skin felt clean and smooth, with noticible improvement to my cystic acne! I couldn't believe it! My hormones are crazy right now and I guess the glycolic acid is really great treatment for them. Highly recommend!"
"I loved these L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Peel Pads. I can already see a huge difference in how my skin feels after I used five of the pads included. At first, it tingles and feels like it tightens pores. Then, it cools and feels like it adds radiance to skin. I recommend to anyone looking to improve their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has done a number of things for me. My skin feels smoother and more polished looking. My moisturizer absorbs better into my skin. My makeup looks better on this skin. I notice that I'm using less concealer on my acne spots. And finally, omg, my spontaneous weekly breakouts have STOPPED. yes, acne breakouts here and there have been on pause since I introduced this product to my nightly routine."
"I noticed a difference after a week of use. My skin was brighter, dark spots had faded a bit, and areas were noticeable softer. It's not overly drying, and shouldn't cause redness unless your super sensitive. A full months use produced similar results as a real microdermabrasion treatment."
"I had been using a much more expensive product. I found this online and decided to give it a try. Skin texture and evenness has improved, skin seems brighter and clearer. Great products for the cost. Only con that I've experienced is that my face seem very greasy after a few hours post use."
I received this in this last month since I been using it morning and night I have a very oily skin with this pads clean my face in morning and really feel clean breathing! In the night after clean my makeup and washing my face I use this pads again and take away all the residue my soap and makeup remover can't believe is really last long 1 pad for all my face neck :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These pads are a quick and easy way to clean my face.
"This is an amazing product. I've been using this for a couple years now, having noticed that my (mature 54 year-old) skin was looking dull and sallow. It definitely improved and lightened the appearance on my skin, even with having very sensitive skin. Very great product; highly recommend"
I love to use these Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Peel Pads because they are very gentle on my face and my skin instantly has an amazing glow to it. I didn't like that my face was sticky after it dried. I would still buy them again though.
"When I've purchased this product in the stores, the pads were dry & not very good. When I buy this from Jet, it is always very moist as well as less expensive. Will but again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unlike most users I actually paid for mine and read directions. After my cleansing routine I used the pad on my face and moisturized after. Skin feels smooth and looks brighter. I've always taken excellent care of my skin and this just fits well into my routine. I'll continue using these pads bc it's one step, no rinsing, or other products, so it's easier than similar products I've used before"
"I was set to see a dermatologist to have laser treatments on the sun spots on my face. Don't have to do this now, after two weeks of using Bright Reveal, the spots are fading. Comments have been made like ""you look beautiful"" since I've been using this product. I'm thrilled. Thank you."
My boyfriend bought this after reading some reviews on it and we both used it had wonderful results very quickly. I have worked in the highest end luxury destination spas around and 90% of the overpriced products we use could not even compared to this. I will definitely be buying the whole collection very soon. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is our container did not seal tightly and some of our pads dried out before we were even able to use them
"I saw this on Dr. Oz so decided to give it a try and noticed immediate results. Was so thrilled after two nights I went back to store and bought more to share. When you find something this good you can't keep it to yourself! I have very sensitive skin so was expecting a possible reaction and to my most pleasant surprise, no reaction at all. My skin has not looked this good in years. I really can't say enough about how much I love the product after only 6 nights use and can't wait to see the results after 30."
I just recently purchased my second container of these pads and hope to continue to do so. I tried them for 30 days and have notice an improvement with my skin. My skin is brighter and my dark spots have faded a little. My skin will tingle and feel so clean and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination skin which is acne prone. I brought this RevitaLift brightening pads at a store and the worked well. I used it at night and the next morning my skin looked a lot smoother and was brighter. The glycolic acids seem to help keep the pores uncontested...so it will help people with acne and scars once the don't have extremely sensitive skin. It is a bit expensive for a drugstore brand.
"I love L'Oreal products and am trying a new skin care regime. As I'm in my 30s, I'm beginning to get fine lines and my skin needs a new regime. I bought the whole skin care set for Revitalift and I'm so happy I did. These pads are great as even though I throughly washed my face I still notice some dirt coming off. They are perfect at night and I enjoy using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using these face pads for a week now; and, what a nice difference I am seeing! My face tone has improved and my skin glows! I am hoping with time that some of dark spots will lighten up. I also noticed some dirt on the pad, even though I had already cleansed my face thoroughly (or so I thought!). Nice product!"
"I bought this product with high expectations that it would help my hyperpigmentation. Much to my surprise when I got home to use them, the pads were bone dry and the plastic seal on them was kinda melted. I was upset that I spent that much money on something that is useless to me."
Ok... I've done some extreme things to my skin in the name of beauty only to discover this gem! These pads are awesome my skin looks new and refreshed! Thank you Loreal Paris for the free sample I'll be back for more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Purchased these because I saw the special on Dr. Oz. I wasn't impressed. They left my skin oily with a film. They also dry out fast. They were expensive and I stuck with using them before bed (because they way they felt on my face) and only used 1/3 of the pads. The other dried out so they are wasted.
This is a great product to help lighten the skin. I was a bit concerned that the ingredients may make my skin feel a bit dried out or sensitive but that was not the case! These pads are quick and easy! LOVE THAT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only just started using this product after searching for one that was under $80 and I was thrilled to find this and give it a try. I have used it 3x (every other night to start) and I have already noticed results. My pours are smaller and my skin is smoother. I have also had no reactions to this, such as skin flares. I look forward to my results after using the entire tub."
"I like these peel pads because they work for me, they are convenient and affordable! My skin is firmer and smoother, plumper and wrinkles are less pronounced on my face- and hands as after treating my face, I use the pads on the backs of my hands."
I am ok . Iam not with a december 2017 if you good time . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just bought this and read great reviews about it. So far my skin is so soft the first night. I'm hoping it will help with my textured skin and large pores and fine lines. I wish the pads would hold more product it seems it is not very saturated.
"I was very excited when my order arrived coz i've read about good reviews on it. But when i open it, the pads are very dry. I tried using it anyway, and as expected, nothing happened to my skin."
I have been using these nightly after the brightening face wash for a month. I have large pores and sensitive/acne prone skin and love how this has evened out my skin tone and is helping clear out my pores.
"After reading glowing reviews, I bought this product and was so looking forward to using it. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package and found 30 bone-dry pads. They was not a drop of product on them, no scent whatsoever emerging from them."
Ihave been using this product for three months and its made a difference. I am a gal who is over 65! I have always taken care of my skin and bonus I have no wrinkles. This product smoothed out the fine lines and boosted the radiance of my skin.
I seen this on Dr Oz about 1yrs ago been use it ever sense it has brightened my skin so much I use it every night befor bed just love it plus am a dark skin woman it works .
I have extremely sensitive skin so I chose to use this product only twice a week and I still saw great results. I had previous acne blemishes and this product dramatically reduced them and made my skin feel smoother. I would highly recommend this product.
I thought it would have more liquid inside. Pads were dry.
"Love it, brightens my skin!"
"I purchased this, completely hoping it would work for me and sun spots, uneven complexion, I soo wanted this to work. Unfortunately, it did not work for me, was faithful and stayed true to the instructions! Ughhh, so wanted to see positive results."
"I also turned 41 this year & can't believe the results from the last 3 weeks... Clear, smooth, bright, no pimples whatsoever... Amazing reduction of wrinkles. Very impressive. This product line is enough to restore anyone's faith in advertising. Nice work L'Oreal. Nice work indeed!"
Excellent product
this is honestly the best product they came out with! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Purchased these pads because it has a similar formulation as the serum with spf 30 by the same company.
I love these things! Totally drastic results on my acne scars and dark spots! They stopped selling them in my store and I was so sad. Found em on walmart.com for cheaper and free shipping!!
I've been using this product for about a year. I have seen very noticeable changes in my age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I live in a very dry climate. These pads help with my dry skin on my face and hands. I cut the pads in half so they last longer. They do tend to dry out. That's why I give this product 4 stars.
"I purchased this product expecting to have some of my dark spots 'brightened."" I didn't get the great results I was expecting. My skin did feel a little softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OMG! Made an immediate difference in the texture and smoothness of my face. I'm 62 years old and my skin looks much brighter- got rid of the dullness.
"I bought the peel pads after using other bright reveal products that I loved. I am not sure if something is wrong with the pads but they are not scented at all, i feel nothing when i use them and they are not that soaked. Given they have gylcolic acid i feel like they should burn a little bit or be drying on my skin. I have been using for a week and see zero difference in skin tone, acne scars."
"I have used the pads for a month. They have actually changed my skin. Its a amazing, smooth, bright and soft. If they weren't so expensive I would say I'd use them forever! I absolutely love this product, it's deff the most effective product I've ever used."
Used for2 months...Love love love fine lines deminished in a couple weeks
"My face feels so, good after cleaning and then using these pads!"
I brought this over a month ago use every night. It did slightly lighten s few blemish. Not worth the price I paid. Also have the moisturizer. It's ok
After I use the Daily Scrub I use these pads and it removes the extra make up. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I first tried L'Oréal revitalift scrub and day cream, and it works for my sensitive and always dull and tired look! So I went to try on this pads and it is just perfect for my skin! I use it every night and will continue using it as it gives my face a clear and smooth complexion!"
"I don't know that these have a rejuvenating effect, but I like that I feel like my face is really clean after using each pad. I have verrrry sensitive skin and these cause no break outs (in fact, may be helping). My face looks fresh and healthy, and it's softer than it's been in years. (I'm 41 and have been using these daily for about 6 months). So I'll continue using them. Wish they were less pricy but maybe it's worth it."
The Revitalift Brightening Pads were the only product that I didn't love. They irritated my sensitive skin and burned my face. I couldn't use them. They smelled good and probably work fine for other people but were too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started by following the product instructions, but found fast that the peel pads worked better for me on a twice a week basis. I did like them for the days I wore a heavier makeup, per it was an extra deep clean. Good news I will save money, by not needing them everyday day, but they worked very well with all the other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Used this product with the Revitalift Bright Moisturizer with SPF 30 and Cleanser. All products complement each other and make my skin more young looking by reducing wrinkles and skin tone unevenness. This helps make me see results faster by removing some dead skin on the surface to allow the new skin come through and shine! Highly recommend this product along with all of the Loreal Revitalift Bright Review line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the peel pads and really liked the results. They are easy to use. You open and wipe your face - can't get any easier. I noticed that my skin looked fresher. some of the dull, dry patches were gone. One of the down sides of this product is, it also exfoliates your fingertips, so the ones that touched the pad were a little dry. Overall I would totally use this product and tell anyone looking to even their skin tone to try this too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't seen any major difference in the ten days I've been using this regime, but one thing I do really like about the peel pads is that they are gentle on my skin and don't leave it feeling dry afterwards. I think though that visible results will be seen with continual use of these pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved d effect the product had but wasn't pleased with the corrosive feeling during use . Used it less than the remaining product in d revitalift collection .all in all it works but be ready for mild irritation on skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this was my favorite product out of the whole Revitalift line. You could almost feel all the dirt and grime screaming as it was scrubbed away. Not a painful brillo pad scrubbing away kinda feeling! It is very good at getting all the makeup that the makeup remover wipes missed. Honestly, My face felt so clean and super smooth after using these little magical pads. This is at the very top of my list for Santa this year!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Having sensitive skin, I loved that the peel pads were gentle on my skin. I didn't have any irritation from using these and the best part was that I noticed my skin tone has been more even, my skin is brighter (I've worn less make up since using these products!) and soft! I am a huge fan of this line and will continue to use all 4 products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads are gentle and effective. My skin is sensitive and combination. These worked effectively on all areas of my face. I've noticed an overall increase in the brightness of my skin. This is the first time I've used glycolic acid based cleansing system and I'm impressed. I'm certainly going to keep using these. I've achieved results using these once a day and not twice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I will admit that I was a little hesitant to use the L'Oreal brightening Peel Pads. I always worry that these type of products will be harsh on my facial skin. I was pleasantly surprised when I used these. I used the peel pads after cleansing my skin in the evening with the L'Oreal daily scrub. These pads are not to harsh and they made my skin feel so refreshed and really evened out my skin tone. I loved how my skin looked refreshed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to try the Loreal Revitalift Brighting product line. As soon as I got it I couldn't wait to start my trial. The pads felt good and felt realy good on my skin as well as left it feeling silky smooth. I only gave the product a low rating due to the fact that it caused me to have a bad allergic reation. For some one else the product I'm sure would be very pleasing. Remember please I only gave the product such a low rating due to my reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These revitalift bright reveal brightening peel pads have worked wonders. My face always seemed so dull... after using this product I can definitely see that my face isn't so dull anymore. Thanks again @bzzagent and @loreal for letting me try for free [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was quite unimpressed with the Brightening Peel Pads and only used them for about 5 days. They left my face with an odd film that I just couldn't get past. Definitely not dry, but not oily. It was almost like a pre-moisturizer feeling, if that makes any sense. Unfortunately, not a fan. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I cannot gush enough about the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads.!!! I have sensitive skin and this product works so well! I am receiving TONS of compliments on how youthful my skin looks! I have never used a Peel pad but I am now a customer for life! Everyone says I just radiate! They are so easy to use and I feel my skin softening right away from these pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very pleased with the results of the Revitalift Bright Real Brightening Peel Pads. My skin is brighter and softer after using this collection. I will be buying this collection in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am not a fan of the name for this product. It is a bit deceiving, as this is not really a ""peel pad"". For me this was more along the lines as ""stridex"" pads. It seemed to be more of a toner, not a peel. I used this for about 2 weeks at night, while my skin was generally cleaner after using these (you can see the dirt on the pad), I felt my skin was drier for using it. For the brightening aspect, I did notice a bit of an improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Out of all 4 products I received from bzzagent I must say that this one is definitely by far my favorite. I love they that are so quick and easy to use not to mention gentle enough to use every day. I will definitely continue to use this product. I'm not really sure that it has done much for the fine lines and such but I have noticed that over time my skin does look brighter and more refreshed. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a fast easy daily face cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Brightening Peel Pads were just ok for me. I have very sensitive skin and they seemed to irritate and sting a little. They also had a strong smell. Keep in mind neither was so bad that I discontinued use for my 30 day challenge. On the other hand, they did do a great job in removing leftover dirt. Even after washing my face, these L'Oréal Peel Pads would still find and lift leftover dirt. No dirt or oil stands a chance with these pads! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After scrubbing my face, I generally think I have removed all of my makeup from the day. These pads prove me wrong. They get all the spots I missed during my routine wash. It's especially good for areas on the neck and corners of the nose. For some reason there's always trace amounts of makeup left behind in those areas. The pads leave my skin feeling refreshed and clean as a whistle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oréal New Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel pads are really good ,I thought they would be harsh on my skin ,but they were not after using them for two weeks I noticed that my skin like smoother and less dull and glowing they do tingle , i notice that when rub tonhard it left white pieces of the pad on my skin ,so Ihad use lightly and not press so hard ,I do recommend these and I never broke out while using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for a month now. I use them every night after I cleanse my face. I have rosacea and they didn't irritate my skin like I was afraid they would. My skin looked brighter after just a few uses. I will continue to use them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recently tried the new Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. They are a great compliment to the other items in the Bright Reveal series. I only wish that the pads had a bit more wetness to them. They seem to dry out after only half of my face is cleaned. Otherwise, they leave my skin feeling clean and smooth. After two weeks of use I can definitely see brighter skin revealed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Again, I have real dry skin that flakes and sometimes i get little pimples as well. These pads are great at helping to slough off the dry skin and help minimize the pimples. 1 pad works great for your whole face and I use them every night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved these pads. After using them nightly for a about 10 days I noticed my skin visibly less dark spots. As well I've noticed less breakout but to be fair, my skin is not very prone to acne. This is an amazing addition to my night skincare regimen!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These pads do a pretty good job with cleaning my skin. They're larger than I needed so I cut them in half to get more uses. I'm not sure if they are really doing anything other than cleaning , but they're good enough at that. The pads feel durable and nice. The scent is light; not unbearable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think these pads were great in that they were not at all harsh or drying but I wish I had seen some improvement in the overeall shine/fine lines in my skin as I was expecting. I used them nightly after using the scrub and just before the moisturizer/serum mixture. Overall, the pads seem to add that extra cleansing step, I am just not sure that I notice a difference overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is such a wonderful product! Ive used the more expensive brands and in my opinion, L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads work just as well at a fraction of the cost. My skin definitely looks brighter, and my pores look smaller. Will definitely be using again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these products! I can truly see a great difference in my skin tone and complexion. I used the whole set for day and night on my face, neck, and cleavage area. It is awesome! I wish I could afford to by the products, but they are kind of pricey. Maybe I can get one at a time. Not sure if I'll get the same results, but I'll try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately the beginning of using this I was experiencing an amazing glow etc. But now my skin is drying. So I stopped using it a couple of days ago. Expected better results for myself. Not telling you not to use it. Because im sure its a great product, it was for me at the beginning. Now not so much unfortunately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are a good product. There not my favorite out of the Revitalift collection but they work good at keeping my skin looking more youthful and radiant. I had no problem with them stinging or drying out my skin like similar products have caused. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved the brightening peel pads!! Instantly left my skin feeling cleaner, clearer and bright! They're not scented which I loved , they're super durable and they work! loreal does it again. I'll add this to my sky nacre routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using these revitalift bright reveal pads for about 3 weeks. I received them in a free kit from bzzagent for an honest review. I like them, they come in a container that has a screw on lid, so they stay moist, unlike some that come in a plastic bag that sometimes doesn't shut good and dries out. They make my skin feel clean and refreshed. Doesn't really brighten that I can tell but my skin doesn't need that much. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First of all i enjoyed being able to try the product. The Reviaitalift Brighting Peel Pads smelled wonderfull and were a joy to use. They glided over my skin and felt like silk. The reason i had to give the product is it caused me to have an allergic reaction. To others it may work wonders. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Revitalift bright reveal peel pads felt great, super refreshing -- I used them after the exfoliating cleanser- and found they gave me a super clean feeling and even brighter skin. They add the perfect touch at the perfect time. Face felt light and airy... left no residue. Leaves your face primed and ready for day or night moisturizer!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The reveal pad have played a big part in this collection. They make my face feel refresh and even out my skin tone. I love how they make me feel everytime I use them. Make my skin feel S oft I love them really love them. I notice my skin looks more even. age and brown spots are disappearing and my skin looks more brighter and glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Peel pads really did do much for me, it may take longer for people with darker pigments. For this part of the challenge, this should have probably been longer depending on your pigmentation. I would have given about 60 days to notice a difference in using it, to give an honest review. I see where there going with this, but again it depends on the pigmentation of a person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the concept of the peel pads. They are intended to gently scrub and cleanse the face after washing. But I have to say that these pads really burn when used and I am not a huge fan. I wish they were a little less harsh but effective at cleaning and scrubbing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely loving these peel pads, my skin is left smoother and brighter, when combined with the other products you will never change skin care regiments. Your skin will feel and look years younger, my skins softness now feels baby soft, it looks brighter and more even and fine lines around my eyes are deminished. LOVE LOVE LOVE this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the peel pads after cleaning my face with the daily scrub cleaner. The smell was nice -- a light citrus. I noticed several times during my use of these products that the pads left my skin burning a little bit. It didn't last long and wasn't painful, more annoying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cleansing pad is an essential part of the routine care in the Revitalift kit. As soon as you use the pads you start to see the results. The skin looks firmer and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.The skin feel refresh and it help me absorb the moisturizers better. I love the product and I recommend it also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Peel Pads worked wonderfully when I used them. They polished my skin nicely and were easy to use. I really did like how my skin felt each time I used the pads. However, I had difficulty remembering to use this product - it wasn't very conveninet for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way the Peel pads gently exfoliate my face and neck without feeling too harsh and I did like how smooth my face and neck felt after using them. They also have a fresh gentle scent. I used daily for the first week and then only used them every 3 days. The only thing bad about the pads in my opinion was the pads leave a sticky film on your face that does not go away without re-cleaning your face again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Nice product that didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I used it at night after cleansing my skin and before applying the dual overnight moisturizer. I have been using these once or twice a week and do not use daily as I wanted to take it slow since my skin is prone to redness and irritation. I wouldn't say that I've noticed any brightening with my skin but this is a simple extra step that I add in my night time skincare routines that I hope over time will show results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that these peel pads are amazing. Not only do they get rid of any residue, they smooth and lift the wrinkles away. My skin has never felt better or looked better after using the whole system. I will continue to use this system. It has dulled my age spots and has smoothed my wrinkles and it makes my skin shiny and smooth. I'm running out to get more of this system! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pretty impressed with these pads. The seemed to help some of my spots on mycfacealong with some other products in the collection. Even though I have oily skin these pads ( which the ingredients are designed for normal to dry skin) I did not break out. I would consider purchasing these in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These peeling pads were awesome. I noticed that small spots and scars seemed to fade away after use. It could be the fact that I used the entire line, but I felt the daily pads contributed greatly to the improvement that I saw. After using I felt a small tingle which I felt was proof the product was working. I'll probably continue to use the products I liked best to see if this is true. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With sensitive skin I have always been very careful about the products I use on my face. The peel pads I am in love with. All you do is wash your face with the scrub at night and then follow with the peel pads. They take away dead skin, and leave it feeling refreshed. They have a light clean smell, and your face will be brighter in the morning . I love the peel pads because they make my skin soft , and they don't irritate it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The peel pads were great however I used them every other day, and sometimes every 2 days. I noticed using them everyday left my skin a little more sensitive than usual. I'll still recommend them but would not advise daily usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the L'Oréal Peel Pads, my skin feels softer and brighter and my pores are smaller. I did receive the whole collection but sometimes I only used the peel pads depending on the day. I would buy them after this campaign, they are that good. They are quick and easy to use, the pads have enough liquid on them to use them on my whole face, neck and the back of your hands. The pads did leave my face feeling warm after, I took that as a result of it working. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't used a peel pad for my face in years...the L'Oréal Revitalist pads are amazing! The pads are soft and not too harsh on my skin... I feel like they do exfoliate and brighten my skin.! I would buy them and use them again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Of all the Revitalift Brightening products L'Oreal made I was most excited to use the Brightening Peel pads. After washing my face with the scrub I applied the pads over my entire face in a circular motion like the instructions recommended. Using them every night until I ran out I thought a difference would surely be seen. There was just nothing to see. It was almost like an unnecessary step that you wouldn't miss if you excluded it in your facial care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used these Peel Pads many times and I must say that I'm not very fond using these. They didn't irritate my skin They were easy to use. After washing your face you apply rub the Pads all over your face and leave on overnight. What I didn't care for was it left my feeling dry and tight. I personally wouldn't buy them in the future.

I used L'Oréal's Brightening Peel Pads once a day at night after I used the cleanser. This product contains glycolic acid which is great for brightening dull uneven skin. The ability to also reduce wrinkles is an added bonus. There is a tightening that I felt with this product and a slight tingle. I love how my face looks smoother and more even. Since using Revitalift Bright Reveal products I have been told many times how nice my skin looks! I will continue to use these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'oreal Revitalift Bright reveal brightening pads are wonderful 10% Glycolic Acid just enough to get the job done but is not harsh on the skin. I used the pads on my Elbows and knees too since I do a lot of gardening work. I would buy this product when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was skeptical at first with the Loreal Brightening Peel pads because I really didn't think they would be that effective. I couldn't have been more wrong! I absolutely love these! I can tell a difference in my skin after just a week. I had some major uneven skin tone going on and I can tell so much difference after using these pads. It's like my skin was dead but now it has been revived! I am definitely sold on this product and will continue to purchase after these are gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't so sure about using any of these products. I have sensitive skin and can't use much. These were all gentle on my skin and gave me amazing results in under a week. I have highly recommended to everyone I have talked to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product as part of my night time routine for the past 30 days ... I have to admit it is kinda gross how much dirt still shows up on these things even after washing my face! It shows that they really are making a difference and my face feels cleaner and fresher. Big fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do believe my face is just getting smoother and bright. I enjoy using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Peel Pads, just before bed and before applying my dual moisturizer. They really make a difference in the texture and feel of my skin, which in turn relaxes me as I prepare for bed. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family. This product is definitely for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think they worked. I used them daily for almost 3 weeks now and my skin feels brighter and I see my dark spots fading. Pros: Really brightened my skin. Very cooling on your skin. Used as a toner after cleansing every night. Cons: It is bit expensive. It only comes with 30 pads for that price. I will definitely buy it again because it is changing my skin and didn't cause any problems on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the idea of these but I didn't see a real difference in my skin. They are gentle although they did sometimes sting a little bit. I'm not sure I would buy these but I would buy the other 3 products, cleanser, day moisturizer with SPF and the dual overnight moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that I can honestly say that my skin looks SO much better since I have been using not only the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads, but all of the products in this line. They all work so well together to give my skin a fresh and healthy glow. My skin feel softer and smoother and I nourished. I highly recommend these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I dont want to say that I think these pads are either good or bad. I do not have very many problems with my skin, so I am not too sure that these were very helpful. Because I was so happy with the rest of the line, I am leaning towards believing that this product does work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These pads are awesome. The glycolic acid works to exfoliate your skin and give you a more youthful and bright appearance. You can feel the acid at first, but you get used to the sensation. I love that the product is already in pad form so that the ease of use is better. I even took a few of these on a trip in a plastic bag. You have to follow with a moisturizer, but that is the standard for any glycolic product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is by far my favorite product out of the four. I noticed a difference in the texture and brightness of my skin almost immediately. These pads are easy to use and unlike some did not irritate my skin which is super sensitive. It has a great level of glycolic acid but is still gentle on skin. The amount of dead skin cells just one pad removed was amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These peel pads are awesome. A simple one step quick way that helped make my skin feel so soft and smooth. Just swipe it all over your face, it dries quick and totally make my skin tone more even. I have a few spots that were darker than the rest of my facial skin and these made them slowly fade to a more even tone. I highly recommend these little peel pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smoother more radiant skin. Love the smell of the pads they glide on easy and cleanse all debris from my skin left over after washing with the scrub cleanser. You can actually see how much it has lifted off the dirt on the pad. Easy to just toss in the garbage can after the one time use as well. Very good product.

"I tried all 4 of the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening prodycts: Daily Scrub Cleanser, Dual Overnight Moisturizer, daytime moisturizer & Peel Pads! I have not completed a week yet but I love the smell & the feel of my skin. The peel pads are amazing. I used it after a shower and to see dirt still on there amazed me. Can't wait to see what my 1 week results are. I didn't have any bad skin reactions which is 1 thing I was worried about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the Loreal Reviatlift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads and loved how easy they were to use. I thought they might burn or sting when applied after the scrub wash but they were soothing and left me ready for the nighttime moisturizer. The smell was light and not overpowering as some routines can be. I'd definitely recommend these as part of an anti-aging skin regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did not think that I would see a difference in my skin after using L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Pads, but boy was I wrong! My skin looked brighter and felt smoother than before I started using them. The size of the pads is just perfect to cleanse my entire face and neck. The light scent left behind is very pleasant. The texture on the pads really feels like they are cleaning every pore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I gave it three stars because it is a little too harsh for my skin to use daily so I tapered my regimen to use it only every other day. It does get rid of the oil but I don't think I would buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my other favorite product in the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. It's so easy to use the brightening peel pads after cleaning my face any feel its effect (slight tingle and redness), then follow with the night moisturizer. My skin feels instantly brighter and smoother afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Bright Reveal Peel Pads. It does exfoiliate my face in a gentle way to leave my skin feeling fresh and smooth. I find that it takes away the dead skin that clogs my pores and has helped with my acne. I have been using all four products and see my skin is looking brighter. Great product line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this product after I take a shower. I clean my face with a pad and notice all the make up that didn't come off while in the shower. These pads leave my face feeling clean and smooth. I recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Brightening Peel Pads!I use these pads every night.My skin loves these.When I use these I am seeing my skin just continue to improve.The texture of my skin has improved so much and I have combination skin!!I will continue to use this skincare line,I love it!!I recommend that everyone try this skin care line.

The Peel Pads were a little harsh on my skin. They caused some minor irritation. I only used them at night after using the cleanser. After about 2 weeks of nightly use I only used them 2-3 times a week. With that being said I would buy them again in the future as part of the collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads were awesome. Even though I washed my face with the daily scrub cleanser, the pad took off even more dirt that I didn't know I had. First it was gross, but I was pleasantly surprised on how much that little pad can remove. I already finished and want to go out and but another jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the cleansing pads! they helped removed any leftover makeup the cleanser missed (not much) and made my face feel super clean. I felt like I just had a facial at the spa. I just ran out and will be keeping this routing going. The pads could probably be smaller and maybe offer a refill packaging to save on waste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. They had a very refreshing feeling, like getting a facial. They worked well the other products in illuminating my skin and keeping it soft. The scent was good and the texture of the pad was perfect, not to abrasive. I wish they would come in a a larger count though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using these at night now and you can feel it work. When I first used it gave a little sting to my face?? Now it give a fresh feeling. You can see how much dirt is still on your face I use after washing my face then use the peeling pad and it removes the rest of the dirt. Making you feels fresh and clean before bed. I would recommend to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think these pads are fantastic. You can see the dirt and dead skin right on the pads. They really do slough off all the extra dirt! My skin showed great improvement from smaller pores, less black heads and a better complexion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really love these peel pads. I like the mildly scratchy surface. Strong enough to get my skin clean but not too abrasive. They are great for a quick clean and that is super handy. Unfortunately I have flaky brown spots on my cheeks that peel off occasionally. These pads really helped with those. Im almost out of these bad boys so time to reup. I absolutely will continue using these pads in my everyday beauty regiment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oréal Bright Reveal Peel Pads for over a month. These pads are quick and easy to use. They have a slight tingle after each use. My skin has had noticeable improvements since adding the pads to my cleansing regime. It is clearer, brighter, smoother and tighter. It only takes a few seconds to wipe the pads across my face. After each use my face has a clean feel. I highly recommend trying these pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The pads feel nice when using them. They seem to get off the makeup my face wash missed. But they also remind me of noxema pads from my teenage years. I can't tell if they are providing any extra benefits to justify the cost vs using a makeup removal wipe. I'll keep trying them and will make my final decision once I am done with the pack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was my first time using a peel. I was impressed with how well it worked and how gentle they were. I was expecting something more harsh. They are easy to use and they did not dry out my skin. It does have a alcohol scent and slight sticky feel. I have been using the whole system for a few weeks and I can tell a difference in how bright and smooth my skin is. I am really glad that I had the chance to try this system and I will continue to buy in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. I have been using them for 30 days and can tell a huge difference in my skin. It's much smoother and brighter. Suprisingly, even using it daily, it does not cause irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Pads may be my favorite part of the 30 day Revitalift challenge. They pick up all the hard to get bad stuff on my skin after cleansing and make my skin feel so refreshed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using this product for more than two weeks I really have seen a difference in my face. I like the clear complex I get after using the product and I can see that it brightens my face a lot.

"Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads irritated my skin a bit. This was my least favorite product in the line. I did feel it working, it made my skin feel warm but it made parts of my skin uncomfortable. I guess that is sometimes what peels do, just I would not do it everyday, maybe a couple times a week. I enjoy the other products in the L'Oréal skin brightening line, especially the moisturizers. Thank you BzzAgent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the brighting peel pads worked absolutely great. They smoothed the area around my nose actually helped with the blackheads. Overall my skin texture is smoother brighter and much even toned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am not a fan of these peel pads. When I fist started using them it left my face and hand super sticky. I applied my lotions and my face was then smooth. As the days went on I kept using it and now I am almost done with the container and it feels less sticky but that stickiness is still there. I will not be using the pads again but everything else was great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this after I use the daily scrub cleanser. I know that the daily scrub is working because I do not see residue on the pads. These are not as harsh as I thought they would be. They do not dry out my skin. Great combination, use the daily cleanser and then follow them with the pads. No acne breakout and small pimples are gone in a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!! I was very skeptical when this came in. I thought it would burn, leave redness and be drying. ALL were false! After using for 2 wks I have noticed a more evenness to my skin tone and small pores. My skin looks and feels firmer with out expensive spa prices. I will continue to use this product for sure!!

"Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are the perfect follow up in the evening for me after using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Face Wash. The pads deep clean my pores, refreshes my skin and makes my complexion look glowy and dewy. I then follow it up with Revitalift Overnight Moisturizer to give my skin great moisture and a super beautiful glow! I will continue to use the Revitalift collection because it is easy to use and makes my face look fabulous! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using these pads primarily as a make up remover. They are thicker than others I have tried. They seem to remove my make up better than other similar products and do not dry out my skin. Instead, they leave my skin feeling moisturized. AND there's zero stickiness or oiliness! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used all the products in the line and loved 3 of the 4. However the L Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads were not a good match for my skin. They seemed to leave a film on my face no matter how many times I tried them. I can't say it they would have worked for their intended purpose because I simply did not like using them at all. They were mild on my sensitive skin, no irritation, but the sticky feeling film they left was just disappointing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am a huge fan of this product, you need to try this. I used it for 3 weeks and I ended up with clearer, brighter, smoother skin. This was so easy to add to your skin routine. There was no harsh smells or irritation tht I experienced. My skin type is combo/oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The pads are easy to use and work great. They remove all impurities from my face and I was amazed at what I saw on the pad. I couldn't believe how clean my face was. It also let my face with a nice glow to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the pad AFTER cleansing! Gross, I know but satisfying to see all the dirt that I thought was hust washed away from cleansing! I have been getting compliments lately, which tells me something positive is definitely happening with this line. It's very encouraging when other people tell you your skin is looking better. I really think it's helping with the tone and clarity if my skin...and that makes me happy! I would recommend, great line! #Loreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So everything was fine the first couple of weeks of using the product. Then about the third week I started experiencing breakouts of pimples which I normally don't get but my skin was still clear so I kept using that had to discontinue use because I broke out in a rash but I think that's just because my skin is sensitive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Skin Pads did just that-they brightened my skin without drying or feeling overly ""tight"" like some pads can do. The pads were easy to use and didn't leave a film on my skin_ I could moisturize like usual right after using them. They did seem to fade some discoloration after 10 days of use though I did use them in conjunction with the scrub cleanser. Good for a quick toning, but I needed the exfoliating scrub, too, for the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wish I had taken before and after photos as there is such a difference! These L'Oreal products have eliminated my under eye circles and have evened out my uneven skin tone. I've been asked by various people what I'm doing differently and which products I'm using. Most importantly, I'm being told how great my skin looks! I've already bought more of these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I cannot rave enough about these pads. I have loved them. They have made my skin look and feel like baby skin. Now I know people say that but I mean it! My skin feels soft and smooth and I am 49 years old! It had been years since it felt moist and smooth. I grew up in the desert and the sun had just ravished my skin. After about 10 days I started to see a dramatic difference in the texture and the feel of my face. I will never ever go without these again. Amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I previously reviewed how great these pads were, not quite sure what happened if it was a change in my skin from using the product line or a change from the weather. Suddenly, the pads have been burning and leaving red spots, I had to discontinue using them. It saddens me because I really loved the product to start. I think I might try again in a week or so and see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I this before I moisturize my face at night. It really gets off the rest of the dirt and make up that the cleanser might miss. It has a nice texture that is not too rough. I actually like the way my face feels after I use them. I really feel like this entire line is brightening my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was so happy to see that I had brighter more youthful looking skin that was revealed by using L'Oréal Brightening Peel Pads. My pores are tighter and my skin feels smoother. This has become a part of my nightly beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoyed using these glycolic pads. I did notice right away a change in texture and softness. However I would prefer a larger and thicker pad. I felt I needed to use several to really get a good treatment. I also thought it could use a good essential oil or spa-like scent to make the experience more pleasant. I felt that this product performed well and gave a good facial boost without burning the skin or feeling unpleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Of all the products in this system the pads are my favorite. They are easy to use and leave my skin feeling great. My only complaint is that there are not more in the package - I ran out of pads long before the other product in the system. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a fan and a frequent user of AHA, BHA, vitamin c, and hyaluronic acid products, so I was sure my skin was be able to handle the peel.

I would definitely recommend this to those with less sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These peel pads felt a little abrasive to my face but it didn't stop me from using them. I actually noticed the pads removed leftover makeup that didn't get washed off prior, so definitely keeping these for my night time skin routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way the pads have two different textures. One smoother for sensitive areas and the other for the rest of the face. I've used these for two weeks and did notice my skin was fluffing off more when I exfoliated then before using these. So mild exfoliating properties are always great. The smell isn't horrid and it didn't burn my eyes or skin as much as other pads I've used prior. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Peel Pads and was not impressed. I do not usually use peel pads but gave this a try. I did not like the way it felt using them.

I love the Loreal Brightening Peel Pads because of how extra clean it gets my face. It helps exfoliate and I feel like when I put my moisturizer on afterword it soaks right into my skin!

The brightening peel pads are and added exfoliator and and they take the dullness off of my face. my face feels so clean and ready for my moisturizer to be put on.

"I wash my face and use other cleansing clothes but I am shocked each time I use L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads afterwards to find so much makeup had been left behind. My face feels so soft and refreshed after each use. I have tried many other facial pads before but these have been amazing. Not harsh on the skin at all unlike some other brands. By far, these are my favorite and will be purchased again after this container runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Revitalift Bright reveal daily pads are one of the best cleansing pads I have tried. The pad cleans the skin, evens out my skin tone and leaves my face brighter and smoother. This pad super cleans my skin and I've really noticed my face is brighter and my skin tone is more radiant after using it for a couple of weeks now. My wrinkles seem to be not as deep. I will continue to use this product from here on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The brightening pads are different. I've never used anything like it. I liked the feel of them though and I had no bad reactions to my sensitive skin.

Brightening peel pads that work amazingly on my face. I have been using this products for over two weeks and it's my favorite from L'Oréal's collection.

"I tried the pads after using the scrub and the first days was little impact but after a week I was amazed the texture, the softness was visible and tone of the skin was smooth and even, dark spots began to fade slightly , I did how ever noticed if I used them twice a day it will dry my skin so I only used them once a day at night. But you actually feel and see the difference in a week on your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved the peel pads! They were large enough to get my entire face & my neck. They were very well saturated & double sided so it totally felt like they were cleaning the day away. I tried using them twice a day, but that was a bit much & it seemed to dry out my face so I switched to once a day & that was much better. I think in the future I will probably use 3-4 times a week to prevent over drying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little apprehensive to try these. I was pleasantly surprised! I have extremely dry skin (especially during the cold months), and I was worried these would really burn and make my skin look & feel worse. There was no burning or stinging! My skin looks bright and vibrant! It erased the dull, lackluster appearance! My skin was soft and felt hydrated! Extremely uncommon with a toning product!

The brightening peel pads work. I'm a bit saddened though because they are so harsh on sensitive skin. My skin burned. I found I could not use them with the other products or it was all too much for my skin. I'm sure for normal skin this is perfect for them. I found it to be too much for mine.

"These Brightening Peel Pads are awesome! After washing my face, I am always a little worried about what kind of dirt or residue that may be left behind. With these peel pads, I have no reason to worry. I use one pad every night after I use my cleanser. After using the pad, my skin tightens and feels extra clean. I have had nothing but amazing results with these peel pads and they are now a part of my everyday skincare regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The pads are one of my favorite out of Loreal Revitalift skincare. I use it twice a week since I have sensitive skin and it really works great. Make sure to use a non glycolic wash/ cleanser beforehand to avoid skin irritation on sensitive skin. Peel pads are my new must have, works wonders. My skin looks brighter after couple of weeks of using the pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The peel pads are great to use after cleansing and before using the moisturizer. It helps to get rid of any extra residue and dirt on the face.

"If you were a teen in the 90s, you are used to medicated pads. L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads are just like that, except modern! And scrubbing away dead skin cells! Used after the scrubbing cleanser, these pads are a cool touch that help renew the skin surface. After 30 days, I can see a difference in my skin tone and texture.

"These Peel pads were great. I used them every night before applying the overnight moisturizer. What a combo, my skin felt rejuvenated after just a few applications. I will most definitely keep this as part of my skincare routine. My skin now feels fresh and looks more even toned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really picks up dirty left behind by regular makeup wipes. It also leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. It didn't dry out my skin like other pads I have tried in the past. I do notice a chance in my skins texture and brightness. I recommend these pads and will continue using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just love this product! I have greatly enjoyed using these. These pads are very gentle on my face. I'm able to use these around my eyes without my eyes becoming irritated or watering. These really help brighten my face. I have buzzed about this product to the moms at football practice and they were excited to try these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are ok...not great, but I've had far worse. As with any pad I've used, you need a good lotion to follow up with so your skin doesn't dry out & this kit came with great moisturizers. I just don't know what this pad does over any of the others that I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are my favorite! I absolutely love the zing that my skin feels after using the peel pad. It makes my face feel so refreshed and you can actually see the brightening working right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought these were ok, the pads themselves are large and thick, and well saturated with solution. There was plenty to do my entire face, neck, and upper chest. However, I found them really drying, which is not surprising since they also contain alcohol. I wish Loreal had left the alcohol out. They do a good job of busting any upcoming blemishes, but I found they worked best as an occasional use item, not every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I gave these pads a fair chance. But unfortunately it is too rough on my skin. Makes my skin irritated and it burns when I use this. I thought it would happen once but every time I tried it it made my skin more irritated so I stopped use. I don't recommend this for sensative skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I dropped my usual beauty routine to try the Rivatalift products. I have used other brightening products before. Many of them stung and were very smelly. These pads were gentle on my skin, not abrasive, not over drying and did not sting at all. They had a fresh scent. Overall, they were enjoyable to use. I wanted so bad to see a noticeable difference but did not. I still had my regular acne and I did not find any noticeable wrinkle reduction. The picture is a before and after...

"This was probably my least favorite item in the set. It is interesting - a sort of additional scrub and probably a strong part of brightening the skin. However, it felt a little harsh to me so I'm not sure I would continue to use this every day in the future, but rather a couple of times during the week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These were ok I couldn't use them every night because they made my skin red and scaly. I went down to twice a week and my skin n felt smooth and clear. If your at all sensitive start out slow but they are worth a try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When most of us hear the word "" peel"", we think of an abrasive product rhat strips our skin. NOT HERE! ! my skin is sensitive, acne prone, and oily. The glycolic acid is a top contributor in these peel pads, and targets EVERY skin issue I have! my skin is left less congested , smooth and bright! bye bye dead skin cells that clog my pores and make my skin looking dull and uneven!! thank you so much!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have fair skin and its not usually sensitive. When I began to use these pads my skin began to peel. However a month into this trial, my nose skin is drying TOO much. Its drying to the point where my nose is red. Im only using the pads once a week. I like how soft they are though and how nice they smell. Overall, on the rest of my face, it doesnt cause that kind of drying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the revitalift bright reveal brightening peel pads are a great product. You use the brightening peel pads after you wash your face with the reveal brightening daily scrub cleanser to achieve a even skin tone. I like this skin care system. I definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I must say that I used the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift face peel and absolutely live it. It leaves your face with a clean, refreshing, smooth feel. You can also notice the difference in wrinkle reduction. I am definitely continuing use of this product and have already recommended it to family and friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was worried that these peel pads would be way too harsh on my skin, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was the exact opposite! These were actually very gentle on my skin and left my face with a clean, radiant feeling! I will definitely put these Peel pads on my beauty regimen for the rest of my life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I simply love these pads. I would apply my night moisturizer after getting out of the shower and then use the pad right before bed after my moisturizer had plenty of time to soak in. In the morning I would wash my face and it was so satiny soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Collection for almost a month now. The peel pads are great! I use one at night after washing with the daily scrub and before the dual overnight moisturizer. It's a no sting, non abrasive way to exfoliate dead skin and improve skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these pads! They get rid of all the dirt and impurities that most face washes do not completely get rid of. My face feels smooth and re refreshed after every use, without leaving my skin feeling dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of all the products in this system, this was - by far - my favorite. I loved how the pads wiped away all the dead skin and soap residue after cleansing. They made my face feel clean and refreshed. The pads are a nice size and full of the product - ensuring that you need only to use one to get all the gunk off. I have and will continue to recommend this product to all my friends. It's fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used these pads after using the Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I am still not sure what they are supposed to do for my skin! I do love this whole line, though, but not sure if I would buy the pads again. I did end up cutting all the pads in half to make them last longer? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads do a great job at cleaning and exfoliating you skin. Unfortunately they leave your skin feeling a bit sticky. That is a less that clean feeling. After using you really need to atleast rinse your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the Brightening pads for a few days here and there. I just couldn't bring myself to continue using them. They gave me bad flashbacks of those acne pads! I'm already using the exfoliating wash and overnight moisturizer with glycolic acid and am fairly happy with the combo. Maybe when I'm out of the other products, I'll try using the pads again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is great while I have been using it my skin looks much more softer and smoother. Its gentle on the skin while peeling away dull skin cells . My skin is much brighter .I had my doubts when I started using this product I did'nt think it would be any good but I was wrong I like the way my skin looks now its smoother, softer and brighter . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed using these peel pads! I love how gentle they are. I also love how well they exfoliated my skin. Then to top it all off they really do help reveal brighter skin! These are a definite keeper!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm using this product every night for 3 weeks so far. I see the diferences on my skin its more clear. The pads has a nice size and moist, the smell is light and pleasant and did not find them to be abrasive at all. The dryness and peeling has now gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I normally use ""higher end"" products in that I get most of my skin care products from a dermatologist's office. However, I tried these Loreal products and was actually pleasantly surprised at the quality. These peel pads were not harsh at all, and in fact they were very effective at brightening up dull skin especially during this time of the year when I am indoors a great majority of the time. I would definitely consider purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have noticed only a slight difference in my skin appearance. I would not recommend using this product if you have sensitive skin because it will cause flare ups/break outs. I loved the facial cleanser, but the peel pads left a weird residue on my face which I didn't like. I was also not a fan of the peel pads scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I followed the regime to the T with the Revitalift line and talked to many family & friends ! Here are the results pictured below , maybe it will take a bit longer to even out my skin but I will continue using the Loreal products even after the 30 day challenge hopeful for my skin!

"I am so happy that I got to try Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. My skin looks so much younger now. I am a big fan of this product. I have mentioned the results I have gotten, and I think a few more of my friends are going to try this too. It is so easy to use and makes your skin look fantastic!

"I love these! They are my favorite of all the products. They get all the tiny junk off my fave the the cleaner misses, which it doesn't miss much. But after using the pads, my face feels completely clean and fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really thank L'Oreal for letting me try out their products and I really wanted to like it but my skin may be a bit sensitive. The peel pads had a really strong smell to them and when I used them on my face, I could feel it in my nasal passages. It was too strong for me so I was only able to use it once. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very happy with the way the Bright Reveal pads worked. They made me skin feel clean, healthy and didn't dry my skin out or irritate it. After a week of using them, I could tell a significant difference. I would highly recommend this while system! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the Revitalift Bright Reveal pads for a couple weeks now, and they have not overly impressed me. I use them every evening after washing my face with the Revitalift cleanser, and prior to putting on the Revitalift night cream. The pads make my face sting slightly and feel tight. Other than that, I have not noticed any amazing improvements in my face. For me, these are just okay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I conflicted about this product. It worked, and worked well. But man, did it leave my skin feeling tacky, sticky, and bad. I'd have to wash my face again after using this product just to get the tacky/sticky feeling gone. It did deep clean, but there are other products that do as well w/o leaving your skin in need of another wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am not a fan of this line you sent me the entire line to try and as much as I wanted to love it it totally dried my skin out to me its nothing radiant about this skin care line this is a thumbs down for me and I gave it plenty enough time to work a miracle [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin, but these peel pads worked great. I felt a light tingly sensation that only revealed fresher skin. I used them before I went to bed at night. They did make my neck a little irritated so I would not use them in that spot again, but overall very happy with results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how the pads were thick enough. They did a good job cleaning the face. However, there are not enough of them. I still have the scrub, but the pads a long gone. They also left my face feel sticky. For the amount and quality of performance, any store brand or Oxy pads perform just as well. Also, of all the products in this line, the packaging for the pads was the worst. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Even after using the wonderful facial scrub by L'Oreal, you will be amazed at how much these peel pads help tone up the skin even more. After using the product I noticed that my face was not showing an oily T zone (the area above your eyes down your nose) anymore. The only draw back I have is that they don't seem to want to keep the moisture on the top pads once opened. Great price, easy to use and no strong smell at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently been using L'ORÉAL Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads daily for about a month I noticed right away that the Peel Pads made my skin feel much fresher , smoother also used it with L'ORÉAL over night moisturizer, the daily moisturizer, and the scrub cleanser these products are amazing I will continue to used them in the future, and I also would recommend friends and family to try these products #I'm glad I was able to try these products before buying [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love that this product contains 10% glycolic complex, which I feel has worked wonders on my uneven skin tone. I usually suffer from redness when I use any type of facial pads, but the brightening pads gently exfoliate to slough off the dead skin and grime that accumulates throughout the day. I also think it has done a lot to reduce my fine lines around my eyes. I would recommend this product to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i liked the way that they cleaned my skin. they got so much dirt and grime off of it. the one thing that i did not like , was that when i was done cleaning my skin, it made my skin feel sticky. If it were not for that , i definately would have given this product 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cleaning pads are gentle, but very effective. They removed waterproof black mascara without issue. There was no antiseptic burning or stinging. The remind me of a kinder, gentler version of Stridex. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin feels so youthful after using thsee peel pads.I use them daily for two weeks now and I've already seen results. They are easy to use , thank you @ loreal for this amazing product. My skin feels and look amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this part of the system. It did refine my skin and it did help fade some dark spots. I have two on my face that really bother me. One is on my cheek and one is on my forehead. The one on my cheek is now about half as dark as it was and the one on my forehead is almost gone. The peel is by far the best part of the system. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I was in my teens and 20s the acne pads and facial wipes starting coming out, and I was hooked! As I aged however, my face became more sensitive and I had to choose carefully what I used on my skin. L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are the adult cleansing pads that seem to work for me. If you're looking for a strong acting pad that will improve skin texture, this is your go to. If you have sun sensitivity or Rosacea, use sparingly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way these pads smell, feel and make my skin look. Out of all the products, thus is my favorite. This can be a tiny bit irritating to super sensitive skin, but it's not overly so. I would recommend wearing sunscreen while using these, and only use these at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great additive to a nightly facial. Using the peel pads generate a smooth but clean barrier on the skin and makes my face feel awesome. I love the way it makes my face feel softer and cleaner. I have been using this for a month now and love it. Recommending for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are excellent. They do not smell like alcohol or cause dryness to my skin. They leave my skin feeling velvety smooth. I follow using the pads with the overnight cream. I do feel that the pads are somewhat dry and that they should have more product on them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the pads. It is the best product in the whole set. Even after cleaning face with soap the pad manage to remove more dirt from the pores. I would not use it every day, but it is perfect for using 2-3 times a day. I guess, it all depends how sensitive your skin is. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While there was visible residue (dirt/oil/makeup) on the pads even after using the cleanser, after one month of use I really can't tell a visible difference in my skin. However, I have had less breakouts and my skin is smooth and not oily. Using the pads was refreshing, and I probably will continue using them, just not on a daily basis. Photo is before I started using the system versus after one month of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Step 2 if the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal process is the Brightening Peel Pads. Wow do they work. See the yucky dirt and makeup it picked up tonight? And that was after washing my face thoroughly. No sting. No harsh feeling or burn. Just clean. Is it just me or does it also help tighten the face a bit? Enjoying this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Since using the peel pads for about a week now I noticed my skin is a lot smoother & softer. I can even notice my skin is more even colored & just looks younger & refreshed. I am really enjoying the results I am getting from these peel pads. I have tried other products that claim to even out skin tone & haven't seen any of the results these peel pads are giving me & I have only been using them for a week. I also notice my skin is not so oily throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If it was possible to give these pads 10 stars I would! My skin is generally a mess - large pores, discoloration, blackheads that I can never seem to get rid of - no matter how many scrubs, masks or pore strips I use. Well these pads along with the scrub have made such a difference. Blackheads are gone, skin is more even & my pores look smaller. Thank you BzzAgent & L'Oreal.

"Everyone must know that this product is the best one out there it makes your complexion look better. So don't hesitate. From the first time I used the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads I saw how my skin was moisturized, radiant , and the uneven tones of my skin were less visible. In fact I give it ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had the opportunity to try the Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads. The premoistened pads have a multi ply texture that are formulated with Glycolic Acid. I gave this product a try in hopes that it would help minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face, which I did not notice much of a difference.

I really like the clean and refreshed feeling that I get when I use Loreal Bright Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. They exfoliate the old ugly dirt and oily or dry skin off my face to reveal the beautiful skin below. Leaving much face feeling fresh and new and beautiful!

"I have noticed after the peel pads my skin is bright pink as in sensitive. So I now wait between doing the peel pads and applying the dual moisturizer so there is not a reaction which I had the first couple of times. I find even cleaning with the scrub, the pads also pick up and makeup or dirt residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing!! I would recommend it to everyone. It leaves your skin looking healthier and refreshed. I'm so happy I got to try them!! After 2 weeks my skin is more even and I couldn't be happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Revitalift Bright reveal brightening pads are awesome. I noticed my skin looking clearer with a couple of days. I use them at night before bed and it seems to brighten my complexion. I was worried it wouldn't be good for sensitive skin but i haven't had any bad reactions only positive ones. I didn't even know these existed but am so please to have found them to help with my fountain of youth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the pad per directions. At first it stung a bit and made my skin a bit red, but within about 10 min that was all gone and left my skin smoother and brighter. The second and third time I used them, the reaction was less so i am guessing that for sensitive skin it can take awhile to get used to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love using these peel pads! They are a little big for me so I cut them in half (bonus!) They are soft & gentle yet I really feel them getting my skin clean. My skin is looking much more bright and smooth since using this entire system! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads have been working great on my skin. I have a lot of dark spots from when I was pregnant and after using this product my skin looks much brighter and healthier. I'm happy to use it everyday because it really seems to be helping. I have been sharing my experience with my friends and coworkers and they have noticed my fresh bright skin too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"OMG, I've never used a product like this before! I have to admit I was a bit leery because I have semi-sensitive skin, but this worked great for me! Along with using the entire system my face has NEVER looked better! I feel fresh, clean, and oh so moisturized every day now! Thank you BzzAgent!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have less breakouts, less dirt feel and more of that all over glow that feels amazing. The personal experience is incredible. They do not dry out your skin, they take out the dead skin and make you feel young and fresh.

"So far, each time I use one, I get dry stops on my face, I have soaked my face with the loreal revitalift bright reveal after, still take a few days for the random dry stops to heal, daily lotion, I normally don't ever get dry stops on my face, I have mostly oily skin and dry stops on my face are super abnormal, but again this is a peel, so idk if this how it is supposed to work...

I didn't feel like these pads did much of anything. I will not be purchasing these later. The pads were a bit dry and it just seemed like an unnecessary extra step at night. I didn't notice a difference when I used them so I stopped after 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really want to like this product but it makes my face burn slightly. I feel that it does make my skin clean. I let my daughter use one and her face turned bright red. So I know it isn't just me that there is a reaction going on just my face feels red and tingly but it doesn't look red. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ever since i tried Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads my face looks more even toned, my skin tone looks not so gray looking, my co workers have commented on my skin asking me what I've done different.

"I got a free sample of these from bzzagent to try for my opinion on the product. I absolutely love these!! They don't have a strong scent, it's light and pleasant. They were so easy to use. I'm a week into my 30 day challenge and love how my skin is looking and feeing. I def see a difference and a nice brightening!

"Revitalift Brightening Peel Pads are great! I don't use a lot of makeup, so I didn't use these everyday, but on the days I used foundation and blusher I did. You think your face is clean until you use the peel pad and see all the residue you missed! I felt clean and my skin looked brighter! The product was gentle and did not dry out my skin the way some cleaning pads do. Congrats L'Oreal on a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have a discolouration spot on my forehead that popped up out of nowhere 2 years ago. I didn't expect this system to completely get rid out it, as that what professional dermatologist's are for, but WOW! I am really pleasantly surprised with the results I have received! The splotches have considerably faded! I am VERY happy with the results! It is almost time to post my before & after pictures! =) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I tried the Brightening Peel pads after using the Cleansing Scrub when I first received the package from BzzAgent. It was a little much for my sensitive skin and I noticed a bit of tightness and burning initially. After a few days off, I tried the Peel pads independent of the Cleansing Scrub and did not notice the same irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
All I have to say is that this set is amazing! I cant believe the difference in how my skin looks and feels! I am so impressed. I have used many different skin products and this is by far my favorite! The 4 step system is so easy! You use 2 products in the morning and 2 before bed. So simple! Check out my photo results! I am in love with this!! I also have sensitive skin and I've had no problems at all. This is one thing everyone should try! #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To be honest, I didn't love the Brightening Peel Pads. It felt like they were an uncessary step. I'm pretty lazy in my skin routine, so for me, it's the fewer steps the better! I would much rather replace this step with using toner to help remove excess oil and dirt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a great product! I love how it makes my face feel refreshed and new all over again. It's so easy to use one pad and just throw it away with no mess. This is a great product for anyone trying to get their skin feeling clean and smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that L'Oreal revitalift is absolutely amazing. The peel away pads literally scrubbed my skin after I thought I had just cleaned it entirely while taking a shower. I was so amazed to see what was still left on my skin after using my normal scrub. My skin did not feel dry or get irritated. I normally struggle with certain products but these have been wonderful. My husband actually tried one after I was so happy with them as well exclamation point [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Before starting this trial I had small little bumps on my check area. It was only highlighted when applying makeup. These pads helped to treat this problem area by making this area much smoother. I also have some oily areas and now my trouble t zone is not as oily. I really like the formula and being able to use them daily to help prevent signs of aging while feeling like I am pampering myself. Almost like a mini spa treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love these pads. When I use them after cleansing my face I notice dirt and residue on them...and I know they are doing their job. My skin isn't dry after and it feels nicely moisturized unlike other pads I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These were nice, but I prefer facial wipes. I do like how one side was ""scrubby"" and one side was smooth and I felt like they did a good job cleaning. I never felt like these were similar to a peel though, just more similar to a makeup remover/cleansing pad. I don't think I would ever buy these. I would just prefer to use the facial scrub t wash my face, and then a facial wipe to remove any excess makeup/residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for a full two weeks without my regular routine. I'm not sure what this product actually did. I used it after the scrub and before the exfoliating moisturizer. I didn't see any extra dirt or makeup, nor any other cleanliness. It was like an Oxypad- however it didn't sting like those, and didn't have the squeaky feeling you got after using those. I would not recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Out the whole revitalift product suite, I liked these pads the least. I wasn't really sure what they were supposed to do. The pads remind me of Oxyclean pads but less strong smelling. I guess if you like cleansing pads in general these would be fine but I don't see that they are that useful. A washcloth with the scrub would work just as well. The pads do have a product on them but I didn't notice that it was that useful [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and after a few days of using the pads I had big bumps on my face so I can't honestly give my opinion on them. What I will say is if you have sensitive skin, please use with caution. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These Peel Pads are fabulous! I use one every night after I wash my face with my Revitalift Bright Reveal Cleanser! The pads take off any remaining makeup that I may have missed with the cleanser and they take off any flaky skin that I may have. Afterwards, my face feels super clean and polished!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these pads! After washing my face every night with the daily scrub, I would use a pad then apply my nightly moisturizer. WELL, these pads are so great, I have been using them once in the morning and once at night. They make my face feel so refreshed and clean!! After using them, I always apply either the brightening moisturizer or the nighttime moisturizer so that my face gets the moisture it needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm loving using these products overall, I am a big L'Oreal fan... but I wouldn't advise using the pads on the delicte skin around your eyes. Even with moisturizing afterward, I have wrinkles showing where I had none before due to dryness. I have discontinued use around my eyes and neck, and continued moisturizing and I am plumping back up again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given the opportunity to test this product and I sadly feel like it feel short of expectations. I used it as recommended and it did not do as it claims to do. What I did like is that you have a months supply in a jar. It is an easy application, all ready for you to use. I have found that a toner is very important in my skin regiment and this did not provide the same benefits as others have in the past. I will be returning to my original toner and do not recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Bright Reveal Peel Pads are really working for me. I have noticed a big difference in uneven skin tone and dullness on my face. The wrinkles around my mouth seem less apparent which I really like. So far I'm really pleased with the results. If I have any complaint it's that my face itches for a few minutes after using the pads. Overall I'm happy with this product and recommend trying it to regain a youthful healthy glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love these peel pads! While I don't notice a visible difference in the tone of my skin, I do feel as though my skin is cleaner and softer after use. I've used these for several weeks in conjunction with the scrub, day moisturizer and night moisturizer. Overall, I love the whole line of products!

#GotitFree #L'Oreal I love the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. I use them after I wash my face with the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser at night. One side is a softer side and the other side is textured to help remove dead skin from your face. It helps brighten your face and exfolitates it. I have been using this for about a week and I do find that my skin is brighter and softer. It helps remove the remaining impurities left on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love these, I use them at night as they are almost gone! At first I was unsure because it reminded me of other face pads I used as a teenager. Would this be too strong? At first my face felt a bit tingly, that went away after a minute as my face dried. So easy to use. It removed any traces of makeup left after cleansing with the scrub. Next, I put on the overnight moisturizer and I was done! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The brightening pads provided some gentle exfoliation without overdrying my skin. If you are looking for medical grade chemical exfoliation this is not for you, but if you want to keep your T-zone oil at bay then this will work without leaving your skin cracked or peeling.

I wasn't able to use the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads because I have sensitive skin and after 1-use my skin was broke out. I actually shared with a friend to see how she liked them after not being able to use this product. I have overly sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love these peel pads. They get a lot of the extra dead skin off of your face to reveal brighter skin. I skipped one day of not using them and I could definitely feel the difference in my skin when I don't use them. I will definitely be using this product again.

"I loved these pads. They are thick enough to make you feel like you are really cleaning your face. My skin feels refreshed and clean after I use them. I have used them for an entire month and am sad to see my jar empty! They have a fresh, clean scent and are worth the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pads are thick and have enough product for entire face. I didn't experience any tingling or redness which I have in the past with other similar products. My skin was left glowing and looked refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These pads are amazing. You simply rub your face in a circular motion with them. It gets off all the little dirt that cleansers can't and all the dead skin. I've seen my skin brighten and my dark spots deminish in just a few short weeks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like how super clean my face feels when I use these pads on my face after I shower and clean my face. My skin tone looks even and it reduced a little the red spots I have on my cheeks. I will definitely continue to use these pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After washing with the Revitalift Bright Reveal scrub I use the brightening peel pads. These little things are amazing!! First they get rid of any makeup residue the scrub missed. Second, they help get rid of the dull dry skin! My skin feels so clean and looks so much younger since using these. I am in LOVE! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love the brighteing peel pads. I've been using them every evening before I go to bed in combination with the other Revitalift Bright Reveal products. After the first few days the area around my nose seemed dry but I continued to use the peel pads with the overnight cream and the dryness went away. I like the fact that the peel pads strop all of the bad stuff off my face and make me feel so clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I waited a few weeks before I posted a review of the product. Never have tried any of the L'Oreal Revitalift products. I started off trying these out daily at night as needed. Now I am using them everynight!! Love these!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cleansing pads left me feeling clean and fresh and did a great job cleaning dirt that was left from my cleansing routine. Although the cooling sensation was amazing, be extremely near your eye socket. Any wiping near the eye socket left me uncomfortable for an extended period of time that is the main reason I will not use again. The pain is not worth the fresh and clean feeling- especially when I was careful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used other brands of peel pads, but these, the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are the best ones I have found yet. I love how my skin looks after usdusding them. I would definitely recommend them to others and I will be purchasing more for myself! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love using these brightening peel pads to remove dirt and make up before applying the day or night time creams! Leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean, and moisturized! I love Revitalift! #gotitfree #bzzagent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I did like these after I used the scrub, but my only issue was that the pad aren't wet enough. I had to use 2 to 3 to cover my whole face. It becomes a bit pricey, when you have to use more than one at a time. They did clean my face though. Whatever residue was left over, I could see on the pad. That was a plus. But I do wish they had a little more solution on them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These might have been my favorite product in the line! It was a simple step to add in to my nighttime routine and i think it made a big difference! I even used on my hands and chest and I really noticed it smoothing both of those areas out, and that's the only thing I used on them! Will be adding these to my routine for sure!!

I received a package of Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads to try. The pads came in a 30 pack which is enough for a month since you use one daily. I love the ease of these you just pull one out and wipe across your face. There is a pleasant scent to these and they were non irritating to my skin. I did notice a difference to my face after using them but they are on the expensive side I don't know that I would buy them monthly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. I could grab a pad and do a quick swipe over my face to get rid of dead skin cells to reveal brighter skin for the next day. Easy to use, just open the jar and grab a pad and run it over your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
They cleaned my skin very well especially when you don't have time to waah your face. They didn't leave a nasty smell. Would recommend to anyone Definitely had to use moisturizer after did dry skin a little but still worth 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
these pads are fantastic. I use that before I go to bed at night and before I apply the night time moisturizer. they are very soft and just wet enough to take off all the make up and dirt from the day. they give my face a nice glow. they really do a great job of cleaning my face. I have never needed to use more than one to get the job done. I highly recommend the pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the pads after the daily scrub and it left my face really red. If i use them alone without the scrub its not that bad. They did remove some dirt even after I had used the scrub. Thats the only reason I gave this a 2star. In combination though they are too harsh for me. I probably wont even use the rest of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Out of this 4-part skin care system, this is the only part I truly did not like. The container feels a bit ""cheap"" to me, with the lid not being the easiest to tighten/untighten. The pads themselves are convenient to access once the container lid is off. My biggest problem was that they stung when I applied them to my skin. I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received all 5 pieces of the L'Oréal said this review is for the peel pads. I had never tried peel pads before and was always curious but a little skeptical. Wow after the first use of these peel pads my skin felt and looked amazing. What a difference I have shared some with many friends told many friends about this product it is a product I will definitely have on hand always! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've been using this product for a couple weeks now and the change in my skin is incredible! My husband even noticed....and he never notices anything. ;) I wear less foundation because my skin tone is SO even!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have always looked for a convenience product that would not only revitalize my face but make it so it wasn't such a task! I'm happy to report that these pads have met my needs and then some! Not only are they easy to use but they gave my skin beautiful results such as refreshing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great pads! I used these and thought my skin was clean when I used them after I washed my face but the pads came out dirty! I really feel like they are getting the dead skin cells off my skin and leaving my skin clean and soft. I love that you can use them daily too! I have noticed in the two weeks of using them that my skin has less breakouts and looks and feels cleaner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I really wanted to like this product...but didn't. I used it a few times but couldn't get past the sticky feel it left behind on my face. Also, I never felt that it cleaned my left over makeup left behind and my face seemed even oilier a couple of hours later. My astrigent (clinque brand) seemed like it did a better job of cleaning up any residual makeup without the stickness. I think it's a great concept but it fell short of my expectations.

"i loved the brightening pads the first night i used them. my skin felt great after my first, and even 2nd use. but as i continued to use the revitalift bright reveal collection i started to break out more and more. i don't know how to describe the scent in the products but there is a strong scent that i do not like. as soon as i stopped using these products i stopped breaking out.

I love Loreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. The peel pads are not irritating. I noticed smooth skin and tighter pores after the first use. The peel pads are textured on one side and smooth on the other side. There are 30 pads in the container.#igotitfree#bzzagent♥ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel pads! These are super easy to use - just gently wipe all over your face after cleaning. While I've only been using them for 2 weeks, I have noticed a difference in my skin tone and brightness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These peeling pads are amazing! I have tried several other brands even very expensive brands and these beat any of those. They remove dead skin with one pad. The pads are infused with Glycolic and are thick and durable. After using these about a week I can see the difference. My skin is brighter and smooth. This is a must in me from now on.

"I was really excited to try these, but they caused me to break out. I stopped using the peel pads until my skin cleared up and then started using them again (thinking maybe it was something else that cause the break out), but again my skin started breaking out.

"These Brightening Peel pads are great. I love the texture of the pad, the fragrance is nice, feels great on the skin and easy to use. The only thing I noticed is that it left a type of layer on my skin that was a little sticky. But, the end results were great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the peel pads! My skin feels so much healthier after each use. Doesn't leave any residue and easy to use. 1 side is textured like it is made to slough away old dry skin and the other side is soft and smoothing .

"The peel pads are used nightly after cleansing and before moisturizing. I have been using them for 30 days now, and after 2 weeks, I noticed an improvement in the appearance of my skin. My skin tone was much more even and less dull. Breakouts also diminished. The fragrance is also very pleasant. I have used the container that was provided to me in exchange for my fair and honest review, and I purchased another one. I will continue to use them.

"I think this wonderful product does a great job at not only removing any left over makeup and products on my face, but delivers a sufficient dose of Glycolic acid in one or two swipes and my skin feels so smooth and has a great glow! I love the different texture of the pads! I think everyone should give these a try, you will be so impressed with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have just got to acknowledge the fact that my skin looks healthier than ever with the help of LoReal Paris's new Peel pads. My skin is so bright and it looks like I am glowing. My teenager has been using these peel pads as well and her acne has gone away and her skin looks very healthy as well. This is my dream skin care product as it has improved both my daughter and my life for the better by giving us beautiful clear skin and has given my daughter a ton of confidence.

"I have to say, i didnt think it was possible to get nice hright even skin tone until i tried the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. Sonce th first use i noticed a feeling of smoother softer skin, immediately i noticed how much brighter my skin had gotten. I love that when used in the correct order my skin was ready and at its ultimate for absorption of the moisturizer to folow. I will xontinue to use the peel pads with my daily routine!

"I first washed my face with teh L'Oreal Revitalift face wash. I thought my face was clean, but apparently I was wrong. The L'Oreal pads took off more dirt and make-up afterwards. I am really looking forward to seeing the difference in 30 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how my face felt when I was using all of the Loreal products. I took them on a girls trip to the beach to share with the girls while we were there. We all loved the feeling after we used the products. We all agreed that we wished the gritty stuff came off easier though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As a BzzAgent I got to try L'Oréal l Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Peel Pads for Free! I absolutely love these pads. They aren't like the typical pads that are full of astringent which irritated my skin. These pads are great on my sensitive skin and takes away any left over dirt after using the scrub. Easy to purchase in most stores and great price point. Wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really loving the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Day Moisturizer with Broad Spectrum SPF 30. I have been using daily for the past three weeks.

"I think that the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel pads make my skin tighter and brighter. I don't think they clean as deeply as I would like them too. Maybe it is my age, because I am older. In the past everything I have used burned or hurt because that meant it was working. I have not had any breakouts and I am completely happy with the results so I guess you can teach a dog new tricks after all!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first, I was very skeptical of this product, but after trying it works so well! I think this is one of my favorite products, for your face, out right now. I give it a 5/5 because it worked so well for me, and I had my sister tried it, and she absolutely loved it too. Highly recommended. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I swapped out my Clinique Clarifying Lotion to use these peel pads. I was nervous that I might have a reaction, as I have sensitive skin, or that it'd be super drying. I think the drying part comes from them seeming like a Stridex pad (oh those lovely acne years). However, my skin felt great after. Plus the pad has enough texture to feel like it's cleaning up your pores. My skin has looked really nice and fresh, and I look forward to seeing even more positive changes. Yay!

I was pleasantly surprised by the Brightening Peel Pads! I have sensitive skin and I was afraid they might be too strong for my skin. I was happy that I was able to use them nightly. I wanted to be sure and use all the products for the best results and the pads helped with brightening up my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love how thick these pads are, when I first opened them, I pulled one out and I swore I had more than one and wasn't satisfied until I ripped it in half. They are a little rough but I figure that has to do with removing dead skin cells. I am not one to buy these type of cosmetic products but this line definitely has me convinced.

I highly recommend the entire line of L'Oréal of Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal. I swear it knocked years off of my face leaving me with a youthful glow! I especially loved the Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. After washing my face with the Bright Reveal face wash I used the pads. It would not only remove any excess makeup but firm and tone my skin. Erasing years from my skin. Come on ladies join me on the youthful side! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I absolutely love this line! My skin feels fabulous and a deep wrinkle that I had above my left eyebrow isn't as deep since I first started using this system! I don't use the pads every night, though, because they really dried out my face. I use them on my neck, too. Don't forget about your neck! I will definitely be purchasing the Revitalift system when I run out of what I received for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oréal Brightening reveal pads have a strong smell to them and they make my skin burn and tingle when I apply it. It left my skin feeling dry and itchy after each use. I really don't care for this product but, I love the other 3 I tried. It may be because I have dry sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product does brighten my skin but it also dries out my face something awful. I'm going to continue the product for the next two weeks and see what it does. Love the moisturizer though! #GotItForFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I used the peel pads after the scrub, it felt tingly, I was afraid at first cause my skin tends to be sensitive and redden easily. Thus was not the case with this product. Although I didn't find much need for the pads everyday or night. Good product I think if you wear heavy makeup products, if not this step could easily be skipped. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using these pads for a few weeks now along with the rest of the Lord all Revitalift Bright Reveal line of products. These pads feel as if you're scrubbing away dark spots and daily grime. This is the first line I've used where I can see daily improvement to my skin. At 44 years old I've done quite a bit of damage to my skin. Now I'm doing damage control with the help of Bright Reveal! Another great line by the trusted L'oreal brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far i am liking all of the products, i can really tell a difference since in starting using them. After using the facial scrub and then use the peel pads they took took off extra makeup that was still left behind. The pads gave me a slight tingling sensation and didn't leave my skin dry at all. I do feel the packaging for the pads is a little flimsy and cheep looking but all the other products packaging is great and looks great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is week 2 of using the line as a whole. I'm loving the brightening peel pads though. My skin looks even in only 2 weeks of use. I use 1 pad per day. it's not harsh on your skin and does not leave my skin feeling dry. smells great and picks up anything left behind from washing.

This has become my new skin care regime and I hope to continue to use with these wonderful results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for weeks, and I am sad that I ran out of them! I noticed that my skin was brighter after a few uses , and as a bonus, the pads also take off any makeup that you didn't get with your normal makeup removing regiment. I also had some blotchy patches on my right cheek that have gone away!! I plan on purchasing more of the pads, and including them in my skin care routine.

"I currently use a clarifying lotion after each time I wash my face. Didn't see a difference from what I currently use, love the clean feeling it gave. No irritation.

"I've been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for a few weeks now and the difference in my skin tone and clarity is really obvious.

"I like using these 'brightening peel pads'. So far they haven't brightened my skin, but I haven't been using them that long. I like how they really get my skin clean by removing any traces of makeup I may have missed with the cleanser, and they don't irritate my skin at all.

"So far I like the pads. They don't dry out my skin. I haven't noticed if they are making a difference yet. I don't use them in the morning because I don't know how sensitive it will make my skin to sunlight, even with spf moisturizer. I would purchase this product once my sample runs out. I talk to my mom about this product. And she is going to give the pads a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked these pads. Very convenient and liked the clean feel it left on my face. This also cut down on the time I spent on my face morning and night. I would definitely suggest this product to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since i m started using them just lived these pads. So soft and gentle to use. Its super easy to use. Cleanse, peel pads and moisturize day/ night. Clean your skin and gently apply un circular motion to face, avoid eyes. This product is good for wrinkles, dull and uneven tone of skin. Good for dark spots too. These pads resurface dead skin cells to reveal underlying, youth looking skin. Gives brightness and shime to skin. Leaves your skin glowy, smooth and soft.

"I have been using the Brightening Peel Pads and am amazed at the great job they do at illuminating my skin. I also use them on my neck and chest area as well. These areas of skin take a lot of harsh sunlight at times and are exposed to everyday dirt as much as your skin. Therefore, I always include these areas when I cleanse my face with the Glycolic cleanser and use the Peel pads. It is important to take care of that sensitive skin as well.

"Not sure if it's just my skin, but I discontinued this after a week of use as my skin started to break out from the use and cleared up after I stopped using the product. It did leave my skin soft and clean but I just may have an allergy to something in this product. I wanted to love it as much as the other products!

Love this product. While I received it free to review via Bzzagent I will continue to use this for the foreseeable future. Tone is drastically improved and my skin feels soft and amazing.

"I recently switched my glycolic peel pads with L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads and I love the results!

"I'm really loving the L'Oréal Peel pads so far. I use them as directed , so I first wash my face with the L'Oréal Daily Scrub then use the L'Oréal Peel Pads on a clean face.

Nice quality peel pads. Thicker than what I expected. First time when I used the pads I used it immediately after the Daily Scrub Cleanser so I felt little burning on my face. Now I wait about 5-10 minutes after using Daily Scrub Cleanser and then use peel pads. So far my skin is feeling smoother and looking healthier. I see a difference in my skin texture.

"I really love the peel pads. I was skeptical upon receiving them, because I tend to have sensitive skin. However, after using the scrub, I find the peel pads to be really refreshing.

I would definitely recommend these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
All I can say is that these #L'OréalBrightReveal peeling pads are amazing! They are everyday use pads that leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshing while whipping dead cells away! Wow!

I love these pads! Even if you use a good face wash often some dirt etc is left behind. Well after using these not only is my face super clean but it feels soft and does not dry out my skin.

"I need a break from the product line. I stopped using the pads nightly as my skin was starting to peel. Even though I wasn't using the pads, I was still using the wash and morning moisturizer. My skin feels dry and a bit sensitive to the product now. Looks and feels like I have small bumps on my face. I am aware the the glycolic acid can cause sensitivity.

I am 36 and my skin feels smoother, more refreshed and brighter than in my 20,s. in just 2 weeks I saw dramatic improvements. Loreal Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are and awesome product! #GOTITFORFREE [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only used these a few times and so far I am impressed. The dry patches on my forehead and cheeks are starting to go away. There was no burning or stinging with this product. It absorbed into the skin nicely with no offensive ""chemical"" smell and did not leave my skin feeling sticky or tight. I will keep using these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The brightening peeling pads make my skin feel amazing. I have pretty good skin, but I am a tanner. My skin gets dry and scaly. These pads have smoothed my skin and softened it. Its so pretty and soft. Impressed so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using these pads daily but had to stop cause it was burning my skin. I did like the way my skin looked more clear but after 2 weeks I was irritated and raw. Today I went to apply my foundation and my skin was actually peeling off. The skin under my eyebrows is super irritated and red. That part is peeling the worst and I didnt use the pads near my eyes so maybe I sweat at night and it ran down to my eyes. I have to stop using these. #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love this peel pad! It picks up all the nasty gunk you didn't get washed off your face, after using the cleanser. It's also great for when I am super tired, and don't feel like washing my face. Takes my make-up right off! A little bit of water to loosen the mascara and eye shadow, and BOOM! DONE! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an amazing product. I used this after I used the scrub cleanser. After using the brightening scrub I did notice the scrub was dirty, I like the fact that the scrub continues to cleanse my face. I'd say it picked up where the cleansing wash left off. I have noticed brighter skin and it feels much fresh and cleaner after I use this scrub. This is a must to use after you wash your face with the daily scrub cleanse. You will notice a difference.

This L'Oréal Brightening Peel Pads is the second step in the 3 step skincare regimen. The pads are easy to use with a swipe of your hand all over your face in crevices and grooves is all it takes. The pad leaves your face with a refreshing tingle of cleanliness. My face feels the cleanest after this step. If I didn't have time for any other step I would be comfortabe with just this step.

"I'm over a week in to my 30 day challenge and my skin is looking younger and better than ever! I can't wait to see the final results and it turns out the challenge ends just in time for my 37th Birthday. The brightening peel pads were really great when my skin got a little wacky with "" that time of the month"" and the cleansers and creams kept my face looking smooth and bright. I'm in love with this daily regiment . #GotItFree #BuzzAgent #LorealParisRevitalift [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a little worried about using these as I have sensitive skin. I use them every other day as they were making my skin a little irritated. They do not dry my skin out like most types of these pads. I have noticed that my skin is brighter and smoother. Overall I am very satisfied with these. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads and I was amazed at the amount to dirt that was on my skin at the end of the day!!!! I am excited to see if it removes any dry dead skin I have in the next 30 days!!! It left my skin feeling slightly tingling but also looking fresh and clean! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think L'Oréal peel pads are perfect with the face wash and moisturizer. I've been using for a few weeks now and really like how clean, soft and bright my skin is looking. I use all three products daily and so far love the results. I will add ohitos once my 30days is up. Easy to use, smells great and skin looks even better [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried these out every other day for a week and they were way to harsh on my delicate skin. Normally my skin isnt delicate , but for these pads it was. My skin began to peel. I no that it needs to happen but it made my face feel like crocodile skin. I caution those using these to proceed with caution. Find a very good moisturizer to use after. On the plus, they smell really good, they are soft against the skin and very easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These peel pads are great. They get the dirt and oil off that was left behind after cleansing your face. They leave your skin feeling clean and tingly. They even make your skin look less dull. I recommend them to all my friends. Thank you Loreal Paris and BzzAgent! #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loreal's brightening peel pads were quite the experience! At first, I was scared to even try them, but I did...and let me tell you, my skin thanked me! I truly felt like years of old and dead skin was lifted away! Amazing! I did experience a bit of skin sensitivity, but it was short lived. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the Revitalift Brightening Peel Pads because they're not only super easy to use, they give my skin a beautiful, healthy glow. I find that I'm using my BB cream less because I don't want to cover up my glow. Thanks L'Oreal!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Used the wipes for almost three weeks now and have developed blisters around the outside my lips. Initially I thought I was getting chapped lips due to the weather changes,but then I noticed actually blisters. The L'Oréal products are the only part of my regimen that I changed. I noticed a tingling after using the pads and I should have listened to my body. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used all four products since last Tuesday! I have found the peel pads has dried my nose out! I have stopped using the peel pads daily and will only use those once a week! With that being said that is why I only gave the peel pads a score of two! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using these for a week I noticed that my skin is a bit raw. The first 2 days I noticed my skin looked much better. Not sure why but my eyes looked brighter and my overall skin just looked better. But by the end of the week the evenly toned skin was just a distant memory. Maybe I cant use them daily. Maybe i'll use them every other day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never really use toners or anything other than just wash my face and apply a moisturizer. My skin is very dry so I was a little afraid to try these, but now that I did, I can say that I really like them. I am only using them every other day and I can see my skin looking brighter. These definitely clean out your pores very well and its a great step before moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm very impressed with my results, I have noticed my skin more bright and smooth. Pores less noticeable. These peel pads are a great . The texture is very good and durable. The scent of the product used on the pads is a bit strong but by the second time I was used to it, I did see a little irritation in the eye area the first few days but that cleared up quickly. Overall it works really good. I'm using the entire collection and loving the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pretty sure I'm in love with these L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads! #gotitfree from @BzzAgent @L'OréalParis. After using the scrub, I use just 1 of these conveniently packaged peel pads, give my face a once over and I can't believe how clean and smooth my face feels afterwards. My skin looks much smoother and brighter that it did prior to using this product! Total keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had been a little hesitant at first to use the pads after using the exfoliating cleanser. I felt that the pad would be a little too harsh for my skin after using the grainy cleanser. That was not the case at all. The pad is lightly textured on one side and there was no burning or stinging sensation at all when I applied it to my face. These pads have been a welcomed addition to my nightly cleansing routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is a bit sticky and feels like it leaves a little residue on my face after, but whatever it does it is working. Never has my skin looked so refreshed as it does after using this entire kit. Perfect timing to erase all the damage and dry/dead skin my face endured after a long, hot summer. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the smell and texture of the peel pads, but they leave a residue behind that leaves me feeling sticky. I like that they clean my skin a second time after the cleanser, but if I don't use the night moisturizer too (I don't on my neck but use the cleanser and peel on my neck), it feels sticky. I actually tried the whole system together. I didn't break out or notice too much oil or dryness. Unfortunately, I didn't notice a lot of brightening or change either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Brightening Peel Pads are great for the extra exfoliating we look for and want as our skin ages. They help cleanse away any remaining dirt and oils leaving skin ripe for moisture. I like how they make my skin feel fresh too! It amazes me how much extra 'dirt' they remove even though I just finished cleaning my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I feel in love with the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. I love how clean my skin feels after using them. I have seen a big difference in the brightness of my skin as well as dark spots are fading. I feel that the Peel Pads remove any excess dirt and makeup that weren't removed with cleansing. Love the Peel Pads! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the new L'Oreal revitalized bright reveal bringing peel pads are awesome first they felt a little strange on my face but I love how it lifts all the dirt and grime from my skin it does not leave A tight or uncomfortable feeling like some other peel pads doare use these every morning and night after the daily scrub I'm very pleasantly surprise on the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love the peel pads!! They are awesome. I use them at night after I wash my face and the in afterwards I use the night dual moisturizer. The peel pads also help remove any dirt I may have missed when washing my face. They really help with brightening my skin up!! I definitely recommend these to anyone wanting brighter skin!! They also help with fine lines!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oréal Revitalize Bright nine Peel Pads OMG, I love these. This is the night time Cleansing step, these pads are easy to use and they work Great. I wipe my face and these pads grab all the dirt and grim off my face. My face feels so clean and refreshed . This is my favorite cleansing pad I have ever tried! #GotItFree #Bzz [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just love the Loreal Brightening Pads! After a long day at work, I come home , take off my makeup, and apply these in a circular motion. Your skin instantly feels refreshed and clean! It also helps your moisturizer absorb better. Such a great way to end your night!!! Love this product!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved the fact that there are 30 pads in the package to help in counting down the ""30-day"" challenge. I like that the pads also help remove any excess make up (avoid eyes) left after washing the face. It also helps prep for the overnight moisturizer, too. I can also tell that having this product in conjunction with the rest of the skincare regimen contributes towards ""brightening"" the skin and ""lightening"" the fine lines.

"I LOVE the L'Oréal bright reveal peel pads. I was hesitant to try them because my skin is very sensitive, but they are not harsh at all. Actually, they make my skin feel renewed. I think my face looks brighter and younger. These pads are fantastic!! #itwasfree #bzzagent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the brighten peels as my nightly bed tone routine. I told my friends one night as our weekly girls night. I took them out to wipe my face I told them it has Glycolic Acid, Pro-Retinol® and Vitamin C, it helps to even out skin texture and skin tone. It makes my face feel alive you can not help but notice how your skin glows. The more you use it younger your skin looks and feels. Neithless to say they all wanted to try my new find. This product was a big hit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use these every night before bed for 2 weeks now. I am surprised at how much dirt they remove. My face feels great afterwards. I may continue to use them after my sample is done. I recommend them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was worried about the Loreal Brightening Peel Pads!! With Halloween and a zombie 5 k run meant tons of makeup, sweat and open pores!! Not a good combination!!! I did not think the Loreal line would work! I followed the instructions and when I got out of shower could STILL see make up!! I used the peel pads and to my surprise it took off everything !!! Leaving me with clean,soft non breakout skin!!. Next morning, I am very very happy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Purposeful product with clear results. After each use morning and evening, my skin is left feeling deeply cleansed without the stripped feeling. No harsh sting that most cleansing pads have. Any left behind product/dirt left behind after cleansing is removed. A perfect prep for the next step in the cleansing routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads are amazing. They dont burn or sting your sting like the ones you ised in highschool yet get off the residue left behind. Theres not too many pads on the market for adults either to strong or just blah definitely keeping these in my rotation [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was thrilled to be asked to participate in the revitalift bright reveal campaign mainly because of the glycolic peel pads. I used to use another more expensive brand but stopped because of the cost. These are just as good as those but at a more affordable cost. They are gentle and leave my skin glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's only been a few days since I started using these products, but I am liking them so far. I love the slight orange fragrance. The pads not only provide my skin with glycolic acid but the texture removes any trace of makeup that I missed in cleansing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These pads are well saturated with the Revitalift Bright Reveal potion. One side seems a bit more textured then the other, which could increase the amount of exfoliation. There is a floral-citrus type scent to the product. The pads seem to be helping my skin look and feel healthier, along with aiding in the evening of my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this product only 1 night so far, but plan on submitting several updates regarding it. I was a little concerned that I would experience redness and or peeling from the peel pads due to the high level of glycolic acid, but so far it has been smooth sailing. It went on easily! I really do enjoy the simplicity of it being in a 1 time use pad. It really cuts down the time of my evening face care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was at first not to sure if to use since I have use other brand and it had peel and burn my skin but with this L'Oreal brightening peel pads I didnt have that problem. Clean my face and left it hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does have an alcohol scent but it's lighter than most and doesn't linger. I like that a lot! I could see a big difference after using this product in just a day. My skin is so much brighter. I feel as if it glows! I'm so pleased 18th this product and the entire line. I will continue to use them.

"I love the Loreal Brightening peel pads. They really have improved my skin tone and helped fade discoloration on my cheeks. They are gentle even on sensitive skin. They have glycolic acid in them to help brighten the skin. The pads have a slight alcohol smell, but not overpowering. I have been using the brightening pads every night for a few weeks and they are my new favorite brightening product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"It is amazing! 'My skin is brighter and so soft! My dull, tired, little time for me mom face now glows. The old acne scars are fading. My skin is very sensitive and this did not give me a painful dry or burning skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was super excited to try the entire line of this brightening system but after doing it for about a week the pads seem to be irritating my skin. My skin burns after I use them and this morning when I woke up I had like little whiteheads all over my face and they're kind of painful. I hope they go away kind of like what happens when you get a facial. Fingers crossed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The peel pads are great. They perform sort of a finishing to the cleansing routine. I am not sure they are any different from other face cleansing pads I have used, however. The pads are soft and large. I could see the dirt that didn't come off during cleansing...which shocked me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm liking this product. I will get this product again and tell my friends too. It is not oily, I did not break out, but my skin is smooth and soft to touch. Very nice to use at the end of the day to just wipe it all away. This is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is sensitive so this is not an everyday thing for me...more like once a week. Was a tad too tingly and a little irritating since it has a decent amount of glycolic acid but my skin was a bit smoother in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The pads definitely cleanse the skin of deeper grime, but for people with sensitive skin like mine, hey can not be used everyday. My skin is red from using them too often even with a cream or oil applied afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I liked these pads. They weren't too harsh and seemed to really prep my skin for the next product. Light scent that wasn't medicinal. I didn't notice any lightening of dark spots, but my skin did appear brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the L'oreal Reveal brightening Peel Pads- they did not dry my skin and it left my face feeling bright and new! The first couple uses my skin felt clean and healthy, but not too tight- I am hoping that the slight discolorations on my cheek will fade over the next few weeks of use, as well.

I think this product is great for people who do not have sensitive skin. It burned after I used it and it made my entire face red for hours. I would't purchase this product and would advise fair skinned people to leave it alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product idea is solid. The formula is a bit strong and I felt a light stinging on my face using these. I'm going to continue to use them through the next 30 days unless I have an adverse reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do have slightly sensitive fair skin, but not a lot is reactive or makes me think of it as overly sensitive. I think I can use the peel pads 1-2 times a week, but not nightly. It left my skin red (even use with the bright reveal dual overnight moisturizer). I'm not giving up yet on the peel pads and so pleased with the other bright reveal products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised to see the pads weren't thin and flimsy. They also have a nice texture that actually leaves a clean feeling. The only con is the alcohol smell. It doesn't linger long but still present for a bit. Still a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think these Peel pads are awesome i have been using it since few days at night. Pro: when i clean my face i see dust particles on pads seems like it cleans very deep and help remove dust that goes inside pores. In morning when i wash my face I feels shiny and soft skin. Con: only that pads smells light alcohol and can be use only for face. Overall I give it 4 stars to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like using the cleansing pads after the scrub. My skin feels extra clean and shiny. I can see a bit of dirt on the pad. My skin feels a little tighter as well. I love the fresh scent with a hint of lemon. The pads are thick, I thought I took out two the first time I used one. I will definitely purchase these in the future.

This brightening pads are great!! They do not have a strong scent and feel fresh on the touch of your skin . The pads are pretty thick and moist.

These are great for exfoliating and cleansing your face. It leaves the skin feeling fresh and makeup free. I also love that it doesn't leave the skin feeling dried out.

"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads were a little harsh for my sensitive skin. I found the alcohol in them to be very strong and drying. They did clean very well. But, at quite a cost to my skin. I had my husband try them and he found them harsh as well. I could not recommend this product to someone who has sensitive skin. It is a very strong product.

"This was something new to add to my routine never used pads before an after I cleanse I love using the peel pads makes a cool sensation an I feel so fresh an clean, tingled a little first time but now it is one of my favorite steps really thought I just needed one cream but now with these easy 4 step products it is simple an my tone , wrinkles an skin feel an look great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I have been using the Revitalift moisturizers for daytime and evening and the Peel Pads. I have a lot of marks on my skin from picking at acne, especially around my chin. I have only used the Peel Pads a few times, but they do not leave my skin feeling scratchy or burning like some other products do. I'll keep you posted to see if it erases some of those stubborn acne marks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"These pads are good but soon after I apply them, my face burns. They feel okay going on my skin but then I get this burning sensation that I don't like. It might be that my face is so sensitive but I am not completely sure. If you are not sensitive, I would recommend it but If you are like me, I would have to pass.

When I used these peels on my face I noticed that my skin was tingling and that it was a good feeling that just to know that i was taking care of my face with this Brightening Peels.

"First time user of Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel pads. I can definitely say I give these a thumbs up. After using the Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser, I break out these wonderful pads and watch them work magic. Not only do the take the dullness away they also help with uneven skin tones. A lovely feeling of refreshed and revitalized so try it today. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This review is for the L'Oréal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. These little pads are great! I use one after washing my face with the L'Oréal Revitalift scrub.

"After using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser, I swiped one pad all over my face starting from forehead to cheeks to chin. Wow! I've seen some dark residue on the pad. So, you think you're face is clean after a wash and a scrub, think again! I love the textured side of the pad. Felt it was going into my skin deeper than the smooth side of pad. This is day one can't wait to see the results of 30 day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think this product is wonderful! I have bought the Brightening Peel Pads and Overnight Moisturizer myself a month ago and I have been wanting to try the cleanser and the day moisturizer because I loved this product so much. I am so glad I got selected for the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal campaign, and now have the chance to use all the product in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These Brightening pads are working well for me. I love that they are oversized. Some other face pads are half the size, which makes them difficult to manuever over your face and neck. These larger pads make covering the entire face quicker and more efficient. My face feels revitalized and refreshed after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Peel pads for a few days. I do see a difference already with fine lines. BUT, be careful around your lips. I have noticed that the Peel pads are drying out the skin around my lips. I have to use extra Revitalift Bright Reveal moisturizer. The L'Oteal Revitalift Bright Reveal peel pads are still amazing and are working well! @L'Oreal #Revitalift [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The pads made my skin burn right off the bat. After 3 tries, I am done and my dermatologist agrees. My face was becoming so irritated that I couldn't hide the red under concealer and foundation. My skin has never reacted this way to any product before this whole skincare line. If your skin is even a little bit sensitive, I wouldn't go for this product or line.

Just received my box and try the pads. Feels sparkling clean. So happy. Days to beautiful skin. I keep getting black heads. Since using already just couple days it feels my skin softer and black heads are disappearing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My first experience with the peel pads was pretty good. It didn't burn too much and made it obvious that it was removing the last of the makeup and dirt from my skin. The only thing I noticed was that my skin did flush for a minute after the wipe. It didn't last long enough to make me second think trying again tonight.

"This is my favorite product in the Bright Reveal family. These little cotton rounds are soaked with magic, no really I swear. Quick and easy and they leave my face smooth, bright and feeling moist.

"Revitalift bright reveal brightening peel pads are great. They are soft for your skin, I have sensitive skin and I didn't feel any discomfort using them. I love how my skin looks immediately after my first use. Is visible brighter and softer and most important helps you in only one week for fine lines and wrinkles appear visibly smoother. In two weeks skin tone is visibly more even, texture is refined. Skin looks younger and rejuvenated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I'm really starting to notice a difference in the texture of my skin. I think it feels smoother and my makeup seems to be blending better. I think each product is good separately, but using them altogether? ?!! AWESOME! I would like to thank Bzzagent.com and L'Oréal for letting me try these products and spreading the word to friendsand family! ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently used these pads prior to receiving my free products to try. The pads are amazing, I am anxious to use these with the complete set. These pads do exactly what this box says, the thing I noticed and appreciate the most is how it help my uneven skin tone and even helps reduce pores! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These peel pads are a follow up to the night cleansing, and before the moisturizer. They have a nice textured surface, that makes you feel like they are actually working! My face feels refreshed after using these, and I am convinced I can already tell a difference (after 3 days!) I will continue using these products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I swear I could feel this stuff working the second I began to use the product. I used after doing the cleanser at night. My face felt a little warm after but nothing that was too much. I hope to see more results as I use them more and more, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I'm not a HUGE fan of the day moisturizer so far but I tried the scrub wash and the pads and have to say I LOVE them. They both feel like they are working instantly. I feel a tightness and super clean feeling after using them and love the thickness of the pads especially. It makes me feel like I can really get in there and get the good stuff where it needs to go. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far, I am in great love of this product. I normally am not strict on my skin care regime. But, I did with this and I'm so happy I did. I will continue to use it and i patiently await the long term results. Go to bzzagent.com and sign up, you won't regret it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using these products (wash, pads and night cream) for about 4 days but I already notice a difference (actually I noticed it after using then first night). My skin seems more hydrated and feel softer. I'll review again when the product runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Never understimate the power of peeling pads! I feel rejuvenated already! I live in a very hot weather, so my skin is always saturated, this will help you to remove dead cells and prepare your skin with your ritual before using your overnight mosturizer. You will notice the difference when you wake up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I admit I was a bit skeptical about using this part of the product line. I was worried about the peel part of the title. After using the pads one time I noticed a difference in my skin. It was fresh and beautiful looking. I thought it would be like using Oxy Pads like when I was a kid. To my happy surprise NOTHING like that at all! It glided across my face with not burning or stinging, it didn't leave my face red an irritated. This is a product I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This pad reminds me of the stridex pads I used as a kid without the burn! It leaves my face soft and not dried out. I also feel like it was very gentle on my sensitive skin. It also got off any trace of excess makeup that I didn't get off with the wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is absolutely amazing it deep cleaned and got off all makeup and dirt and with its wonderful scent did everything it was supposed to do, after cleaning it left my face very soft. Thanks for this opportunity L'Oréal and bzzagent. I would recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been trying these products for 4 days now and I can't get enough of how clean my face looks. The combination of the Brighthening daily scrub and the pads is amazing. I notice, specially on my nose, how clean my pores look!!! I follow the instructions religiously and I can say that I am very happy on how clean and radiant my face looks in 4 days using L'Oréal Revitalif products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try this product as the whole line sounds like it offers great anti-aging and skin-reviving benefits. Unfortunately, my sensitive skin flared up right away. I gave it a few uses, though, just to be sure, but my skin became dry, itchy, irritated, and red. I am sure that this product has some great beautifying effects, but it is not ideal for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received my products and I have already loved L'oreal so I am really excited to try everything. So far, I have used the brightening peel pads which are so refreshing. The pad is cooling to the skin and so easy to use, my skin is fresh and bright and I know the longer I use them the better my skin will be. Can't wait to try everything and report on it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the peel pads are great! I love how much it exfoliates and how well you feel it deep cleaning your face. I like the clean tingly sensation I get after using these which gives me that clean feeling. It actually feels like it completely cleans the deep hidden dirt that I can not see from my face. I definitely recommend this product because it does feel like it gives you a deep clean and I love the clean cooling feeling after! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product itself works great. I use a toner and will continue to do so. I'm glad I was able to try the pads along with the entire line. The line as a whole is spectacular! I just wouldn't use these pads on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works well - it is quite strong. If you aren't used to an exfoliating pad with these medications, expect to see redness, peeling and breakouts for a couple of weeks while your skin adjusts to this product. When I started using it, I got several breakouts of cystic acne, but it seems to be settling down now (after a couple of weeks). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Makes skin feel newer and cleaner. Doesn't dry skin up and has a pleasant scent as well. Thanks again for the chance to try this out!! The pads are soft but get down into the pores.Skin feels bright and youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These peel pads actually do what they say. My skin was brighter and firmer from the first use. Not many products can deliver that. When used with the rest of the skin care regimen, these take dull, tired looking skin and make it more smoother and makeup looks fresher and stays on longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am impressed with these pads so far. I have tried other glycolic pads that have irritated and burned my skin. These feel gentle and I like knowing there's direct delivery of active ingredients to my skin. I can't wait to see my results after one month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel like this is a step I can skip. I've used them for a week and I just don't feel like they do anything. I will continue to use them daily, until they are gone, but I don't know if I would purchase them. Maybe, I need to give it more time......we shall see! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that the pads have a little bit of texture. It seems like I get rid of more dirt. When I wake up in the morning, my face feels oily. I don't know if it's the combination of all of the products or just one. I'm going to use them separately for a few days to see which one is causing this. They feel luxurious but I just don't like the oily feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Revotalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are gentle to my skin. Even after cleaning my skin I still see dirt on the pad. That is a great thing for me because I like to see that the product is working. Before purchasing this product or any other product I like to know what others thought about it and if the product works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this for about a week now. I use it nightly and have seen positive results. I wash my face and use witch hazel before the pads and somehow these pads find makeup on my face that was left over from the first two steps. Thats crazy! It makes my face feel extra clean and my dark spots are fading fast. I will keep this routine up for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'OREAL Paris products for two weeks now...only to realize i was using the brightening pads wrong. Lol I was using them morning and night instead of just at night. Since i started using them only at night, my skin has looked and felt AMAZING! This may be a product that i continue using even after my #FREE product is gone!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Peel Pads clear off excess makeup that soap leaves behind. I have noticed my skin is smoother. I'm also thrilled that it does not burn and are not drying like a lot of these products can be. Love them! I received this product to review but all opinions are my own and based on my own experience. @LOrealParisUSA, #BrightReveal and #GotItFree. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These are truly great brightening pads! L'Oréal did a great job as always, but these pads really do a great job with taking my makeup off and making my skin feel clean and great! My skin also looks great! This is definitely a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I FIRST started and a week and a half later I can see the difference. After washing , I then use the pads and you can see it taking off left over dirt, makeup, dead skin. I would recommend this product to every check it out! L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads #gotitfree #BzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried so many different things for my face and no of them have helped or worked. I received Revitalift Bridget Reveal Brightening Peel Pads to try for free and decided it was worth trying. Well what I can tell you is YES!! They worked!! This will in fact be a daily routine for me now. I wish I would have taken before and after to show the difference. My skin is so much more brighter now. I feel so refreshed after using them too. Will be buying some more this week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are a true Godsend. They help swipe away the dead skin cells with just a few swipes on your face. My face is already looking brighter & feels so, so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this revitalift from Loreal Paris is absolutely wonderful. I have been using for almost 2 weeks. I look brighter and firmer. I look younger than I did almost 2 weeks ago. You must try this skin care system. It feels good. It's easy to use. It works... #loverevitaliftlorealparis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first used the brightening peel pads, I couldnt believe how much had been removed from my face onto the pads! And mind you this was after I cleansed my face. Using this just made my face feel extra cleaner and brighter! Resurfacing dull and uneven skin, it is definitely noticeable that this product does what it says along with using the products from the revitalift bright reveal collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I will continue to use this product once I have run out. I am so satisfied with the whole regimen! The brightening pads I use on my face at night and each morning have woke up to glowing more youthful skin. My skin tone is beginning to even out even my husband has noticed! I like the way they make my skin feel and I like that they are not harsh on my skin. Overall a fantastic product ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The only reason I am not giving five stars is because of the smell. They worked really well at exfoliating my skin without irritating or scratching. Did not leave a sticky residue. Will continue using them for the 30 days to see how the perform. Packaging is kinda flimsy though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am at theend of my first week of the L'Oreal Paris Bright Reveal challenge and I am hooked! These Bright Reveal Daily Peel Pads are great. They gently remove dead skin and impurities and leave my face refreshed and smooth. In just seven days I can see a more even tone and my skin feels great. I can't wait to see what the next three weeks can do! #BzzAgent #L'Oreal Paris USA #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have now used the bright reveal peel pads several times. I am torn with this product. While I like the idea of a deeper clean and the exfoliating effect, I am not thrilled with the way it leaves my skin feeling. I felt that these pads were a little too tuff on my facial skin, I prefer a gentler pad and cleansing. I would recommend these to people with oily skin but someone with dryer skin may not like these. They left my skin feeling dry and in desperate need of hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving the softness and tone of my skin after using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads. This product is improving the look of my lines and poors. I will definitely continue this regimen. #gotitfree #bzzagent #L'Oréal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got my products , so I stoped using the other ones and decided to,try L'Loreal Revitalive the pads really clean you face so well after you feel so fresh and your face is so clean and soft I will definite use this product from now on it is so great. must try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for a few days, but I already can see a difference in my skin. My skin looks smoother and the tone looks so much better. I tend to get a bit of redness on my cheeks and forehead and these pads are great for combating it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm introducing each product of the L'Oréal Revitalift line slowly into my skin care regimen. I'm doing this so I'm able to see what is making a difference. The brightening peel pads are making an amazing difference in my skin tone, brighter skin and some wrinkle reduction. It's amazing to see what is actually left on your skin after washing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using the Brightening Peel Pads a week ago and right away, my skin felt smoother and looks brighter. The pads are largeer than most and they have just the right amount of solution on them. They're not dry and they're not overly saturated. This means I can cover my entire face & neck without getting another pad. I'll never stop using these miracle pads... :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. The pads are a nice size, easy to glide them across your face, no fuzz left behind. As far as the solution great no stinging or any burning. Does give you a clean, bright glow after use. I find them mild enough for daily use. Definitely, will repurchase and include in my daily skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical of these Brightening Peel Pads after I received them. Once I decided to try them I was impressed with how clean and fresh feeling my face was. My face was so clean it was shining! Loved the way the pads left my skin. I have been using the Peeling Pads every other evening after showering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love these products! Easy to understand the directions. Very nice to have the entire product line and my face feels amazing since I started using these products. Will post before and after photos! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
loved it and will definitely be buying again when I run out for me and my husband to use because he liked it as much as i do. thanks BzzAgent for the chance to try out this product and the others that came with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What a great, easy way to renew and refresh skin. This is easier to use than facial cleansing cloths and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean. The exfoliation is an added benefit and will make your skin glow. This is quite an impressive product and has brightened my skin with less than a week's use. Nice job, L'Oreal. #BzzAgent #freetrial [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the pads. They remove all buildup on my face. I used the entire line of products and I absolutely love them. I am going to my local retailer abs look for the products before I run out. #BrightReveal #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the resurfacing feeling of the peel pads. I feel like there is a fresh new layer of skin after I use them. They don't burn or irritate my skin. My skin does feel a little tacky or sticky after i use them, which I don't like. that could be because I have oily skin. I feel like the old skin cells have been swept away. My skin does look more youthful and brighter after using them for almost a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I first used the facial scrub and then used the glycolic acid wipes. I was surprised when it didn't dry out my skin. On day two I did notice some redness and tingling but not enough to stop using them. After this first week I'm excited to see what next week will look like!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These pads are very nice...I like the fact that you don't have to waste product on a cotton ball and love the glycolic acid. Just wish they would have left out the alcohol which can dry and irritate sensitive skin. Maybe gradually increase usage to make sure your skin can tolerate it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I could not wait to try these literal products I have been sick but used the peel pads and night moisturizer everyday and I think my skin is looking better.I have uneven skin tone and have tried everything so I'm hoping this will work..to be continued thanks buzz agent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The pads exfoliated my dull dry skin and gave it a smooth youthful look to also feel silky and fresh and all impurities removed. It did burn a little bit at first but was highly effective and would recommend to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love these pads, after using the scrub you simply wipe over your face with one of these pads. Your skin feels amazing after using it. And to top it off with the night time moisturizer you go to bed with you skin feeling amazing! So soft, and even the next morning my skin still felt great. Can't wait to see results after a month of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I wasn't too sure about trying this product. I have sensitive skin and I can't use a lot of skin care masks for that reason. I took the plunge and used the pads every night for 5 days and NEVER had any reaction!! My skin had a slight dullness too it and now I can tell it is brightening. I am pleased with the pads, especially since I can actually use them!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using these and was a little skeptical but after just the first use my skin feels great. It feels clean and fresh and even looks a bit brighter. They removed dead skin without being too harsh. I was amazed at how much dirt was in the pad even after cleaning me face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the Peel Pads. They are so easy to separate and use. I love the fact it shows what makeup was not removed while washing. I love how it exfoliates the dead skin cells to give me a brighter complexion. I will continue to use these! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These brightening peel pads by L'Oréal have made a great difference in my skin. I have talked to family and friends about this recitalist line by L'Oréal and they are amazed by the difference in my skin. They are wanting to try it out to see if they get the same great results! My skin feels great! Thank you L'ORÉAL! Thank you Bzz Agent! My husband thanks you too because now he has a more youthful looking wife! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the brightening peel pads followed by the dual overnight moisturizer for a week now. I was a bit hesitant to try this product at first because I have very sensitive skin but I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. It is not harsh on my skin and I already see a difference. My skin feels so clean and smooth. It looks brighter and more evenly toned. I definitely recommend this product and I will continue using it as a daily regimen.

I absolutely love Loreal Paris Revitalift. My face feels smooth. It feels like my wrinkles are finer. My face feels brighter. I love the smell all the revitalift products. The cleanser has little beads in it. The day cream feels light and not greasy. The night Cream feels good too. Not oily when I wake up. The peel pads I love too. I'm very happy with the results. #lorealparis revitalift #bzzAgentigotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the peel pads are so easy to use if you are looking to keep your skin clean and healthy. There is an instant glow immediately after you use them. I also love how firm my skin feels especially after using the scrub. You will not regret doing the 30 day challenge because the peel pads will instantly make your skin feel fresher! I love that they can be used at any time of the day. I wish more makeup companies made peel pads like these! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the Brightening Peel Pads for the past few days. My skin feels clean and soft. Directly after usage my skin feels a little tight but it is soft and smooth after I moisturize. I would definitely use this product all summer but probably not in the cold New England winters. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used the Peel Pads in the morning to remove dirt and grime from the night. It wakes and revitalizes my tired skin. It seems to exfoliate removing the dull skin revealing a fresh, bright face. In addition, my skin tone seems to be evening out. Used with the other products in this line, my skin is improving each and every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used other glycolic peeling pads, but the liquid always ran down my hands, and the pads felt flimsy. These are solid, think pads, and aren't over-saturated - they have *just* the right amount of liquid. They aren't totally smooth - so I'd say there's a tiny amount of physical exfoliation going on - but the glycolic acid is doing 95% of the work, IMO. And so far - it is definitely working! My skin is far less dull since using these. I would recommend for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these bright reveal peel pads.I have been using them for 8 days.I have noticed a small difference in my skin, it feels smoother and appears brighter.I am looking forward to seeing how my skin looks and feel after using it longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Brightening peel pads are big enough and very moist, which is great. After you done the face feels a little sticky, but not for long. It doesn't burn. Maybe a little sensation here and there, but overall is pleasant. I love that you don't get to wash it off your face, meaning the product needs to stay on to do it's magic, but not harsh enough so must be washed off. Can't wait to see the results after a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel the peel pads have evened skin tone after about a week of use. Very refreshing to use. Does not feel harsh and does not have a strong chemical smell. I have been using at night before bed and then use the brightening dual overnight moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm only on Day 3 of the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Skin Care regime, but I am absolutely sold on it already! My skin feels smoother than it has in years and I can't help but keep telling people about it! I'm excited to see what my skin will look like on day 30! The Peel pads have a nice smell to them and just a slight tingly feeling when you're using them. My only complaint about the pads is that they shed a little while you're using them, but other than that, they really do work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the Loreal Reveal Brightening Peel Pads worked really well with my skin. They were so easy to use and I immediately felt a difference in my skin.

Love how fresh and clean my face felt, I will definitely be using these peel pads more often and add them into my skin cleansing routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Light fresh scent (kind of citrusy). Easy to use! No goopy mask and no need to rinse. This goes on smoothly, and the glow comes through instantly. Skin will feel smooth by morning as dead skin is gone. No irritation for sensitive skin. Will purplchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited for my first buzz campaign. I am extremely happy with the revitalift peel pads and moisturizer. I thought my skin was just fine until I tried revitalift.

"I used the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads after using the Revitalift Scrub Cleanser, as recommended.

The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads used at night after cleaning my face with the Revitalift Scrub are a great second step in my new face care ritual. The first night I used the peel pad I was amazed at how much dirt was on the pad after I used it. It has made such a difference in the way my skin feels. My face is so soft and is much tighter. My face looks and feels twenty years younger!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Day one of 30 L'Oréal revitalift challenge from bzzagent. I tried the peel pads and day moisturizer with spf. Felt like the pads were doing something it tingled and slightly burned but didn't hurt..then added the moisture..don't need much..can't wait to see how it works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Using the loreal bright reveal peel pads I found not only did they have a Overbearing alcohol smell but they made my face burn. Like many others I have sensitive skin, so I am picky about what I use on my face. I will not be using this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face is oily but sensitive around the nose area. When I used the pads it didn't sting at all but it felt clean. I feel like in combination with all the products it should work and lighten up my blemishes. I'm excited to see the final results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not a regular L'Oreal product user. I liked all the other samples (scrub, overnight moisturizer & day moisturizer), but I'm not sure about the pads. After use, it'd make my skin itchy & stinging. I have very sensitive skin so that could be why I'm impartial. On be plus side, the scent is really appealing. I've only used the product for a couple days so I'm going to give it a try a little bit longer. But from what I've used so far I'm on the fence if I'd buy regularly.

"The daily scrub cleanser it sheds the dead skin cells it has micro pearls and glycolic acid to improve skin tone revealing brighter radiant skin.

"I work in the sun alot, due to that I have Dark spots on my cheeks. I received my free revitalift bright reveal products a week ago, I have used it daily and nightly for past week, and the dark spots a starting to diminish. I still have fine lines, but my face is smoother and more radiant just after a week. the products seem to be working thus far. I will complete the 30 day challenge and report back after the 30 days.

I must admit I was a little skeptical using a peel pad on my face at night but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. To date I have not seen any wrinkle reduction but then again I don't have many but I have seen dark spots visibly reduced and it has been noticed by my hubby which is always a good thing. I would ask is this product worth buying and I would Have to say with only using it a few times I am definitely pleased [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These pads are part of my evening skin care routine, and I like the fact that it is quick and easy just a few swipes and your done, you do not have to wait around for 10-15 minutes before you have to wipe product off of your face. There is a slight tingling sensation, but it is not uncomfortable at all. I haven't been using it long enough to see major results, but I am sure that with regular use, that will come.

"As soon as I received L'OREAL BRIGHT REVEAL PEEL PADS from BuzzAgent I just had to try it out . To my surprise I LOVE IT ‼️‼️ Use ever night , and I'm hooked ‼️ It's wonderful . Not a harsh exfoliantes pad. Very smooth , dries quick so I can apply my L'OREAL NIGHT REVEAL MOISTURIZER With out having to wait a long period of time .For me, that's important . Noticing a great improvment , highly recommend . You'll be hooked too❤️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was ok refreshing but when I use this product it tingle a bit I don't know why but I will continue to use it didn't break me out or any thing like that and there's no horrible smell but refreshing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is great when you are in a hurry to get out the door but need to clean your skin before applying daily moisturizer. It is actually brightening my skin. My blemish scars are disappearing after only one week, it is almost miraculous. They smell great and are big enough to clean my face and neck area with one pad per day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, after using this product only two times, I will no longer be able to us it due to sensitivity issue. Specifically, after cleansing, I applied as directed, but my skin immediately started stinging and turned bright red. It says not to wash off, but I had to in order to calm my skin. I will note that I have had sensitivy problems in the past with various products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far so good! The peel pads are easy to use and don't have an unpleasant smell like some previous brands I've tried and the day moisturizer isn't ""gummy"" feeling (I don't know if it's my skin or what, but some end up feeling tacky on my skin)..Can't wait until tonight when I give the overnight moisturizer a go <3 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the L'Oreal Revitalift bright reveal brightening peel pads! There are 30 pads to each box- so a months supply for me. The pads make your skin so smooth and soft and refreshing feeling after using! I am impressed with the noticeable difference my skin is after 1 week of using these! My skin is brighter and more toned! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. The pads come in a nice sealed container so no worries of them being dried out . Does not feel rough on my skin at all. My face does not feel dried out either. Great product and would purchase again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin and most products burn my face. I had no issues with this product, when it comes to what it did to my skin. I did not find the pads as moist as some products. It seemed some what dry. Overall the smell wasn't strong. The texture of the pads wasn't abrasive. Great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I love revitalift brightening peel pads my skin feels so clean after using these pads and I don't wat to waste a drop after I do my face and neck the pad it still wet so I do my chest and arms !I don't waste a drop! I have already noticed a difference and its only day 3! thank you bzzagent I love all of these products!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used many different kinds of exfoliating/ toning pads and these are by far my least favorite. There was a strange smell associated with them and they left my skin incredibly sticky. I don't plan on giving these a second go and if I could, I would have returned them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think its a great product. From the first day I used these products the peel pads, face scrub day/night moisturizer I noticed my face viably brighter. You don't realize how much dirt and makeup stays on your face even after you wash it with the usual soap and water. Right after using the peel pad i noticed a difference. The scrub is great also and I love the moisturizers! Definitely see the results , brighter, cleaner healthier looking skin !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Wow I'm so amazed. Here is a before and after of my peel pad. I washed my face using my ""trusted"" lol face cleanser. Look how dirty that pad is! Now my face is really clean. My skin is smooth and bright. Nothing sticky or stingy about this. I'm in love. Thank you #brightlift and #bzzagent for sending me these incredible products to review.

"These pads seemed to really help to tone my skin, and help it look better overall. These seemed to help keep my skin clear (without blemishes), tightened it up, and look improved over time. These are very easy to use as well. I really loved these peel pads. They did not cause my skin to ""peel"" which is a good thing in my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think these pads are good for your skin. I have noticed a difference in only a week. The product states that its like achemical peel but liter. I felt my skin had a glow, pores were minimized and there was no harshness to the product. My face had an overall fresher look after a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical about any over the counter product that would help brighten my face and erase the fine wrinkles, but I was proven wrong. The Brightening Peel Pads were easy to use, did not cause any sensitivity and I felt they really made my face look better. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like to use these pads after I use the scrub but they make my skin feel sticky. I haven't really noticed a difference in what it says it will do and I've been using for over 3 weeks now. Not sure if I will buy when they run out, but most likely not. I love the scrub though!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Brightening Pads are soft and feel good against your skin. The Glycol acid helps renew the surface layer of the skin. It could not be any easier then opening the jar and take out a cool Brightening Pad and your on your way to beautiful skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the peel pads! They really do make your skin look and feel brighter. Once I was of out the sample product I received I instantly could tell I didn't use one. My skin glowed when I was using them. I would like to continue using them in the future but probably not on a regular basis. To be honest they are little expensive. But the do work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These pads are nice. I like how they work, Andy skin feels clean when I use them. It's a nice mid day pick up and good to k ow the brightening agent is in there. The only concern is that the container is so large for the pad volume they seem to be drying out. I did tel the same friends that I've been discussing the other bright reveal products with about them. They do have benefits. If repackaged they'd be great! I do see a difference in my skin from using the whole regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have dry and sensitive skin. I tried the peel pads for about three days in a row. I noticed my skin felt very sensitive and irritated after use. Once I stopped using them my skin returned to normal. I do not think this product is for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"By far my favorite product in the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. It's gentle enough to use everyday, but still gives your results. I especially like the light citrus fragrance , it's like a hint of orange blossoms. Definitely a must use!! #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal brightening peel pads are like micro dermatologist in a jar! So simple, yet so effective! After just a swipe or 2 across my face I feel the moisturizer absorbs so much better and my skin is brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The peel pads weren't as exfoliating as I thought they would be, however, they were a good way to determine if I had cleaned my skin thoroughly with the Bright Reveal cleanser. They acted more as a toner and less as a ""peel"" for me. I would however buy them as a complete part of the Reveal set. My skin does however look more refined with them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads leave your skin feeling brighter and more even. My skin feels great. I've noticed that after using the L'Oreal Revitalift products even my makeup goes on smoother. Something I really like about these pads is that one side has a texture. Using that makes me feel as though I'm getting any make up or dirt I might have missed washing my face. And then the smooth side is a nice finish! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really excited to try this product! This is the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. It is used after the cleansing scrub, and it feels amazing and works amazing. It's very easy to use, just wipe across your face avoiding the eye area. Let the active ingredients do their job. This product did not let me down, excitement fulfilled. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using these pads for about a month now and what I love most about these pads is that they have made my skin feel refreshed. Immediately after applying I noticed a glow, my skin overall felt much softer ,I noticed that the fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead were minimal. The results were great and I plan to purchase... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The idea of having the peel on pads rather than in a jar/tub is appealing. However, I didn't like the results. I felt like this made my skin less able to absorb moisturizer, and it made my normal skin quite dry. Also, not sure it if was this, the moisturizer, or a combination, but I feel like my fine lines are actually worse. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried the entire regimen and I like it, however the most effective part of it is the peel pads. They have been scrubbing the dead skin off better than anything else I've ever tried. I'm not wild about the tacky feeling of the moisterizer so I don't think I'd purchase that part of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by these pads. They are effective, but mild enough to use everyday. They make my skin look brighter, layer well with other products and don't break me out. Best of all, the price point is great. It's always nice to find a good skincare product that you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars for. This was gifted to me by L'oreal, but I will definitely purchase when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved sampling this collection. All the products worked supurbly. But I really love the Brightening Peel Pads. Loved the way the left my face feeling really clean and refreshed. Ingredients in the pads were light and non abrasive. Really will be purchasing them again. Great Collection L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do what I can to take the best care of my skin. After using Loreal Revitalift's Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads just a couple of times a week for the past month, my skin tone is visibly brighter and more even. I love the results its giving me. It exfoliates dead skin cells helping my skin to look fresh and renewed. My skin has never felt so smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads are my favorite item out of the entire L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal set. In addition to gently exfoliating it also takes off excess dirt I may have otherwise missed when washing my face. This is something I would purchase in the future and use maybe a few times a week or whenever my skin needs a pick me up. This product is sensitive to sunlight so should only be used in the evening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Prior to this campaign, I never tried any type of peel product. I was a bit hesitant going into it and a bit afraid that it would hurt my sometimes sensitive skin. Thankfully it's gentle and easy to use. I now use the peel pads twice a week and I definitely notice a difference after I use them. My skin just looks cleaner, brighter and younger! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"They leave my skin feeling tacky. However, they clear away any trace of leftover dirt or makeup on my skin. Which there usually is none after using the facewash. It is part of the four steps and I see lighter and a more even skin tone . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for more than 30 days now and I am loving the results. I have never been able to use anything on my face like these products. Usually when I am using more than one product on my face through out the day this is when I get more break outs and black heads and makes my skin so dry. I haven't used soap on my face in over 30 years because of this kind of result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is used at night after using the daily face wash, this product gets in deeper into all the pores and gets the dirt and gunk off your skin, you follow up with the duel moisturizer then go to sleep wake up refreshed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What can I say. It is toner on an exfoliating pad. It did pick up some oil and dirt the scrub missed. It didn't dry out my skin. I tend to have normal to dry skin. I don't have large pores so actually don't usually use toner, but the pads made it convenient. I think there should be more pads in the giant container though. Much cheaper to use your own pads and a liquid toner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just the word Peel Pads can sound harsh, but these pads are very gentle on your face. No harshness what so ever. I could definitely see a renewed appearance to my skin. You get a 30 day supply in the container for a decent price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have found these pads to provide that extra level of cleanliness that other cleaners fall short to provide. I use these after cleansing and wake up with fresh feeling skin. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to up their nighttime regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've used these and i have to say i like them a lot...the only thing i don't care too much for is they seem to be a bit dry. they don't irritate my skin or make it burn and its not sensitive to the sun the next day either which is great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This pads have been great for my skin. They exfoliate very well and leave my skin smooth. I seen an improvement in skin tone and my skin seem clearer. The pads are easy to use, they come premoistened with the right amount of product. After using this product the night moisturizer seem to absorb faster into the skin.

"I tried the L'Oreal Peel Pads and felt indifferent about them. I usually don't use peel pads- but since I was given them- I figured I would give them a try. I liked that they are easy , convenient and quick to use. Not so sure if they really did much in the long run though. I guess just more of a personal preference- but I didn't find them a necessary product to add to my regimen- but of course some people might see a difference if they use them in conjunction with the other products.

"These pads have been absolutely great for my face. I have oily, acne prone skin. My problem areas lie around the sides of my nose, my cheeks, and more recently my temples. These pads have made a big difference in the way my skin feels! My skin has been getting clearer and smoother-looking day by day. . I will definitely be repurchasing these again! Love love love them!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I usually just wash my face but I started using the peel pads. They are amazing! I wash my face with just soap and water then clean my skin with the peel pads! I'm shocked at how much dirt was left on my face after a normal wash! My skin has really started to glow and look younger since using the peel pads. They are easy to use and easy to take with me when I go away! I've been using them for 2 weeks now and I'm impressed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These pads are a very convenient way to apply the glycolic product, making me more likely to use it on a regular basis and for traveling especially on airlines. The only complaint I have is it was impossible to open the jar . I almost had to take a hammer to it. I had to ask 3 guys before it was opened. He had to rip the lid off. A lot of older women and men may use this product, so they may have weakness or arthritis and won't be able to open it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think these L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are great! They are so easy to use, just pull one out of the container and wipe. No mess, no fuss, and you can feel a tingle all over your face after using them. It creates a nice base for the lotion to soak right in. Overall my face feels great after using this system. I've only been using it for one week, can't wait to see results after one month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There is nothing I like more than a clean feeling face. Using these pads each night after washing my face made a huge difference in how much longer my face felt clean. The pads were tough, yet gentle and had just enough solution on them to last over my whole face. The pad didn't tear while applying, and I'm a scrubber! The smell was nice, not medicinal. My face felt tighter after use. I love using these in combination with the L'Oreal Revitalift Face Scrub. Great duo! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal peel pads leave my face feeling very fresh and clean. I use them after the cleanser and they leave my pores open for the night moisturizer to soak into my skin. My only concern is that the second ingredient is alcohol but I will continue to use the free samples I received before I decide whether or not to purchase them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal's Brightening Peel Pads are fast and easy to use. They have a pleasant smell, and leave my face feeling tingly and fresh after I use them. I have noticed that I really have to be careful not to get close to my eye area - cheekbones are safe - but above that, my skin gets puffy and swollen if I use the pads near my eyes at all. They definitely slough off the old skin to make way for the new, and have a pleasant fragrance with the ease of a throw-away pad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Peel Pads free from L'Oreal Paris and I love them. I'm a super busy mom, and was very skeptical about changing the facial routine that I already have. BUT... I'm glad I did. After using the pads, my face feels free, refreshed, cleansed. The pads found dirt that I would have never known was there. They didn't over dry my skin and I didn't feel drenched in chemicals like I do with other cleaners. This is now on my fave list.

Reduces dull uneven skin tones while at the same time reducing wrinkles and brightening the skin. Contains 10% GLYCOLIC Acid which is brightening known by dermatologists. Tightening pores making skin softer and smoother. In a week fine lines and wrinkles become more even. In two weeks skin looks young and brighter. Overall I like this product but had very strong odor that made my eyes burn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The peel pads are great for getting any left behind dirt off your face after using the cleanser. They help get rid of the dead skin and exfoliate your face. They come in a round container and do not dry out like other brands [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"LOVE theses pads ! They definitely make your skin much brighter and give you an even tone. The only down side, was they are a bit strong (alcohol ?) and tend to burn my eyes. I have used them for a week now, and saw a difference within the first several days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this products for about 2 weeks. Once you open the product the pads do not dry out. The are so easy too use.

"The towelettes are specially formulated with vitamin C to nourish your skin and boost radiance while exfoliating and removing dirt, pads are big enough to wipe your entire face and neck, one side has tiny little bumps to scrub the dirt and other side is smooth to finish the job. #GotItFree Thank you L'Oreal and BzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the l""Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads and my skin looks like it had a light peel. It is so fresh and soft feeling and looking. I went to a brunch today and 3 out of 5 friends remarked on how great my skin looked. I told them all about L'Oreal Peel Pads and they are dying to try them! My skin feels so smooth and I;d highly recommend the Peel Pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal collection for 12 days and realized that a dark spot that I usually try to cover with foundation has faded significantly. The pads are quite large and I have been able to cut them in half and still have enough product for my whole face, which could double their value! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Brightening Peel Pads for 10 days and while they do work I cannot use them everyday. I don't know if it is my skin type or the product but if I use it everyday my skin is very red and irritated. I have switched to using it every 2 days and it seems to work better. It is doing what it is supposed to do. It is brightening my skin and removing the dead skin cells, I just cannot use it every day. Also I am using it with the Dual Overnight Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that the pads are two sided, one feels exfoliating and the other smoothes. No strong scent. It's definitely brightened my skin. However, I haven't seen any faded wrinkles. I don't like that I still have to use my toner for acne. I use the toner first wait about five minutes (ugh), the use the brightening pads. I'm giving it four stars because I wish that it took care of my acne, I don't like the extra step and time I've had to add. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These pads help to get any gunk off my face that the cleanser didn't already get. The cleanser does a good job cleaning, but these pads are an extra cleaner to get everything off. Usually with toners or pads, I have a stinging feeling when I use them. But I don't get that feeling with these pads. There is no odor to these and they are easy to use and cover the entire face with one pad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always stuck to one moisturizer my whole life and it did my skin very well, but once I tried Loreal Paris Bright Reveal Moisturier (both day and night kind) I was blown away. It's so delicate it just seeps into your skin. Leaving it feeling soft and smooth. Like silk. I love the citrusy scent and also have to say it last ALL day long. I really notice my skin is brighter and more youthful. I'm so excited to finally have a new moisturizer in my life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. I use them at night on my face after I use the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. They make my face feel super clean. It has 30 pre-soaked pads in the jar. They make my face look and feel amazing! My face looks brighter and more radiant. My skin has cleared up tremendously. I will keep the L'Oreal Revitalift products as part of my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As with the rest of this awesome line of products, I loved the peeling pads. After the cleanse, a simple wipe of the pads over a clean dry face made me feel tighter and fresher. Very easy to use and doesn't take more than a few seconds. Definitely worth it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for two weeks now morning/night and i was surprised to find it was gentle on my skin,it really cleansed my skin very well but didn't overdry or irritate it.My skin was balanced so not dry nor oily but just clean,i haven't noticed my fine lines dissappearing yet but maybe time will tell [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the brightening peel pads the first day I received them. MY skin feels vey clean and soft after using them. I use them every night after I wash off my makeup. My skin also has a glow about it after I use them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is my first try with peel pads and I'm loving it! I really am noticing softer skin and my make up looks better! I will continue to use these regardless of the brand I use for cleanser and moisturizer. I can't wait to see the results after 30 days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the soft texture of these pads! They they clean your face well, even after washing with the scrub which I also love! I wish there were more pads in the big container they come in. I have noticed my skin is brighter and feels very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The pads I have been using every night after I use the scrub, I think the are just OK. I wish they had the same scent as the scrub. It doesn't smell bad, just not as good as the scrub. Also my face feels sticky after it dries after using the pads. I am not hooked. They aren't bad, just not a big fan. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the Bright and Reveal peel pads were very refreshing. When i first used it it stung my face so I am using it every other day. I am glad after the wash I use it and notice that it gives you a sense of relief it gets the dirt off. Seeing is believing afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product, and it was a nice cool feeling, nothing stung and the dried feeling after was not too dry. it felt like a refreshing wipe that gave me a nice fresh feeling, if you have dry skin this will not dry your face out.

"I am in love with these Bright Reveal Peel Pads from L'Oreal! These are absolutely amazing! They are so gentle and did not sting or burn my face at all! The best part is the immediate results! Within one use, my skin felt so soft and refreshed. After just 3 days I noticed a huge difference in my skin. It looks so radiant and I get compliments all the time on how I just glow. I will definitely be using these peel pads along with the entire Bright Reveal skin care line from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not sure what's in these little pads, but they are surely doing something for my face! I have an annoying bit of acne on my chin line that just never seems to disappear, no matter what I do. The first night I used my L'Oreal Bright Reveal Peel Pad, boy did it sting! But after just a few nights, my chin is finally starting to clear up. I'm excited to see what will happen in a month!

"I have only been using this product for about a week, but I love it - the pads are my favorite they not only clean any left over dirt but they apply a nice layer of smooth brightening product on you face and leave it ready to apply either the night or day moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not certain the point of these pads. They do not seem to removed any dirt, nor cleanse my face. They leave my skin feeling sticky, and it takes a while for it to dry. When I add the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer to the mix, my face feels extremely oily and it really shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that these pads have really made a difference. I use to not do anything to my face in the evenings except for remove my make up. Now, I'm also wiping my face with these pads and have already started noticing a difference. My face looks smoother and brighter. I don't wear a lot of make up, but I've started wearing even less because I don't see that I need it anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is good for lazy people (like myself!) It was easy and fast to just wipe with a daily pad. It helped my skin feel soft and revealed fresh looking skin. I think the Glycolic Acid is a scientifically proven formula that effectively exfoliates dead skin cells to help renew the surface layer. My boyfriend used it too and thought it helped get rid of his flaky skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that the peel pads are part of this program. I bet I could cut them in half to get 2 months of use...I think I'm dong that right after I finish this review. I do like that they pick up some left over make up that didn't get totally removed by the cleanser and I know the glycolic acid is making my skin regenerate much quicker than normal. I can't wait to see the final results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ok...so, at first I was concerned that my skin would burn or become red from the Peel Pads. I have used similar products in the past and they irritated my skin. I was delighted, no such issues. I have been using them for about 4 or 5 days now and I plan to continue for at least 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first night I tried the peel pads they stung my face pretty bad. I decided to try it again the next night though and it didn't really sting. I have only used them for 3 nights now so we will see how it goes as I keep using them ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product daily. Not only does it clean my face but it leaves it soft. It removes all the dirt and oil which is what I need. I love using this product and would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Getting closer to the big 50. And what a perfect time to try the L'Oreal Paris Reveal Brightening Peel. These pads take off any remaining makeup and leave my skin feeling clean and soft. This product doesn't dry out my skin or clog my pores. It is a perfect thing to use before applying the moisturizer at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked it because it had a gritty texture which helped it get rid of some of the dead skin cells. Also it was really good at getting rid of extra makeup left on my face like foundation. Honestly, I didn't see that it really brightened my face like it says it does, I landed up using it more as a makeup remover. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The bright reveal peel pads had a pleasant fragrance, were easy to use and along with the other products, seemed to have helped improve the overall health and tone of my skin. I do have a small complaint - the pads, once applied and allowed to dry, left a sticky and somewhat uncomfortable feeling on my face. It took a lot within me to not wash it off as I really wanted to allow product to work its magic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think these peel pads are amazing! They are gentle, no stinging or burning at all! Yet completely effective. The best part of this skincare line is the immediate results. With using the entire line, my face was instantly smoother and brighter. I've already recommended these products to so many people. They work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used these for about two weeks before noticing a change. It's not drastic but I look more rested and healthier. These are so convenient to use which is important for me because I'm usually rushing. I really enjoy these. They did make my skin a little sensitive though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this every day as a moisturizer for my face and for a sun screen on my face too! Since I had wore make-up it works really well with it !! I just couldn't ask for anything more out of the product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads approximately every two to three days for the past three weeks and can tell a noticeable difference in the smoothing of my skin. In fact, even my husband - who's normally oblivious to small changes - asked if I had been doing something different. My skin feels tingly when I use them, but the pads themselves aren't overly harsh and don't irritate my normal skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
LOVE these brightening peel pads. This is the first product that I have used that does not burn when using. I really feel my skin is looking fresher and brighter then it has in a lonnnnng time! I will definitely continue to purchase and use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I probably wouldn't buy these for myself as they were a little too harsh for my sensitive skin. My skin stung quite a bit after using them. However, my husband loved them, as he did all of the products in this giveaway! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think they have a great smell and leave my skin feeling great right after I use them. However after continually use as the instructions say I started getting small cracks in my skin. For my skin type I would suggest using them less often as in every other day or every third day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so hesitant about using the peel pads. I mean, it's summer and it says on the box to avoid the sun. Not to mention, they looked a little rough for my delicate skin. Well I used them and they reminded me of the pad cleaners from my teen years. Still gross seeing dirt on them even AFTER I just scrubbed my face. I'm glad I used them and will make it a point to continuing using scrub pads even after these run out just to make sure I get off all the dirt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This had some pluses and minuses for me. I really love the convenience of the pads. They're super easy to just grab and swipe over your face. And the results I got from using them was nice. After using this for about a month, skin feels so incredibly soft!!! The downside to these is they leave my skin feeling not so clean and kind of sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried these just once with the intent to add them to my routine. Unfortunately after applying, my face freaked out. I felt a burning sensation and noticed redness. Sadly I was not able to give them another chance.. just couldn't put my skin through that again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you want your face to feel young and alive again, try the L'Oreal Revitalift Brightening Peel Pads! After just one use my skin felt clean and fresh and looked brighter. I have been using these pads for over a month now, and I am pleased to say that my skin has a brighter, younger appearance. These pads not only cleanse your face, they improve skin tone and are refreshing to use. Great product that you must try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I think they are on the smaller side, I enjoyed using them each day. They smell very refreshing, they have two different sides, one is more delicate the other allows you to pick up deeper in the T zones for example. I don't recommend them as make up remover because you'd need more than one, but definetely as an accompany routine to the scrub to ensure every remains as clean as possible. And you smell delicious too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did not like these pads I don't think they did anything as far as my skin tone goes I still have the spots that are on my cheeks and also I thought this burned my face everytime I used this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried these peel pads the first thing when I got them and WOW I must say that they are GREAT. My face felt so very clean, toned and fresh. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you Bzz Agent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely LOVED the peel pads. I could not believe how much it cleaned my face even after using the daily cleanser. However, it made my face feel very sticky, yet oily a couple hours after using. I did not like the feel of this. :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love these peel pads . At first I didn't really know what these were suppose to do for my skin, but after the first day I noticed how bright my skin looked and I was hooked from that moment on. I went and purchased another container before I ran out of them. I am so happy with the results, I recommend these peel pads to anyone looking to get brighter skin. I received this product for free for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked hear pads, even more so than the glycolic peel pads I buy from my dermatologist, and cheaper too. I liked how they did not dry your skin or felt abrasive when using. I noticed my skin was soft to the touch and diminished a few lines I had around my upper lip even. I had my friends try them for themselves and they like it too. I got one friend to sign up at bzzagent even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took on the L'oreal Bright Reveal 30 day challenge. I couldn't be happier with my results. After cleaning my face with Bright Reveal face cleaner, i used the peel pads. I noticed a big reduction in fine lines after 1-2 weeks of the challenge. I love how the pads made my face feel after each use. Yes, i have recommended the peel pads to everyone i know. Along with the Bright Reveal daily moisturizer, and night cream. Love my results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the smell of these Brightening Peel Pads by L'Oreal. They are a nice touch to the Brightening system. I would swipe one over my skin in the evening before putting on the overnight moisturizer. I just am not sure how effective the pads are (by themselves), since I was using the complete Brightening System. However, I enjoyed the benefits of the Brightening System to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Brightening Peel Pads help to deep clean and remove oil from the the skin. They leave the skin feeling clean and the pores feeling tighter. My skin is more even toned and smoother. I am left with skin that clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the peel pad's from L'Oréal Revitalift. They work wonders. I really like how clean my face feels after using them. It's been a month, and my skin is so soft and smooth. My skin tone is even, and I couldn't be happier with the product. I plan to continue using the peel pads, and I highly recommend them to others. I received them in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These Brightening Reveal Pads are AMAZING!!!! I love the scent. They leave my skin feeling squeaky clean without aggravating or drying out my sensitive skin. My skin is becoming clearer and brighter. I could see a difference in my skin tone after one use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Loreal Revitalift Brightening Facial Pads are so easy to use. They are refreshing and smell really good too. They are not strong or too harsh on my face and cleans all the oils off and they're amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These soft premoistened pads are perfect to gently scrub away any left over oils, makeup, dirt, or grime leaving your skin feeling fresh and clean without all the harsh chemical burn, smell, or sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Bright Reveal Peel Pads are probably my least favorite of the line, though that's not to say that I don't like it. I just don't know that it is doing anything, which I feel like the other products truly are. I like that I can use it to get eye makeup off, but I'm not sure that I would pay the price for these pads since they will only last a month. I do like using them, but again, I need more assurance that they are doing something helpful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very hesitant at first to use the L'Oreal Revitalift Peel Pads. I have very sensitive skin and I was nervous that it would dry my skin out and be too harsh. It did not dry my skin out at all. It smoothed out my fine lines and made my pores smaller. I will absolutely be buying this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received these Peel Pads from L'Oreal Paris to try free of charge and I love them! I've been using them with both the daytime moisturizer and the scrub, and the difference in my skin is amazing. My skin tone has evened out, I no longer need to use a concealer for under eye circles, and my skin looks bright and radiant! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the cleaning pads for several weeks now. I received them free because I am a Bzz agent. The pads do get makeup off using 2 of them. They are thick and leave a little fuzz if you wipe your face too much. I didn't enjoy the smell. I also didn't like the way my face felt after using them. My face felt clean but also sticky at the same time. I love face cleaning pads but these would not be my first choice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use the Brightening Peel Pads after using the scrub and as clean as I think my skin is after the scrub, the pads get every last trace of dirt left on my skin. Dirt that I didn't even know was there. It does leave my skin a bit sticky but it feels a little tingly too and I can tell it's working. It primes my skin for the night moisturizer which I also love. My skin looks amazing after using this regimen for the past few weeks. My skin is clearer, smoother and brighter, exactly as promised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! My skin has had no blemishes since starting the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal 30 day challenge. It looks healthier and more radiant than ever before. This is a product that I will continue using and refer it to my friends. Thank you so much for introducing me to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think these pads are amazing. They make my skin so soft and it definitely feels clean and refreshed after. The best part..even after I wan my face and neck, I use one if these pads and I still get dirt on it...AFTER I'VE ALREADY USED SOAP! That's how powerful they are. They do brighten up your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was worried that these peel pads would irritate my sensitive skin, but after using them every night for a month, my skin appears so much brighter and softer. No irritation, just new fresh skin. I love the way my skin looks and feels now, I will definitely keep using these! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the brightening peel pads but I will just use them every other night in the future. I liked the pads were super easy to add to my night time routine. Sometimes when I'm really tired complicated beauty products really do not work in my nightly routine, but these pads are super quick and easy. I would definitely buy them in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There was a slight tingle/burn to them and though normally I have no issues with facial products drying out my skin these left my skin almost scaly. I don't mind the slight burning but not how dry my skin became. Even the moisturizer provided didn't seem to alleviate the dryness. I wouldn't buy these again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that these peel pads are absolutely awful. They burned off my skin and made my face red and heated. It felt like I was scraping off layers of my skin. My skin dried out and hurt. I had extremely dry, damaged skin after using it. My skin literally peeled off and looked awful. I had to use 100% natural lavender oil on my skin to rebuild it.

The peel pads are amazing and make my dry skin feel great. I have been using them for about four weeks now and they help tighten and brighten my skin! It has definitely become part of my regular routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Only 1 star :-( I have very sensitive skin and don't use harsh cleansers on my skin. I used the Peel Pads just once to remove greasy residue from the daily moisturizer and my make-up. My skin felt irritated after use and was very sensitive to the touch for several days following use. My skin is quite dry so perhaps someone with a more oily skin would find these more effective. I did not enjoy using the Peel Pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the peel pads, and the entire line, but I'm not sure that they are improving my skin. My adult acne has gotten remarkably worse over the past 30 days and my hyperpigmentation remains unchanged. My skin is less dry, but I almost prefer the dryness to the severe acne. These are the only new products I've been using, so I'm afraid these might be the culprit responsible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These pads were so easy to use. Great for removing the days make-up, dirt and grim. The pads themselves were soft on my skin, big enough to provide great coverage and nice and thick. They also stayed nice and moist in the container throughout the whole month unlike other brands that tend to dry out by the last few pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Don't get me wrong, these are still great! They get whatever make up the cleanser forgets, they leave your face nice and bright.... but they also sting your face a bit... not excessively but a bit. They just aren't quite as gentle as the rest, but I am happy with the results all the same! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are good, but not something I personally would keep as a part of my skincare routine. I loved that the pads removed extra makeup left behind, but I did not like my skin feeling ""tacky"". I would encourage using all the other Revitalift Bright products first before adding the peel pads. Thank you L'Oreal and BzzAgent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the bright reveal cleansing pads were very easy to use and definitely took dirt off. I would recommend to all my female friends that want to clean their face and look younger without using harsh chemicals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally don't use Loreal products because my skin is super sensitive and I tend to purchase fragrance free, natural products. But I have to say these really impressed me. After only a few days of using them I can honestly say I really notice a difference in my skins uneven tone with discoloration from the sun improving. I feel like it makes my skin look more alive. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked that these pads held up. They didn't shred, fall apart or separate. My face felt clean, I did have a light burning sensation the first time I used them, I'm thinking because I had just used the scrub. I like the way my skin feels after using these. I like looking at the pads after going over my face, to see just how well the cleanser works, haven't seen much residue left over from the scrub.. Over all pleased with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've got to say, after using this entire line for 30 days, the Peel Pads are definitely the part of the regime that I could do without. They stung a bit when I used them and I'm not sure they were really as effective as the cleanser or moisturizers. I just don't think I would ever buy this product, even though I really liked the rest of the Revitalift line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this after the Revitalift Brightening daily scrub cleanser. The pads are thick and fluffy with not a lot of product. I don't seem to remove a lot of dirt when using the pads. I have only used with the scrub, so guessing the scrub works so well that the pads don't have much to remove. Preps my face for that magic silky dual overnight moisturizer.

I loved this product as a busy mom on the go I loved how easy this was to use even on my most crazy day even if I only had 2-3 mintues was all I had. I like the recloseable jar this comes in. Easy to store. it cleaned and removed old dry skin my skin felt smooth and soft. I couldn't believe it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel pads are amazing and easy to use. This brightening system comes on a pad for very easy use. Just wipe the brightening pad on your face.

"I seriously love the Peel Pads, they are very smooth, I love the feel of them they do not leave your skin feeling sticky which is a BIG benefit, because I really hate the products that leave my skin feeling sticky. And they brighten your face like other products as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually dont try new things for my face bring I break out usually. I absolutely love these. They make your face feel refreshed and clean without a drying sensation.

"Before I go out and buy this product I would like to know how much it is going to cost. I really like the smell and texture of these. I use them at night after washing my face and every-time I use them I feel like my face has had the best cleaning and exfoliation ever. These are gentle but they still get my skin feeling amazingly clean and soft. I will definitely continue to use these for the rest of my 30 day challenge, I will be disappointed once I run out of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thing the Revitalift Reveal Brightening Peel Pads by LOreal are AMAZING!!! My skin feel absolutely amazing when I get done with my daily regimen. After a week I have noticed a huge difference. My acne has cleared up a lot. After using it leaves such a fresh feeling. There is a little bit of a sting from the Glycolic Acid, Pro-Retinol, but the end result is well worth it!

Loved the Brightening Peel Pads as part of the entire bright reveal collection. I was really impressed with how much dirt these pads could dig out of my face even after washing!

"I received this product as a free promotion for being a member of BzzAgent. I really was excited to try this product. Unfortunately it made my skin red and blotchy. When I wake up in the morning, the redness is still there. I have sensitive skin with rosecea so I was hoping the brightening peel pads would help. It didn't.

"I have been trying these out for 2.5 weeks and I like them as a cleansing before bed pad. Not sure if that is what they are supposed to do, but they do it well. I like them for a quick cleanse to get the gunk of the day off my face before applying the moisturizer. Does well at removing makeup, nice thick texture. Just today I was flippin through a Cosmo and there they were. It was so cool to see an add for a product I have the privilege to try for FREE! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the Peel pads. I have used others from Avon before, but they made my skin really sensitive and were bitter if they ever touched my mouth, Yuck!

"L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads gently exfoliate dead skin cells to even out skin tone and texture. After 10 days, my skin is already softer and the tone more even, can't wait to see what 30 days with the products delivers!

I tried the L'oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads and I've got say that I like the product but after a few days my skin felt pretty irritated. I stopped using the peel pads for a few days and then I started using them every other day. My skin still gets a little irritated so I don't use them at all anymore. When I used them I could see that my skin was a little bit brighter and I would have loved to able to continue using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was curious if I was going to experience that eye burning sensation after using the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads, and yet again L'Oréal came through with a great experience. There was no burning and only a nice clean fresh feel. The pads get those creases on your nose and hug your face. No scratchy feeling as you gently use this product. You have won me over yet again!

I really like these pads they were easy to use and picked up a lot of dirt. I did however have to switch from using them everyday to using them every other day as daily use was too harsh for my skin. my face was red and very angry after using them. But switching to every other day stopped the stinging. So if you have super sensitive skin like i do I recommend just using them every other day. But other than that i highly recommend trying this product and feel the smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been a tried and true Clinique user for years. I tried these L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads and they are definitely a new favorite. I love how quickly and easily they remove makeup and dead skin. Seeing the impurities on the pad is great knowing that they are no longer on my face! Definitely follow with the moisturizer to replenish the skins balance as well as calm and soften your clean and tingly face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The peel pads felt a little too harsh for my sensitive skin. I could feel a little burning sensation when I applied them to my clean face.

"I love how this product strips away dead skin without drying, and without scrubbing, which creates tiny scratches. I can't wait to see a month from now. As I've aged I've developed tiny sun spots and I'm hoping this will help fade them! So far my skin is brighter and smoother, and it helps with those little eye crinkles. I especially love that I got to try this whole skin care regime for free, for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My experience so far with the brightening pads has been great, I love the fact that they don't have a strong odor to them. They don't sting when you use them and they don't leave your face face looking red afterwards. I woul d highly recommend these to anyone who has sensitive skin. L ' O real did a great job with this product. Thanks BzzAgent for giving me this product to try for free, I will be buying these in the future without a doubt.

"I've been using L'Oreal bright reveal products now for about 3 weeks. I have sensitive skin and the product is great on my skin. I feel that the peel pads give me that extra clean feeling.

"I loved the packaging and smell, and felt that Loreal was a great brand. After using these and getting a face full of breakouts that I am still recovering from I have decided to be more selective in products I use on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used these pads following a cleanser routine with the L'Oreal Brightening Scrub Cleanser and on their own on days where I don't wear makeup and just want to rid the daily dirt and grime without using exfoliating cleansers. I will say that both work great! These pads really take care of any leftover dirt or makeup that may have been left behind from a cleanse or without. It's also very nice that they stay moist and do not dry out quickly like other pre-soaked pads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm in love with L'Oreal products my face now looks ,more refresh and my skin has a better tone but when I try the peel pads I feel disappointed the first think that I noticed was the strong alcohol smell and then I follow the instructions and apply the pad in my face making circular motions but I start feeling burning sensations so I decide to stop.

I like the cleaning pads. It has a nice scent and makes my face and neck feel clean after a hard days work. I can see the dirt and oil on the pads after each use.....I would use this product again once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got to try Loreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal as part of a set of Loreal products in exchange for my honest opinion. BzzAgent sent them to me for free. I have really enjoyed using the pads. They leave my face feeling really clean and soft. They remove dead skin and any makeup left behind. My skin is much brighter than it was. Loreal has made me a firm believer in their products. I will definitely continue to buy and use their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Well this Loreal Bright reveal peeling pads are quite easy to use. And I love the soft scent it has. It doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all. I use it at night like suggested.

"I had the opportunity to use L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads when L'Oréal Paris gave me the product to try for free. Unfortunately, I did not care for this product at all. The pads' texture was very scratchy to my skin, no matter how gently I tried to be, and I felt like my face continued to feel scratchy and I could still smell the product for a long time, to the point that the smell was a distraction to me when I was trying to fall asleep.

These peel pads worked great on me. Since i received this collection from loreal paris i been using it everyday. Even though i use the loreal scrub. There is still makeup and dirt leftover which these peel pads get rid off. It leaves your skin smooth . the smell is alocolic like other pads. Once i use this at night it leaves product on face. I leave it for 2 to 3 mins to dry off then put loreal dual moisturizer. My skin is brighter. Definitely will buy this in future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thank you Loreal Paris for letting me try the Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for free in exchange for my honest review. I have been using these pads every night for a few weeks now. They leave my skin feeling a little weird like there is a film on it. But I do feel like my skin feels brighter and more radiant, so I guess it's a good trade off. I will continue to use them.

After using L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for almost a month I can say that my skin is softer and brighter. My wrinkles lightly faded too. I used them at night only to completely remove all the impurities. It left my face ready for the night moisturizer. I really like these pads. Thanks L'Oréal for letting me try them for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used these pads nightly for a week and then every other night for a week. I honestly can not say that I noted any difference that I can attribute directly to their use. I was using them in conjunction with the scrub from the Revitalift line. I received this product for free from L'Oréal Paris in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These pads were very effective in lifting hidden dirt and old skin cells from your face and neck. The pad glided easily over the surface of the skin, lifting away dirt and dead skin cells, and leaving behind fresh and glowing skin. This is truly a great product in a fabulous skin care system!

"I am lucky enough to be a #bzzagent and got a free sample from #L'Oreal that gets a chance to review products provided to me in exchange for my honest opinion. I have noticed my skin more bright and smooth. . These peel pads are a great addition to my skincare routine, but too pricey for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works wonders for a morning scrub. I like using something on my face other than a wash cloth to wake myself up. This peel pad cleaned my face nicely while also leaving my skin feeling smooth and fresh. I think it has a pleasant odor to the pad too. I would highly recommend the pads to a friend. There is also a nice amount of pads that come in the container and they last a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Peel Pads from L'Oreal's Revitalift Bright Reveal line are nothing short of amazing! My skin is glowing! I have sensitive skin and I'm so amazed that they are not harsh and they smell amazing too! Easy to use. You cleanse your face at night and before you put on the Revitalift night cream simply rub the pad all over your face avoiding The eye area of course. You've got to try them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the products that I got for free from L'Oréal are awesome. I have used it for about a week now. My skin is so soft. I use the scrub in the morning and then I put the brightening day moisturizer on before my makeup. I use the brightening pads at night after my face is clean then I apply the dual overnight moisturizer. I love the way it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the peel pad because it adds an extra step to make sure my face is clean. I think I would buy the cleanser, the night moisturizer and the moisturizer but will not buy the peel. I just didn't see that it made a ton of added benefit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feel of my skin after using the loreal brightening peel pads. I received a complimentary jar of them from LOreal. My skin actually felt like I had used a peel after using the pads. It was tighter and brighter as well. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an easier way to get the benefits of a peel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like using these face pads. I like seeing the dirt come off on them. Even though it wasn't much. They made my face feel clean and soft. I will be purchasing depending on the cost. I received this product for free from L'Oriel Paris for testing and reviewing purposes only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. This product is not for me. I am not a fad of any type of skin care pad. I don't like using things with alcohol as it dries on my skin and is too harsh. This product is not for me. So far this collection of products has been hit or miss forme. Full disclosure, I did receive the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection free of charge from L'Oréal Paris. This is my unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not only do these pads get rid of dead skin cells left behind, but they also left my skin so soft. My skin tends to look very dull and these really left my skin so soft. They are very gentle on the skin. I have semi sensitive skin and these didn't sting or irritate. You use them at night after you wash your face. It leaves my skin feeling very clean, very soft. My dark spots near my cheek look so much better. Easy to use as they come moistened. Makes my skin look and feel so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads are too much for my sensitive face to handle. After the scrub wash at night these pads seem to scratch up my face more and I end up with a very angry face and where my eczema is it starts burning and turns bright red. Even with applying the dual cream afterwards [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Have been using the product for over a week now, haven't noticed any difference in using any of the products for the better. The products have caused my skin to break-out - used to only using products that do not contain parabans, chemicals, etc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L Oreal Revitalift brightening peel pads are great product. I have super sensitive skin. I use these nightly and wake up to younger more brighter youthful looking skin. This product was a free trail from L Loreal and I'm honestly hooked on the entire Revitalift line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the L'Oreal brightening pads. They give my face a refreshed feeling. It feels like they pick up anything the cleanser may have left behind on my face. It gives a tingly feeling like its cleaning out pores and closing them up. I definitely will purchase again after the free sample I received it gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads from Loreal as part of a promo as bzzagent and have used these for almost 30 days. I have found my eyes are less tired looking, my dark circles have lightened and my skin looks tighter around my eyes. I will continue using these because they are wonderful! Totally recommend to anyone from young to old to try. Love, love, love them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Using the peel pads after the face cleanser felt great! They were so refreshing and left my face feeling cool and clean. Very impressed. I will absolutely continue using them after the cleanser. I can't imagine not using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received these peel pads free for a honest review from L'Oreal Paris. These peel pads were amazing. They smell great, make your skin feel fresh and clean, and your skin becomes tighter...all pluses in my book. These pads also visibly picked up dirt that the cleanser left behind. This gave me piece of mind that my skin was truly as clean as it could be. I will definitely be purchasing these in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product for a few reasons. First, I noticed that they removed dirt that the cleanser left behind. Second, the scent was clean and my skin felt tight and fresh after using. I did feel like they would be a bit costly to purchase regularly, and although they were helpful, I don't think they would be necessary as part of my skincare routine. I prefer to have an item like this on hand for occasional use, rather than for daily cleansing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried these out for the past few nights. First, wash and dry your face. Then gently run the pad all over your face and neck. The pad feels refreshing when you are using it. There was a slight tingle after I was done but nothing uncomfortable or irritating. I like how soft and smooth my skin feels afterward. Pores around my nose are less noticeable. The pads are supposed to help with uneven skin tone which is one of my skin concerns. I hope to see that in the coming weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently received this sample and my most favorite item of the for L'Oreal Paris free samples I was given has got to be the revitalift bright reveal brightening peel pads. They make my face feels so clean without a strange feeling at the end with a burning sensation. I have been so happy with all of the products I have been given and I've used them for a month and I can totally see a great difference in my complexion from all four of those products.

"I think the L'Oréal Revitalift Brightening Peel Pads are a little harsh on my skin and if you have any type of nick, cut, or abrasion, it feels like your skin is on fire. I'm sure there is a good reason for this step in the L'Oréal collection, but I am not sure really what it does other than roughly remove dead skin if you have any left after cleaning your face. This is not a product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using the pads on Monday and I already see a difference in my skin tone (it is now thursday). I can only hope this is true for the other 3 products as well. The Brightening Peel Pads do not sting upon application, do not leave your face feeling overly tight and are not dripping wet when you pull them out of the canister. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am loving L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. After just a few days, I am noticing a change in the texture of my skin. It's smoother and fine lines are diminishing. I will absolutely continue using these after this campaign ends. I also like that I don't have to use these pads every night. A few times per week makes this more than manageable!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the peel pads this afternoon and it left me feeling a bit sticky, and I waited quite a bit for my skin to dry. Next time I think I will try doing the peel first then wash then lotion, because even now hours later I still am feeling sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My face is so much softer and smoother, my pores appear smaller, my dark spots are lighting and my makeup goes on so much nicer. I give two thumbs up to L'Oreal for the Revitalift Bright Reveal Collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What you need to know about this product is that it smells so good. I feel so fresh and clean when I use these especially after my afternoon work outs. The package is so convenient to take with me if I decide to run outside I can stash it anywhere. I also love the fact that this feels like it is exfoliating and moisturizing my skin at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These brightening peel pads are exactly what I've been looking for. My skin feels smooth and clear. My sensitive skin is rejoicing because I have not had any breakouts due to this product. I feel as though it perfectly replaces a toner in my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is really convenient. I like how there's already pre-soaked pads. It smells faintly like acetone or alcohol, but I don't mind it. The pads sting a bit if you rub them on areas with open cuts like acne. It's not that bad though. The pads have kept my skin feeling really smooth and I will totally buy it again. I see results even after the first day. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Usually peel pads sting my skin and leave it red and irritated. These were gentle and I could see an immediate difference in my skin tone. I like how easy these are to use. Great product to add to your skin care line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These are like using toner without the messy cotton pads or cotton balls. It makes my skin feel fresh and clean. It doesn't sting like some toners and wasn't too harsh on my sensitive skin. Great product when used after the cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free from L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for about a week now consistently and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I feel like it really helps remove a lot of the junk from my pores and leaves my face feeling refreshed. I am very excited to keep using these pads! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a bit hesitant to use these pads because they reminded me of Oxy pads which used to dry my face out something horrible. I was SO wrong! These pads remove all dead skin that is left over after what the soap doesnt remove. It is very gentle and gives my face a great shine. I received this item from L'oreal to try for my honest opinion.

"I received a free sample of Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads as a promotion from Loreal and I have never been so happy with a line of products. The peel pads are such a quick and easy way to clean your face in a hurry, my face felt clean and soft after using the pads. Love these!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. I love that they come pre-moistened so it's one less step for me to do in my nightly routine.

"I received a free 30 count supply of L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Pads from L'Oreal to try and review. I like using the pads, they make my skin feel really clean and ready to soak in the moisturizer. I love the brand but I guess I was expecting faster results, I don't really see a difference in my skin after using them for a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin looks so much better after only 1 weeks. The pads are great with light scent and don't burn or irritate my skin. They also do not leave a residue. My skin definitely feels brighter and more refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These pads do make my skin tingle after using them. Price is expensive, but I think each pad could be cut in half to be more economical."
My skin does feel a lot smoother after using all 4 steps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the peel pads once a day for 2 weeks. The peel pads really make my skin feel amazing after washing with the scrub. My fine lines are prominently less visible and my skin glows. I will continue to use this product because it actually works and you can see the results. I was giving this product for free to review by L'Oreal and Bzz Agent.

"I was so excited to try. I read the ingredients and see alcohol. I was disappointed. But there are times alcohol is still okay. So, I opened and smelled. Wow! I was strong!! Okay, I didn't give it up right away. Take a look at the peels. It's thin. Won't be too much. But after I put it on the face, IT WAS REALLY STRONG!!! And I had some redness on my face. So, I have to wash away. So disappointed that I can't use it. Can't touch it anymore!!!! :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the texture of these pads! They really do make my skin feel smoother and look brighter. The pads are amply big enough, in fact, I cut them in half and only use a half of one each night. Great ptoduct! I have replaced my regular resurfacing pads with the Loreal Bright reveal brand! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was part of 4 products I received from L'Oreal Paris for review. There wasn't much to the pad at all. The container seemed to be made of cheap plastic and most of the time I couldn't get the lid to close. My face felt more oily after using them. I didn't really notice any difference in my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using these peel pads a week ago. My skin is very sensitive. There was no problems with my skin sensitivity . I also have sunspots and freckles. This product has made my skin brighter in just one week! I definitely will continue to use the product after I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads for the first time. I used these pads not knowing what to expect. I experienced a fresh, clean feeling across my face and neck that left me feeling clean. I feel like my skin looked brighter and felt tingly clean. I may have to add these to my weekly routine!

"I received the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Peel Pads free from L'Oreal Paris for my opinion. I have used other products like these in the past and I never see much difference. I do notice a slight tingle on my skin after I am finished using the pads and I see extra dirt and oil after cleansing. I have only used these pads about a week, maybe my opinion will be different after using them for a longer period of time but I am indifferent right now.

"So far (day three) I LOVE these the most out of the entire set I am trying for the 30 day challenge. They are diminishing the dark spots after only three days. It also fresshens my face! They are not too strong, which I was worried about, they work perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was looking for a product that would be similar to an astringent for my face. I love the convenience of a pad with the product already on it. It is so simple to just remove a pad from the container and use it. Every time I have used this product I remove additional make up and oil that regular face wash does not remove on its own. Leaves skin feeling extremely clean and soft and smooth. I will definitely be purchasing this product from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use these types of products all the time. These L'Oréal peel pads are great. They help dry up my oily skin and make my face look and feel brighter. I received this product from L'Oréal for free for my unbiased opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using the Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. They tingled all over my skin and left it feeling clean and renewed. It reminds of me of another product I used to fight acne. It didn't break out using this product, which is great. I would love the package to let me know what it's really for. Is it for cleaning, acne or fighting wrinkles? I enjoyed trying it out. I like the colors of the packaging, but the plastic seemed fake and cheesey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After you wash your face with the L'Oréal Paris scrub you use these peel pads to wipe your face. For me I just didn't get it. I don't understand what they are for or what they do. I feel like I am using astringent wipes from my achne days. I received this product for free frm L'Oréal Paris for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use these pads after I wash with the Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. They feel refreshing on my skin and have a clean scent/ They are non-drying and leave my face feeling soft and smooth.

"I really love these L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads. It amazes me how well this has worked shrinking my pores and reducing the look of my crows feet. I am really impressed with this. A lot of products claim they can do this, but this actually does was it is intended for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very nervous about putting acid in my face, but I found that these pads just made me feel fresh like the rest of the products and there was no stinging at all, and I found that they were also seeming to deep clean my pores, so it was a double bonus, I also noticed my age spots diminishing. Very happy with this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal Peel Pads are not bad to use in a pinch, but I much prefer the Daily Scrub. I felt the pads were a little too wet for my taste. I've been using them for 3 nights in a row before I apply the night moisturizer. I feel it's too heavy on my skin and doesn't leave that clean feeling like the scrub does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
They are not rough pads...u can feel them working as soon as you probably lace the pad on ur face this is my 2nd day of my 30 day challenge which I got for free though buzz agent.... I very much please with the pads... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just like the daily scrub, I used the L'Oreal Bright Reveal peel pads for the first time today. I like the fact that it comes in a little jar with individual pads to use. You only have to use 1 pad for your whole face and I used it on my neck also. My face felt really clean and soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this yet another wonderful product in the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Line. These are gentle and do not give your skin the burning sensation like many glycolic pads give you. I will certainly have these as a staple in my skincare products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What would someone like to know before buying this product? At first I thought it would be just like maybe the makeup remover pads that I've bought or the stridex pads that I used as a teen. It is neither. It works like a downer but it does not dry out your skin it is great for more mature skin. I use it at just before I moisturize [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The pads were great! They felt gentle and smooth over my skin. It did subtly brightened up my skin tone a bit over the past several weeks of using it. I'm thinking with long-term use, this can actually brighten up by 1-2 shades. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Pads I got to try for free thanks to L'Oréal were great. However, I felt like they were uneccessary. They did leave my face feeling fresh and after use, I did notice brighter skin. Will I buy them, yes. Why? Because I like the clean scent and I feel good using them.

After using the L'Oreal product my skin felt a lot healthier and softer I also told my mom about the product and she said she was going to try it thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to try this product and I also love that the product has sunscreen in it to help with the Sun [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I had never used a Peel Pad before, so I wasn't sure how I would like it. I have really sensitive skin and so I was a little nervous about it. it stings a little at first but it didn't make my skin red. I really seemed to brighten my skin so I was impressed.

"I think the Brightening Peel Pads are the easiest little peel pads I've ever used. Just remove one pad from the container and swipe over you face and neck, avoiding the eye area and you're done. I even swipe it on the backs of my hands and my upper arms..why not? My skin has become brighter and more even toned. I can even go without makeup. I would recommend this peel pads to those who want a treatment that is easy, quick, inexpensive and works so wonderfully. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Normally, I would not take the extra step to use this type of product in my skin care routine. However, I received it free, from the company, so I thought I would give it a shot. I am so glad that I did! These pads do not sting, like the old school witch hazel pads used to use, and they feel great. My skin felt tighter and cleaner, immediately after use. After a few days, my skin was noticeably softer and had fewer red spots, go figure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin was dull and my makeup looked cakey and dry. After using this collection I don't need foundation at 36! My skin is smooth and glowing on its own! I love it and will make it a lifelong part of my skin care routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this for FREE from Loreal Revitalift. The pads are crazy amazing. Soft smooth skin, and no breakouts. That is really important to me too. I am in sales and in front of people all day, so I need to be able to rely on my face products to make me look my best. The pads make your face feel cool, and refreshing. My shin is bright and smooth."

I have been using this product for about 10 days. The product should be applied at night after cleansing with the L'Oréal Revitalift Brightening Cleanser. The pads are smooth and feel good on your skin. They do leave a residue that feels a little tacky. I do see a difference in the brightness of my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers sun spot damage on their face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free set of L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal which included the Brightening Peel Pads. They work fantastic!

"I have been using these peel pads for about a week now. I use them following the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I think they are a great way to remove any extra make-up that the cleanser may have missed. They don't irritate my skin and my skin dries quickly when finished. I haven't noticed my skin looking brighter yet, but will keep using these peel pads. I received this product for free from L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest opinion.

"I received these pads for free from L'Oreal Paris. After trying them for two weeks, along with the other three Bright Reveal products, I have noticed my skin seems clearer. I have some light spots on my face from sun and a past pregnancy, and these seemed to diminish them somewhat. I don't have sensitive skin, so I haven't experienced any redness or reaction to using the pads. They seem to have the right amount of moisture for one use, not too wet, not too dry.

"I have been using these L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads in the evenings after using the scrub for about two weeks. I like these peel pads quite a bit. My skin is sensitive and they don't irritate my skin. They do tingle, no more than the tea tree oil ones I'd been using, certainly they don't burn. I have seen a slight difference in the brightness of my skin and anticipate seeing more with continued use. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the products that I got for free from L'Oréal are awesome. I have used it for about a week now. My skin is so soft. I use the scrub in the morning and then I put the brightening day moisturizer on before my makeup. I use the brightening pads at night after my face is clean then I apply the dual overnight moisturizer. I love the way it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pads free from L'Oreal Paris. They smelled really nice, but I didn't seem to notice any results when using them.

"Well I've been using the whole 4 steps for about 5 days now, I really like the Brightening Peel Pads, I have used many pads and they have always left my face feel so dry, so far these pads haven't made my face dry. I did notice a huge difference on a deep wrinkle that I have on between my eyebrows, it's doesn't look as deep!! The area between my chin and lips has been darker than the rat of my face and I can't wait to see the difference in that problem area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got to try L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Peel Pass for free from L'Oreal for a honest review. I have wanted to try these and I'm so glad I got the chance.

I was horrified and amazed at how much dirt the cleanser pads removed from my face. It wasn't drying at all and as a matter of fact my skin felt softer and looked so healthy after just the first use.

They smell very strong, like Oxy Pads that I used 20 years ago in high school, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. They do make my face feel clean but I don't think they do much else. I like them after a long day when it's been hot and humid, and after the shower. Makes me feel refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads are amazing. They leave my skin bought and refreshed every day. I use them first thing in the morning. They are gentle and effective at smoothing my skin and giving me a young youthful look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never used a peel pad so I was excited to try. I am not sure about this product yet, as I normally go for more natural skin care. This peel pad smells like alcohol. However, I am liking my skin since I tried these products, so maybe it's working well. I'm interested to see how it goes. I am on my first week of trying the kit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This one, I'm conflicted on. I like the concept of ""peel pads"" like a facial peel, but I don't see results from them? The other products I notice a huge difference. Maybe they are working? Too hard to tell, unsure if I'd purchase [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Works great,it is so easy to use,applying it on clean face at night, did not experience any skin irritations.My skin is luminous and glowing,more evenly pigmented.My skin is visibly smoother and softer after using it without leaving any residue.Improves skin texture.Love that is anti wrinkle plus brightening treatment.The only thing that concerns me is that the pads are not enough saturated in solution and they are going to dry out before I use all.

I just turned 38 and am suddenly uber aware of my wrinkles! I have been religiously using the l'oreal revitalift day and night creams for 5 days. Today I used the pads. My skin feels so clean and fresh! The pads have an astringent smell to them but do not sting and do not feel abrasive or scratchy. Although I had washed my face really well the pad was still a little dirty so I felt like it must be working! I can't wait to see what 30 days of this regimen will do for my skin!

Leaves skin feeling firmer and with all over better appearance

"i think are so strong for face skin, feel hot and burning. But in other way take out all dirty of your face, also i try it on my moms face but she really love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wish it had read the review stating bone dry pads. The only use for them was wetting them and cleaning my bathroom faucets. Read the one star reviews before considering purchasing. If you would like to search out other pads there are excellent ones being sold by a women dermatologist on Amazon. More expensive but worth it.
"Great product, good walmart price"
I have tried so many products recently and this is the first one to ever have visible results overnight. Very impressive.
These served no purpose but adding to landfill and I will not buy again.
