Love it!!! The best for dry skin! Comes out white but after you rub it in it doesnât leave a cast. And great value!! Love the pump rather than a squeeze tube.
"Product good. Dispenser bad. I've ordered this product 5 times over the past year. 2 of the times, the dispenser doesn't work. Both times, I tried turning the lid, tipping the lid, holding down, pressing super fast... nothing works. So it's kind of like playing the lottery, whether or not you get a good dispenser. Best to buy in store, and test."
