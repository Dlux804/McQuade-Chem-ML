"I recieved my free sample and I have to say it made my showering experience so much better, I love the way the foam feels and sticks to my skin, its soft and makes my skin feel soft and clean after wards, not sticky at all, moistures great, love the soft scent . Will definately be buying. Love it."
This Olay body wash smells amazing! I have to be carful with soaps because most of them make my skin feel sticky and super dry but Olay has amazed me. My skin feels super soft after using this body wash and makes me smell great as well. There is tons of soap in the can as well. My favorite part of this soap is that it comes out whipped! So it's just like shaving cream and it's so cool!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I cant say enough how much i love this. Its smells amazing and leaves my skin so soft. It doesn't dry my skin out like most other body washes and soaps and leaves me feeling clean. The whipped body wash has a silky feeling. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a rich, luxurious experience. It enhances your senses with the scent of white strawberry and mint. Whipped foam gently cleanses your body with a thick, creamy lather and rinses away easily leaving you feeling refreshed. Just a little goes a long way. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is really cool foaming wash. It smells amazing and scent lasts for some time. It's dual purpose as not only does it wash, but it crests a good shaving lather. The only things I didn't like is that it's tested on animals and not as moisturizing as my normal bars of natural soaps."
This foaming whip body wash is great. I have tried similar products and none have lathered as well as this Olay one. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft. Both my daughter and I love using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This body wash is everything!! It comes out of the can in a big poof and that's all you need! It lathers beautifully and the smell is so good! It smells more like strawberries and not so much mint, which was great to me. The body wash leaves your skin feeling clean and very moisturized. I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LOVE this body wash!!!
I very much enjoy the two scents of white strawberries and mint. I look forward to using this wash every time. My hands have seemed to look more youthful and the rest of my body has felt comforted. The foam is light and airy but wont go floating off your hands while you use it. I tend to use more on my hands and arms. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not quite sure what makes this body wash different than shaving cream... although it does smell nice. Just nice... still has that mass produced artificial part of the scent but it's nice. A lot comes out quick so I'm not sure how long it will last but it spreads out ok. No exfoliating element, so I probably won't use this long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all I love the scent, one pump gives you so much lather and heaping size of foam. The size of the canister is a very good size. I will definitely be adding this to my shopping list and look forward to other scents. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I decided to try the Olay White Strawberry and Mint Scent Foaming Whip Body Wash. it smells good, and the Foaming Whip lathers up ok. Leaves your skin feeling smooth. Works good as a shaving cream for your legs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love the new take on body wash, this canister is a good size and fits well in my shelf . It smells like a strawberry scent from my childhood and does linger after my shower. My 3 year old likes it too. It lathers well and makes my skin extra soft. I would love to see this in a shaving cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has a great light scent to it and the foam is so light you barely notice it. Washes away completely. no feeling of residue left behind. Hard to tell when the can is getting low but that's not a problem. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really surprised at how smooth, soft, and foamy this whip body wash is, however I will say that it doesn't have much fragrance. I smelled it before taking it in the shower and it had a subtle fragrance, but once I put it on in the shower I couldn't smell it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay white strawberry and mint foaming whip body wash texture reminds me of a thinner shaving gel. It does cause soapy suds on the body, but it's watery and does not stay in place like I would expect. Personally I am not a fan of the scentâ€” the strawberry and mint worked against each other. One scent or the other would be better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Olay White Strawberry and Mint Whip Body Wash is amazing. First, it works great--it's easy to apply, doesn't make a mess, and softens my skin! But the secret winner is that it also SMELLS AMAZING. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw this in the store for weeks and I kept wanting to try it. I finally did and oh it is amazing!!! This is now a staple in my shower. It foams and cleanses the body really well.

My wife and daughters loves this new body wash by Olay they love how easy it is to dispense from the can and it makes bubbles very quickly as they add it to the pouf. The scent is amazing and smells so sweet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This body wash is nice and nourishing. I really like the scent and how it is in foam form. It leaves my skin feeling very clean and not dry at all! The packaging and pump are both high quality which cannot be said of all foams. I recommend this to others!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It's so easy to use, shake, ladder over body rinse off. That's it smell and feel good all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Upon first coming out of the bottle, the body wash is quite foamy and lathers well. But it diminishes Greatly once water comes in contact with it. To the point that I had to reapply. Also, it does not leave the skin as soft as other Olay body wash products I have used. I was a bit disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm a huge fan of the play white strawberry and mint scent. I often purchase the bars and body wash. Now, the foaming whip body wash is a ""delicious"" whip treat!

I love this Olay foaming whip body wash! It has a very silky feel to it. It comes out very easy and has a great amount of soap once you rub in your wash cloth. I love the scent also.

This body wash smells good and leaves your skin feeling clean and doesn't leave a residue like some body washes. The only thing I don't like is it's almost too foamy and it comes out of the can a little too fast [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this body wash!! I really liked the smell of this White Strawberry and Mint foaming whip. Reminded me of shaving lotion in a way but is so lightweight and lathers alot on my loofa but washes of easily. Skin was so soft afterwards and left the bathroom with a slight fruity aroma. Plus one can should last like 30 plus showers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received the shea butter sample and I enjoyed the product. So I ordered more in a different scent and I like it as well. Good product doesn't require a lot to get yourself clean and it leaves skin soft and moisturized. I will purchase again

"If I can say anything about this product, it's that it delivers on its sell points. The foam gives a gorgeous lather and it feels like nothing, it rinses clean, and you not likely to over use on the product because one pump will give you plenty of product! The 5 dollar price tag is well worth it. Even though it doesn't advertise for sensitive skin, it hasn't bothered my skin in the slightest. Absolutely try this!"
"This foaming body wash smells like candy!! And what I love the most, is that your skin still smells like it even after you get out of the shower! I have super sensitive skin, and this was gentle enough for me! Can't say enough good things about this stuff!!"
"These whip body washes are so thick and luxurious - but most of all so FUN to use! The strawberry and mint scent is my absolute favorite. Normally my husband couldn't be bothered with products like this, but I had him use it and he geeked out over it, he loved how the whip lathers up so immediately! Basically a staple in our household now. :)"
I enjoy using this product in the shower. A little really goes a long way. The light smell of the white strawberry is not too over powering. My skin was a little dry afterwards but I made sure to moisturize ASAP. Overall very good clean and the price is unbeatable.
I absolutely love this body wash. So happy I was able to try these out. These products have a great price point and the scents are incredible! I love that a little foam goes a long way. It doesn't dry out my skin or have a weird feeling after you rinse. It's so fun and I would highly recommend it. Olay products never disappoint!
"I absolutely loved the feel of this gorgeous product & it made me feel like I was having a spa day! The scent is sweet, but not overly sweet, & made my skin feel smooth & glowy. The value is incredible for the price! I could use this to wash, but also, I love using it to shave, as the glide is smooth & I got an incredible finish! The only downside is that the ingredients aren't quite as clean as I usually try to keep things, so I'd love to see Olay come out with this product in a clean version."
The Olay Whips have left my skin feeling so soft. They lather into a thick foam but rinse away so effortlessly. I love how a little bit of product goes such a long way. I easily get over 30 showers out of one can. I love all the scents but the Strawberry and Mint is hands down my favorite.
I love love love this body wash!! The foam is so lightweight and lathers perfectly. Not to mention I smell like a dessert afterwards. Highly recommend
This product smells so amazing & I honestly love how it feels on your skin. It leaves an amazing smell on your body after the shower & I love that this doubles as a shaving cream. I totally recommend!
I cannot say enough good things about the Olay Whip Foaming Body Wash. It feels so amazing on your skin. It feels like a luxury product but it's offered as such a reasonable price. It also smells incredible!
it smell great!!!!! im obsessed
"The funnest product currently in my shower! It foams up like crazy when you pump it out, gets you squeaky clean, smells like candy, and works wonders when used on a loofa! The Strawberry & Mint scent has been my favorite as of late. The texture is so soft and soothing on the skin that I think my showers are actually getting longer and longer with each use."
I love how a little goes a very long way! The foam turns into this creamy luxe lather that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it smells absolutely amazing. My husband is a fan of it too and already told me he wants me to keep buying it once we're done with it.
"The foaming lather is thick and luxurious. I love that the foam hugs my skin instead of just falling or sliding off. Despite that, it rinses off easily and leaves my skin feeling soft. Now let's talk about the smell...it's SOOO pretty. I love how the smell lingers in my bathroom wears on my skin!"
"I love the scent of this product - it's not overly sweet, and leaves a subtle hint of strawberry scent on the skin after you wash off. The texture of the foam is also so soft and creamy, and leaves my skin feeling soft without drying it out. I also love that it doesn't take much for one use, so it a little goes a long way and I feel like I'm not wasting any product. Overall, cleans well, smells great, and feels weightless on the skin!"
"I absolutely love how this body wash lathers instantly into a luxurious foam and gently cleanses my skin with a creamy lather. My skin feels clean, refreshed and soft after I use it. Plus I love the cooling effect and the smell is just amazing. A small amount really goes a long way so it's another win for me. I highly recommend it!"
I have used this scent in the past. It was the regular type body wash. I really love this scent and am especially happy that it comes in the foaming whip version. The scent is so refreshing especially on hot summer days. It is great for the entire family. Softly scented without being overpowering. I would love to try the other versions as well. Looks like I will be purchasing this very soon again . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wow I was super surprised by the foaming of this product! It foams up into this amazing fluffy but substantial foam. I tried the white strawberry and mint scent and I really liked the smell and the heavy consistency of the foam. It goes on and does not dissolve while you are rubbing it on your skin but still washes off clean. This is a very unique product and I would love to try more scents! I can't compare it to anything else i have ever tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product in Strawberry Mint smells AMAZING! If you love the smell of strawberries then this is the product for you. After trying this one I am so excited to try the others. It's a lot of fun to use too. It feels like you're putting shaving cream on your body, but then turns to that soapy feeling that you're use to. I enjoy using it as well as my husband. My kids loved it too! Lots of fun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I purchased the Strawberry olay whip body wash and this is my new favoit wash. I have always used olay products but this is one of the best ones yet! The smell of the wash smells up my bathroom when I take a shower. the packaging is difenetly apealing. I even had a few of my friends try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never heard of foaming body wash so I was interested in trying this. I first tried it on my loofah and it didnt seem to work just right. Then I used my hand and wiped it on my body and it spread much better that way. I didnt feel like I was washing myself that well so I still used my loofah to rub it in more to make me feel like I was clean. I did love the smell! It works good. I would reccomend it and buy other scents. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed using this product. It felt so light and airy which was a nice feel on the skin. My only complaint is that it's hard to figure out the right amount to use as it spreads more than you realize so I tend to use more than I need and that would mean I'd go through the bottle faster than necessary.

"Am a big fan of Olay's products but Olay whip body wash is a WOW , I love the packaging, very attractive, it has only 3 fragrance to choose from.The dispenser makes the application easy to use, first you shake,flip the container and press the dispenser, i used 1-2 puff (s) for each shower, I love the rich, creamy cleansing effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the Olay foaming whipped body wash in the white strawberry and mint scent. It smelled really good and refreshing. It also cleaned very well and had a good leathering texture. It rinsed clean and left no residue behind, only a nice clean smell that I really enjoyed. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a foaming body wash. I will definitely keep using this and recommend it to my friends and family members. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Body wash leaving my skin so soft . The smell is yami and I am obsessed with a very pleasant smell of the white strawberry and mint. I don't have to worry to dissolve the foam during my shower. It's already on my skin and it's ready in a second to be rinsed. I am very glad I tried this product and it's going to be in my shower section stock item in my bathroom . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay foaming whip body wash is phenomenal. The texture is like a soft cloud of foam. The smell is absolutely devine. I put a palm sized amount and rub it all over my body starting with my neck. I love the scent. The combination of strawberries and mint is genius. Love the way it lathers and feels on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my first experience using a foam body wash. I was unsure what to expect at first, but was surprised that it felt like soap on my body. It smelled very good and met my cleaning expectations. I believe that this is something that felt very luxurious and would be great for those looking for an alternative to traditional body washes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It had such a refreshing and different scent that left me feeling cool and refreshed all day. I wasnt sure how it was going wash off because it felt like shaving cream coming out but it was light and washed off fairly well. My skin feels so soft and moisturized after and I didnt really have to use much of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the container this product comes in. It is very, I mean extremely easily dispensable even the first time around. I enjoyed the smell quite a bit. I purchased the strawberry mint. I couldn't smell the mint so much but the strawberry smell was wonderful. The product has a very luxurious lather and leaves your skin feeling silky. I found that it was a nice product to shave with also because of that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I do not like strawberry but this product smells DELICIOUS and works beautifully.
They smell so good! My favorite scent of the Strawbery and Mint! it comes out into a thick luxurious foam and the lather makes my skin feel so soft and refreshed through out the day.
Honestly I was so amazed by this product! There is nothing else like it. Even when you apply this Foaming Whip it goes on so smoothly. I love all the scents but this one is my personal favorite! I also think the price is awesome!
The white strawberry & mint scent smells so good! I really enjoy how this product makes my skin feel soft and refreshed after i'm done using it. I would definitely recommend this product and I plan on purchasing again!
"Not only does this product smell amazing, but it leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I can't stop using it!"
