noticed results soon after use. my skin became less oily over a matter of days and pores did appear smaller. the fragrance was pretty strong tho. i got itchy and flushed after use. i switched to a cream with Similar ingredients but fragrance free. the irritation stopped and i still got results. is too bad that this affordable version has to be ruined by fragrance. this would have otherwise been amazing for the price. it's probably fine for people without sensitive skin.
"I've seen and felt a noticeable difference in the firmness of my skin in just 2 weeks. I use this for daytime and the Equate night firming cream before bed. Not only are my fine lines diminishing, but the skin on my jawline is tighter and is not sagging as much as before."
This is very easy to use and I do think it has made a difference in the appearance of the wrinkles near my eyes.
"Absolutly love this moisturizer!! Light and not oily. I have oily, normal and dry mix skin on my face. This is by far the best"
"this product makes a huge difference in a short period of time. my skin has a more youthful texture, really plumper around eyes, and pores have shrunken. I was having adult acne but that has diminished by 80%."
"The lotion was light and easy to use. I usually prefer Oil of Olay and still do. One caution for all users - when my jar was used up, I opened the black top to check and found what appeared to be brown colored growth or mold. It was upsetting especially since I cannot find out what it is. Just note that the number on the bottom is A165843-18178L10 21:47."
I like the bottle it came in and the fact it was shipped right away
"I don't know about ""anti-aging"" but it's a good daily moisturizer for the price."
"Really wanted to love this lotion, it went on smooth and didn't feel too thick or sticky on my skin. But however, it didn't do ANYTHING for my skin! It absorbed well but it still left the dry patches the that I have on my skin..dry! My skin is now irritated."
