"I've been using this twice a day for the past 2 months and I love how fresh, smooth and hydrated my skin feels."
I've wasted a lot of money on moisturizers that never helped my face and sometimes made my dry skin and acne worse. This has helped both problems from the very first use. I won't use anything else.
"I have acne on my chin and this is helping clear it up. I was using a grapefruit acne moisturizer and it wasn't helping, so I decided to give this a try. It is very moisturizing but not too thick. I like that its natural. I was worried that it would smell weird but its lovely. I will definitely keep using it and repurchase when I run out. I have tried a few other items from the Found brand and so far I like them all."
