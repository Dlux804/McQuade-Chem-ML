Absolutely amazing!! Leaves my skin feeling completely moisturized with a greasy feel. All 4 products in this kit smell so good!!!!! I can honestly say I saw a huge difference in my skin with only one week of use. It made my skin look almost flawless. So much so that I am no longer using foundation.
I really like this starter set.its perfect for my daily facial routine.it has everything you need in making your skin glow and healthy looking.its very gentle on your skin and just a small amount will do all the work so it will last along time.all the products smell great.
"I absolutely loved using Super Fruits Starter Kit! It was easy to apply and use, the directions were simple. It did not irritate my skin and smells so delicious and fruity. I loved the scent and the feel on my skin. I could notice a difference instantly with my skin looking younger and feeling more refreshed and also smelling so delicious and amazing."
"This is a great kit, it comes with everything you need to get started. A cleanser, a day cream, a night mask and eye treatment. I love everything except the eye cream. In my opinion it's just a little too heavy and greasy. The cleanser is nice, rinses clean and leaves my face soft. The day cream leaves my skin feeling soothed and refreshed and the night mask is a great way to pamper my skin. All in all its a great kit and I'd recommend it"
The super fruit starter kit is a great way to try multiple products. I like that these products are made with real fruit and are natural to use on your skin. My skin is acne prone and I have had no issues in the few days I have been testing these products. I would recommend them and I'm looking forward to trying more products by this brand!
I liked how these products smelled! Not overpowering but sweet fruity scent. The eye cream was very moisturizing and my face felt very clean after using the cleaner but I did not notice any difference on my face after using the mask. It did smell fabulous! No allergy reactions and no breakouts which is a big plus!
"Other than the smell of the banana eye cream, I absolutely love this starter kit. And even though I didn't enjoy the banana smell, I am really living the results. My skin looks brighter and feels softer. It's such an easy daily routine to get into. It takes minimal time and effort and produces amazing results!"
I love that the Super Fruits Starter Kit comes with all the products you need to have an easy and well working skincare routine! The blueberry exfoliating cleanser has lots of tiny little scrubbers in it which I personally love because it makes me feel like I'm getting a great cleaning out of it. The scent of all 4 products are so fresh and natural! I love the way my skin feels after using each product individually but when you use them consecutively it works better than some of the most expensive products!
"I really liked this kit. The most liked product was the gel cream and eye area cream, because my skin absorbs the product very fast, which makes it easier to use before makeup. I feel my skin hydrated. They all smell very nice and pleasant. I found this kit perfect and complete for me to use on my travels. The exfoliating soap left my skin soft after I used it."
"I love the smell of all four products in the starter kit. The cleanser feels great on my face and washes off easily. The eye cream, morning and evening creams are all thick, creamy and smell delicious. They soak into my skin fast and do not leave any kind of residue or oily feeling like many creams do. My skin feels more hydrated and healthy. I will continue to use these products."
"I loved that this are clean products made from all natural ingredients and really liked that it cleaned my face ,rinsed easily and made my face feel soft and not dry but my face brought out in red splotches all over my face .It did not itch but this laster for several hours before going away.I have never had this happen before but was afraid to use again.Probably just me and someone else would not have it happen. I did like everything else about the set."
"This is a great starter kit for someone that wants to try the Super Fruits without buying full-sized, single products. I really liked all the products in this kit. It provides you with the daily regimen you need to have radiant skin. I especially liked the day gel; it left my skin so soft and smooth. All of the products smelled amazing too. Highly recommend!"
this is the first ever only fruits kit i use as my extended facial routine.i tried it twice and it smelled devine. blueberry exfoliating cleanser us very gentle and it removed the toxins well.i dint see much results on using the eye cream.the day cream is so moisturizing and it is not oily.the mask is so soothing.overall this face mask calmed my skin at night.
"The earth to skin Super Fruit Starter Set is an awesome introduction to four great products. The cleanser is formulated with blueberries to exfoliate, brighten, and illuminate your face. The citrus day gel cream is lightweight and very moisturizing. The avocado overnight mask helps to get rid of dull and tired skin as you sleep. My eyes look bright and refreshed after using the banana brightening eye cream."
All of the products smell super yummy!
This is my new favorite facial product! The blueberry scrub smells great and does a great job. My face feels soft and moisturized. My skins looks and feel absolutely beautiful. I am so happy with the ingredient list. Once I run out of my normal facial routine products I will be replacing it with these products.
"I loved every product in the starter kit!! The facial cleanser exfoliated my skin and was gentle, the day gel left my skin so soft and hydrated. I love the banana eye cream because it brightens my under eyes and the avocado night mask helps me wake up with soft skin"
So my 13 year old daughter and I got this kit and we both were super excited to try it! The fact that fruit could be used in beauty products made her happy :) it was awesome to have an entire line of cohesive products to use on our faces. This will definitely be a keeper. Love the smell and the way it made our skin feel.
"This new Earth To Skin Super Fruits Starter Kit is amazing. It has everything you will need to keep your skin nice and healthy. I love everything about this kit I can honestly say. My favorite has to be the exfoliating cleanser. It smells so good and keeps your face feeling so fresh, revived, and brighten. If you are looking for products that will help brighten and give your face a beautiful healthy glow. This would be the perfect set for you!"
I really loved this kit. It moisturizes skin leaving it soft hydrated without feeling greasy. The serums absorb well into skin and they all smell amazing. I apply them both (day and night) and include it in my regular beauty routine. The cleanser is great at removing dirt and makeup and leaves skin feeling refreshed and clean. This is a nice little kit to keep in my beauty bag and I give it two thumbs up!
"Nice skin care kit. Contains everything you need to seriously start caring for your skin. The blueberry cleanser is nice, smells a little, not overwhelming, and has micro beads for exfoliation. Grapefruit day cream is light and smells nice, does a good job of moisturizing. Avocado overnight cream, works okay, but doesn't really smell and leaves my face a bit greasy. Not a fan of bananas, but the eye cream didn't smell too much, and felt nice to apply. Great starter kit."
I loved the way my face felt clean and looked so much brighter! The fresh fruity scent was refreshing and all the products worked great together! The mask was very clarifying the eye brightener worked great and I love the face wash because it was non drying and cleaned great! I love these products and I am looking forward to purchasing many more!
"I really enjoyed the Super Fruits Starter Kit. First of all I love the scents - very subtle but just a hint, which is great. They don't have that strong fake fruity smell. All the products are very gentle on the skin, I've had no reactions to them and just a little product goes a long way. The day gel cream leaves my skin so soft and radiant. I really love the eye gel, I can feel the undereye area tighten up! And its banana scented! The products all work well together and they compliment each other."
Wow! Just love this kit. Awesome results. Skin feels so refreshing even after one wash. Nice fragrance mask and gel cream is not sticky at all. Spread evenly all over the skin. Definitely I am buying more in future. Thanks for giving me this opportunity. #sponsored

"Really good! I have oily skin, so i skip the morning cream but the others, buyers should try! All smells amazing and natural, scrub lathers well, overnight cream is a must and eye cream makes me look a bit more awake. Keeps my face less red ( not 100% but def under control) and i havent broken out since ive started using it (1 month now, i use Dicksons toner before applying a the Ordinary serum and then these products in the order of eye cream, moisturizer and then overnight cream) hope this review helped someone !"
I love these products. I went back and bought more.
