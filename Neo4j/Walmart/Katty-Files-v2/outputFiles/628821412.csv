"I dont wear makeup, and never have. I was on the hunt for a good sunsreen moisturizer that didnt give off a white sheen. And when I bought this, my life changed! I also love the healthy, dewy glow it gives to the skin! THIS PRODUCT IS SO GOOD. I have oily, sensitive skin, and it didnt make me break out either. Best ELF product out there!"
I really love this product I don't think there's anything quite like it from any other brand. ELFs shimmer game has really gotten good in the last year or so. This provides a really beautiful glow without being glittery at all. It's perfect for a no make up day plus it still has SPF! The only small downsides are that it smells like straight up sunscreen and it seems to oxidize a little bit and make my face look darker than my body.
"I have been using this for a little over a month now and I love it! It's soft, light, and smooth. I usually only need one pump and it covers my entire face. I love the subtle glow it gives and the moisture from the hyaluronic acid"
I bought this moisturizer about a week ago and makes my skin so soft. I'm having few breakouts with it because it keeps my skin hydrated so my skin isn't trying to produce so much oil. I can't wait to try more of elf skin care products
"I've ordered this elf product a while ago so I can write a review. This product is creamy with a good texture, a little goes a long way so not much is needy. This had made my face much softer. I apply it into my morning routine. I recommend this product."
"I was really hoping to love this but the ingredients are sketchy and nor good for the skin. Dimethicone, Fragrancem, and it ""MAY CONTAIN"" Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Red 40 (CI 16035), Yellow 5 (CI 19140) ???? there is never a reason to put red 40 or yellow 5 in ANYTHING that goes on your face. Elf can create cheap products without these ingredients."
"This glow is noooooooooooo joke. I was looking for something like this, extremely emollient and downright glossy. I started using 2 pumps which is way too much. A little of this goes a long way. Just one pump is plenty for a totally glossy wet looking face base. I recommend all the dewy products from this elf+ line. The scent is nice and the product clings and offers moisture for quite a long time."
Boy was I disappointed. This lotion makes skin look and feel beautiful BUT I realized after three weeks or so that it was the reason for some pretty terrible breaking out. I so wish it didn't do that to me because aside from that I loved everything about it.
"I bought this a couple months ago and I've been using it daily. Now, I'm oily so I can't speak for how much moisture it gives. I do get greasy but honestly I get greasy with everything Ive ever used. What I love about it is how I can get my spf without feeling like I have sunblock on my face AND so far no breakouts. I also like the smell and the subtle glow it gives. One pump gives me plenty so a little goes a long way. I will purchase this again when I run out."
Has a sweet coconut smell and it has a creamy smooth application. Gives a light tint and glow. LOVE IT!!
"Love this!! Gives a you that perfect dewy glowing skin, smells great feels great.will be purchasing again! Just wish it had a cap or twist lock so I could put in my purse with worring that it will Leak out."
"I had an allergic reaction to this product, BUT I liked the finish this gave my skin before that happened! If I hadn't reacted to it, I probably would have only used it as a primer because it wasn't moisturizing enough for my dry skin."
"I just bought this! I have been wanting to try it even though it has coconut oil in it which can clog your pores :/ but it also has hylarounic acid which is awesome. I mostly bought it because it has spf. It smells really nice and blends well and it leaves the skin very dewy. I rub it in with my fingers then blend it out with a beauty sponge. I don't wear makeup a lot, but this is a new go to for me! Besides the coconut oil, I love this"
"This is a beautiful product! And not just for the price, but just in general. I'm a skin care junkie and this easily rivals any of my high end moisturizers. The glow it provides is lovely too."
I bought this a few weeks ago and I am in LOVE it has worked so well on my skin and is now part of my daily skin routine. It not only works but it also smells good too. Plus were it has SPF 15 in it unless i am going to be outdoors for a long time i dont have to apply sunscreen!!
"I bought this product a few weeks ago as I was in he market for a new SPF. I came across this and love it! Does not leave a white cast on melanin skin, and gives you that perfect glow from within. I got a compliment the very first day of using it. I have combination oily skin and it works pretty good for me. Will definitely purchase again!"
Three days into this moisturizer and I'm in love.
I loveee the dewy glow it gives. This is what I was looking for!!! Flakyness has left the CHAT.
"Just purchased and received this and I love the feeling it has on my skin, it look so fresh and glows beautifully. Smells good to!"
"I tried a couple of elf moisturisers and like this the best. I add a drop of facial oil to thin it. I have really dry skin and this is fantastic. You cannot beat the price, so I'm about to re-order."
"I bought this many months ago and still have it, I use it sporadically as it's a little oily for me. I do like it though & I wear it on my good skin days."

This smells and feels like sunscreen. It's thick on your face and it makes you feel clogged up instead of hydrated.
I bought this at beginning of July Loved it so much I just ordered three more tubes!
It gives your face a nice glow!
We all need SPF LADIES. This is the perfect moisturizer has spf and smells really good. Works really well as a primer
