This serum-like booster has a great mix of ingredients that are very good for the skin. It blends well with other products. Great product for a great price.
I bought this product a few days ago.Wow at 60 years old this has really been a game changer for mature dry skin.My skin soaks in the luxury skin booster complete hydration for hours.I'm so impressed with the way it works right away no waiting my skin hasn't felt this good since my thirties.
"I began using this serum consistently for two weeks and noted improvement in the texture and health of my skin. This little gem also contains hylauronic acid, the holy grail of moisture magnets for your skin with absolute zero oiliness. Moisturizer flows flawlessly in smaller quantity, feels comfortably and effectively absorbed. Will be buying again!"
I am so excited to finally find a product that does what they advertise. I have to watch what I use because I have combination skin. This product is great. After 2 days i noticed a difference. I like that you can use a moisturizer over it also. The major plus is that it didn't make me breakout. Im a lifer now and sooooo pleased. Keep up the good work Physicians Formula!!
I use before i apply my makeup in the morning to hydrate my face. Love it.!
I love this. I have horribly dry skin and between this and the ROSEâ all night cream my face is sooo much better. I use this in the morning and at night before the night cream and my skin is starting to look like it did pre baby. Iâm sold.
"I've been using this before bed but this morning I used it and really saw a difference in my skin with in minutes! I'm sold on it now, and as soon as it's back in stock in ordering more. Telling all my friends about it too!"
I bought this maybe a month ago and have been using it almost every day and my face has been almost clear which is a big deal for me! I was nervous about this at first because I didn't know if it would make me break out but it doesn't (for me) and I couldn't be happier. As far as improvements I'm not sure but it does make my skin feel firm so I massage this into my face AND neck. Not about to get a double chin anytime soon lol.
Nice gel like consistency. Dries quickly. No adverse reaction. I use daily in the a.m.
I was really hopeful about this product because I have used the RosÃ¨ serum and loved it! Unfortunately this product gave me break outs. I even took a break from it for a week and tried it again to test my theory...and two days later I had another break out...
"I have combination skin and have always had issues with moisturizers making my skin break out or not provide enough hydration. I have had 0 issues with this product. It makes my skin feel well cared for all day and works as a great natural feeling primer for makeup. I would suggest applying small drops to the forehead and cheeks then rubbing in, rather than putting in your hand."
"I suffer from really bad eczema and the skin under my bottom lip is always dry and my makeup looks awful on it. I've tried so many things and they never worked, until now. I put this on and in minutes my skin was so hydrated. My usual dry patch cleared up instantly."
I have been using it for almost two weeks now and I noticed how it gave my skin such a nice glow and lighten a few of my acne marks. It also didn't break me out and very affordable compared to the other vitamin C/brightening products out there. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
"hydrates like advertised. I been experiencing now as I enter my early 30s extreme face dryness. So uncomfortable that my face dryness keeps feeling uncomfortable though out the day. Nothing works. No cream of serum. Nothing. This product has worked so far, I can feel my face hydrated for two days even when I don't wash it."
Amazing!!! In 3 days I noticed skin was lighter and brighter. Wow
"After using this for a month, i noticed dark spots/freckles lightening, which is what I bought this for. I put quite a bit on too but overall it really helped."
This is one of the best hydrating products I have used. It works much better than so many more expensive products. Hope that Physicians Formula continues to make it and Wal-Mart continues to carry it.
"I have to admit, I was skeptical, but this product saved my dry skin. After an epic drought following a bad reaction to skincare, the serum calmed and hydrated. It does not fully sink in (in a good way) and leaves the skin dewy. Perfect on it's own! Kept all the dry patches away and brought my glow back. You really don't need a ton of this each time you use it. Give it a shot!"
This product did wonders for my skin! Iâm acne prone and it didnât break me out at all and helped with my acne scarring. Highly recommend
I have only been using it for a couple of weeks so not sure yet if it is increasing hydration on my face.
I will buy it again! excellent product! I want to try the brightening and Hydrating vitamin shots.
It didnt break me out but I didnt really notice a change in my dark spots. I won't be buying again.
