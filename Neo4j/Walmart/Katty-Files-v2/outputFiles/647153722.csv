"Convenient no-mess airless pump packaging. This product is creamy and moisturizing but not heavy and absorbs into the skin quickly. Honestly I prefer this product to luxury brands - moisturizing, good SPF coverage (some luxury day moisturizers only have SPF 15), no added fragrance, and not greasy."
"To date this is the best facial sunscreen from the ones that I've tried. Sunscreen tends to aggravate my eyes either the fumes or it gets into them somehow. This one is light, doesn't leave your face looking white and is gentle on sensitive skin."
"Very light, absorbs quickly, doesn't aggravate my Rosacea, and best of all, no white residue! I've tried many products and many (including expensive brands) all leave a white residue on the face. Needless to say, I bought 3 extra for myself and a few tubes for my kids."
This is the absolute best moisturizer I have ever used. I highly recommend!!!
"Came right away. Purchased this for my better half, and she loves the stuff. When she's happy, I'm delirious. Thanks for having my back, Walmart"
Lightweight sunscreen that doesn't make me even more oily. Great for matte finish. Con - when skin is extra hot it may crumble. Dust powder and your set.
Really enjoy this moisturizer/sunscreen! It has a nice lightweight feel and absorbs quickly. It has no sunscreen scent and doesn't leave a white residue. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because you don't get much for the price compared to the cerave am moisturizer with sunscreen.
Great for the day time and under makeup.. feels very light on skin
