"I've been using Lloreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Night Cream for the last few weeks and it feels great. It's very thick and a little goes a long way. I was worried about it breaking me out on my t zone, but it never did! I'm very pleased with this product. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. #cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this balm from influenster to test and review. I do like this night balm. It is thick and best if you warm it on your finger a little first. I have dry aging skin and I use Retin A nightly. I started putting this on top of my retin A and LOVE the results. It seems like it piggybacks into my skin and when I wake I do not have the dry feeling from the Retin A. My skin is plump and soft. I haven't tried this alone yet but for how I am using it I am getting wonderful results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for a month and I've been very pleased with the results. My skin still feels smooth in the morning. I received this complimentary for testing purposes but I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complimentary from Influensters. This night cream is all that it clams and more. It's thick and creamy and applies very easily. Non greasy. Absorbs well. My skin is well hydrated well into the next day. I have noticed a remarkable decrease in my fine lines and smile creases. Excellent cream for aging skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the L'Oreal Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Night Balm for 3 weeks. It is very thick and makes your skin feel smooth and soft.

"I've been using this night cream for a couple weeks . It is wonderful for very dry skin. I use it on my face, neck, and chest . This product is very thick and creamy. My skin feels much firmer ,soft and smooth since I began using this cream. Also, it is great for my sensitive skin. I received this product from Influenster in exchange of my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample from Influenster of this product. I'm a L'Oreal fan, so I was excited to try this. I tried to use it every night for about 2 weeks. I love that it's not greasy and goes in soft. It kept my skin soft as I tend to have drier skin in the winter. The only flaw is the jar size as it's hard to use without getting it under your nails. I have to use my knuckle and then spread with fingers. Overall, I like it and will continue using it. Thank you Influenster for the free sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a full sized sample I received through Influenster, i reilike this product, it goes on silky not messy, it's light on your skin and leaves it feeling really smooth. I enjoy using this and will continue too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried a couple of night creams but they never impressed me as much as this one. It goes on smooth and not greasy. As I apply it my face just soaks it in and it feels so silky.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a free sample to test and I am thankful that I was picked. This balm is amazing. When I opened up the jar, I could spell the honey.

Thanks L'Oreal for this great line of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this honey night balm along with the eye gel and day cream daily for about 3 weeks. It is very thick and creamy, has a light honey scent, and absorbs well. Every morning when I wash my face, I notice how much softer and younger my face looks and feels! I am 57 years old and this balm is helping me look years younger! I received a jar free from Influenster for reviewing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this complimentary to try from Influenster and I Love it! It has been a couple weeks since I started using this and I have notice a change in my skin. It goes on like butter and my skin soaks it right in but still feel hydrated and moisturized. I've notice my skin looking and feeling lighter and soft with diminishing wrinkles and discoloration. I know when I run out I will be purchasing another jar to use. I definitely reccomend this system to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For the past few weeks I've been using the complimentary L'Oréal products I received from @influenster. This is my least favorite of the three products. It is super thick and takes awhile to absorb. After using it for a few days, it takes even longer to absorb. If you have super dry skin, it would be beneficial, but it just seems a bit too greasy to put on my face for an extended period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my free sample from Influentster. I liked the day cream. The Night cream is a lot heavier on my face. It feels a bit greasy. I am still using it because the greasiness seems to go away over night. I am a little worried that it will make my face break out with continued use. I will have to weigh in later about that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very Nice Night Cream! Like the day moisturizer it's a thicker cream but it amazes me how it melts and covers beautifully. I wake up with no more flakes in crevasses between nose and cheek or chin. My problem areas. I surely will encourage my family & friends to give this a try. I recieved these products from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first night I used this night balm I knew My face would be sticky and uncomfortable all night! I was so VERY WRONG! It's the greatest feeling on my face, ever! A must have in any nighttime regimen! My face felt so hydrated without that oily, sticky layer! Comfortable for bedtime! A little does go a long way! #influencer I received this for free to test and review! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this for free for testing purposes. The packaging is beautiful and very classy. This balm is extremely hydrating, thick and luxurious feeling. When I woke up in the morning my skin felt super soft and hydrated. I live in a dry climate and in the winter this cream could be a lifesaver. I gave it three stars because it has a strong fragrance that I didn't care for. Without the fragrance this would be a perfect night cream for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary, full sized jar of the L'Oréal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition night balm to test and it will now be a part of my nightly routine!

Older, mature skin will now look and feel better thanks to this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is definitely not for my skin. The texture is thick and very sticky. First time I used I thought I used too much so the next day I use less and still felt very tacky. This is not for me because I want to feel clean on my face. It was sticky and I had to wash it off my face. I received this complimentary from Influenster's for review purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this amazing product from Influenster to try out. What caught my attention was the honey ingredient. I've read and heard many times that honey is very healthy for the skin. This night balm is so awesome! I have dry skin and just a small amount makes a huge difference. The smell is so great, the balm is thick and creamy and my face feels great in the morning."
I received this complimentary for testing purposes and love it! It is for dry skin (mine is combination) but it still works great! I just wash off excess in the morning before getting dressed. It makes my skin feel soft and supple. Thank you L'Oreal for sending this to me to try!

I received this product from Influenster to give my honest review afterward. I love it! It is very nice as far as scent-wise. The thick creamy formula is used on my neck and face at night so in the morning I wake up with a softer complexion.

"I tried this product over the past 3 weeks and I do have to say, the product is super thick, almost a balm/mask texture. While I did find it hydrating, I had a difficult time with the consistency. It does have a very light scent which to me was pleasant. All in all, I liked the product but didnt notice much improvement in my skin other than the hydration. I had a difficult time with loving the thick consistency. I received this complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this to test through Influenster in a voxbox and here is my honest review. Though I like the texture of this cream it's just too heavy for my skin. I think it's better suited for someone who has drier facial skin than I. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and though I think it does a good job, it's just a bit too much mousturizer for my facial skin unfortunately. I guess I should feel lucky I don't have dry enough skin for this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have very dry skin and this did make my skin feel smoother. It is currently very dry where I live and I can use all this has to offer. I use it on my neck both am and pm and on my face in the pm. It has a slight scent that dissipates quickly. I rub it between my fingers and then apply and it soaks in. My skin feels very moisturized even in the morning. My skin loves honey in anything.

This product has done lovely things for my skin. After a few weeks of use my skin feels softer.

Just wonderful. Highly recommend. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love a good night cream and this fits the bill. It's a little thicker than day cream and upon waking my face is smooth and feels deeply hydrated. I did break out a few days after using this so I'm not sure what that was from. But I'll keep using this night cream as it was a free sample from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Night Balm for a couple of weeks and have really noticed that my face and neck feel firmer. It feels like putting silk on your face.

However with that being said, I used a lot less as recommended on my face and on my neck. It made my face feel like silk. I will definitely repurchase this...anything that works that well on diminhing fine lines gets my vote. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have struggled with dry skin for a few years. I have know used this night cream for about 3 weeks and my skin feels and looks so much better.

I received this product free for testing purposes but will definitely purchase it and keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary jar about three weeks ago. It works on dry areas of my skin as it's aging. However I can't use my normal routine wash, apply cream and jump in bed. It will leave marks on your pillow case. If I sit up for a couple hours it's ok. I do love how soft it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My husband has been using this product, and we have been very pleased with the results. From the very first use, there was a noticeable difference in his skin the next morning. He woke up with smooth, soft, hydrated skin. His skin was plumper, making his fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable. He has gotten the same result after each use. We received this product from Influenster for testing."
This was the last in three products I was given free to review for my honest opinion on them. The night cream is a slightly heavier version of the day cream. It seems slightly greasier but it works for a night cream. So far my skin has be doing great with all three. Very supple and plumped up. Very please with the results so far [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Night Balm became my favorite night time mask. It is more dense than usual night creams. It has a nice texture and smell.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free from Influenster and have used it for more than a week now and I can already notice a difference in my skin. The consistency of the cream is smooth and creamy without being heavy. It is easy to smooth on and is easily absorbed. My skin is smooth in the morning and the dryness I have experienced this winter is gone.
"I was offered a chance to try Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Night Balm for free and so very happy that I did. This balm has become a part of my nightly routine.

"I've been using this for 2 weeks. This is a rich, thick cream So warming it in your hands helps it spread easier. My face feels very smooth and soft.

I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this to sample and review from #Influenster. I have used this product now for 2 weeks. I have been sick which made my face even drier and in need of some intense hydration. This did it and I love the results. I use it every night before bed and wake to a soft and hydrated face. I've used so many other products that work okay but still didn't give me the results that this product did. I will continue to use this product and purchase it after my original jar is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Bought this night cream hoping to find a new product for my 67 year old skin. Nice fragrance, but quite thick. After about 3 applications my face developed a blemish . As this is the only new product I have used recently I can only assume it is this cream. Discontinued use and will return."

None. I highly recommend it and will purchase when I finish the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Thry are not kidding that this is a balm. Very thick but it melts into skin immediately and works all night. Skin feels hydrated and plump in the morning. Perfect for cold months and severely dry skin. Had a pleasant warm honey scent. Overall, I enjoyed it. But, I wish @lorealparisusa was cruelty-free. I received this product free for testing and review. @influenster #influenster #voxbox [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I finally found something that works. I'm only in my 40's but have very dry peeling skin. Within two days my skin was calm and felt hydrated. I don't have to keep reapplying all day like I did with others. Those expensive moisturizers have nothing on this. Love this line!

"I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. I am so glad I did. This is a thick and creamy moisturizer. It stays on your skin throughout the night. I am so used to other moisturizers that feel like water and you can't tell they are even on. This one is different. It seeps into your skin, instantly moisturizing. My skin feels as though it is being hyrated all night long. I'm loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm very fussy about what use on my face as I still have acne. I received this product as a tester and was very happy I received the Manuka honey product as I use ths honey in my tea.

I received this product from Influenster complimentary for my honest review of the product. I am pleased to say I have found a new night cream. This formula is rich and really soaks in to my extremely dry skin. I was shocked to see how soft my skin was the next morning. I have been using this product nightly for over a week and really LOVE it. I have used products twice and three times the price without the same benefits. I am sold.

This product is amazing. This was a tester product. I have gotten many compliments for this product. It feels absolutely amazing. And works very well. I can already tell the difference in the fine lines. And leaves your face feeling amazing. Thank you L'Oréal I love your products. Super great and really works.
This product was received complimentary in return for an honest review.
This is not my typical type of facial product so I was worried due to the texture. It is very dense but does go on nicely without feeling like a film over your face. It still allowed my skin to breathe while moisturizing. I do have mature skin and I like the way it filled out my face with plumped up hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Do buy this thick luxury cream for your face. It has a light clean scent. Even though the cream is thick it sinks in quickly. I have sensitive skin and I did not have any issues with this cream. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and my skin feels much softer and much less dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. It is really moisturizing. My face feels smoother. The only draw back is it has a pretty strong smell. It is not a bad smell, but rather a pleasant smell. Some people may not like that. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I would recommend this to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product via Influenster to try. I am so happy with it!! I have very dry skin due to winter weather and menopause. This product gives me great moisture without a shiny greasey film.

"My first impression of the Age Perfect Hydra Nutirition Honey Night Balm upin opening the jar was how strongly scented it is, (I tend to stay away from scented skincare) however I dipped in and it is a truly thick balm. I found it not easily spreadable on the face, and just felt waxy - not melting into the skin, just sitting on top. After about 40 minutes on my skin, the scent was still very strong. I am 56 years old, with normal skin type. I received this item complementary for reviewing purposes from Influenster."
"Received""free"" from #Influenster to try..I love it! I dont normally use night creams that often, but I really like this..although it's a balm, it doesn't feel heavy on my skin. My face feels soft and the cream smells great too...no heavy scent while I'm trying to sleep.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a rich balm. I really like it and use it under my eyes also and sometimes on my hands. I did not notice a scent and it did not make me greasy. It also did not clog my pores like so many other night creams. If it were in a pump it would be something I would repurchase. I received this product at no charge on exchange for my honest and thoughtful opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free from Influenster and L'Oreal, just for trying this product. And I am glad I was selected to review this Night Balm. It is thick, but soft and melts into the skin beautifully. The smell is delightful. The hydration is the best. I did not know I needed night cream until I missed putting on my cream one evening. It was like my face was craving it. I will continue to use this product after this study. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary to review. It has a slight pleasant smell and is a very very thick consistancy. I rub it together in my hands til it melts a little and then apply. While the applying part wasn't super pleasant, the look of my skin in the morning was absolutely more moisturized! My skin really loved it! I probably wouldn't purchase on my own. I like something that soaks in more on contact. But it you want a very serious heavy cream this would be it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was super thick and heavy on my skin. It caused my face to sweat in late December weather. The consistency was like lip balm in that it was hard to spread on my skin. Even after rubbing it for a while to get it to be softer. I had to rub hard to get the product over my skin. Not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this free to try. It works so great. It goes on so smooth and easy and immediately absorbs into my skin. It is Pratt of my daily routine now. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love this night cream. It is very thick but it almost melts into my skin. It does leave me feeling a bit greasy but not for long and it's at night so it doesn't really matter. The scent is wonderful yet very subtle. My skin feels moisturized and I don't wake up feeling dry. I only give it 4 stars because I've only used it for 2 weeks and haven't noticed any other benefits from it other than moisturizing. I received this product complimentary for testing.

I've been using this product in conjunction with the day cream and have never been happier! I live in Arizona and noticed as I got older I needed to change up my routine. My skin was very dry and this night cream is what I needed. I feel hydrated all through the day. I forgot to put it on one day but my face didn't feel dry. I received this product for my honest opinion and will now be a part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for review. This product has an unusual texture that I really enjoy. Appears solid until you touch it. Then it appears to melt. It goes in so smoky and leaves my skin so soft. I really enjoy this product and will continue to use it.
I received a complimentary jar of this night cream for testing purposes and my honest opinion. I have to say I love it!!

All in all I do like this product as my skin does feel more hydrated and less dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product to try and review from Influenster. When I first open the jar I saw how heavy this cream seemed and was very skeptical. But after trying it I love how it makes my skin feel.

"I was a little skeptical about this night cream. I received it as part of a free trial. I was really worried about it leaving my skin feeling greasy. I have older and aging skin but still have a some oily areas in my t zone. This felt really heavy to the touch. But when I smoothed it in my face, it did not leave an oily residue. I really like it and I think it is great for all skin types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for a week. I'm not a regular user of night creams. After trying this, I've become one! Smells great, feels luxurious, makes my skin feel wonderful.

"I received this as a free product but I would purchase this myself having used it now for several days. In my mind, I am much younger, but my skin doesn't know that! LOL.That's OK. I just don't want to be using something that smells like my grandmother's cold cream. This product has a smooth texture a very nice light citrus fragrance and is not oily. This is not your grandmother's cold cream. I wake up in my face still looks refreshed and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved This complimentary from Influenster. My first thought was wow this is thick.at first I didn't think it moisturized as well as my other products but as I continued them it has proven to be deeply moisturizing. I am pleased with my results so far and will continue to see if it gets even better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have to say that Age Perfect Hydra Nutrtion Honey Night Balm is an excellent face cream. Its the perfect consistency for mature skin in need of some hydration. I like that it actually feels more like a balm as it glides on easily and gives me a dewey complexion. The scent is nice and light. I received this free complimentary product to test and review.

I received this complimentery product to try from Influenster that said. L'Oréal always has Innovated cutting edge products using newest go to ingredients at a reasonable prices. Paraben free and ultra hydrating.
Would have been 5 stars but does have a perfume scent when you first apply. Dissipates quickly so not bad I am just highly sensitive to smells [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product from Influenster in my Vox box. I wanted to use it before I wrote my review. My face was dry, starting to show wrinkles and I just felt I was looking old. After using this product for a few days I can tell you that I am seeing a very big difference in my skin! It feels and looks amazingly better! Thank you Influenster for the opportunity to try this product! I suggest you run, not walk, to get this product for your dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a heavier moisturizer. They recommend rubbing it between your fingers to warm and help it blend into skin, and I think this is a must -- if I did not do this, it sat a bit too heavily on my skin. A little goes a long way! Very moisturizing, with a light and pleasant fragrance that does not linger."
I received a complimentary product for testing purposes. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary to try and used it together with day cream. It went on creamy and made my skin feel so good! Sorry, smooth, hydrated and pampered! The smell is just wonderful, like being in a high end spa! I will definitely consider buying again although it doesn't take a whole lot of product each use so will be a while! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first time I used it I took enough to slather on the whole of the upper half of my body. After I discovered the proper amount to use I love this product. It made my face feel silky soft and not so dull and drab. It also helped my foundation go on much better. I can't tell if this has helped the tinkles or not but I definitely feel like my skin looks better. I also love the smell of this product. I am a beekeeper so anything with honey on it has my vote [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for review....and I have to say I am so glad I did! This is the best night cream I have used to date. It has only been two weeks but the dry patches are gone! I struggle with dry skin and it is so much worse in the winter, this was not greasy or heavy at all on my skin. No strong smell at all. I will be adding L'Oréal Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Night Balm to my nightly routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this from Influenster for my honest evaluation. It is very similar to the Golden Balm, and I believe it is a reformulation of that product. I am layering it over my Retin A, and it adds serious moisture with a slightly oily texture. I was previously using a hyaluronic acid cream topped with a facial oil, so I don't mind a little bit of a greasy feeling. There is a mild fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have never used a balm night cream like this one. It feels so nice on the skin, nourishing without being too heavy or greasy. I am 57 with not many wrinkles and combination skin, so cannot use anything too heavy at night or it will clog my pores. This does not. A little goes a long way and this jar will last a very long time. I received a sample to review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Night Balm is the bomb! My skin was so dry and flaky that when I put on makeup it just caked up and was splotchy looking. After using Night Balm even for a couple of days I've seen a HUGE improvement in my skin. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Night Balm! My skin felt really morturized on the first night I used it and even more after a couple of days. My sface feels so smooth and soft. I am happy that I received a complementary sample of this product for testing.
I also got this as a sample. I have very dry skin with fine lines and wrinkles. This does everything that it says it does. My skin is more hydrated and it looks and feels better! The consistence if this skin cream is light but it works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was given this product for free to try through Influenster. It has a wonderfully creamy texture, but not too thick. It goes on smooth and soaks right in. At first it has a nice, but somewhat perfume smell that I am sensitive to and don't like, but it goes away fast and is not a deal breaker. It makes my skin feel and look great. I would highly recommend this night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am enjoying this. It is very thick but a little bit will do the job. I put this on at night before bed and it feels very good. I cannot smell any type of over the top fragrance. My skin looks so much better and plumper. It has made a big difference in a short time I have sensitive dry skin and have had no issues with irritation etc. I received this product from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received these products complimentary for testing purposes about a week ago. Have been using nightly and can feel an overall difference in the feel of my skin. Thick moisturizer that spreads evenly without an unpleasant smell [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is thick... like a paste. Which is good, you only need a little bit, and your face is completely covered. I was worried at first that it was going to sit on my skin like a mask, but it did soak right in. The current price is good for what it is so I will most likely purchase more of this in the future. I received this product complementary as a product test [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok I got up this morning after using the night balm that I received to review and test free from Influenster and my face was still feeling mostiture I absolutely love this stuff so I washed my face and applied the day cream and it smells awesome not heavy at all love it would recommend every lady use this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is almost like a balm. Very moisturizing, a little too much for my combo skin. Woke up to very soft skin. A little bit too fragrant as well tho a nice scent. Drier skin types will love this! *I received this product free for testing from Influencer for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a demo to test and review from Influenster. Although the day cream felt too heavy on my skin,, this night cream feels ok to wear at night. You can feel it and it's even a bit sticky but it definitely nourishes your skin. My skin still felt sort after washing it off in the morning. I will continue to use it and see how well it works over the long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this in my voxbox from influenster & was quite excited to try this out! I'm usually not one to put anything on my face/neck at night so this was a big step for me!! When I first opened the jar, I was thinking the cream is quite thick & that it would just cake my face. I was pleasantly surprised & it soaked right in & was very moisturizing & not greasy feeling at all!! No immediate results as of yet because I just started using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only have been using this for the first time tonight.

"This is, without a doubt, amazing. I was a bit skeptic at first since I have oily skin and this is a balm but oh was I surprised. This product absorbed quickly and made my face feel so soft that I wanted to use it everywhere!! Upon waking, my face was not a bit oily but soft, firm and supple. I also noticed the reduction in appearance of fine lines. I received this product complimentary for review and am so happy!! My previous cream has just been replaced and I'm saving money on the switch."
I received this through influenster to review. I had never used a night cream before but now that Im older Im glad I did. It wasnt greasy and soaked into my skin. The next morning my skin felt so soft. I would prefer it to not be so thick though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried many night creams and I am usually disappointed for one reason or the other. This cream is rich without being clumpy. It feels whipped and I wake up with soft skin without it going on greasy. I also love the faint scent. I think L'Oréal does do a good job for those of us with mature skin bum 54 I did receive this for free and I know some readers will be skeptical. But give it a try and i think you will agree that this is a very good product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

After receiving the night cream as a free sample from L'Oréal I immediately put it to use. I liked the clean smell and creamy texture that the night balm has. The thicker texture provides a longer layer for overnight penetration into your skin. I noticed a softer feeling to my skin the next morning. It was an immediate change. I will continue to use this balm to see the long term results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I guess I should mention that I am 70, and always strive to take care of my skin. I have very few wrinkles/ lines, but, I can't seem to fight gravity."
"So far, so good. I've only been using this for a few days, but have noticed that the skin under my eyes is staying more hydrated than usual. Between seasons, I usually get dry, flaky patches under my eyes until my skin adjusts to the weather, but they haven't appeared so far! Fingers crossed that this continues to be the case!"
"I am very surprised to see the high ratings for this product. I tried it twice thinking that maybe I just got a bad batch the first time but it was the same both times. It is too thick, does not apply smooth, and does not obsorb well. In the morning, I had to wipe it off. No matter how thin you try to apply it you will see residue. I only gave it three stars because I have tried so many eye creams that are not even as good as this one. I will not use this product again. Regular Age Perfect Eye Cream is much better than this cream."
Use this overnight and I could not believe the results in the morning. A beautiful new skin glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using this product for less then a week and already notice significant improvement. I started using this product to treat my dark circles and crows feet and couldn't believe how fast this product started to work! As a single mom, I am always looking for the BEST products at the most affordable prices and I know that is what I've found with this product! It is more effective and works twice as fast as the more costly brands. I will be a faithful user from now on!"
"I never write a review but I just had to take the time for this product. I am 39 yrs old and the skin around my eyes is always dry no matter how much I moisturize. I've bought some expensive creams with no results and they all sting terribly when I first apply them. This cream is so gentle, does not irritate my skin and has corrected the dryness within days. I will be a faithful user!"
"This eye cream feels so luxiurious! It's fragrance free which is a plus, too! It is very emollient and is great for lines and wrinkles as well as thinning skin under the eyes. I've replaced my department store brand with this eye cream since it feels exactly the same."
Smooth cream that feels light and non greasy. Excellent under a tinted foundation. Worth the money.
"This product is amazing. I had horrible dry skinaround my eyes. With this product, I saw results that day and the dry skin was done within 2 days. Love this balm!"
I bought this a couple weeks ago because I like other Age Perfect products. I find it great for night use but too heavy for day. I would not wear this under eye makeup.
This one saved me from a lot of cold winter nights !
It is Amazing and works very well on my face!!!!!!
