"I have only used it a month so far so my wrinkles aren't completely gone, but it seems like it's working. I just started using the Dickinson's Witch hazel toner enhanced with vitamin E before I put on the toner. It's supposed to take about 3 months to see a significant difference so I will have to update this review them. So far it seems great an be doesn't make my skin irritated at all. I am 53, btw."
"I love this stuff! Not only do I use this on my face, neck and chest, but also on my hands. Iâm stunned at how well this is working. Very, very pleased!"
"I've used many bottles of this serum. I put it on a large brown growth every morning and night. It just flaked off. No bleeding. I will continue to purchase. My skin is much smoother with fewer brown spots. Doesn't irritate my skin. I use it on the backs of my hands, too. I can see and feel a difference"
I receive so many compliments about my face since using this serum. I especially benefit by adding IQ to St Ives Timeless Collagen Elastin moisturizer. Skin especially benefits when applied to moist very warm skin to penetrate to lower layers of the facial skin below the surface. I also massage around eye area.
"I use that during the day and use the retinol serum at night. I had been beginning to see little things I did't like, the beginnings of wrinkles, tired skin, it just wasn't as luminous as I like. It's been a few weeks using these products and I am hooked. Reasonably priced and effective. I love that this Retinol Vitamin A Serum. My skin looks great and I think it'll keep improving. I'll definitely keep buying."
"This is my first Retinol purchase and I am VERY impressed! I started off, as suggested, by using every other day and now I use every night as part of my nightly beauty routine. I have noticed a massive difference already"
Iâve been using this a couple weeks and I am surprised at the difference itâs made to the way I look. Itâs not moisturizing exactly and I donât feel any different but I look different. I look better. Noticeably better. I will continue to use this product.
Really my skin is so plumed after a month using these two. and my skin is many improvement after using this product.
"I admit when I received this product, I thought the bottle/packaging seemed really cheaply made. But the instant I tried it for the first time I could FEEL it tightening my skin. It's amazing. It's the only anti-aging product I've tried that really felt like it was doing something! I use it after every shower and follow it with St Ives Timeless moisturizing cream. It's a keeper for sure! I'll definitely be reordering when this bottle runs out, but I expect it will last a good while."
"We are very happy with ours results so far. I use the retinol at bedtime, allowing it to dry and then applying a nighttime moisturizer. I have been using it for three weeks and there is definitely an improvement in the appearance of fine lines in my face."
"awesome serum! the results are immediate. Love it, will defenetely purchase more"
I see it using my sister and she is happy she use start this retinol serum last 1 month ago. I know it work well.
This is a great product. It has the same ingredients as the way more expensive brands. It is gentle and your skin absorbs this serum right away. You won't be sorry if you purchase this product.
I've only been using these products for several days and I can see drastic improvements in my complexion! rally retinol vitamin working too
"So far I have not noticed any changes, so I`m going to have to say no I would not purchase this product again! Waste of time and money."
