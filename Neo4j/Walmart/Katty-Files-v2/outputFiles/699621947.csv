I received a sample of Olay Shea butter foaming body wash and have been hooked since my skin issues have totally improved since I been using. I struggle with bad razor burn and first use I seen a major improvement. I am so great full that I found this product I feel so confident since thank you Olay for this amazing body wash.
"Wow I got my sample and I was shocked what was in this, it is so perfect, I am in love with this new product, the feeling it leaves my skin , the most beautiful scent and I love how light it is! How far just a lil bit goes. Get your sample and I promise your not gonna be disappointed! I fell in love with this product"
"I got a sample of this in the mail and I was skeptical. Usually whipped or mousse type of washes just dissolve nothing, but not this one. It was thick, rich, and luxurious feeling that didnt leave a residue and left my skin so soft and smelled great. It also goes a long way, other foaming body washes I have tried also seem to empty very quickly..not this one. I am definately a fan. AND I makes an awesome shave cream."
"Recently tried Olays foaming body wash in Shea butter, and absolutely loved it! First thing I loved and found was the fact that it's a foaming body wash, not only did I find that to be super unique but it's also really convenient. This foam body wash smells amazing and the scent lasts a long time. I found this body wash to lather extremely well and a little goes a long way, it also left my skin feeling baby soft and super smooth. Overall this is a fantastic product and I would highly recommend to anyone!"
"I received a sample of the shea butter Whip and I love it! It's so smooth and silky, leaves no residue and it lasts forever. I can't wait for it to be gone so I can try a different scent."
"I received a sample in the mail. The first time I used it, I was amazed. My skin is silky smooth. I feel sexy. It also smells amazing. I will definitely be buying more."
I recieved a free trial and i loved it!!!! Will go a but the full size bottle! It was so rich and creamy! I thought the foam would be thin but it was not! And the scent was smazingð
"This product is wonderful. I have dry skin and after using it for two weeks I can tell a difference in how soft my skin is. It has a sent that is light, the foam is luxurious and rich."
"I signed up for a free sample and loved it! It works as a body wash and shaving cream. I can't wait to buy the full version and use it all summer. Fragrance was perfect, by the way!"
It smells very good and it's so soft on the skin. I got a free sample to try and loved it. Even my 4 year old daughter loves it. I had to buy both of us one. This is my favorite one but she prefers the strawberry one. Amazing work!!
I received a free sample and will definitely buy other scents. The product felt amazing and I loved the softness it left. Great new and fun way to use body wash.
"Signed Up For The Sample And I Was Really Surprised With How Fast It Came. I Was Very Happy With The Side And To Come In A Small But Convenient Size, There Is No Mess Left Behind."
"First of all thank you so much for the free sample! I absolutely loved it. I love the design of the bottle, the smell, how soft it felt on my skin. And we adults like to have fun products too. I'm excited to try the other scents."
"I didnt expect much from this. I thought it sounded kind of gimmicky. I love olay, but the idea of a foam body wash was something i had never considered. On a whim, I decided to grab it. I have really dry skin, and eczema. I wore capri bottoms to bed and seriously every time my legs would hit each other my skin was SO soft. My arms were soft, everything felt moisturized so much more so than ive ever felt from any other body wash or soap! Its great, and worth a try. Not only that, it smelled great!"
"I could not believe the results I got after using this foaming body wash!! I have super dry skin, especially during fall/winter and this seriously helped me regained moisture and softness in my skin and let me just say.....the smell is amazing. It's not too strong and overpowering, like it's literally perfect! I got so many of my friends on this and now they're all obsessed with olay products!"
I love the smell of all these scents-- but I would have to say the Shea butter is my favorite (followed by Strawberry + Mint as a close second!) I used the shea butter in the shower yesterday and the smell was with me the rest of the day which I loved! Fun texture too-- excited to continue using!
This body wash is a huge YES from me. The shea butter scent is AMAZING but you honestly can't go wrong with any of them. A little product goes a looooong way so you get so much value for such an affordable price point. The lather is very thick and my skin is left so soft and fragrant after using. Hands down a repurchase for me!
OMG! I am obsessed with this new body wash! I love anything that smells like Shea Butter and love the way this foams up. It's like a shaving cream consistency and takes your shower or bath to next level luxurious on a budget. Olay has really done it again and I'm happy to say I will be a repeat customer for this! All of the scents are amazing by the way so easy to try them all at the great price point!
"This product is AMAZING! We love how much product you get in the bottle for the price! When it comes out of the bottle a little goes a long way, and it feels so nice when you smooth it on your skin! When you rinse it off your skin feels so soft! We would totally buy this product again and again!"
"As a new mom, my shower time is SO limited and when I saw the Shea Butter Foaming Whip Body Wash, I figured it would be fun and feel a bit luxe. The texture of the product is my favorite - so thick and a little goes a long way. My skin feels soft and smells clean and fresh after use and leaves my bathroom smelling like a spa!"
This product is not at all runny. Its rich and creamy and leaves your skin so soft
Received a sample and love this product. I am looking to purchase it for the first time
It has the most lightweight formula i have ever seen literally feels like air it will make ur skin really soft and smooth looking ❤️
This makes my skin soft and I love it. Wish the scent stayed on longer. I still love it especially when I shave my legs.
I was amazed at the quality of this Foam Wash. I have very sensitive skin and not only does this product smell amazing but it left my skin feeling super soft and moisturized!
I've fallen so in love with this product. It's so easy to use and smells amazing. You will feel so clean after but not stripped at all! This scent is my favorite but I've tried all three & they are all so great!
"I used this product for the first time, and I love it"
Loved its fragrance and the softness. Would definitely use it again and again.
This stuff is amazing! The scent lingered all day and my skin felt silky smooth!
Love love love this product! So lightweight yet moisturizing ♥️ I give it a thumbs up! Will add this to my body care routine!
"The Shea Butter scent smells great! It has just the right amount of subtle freshness that is t overpowering but also lingers just a bit. I love it! I've used Olay bar soap and gel body wash and was intrigued by the foam texture. At first I thought it would be weird to just spray the foam into my hand, rub it in and then rinse. But then, I tried it and it was so simple and my skin felt super-soft."
"I love a nice, steamy shower at the end of a long day, and I want to be able to enjoy it as much as possible. With these my evenings are full of luxuriously fluffy bubbles and clean skin. These dispense THE richest foam that is an absolute blast to play with. A little bit right in your hand will cover your whole body, leaving you with soft skin."
"The Shea Butter scent is my all time favorite, it is such a nice subtle clean scent. The whip foam is seriously a shower game-changer, and the soft foam really makes shower time easy and relaxing. It easily stays in your hand to apply effortlessly onto your skin and lathers into a luxe foam all on its own! I love how a little goes a very long way. I am seriously obsessed!"
"This leaves my skin feeling so soft, and is super creamy on the skin - I love the whipped texture! It lathers up so beautifully and washes off clean, and leaves behind a subtle scent that isn't overpowering. It's also great that it's so affordable and a little goes such a long way!"
I am super picky with body washes due to the smell. I love a sweet smell but not when it's over powering. I have now tried all three of the Olay Whip Body Washes and can confidently say that are everything I've been looking for in a body wash. I also love that when you turn your hand to put the cap back on the foam doesn't slide off your hands! HALLELUJAH!! haha! I actually plan to give a bottle to all my friends for Christmas in stockings.
"I tried using 5 times already and i have to use at least 3 pumps to feel clean at all, this product does not lather up at all there is no suds hardly either to even make me feel like it is cleaning my body and for this price its a waste of money. Ill be done with the bottle way before the thirty days at this rate."
This feels like I'm washing with shaving cream. Feels like I ran out of regular soap does not feel like soap at all. I have been using it for two weeks now . I do not feel clean with this product. I put it on a washcloth and luffa . I just shave my legs with it now it doesn't lather up like soap. I buy body soap I don't buy bar soap this foam dose not even come close to body soap . it should be OLay shaving cream not foaming body wash. I don't feel like this product is worth the money
"As a user of the Olay Shea Butter body wash already, I was very excited to try a foaming version! The foam comes out very similarly to a shave gel: thick and luxurious. It goes on your body more lightweight though. It's like body wash that's already lathered! I found it went on smoothly and rinses off cleanly. I love it!

Very convenient product to use for travel. Product feels great - double use as shaving cream. Made my skin feel nice and smooth. The whip is definitely unique - still unsure what long term benefits it will offer. Also curious to see how long it lasts in comparison to similarly sized body washes. Will use again!

"I have been a big fan of Olay products for years and was excited to try Olay Foaming Whip Body Wash - Shea Butter. It was not what I thought it would be. While it was easy to dispense, it looked and felt like I was putting shaving cream all over my body. I did not have a good, clean feeling afterwards, and it felt like it took longer to wash. I did not care for the scent, though it was not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay whip foaming body wash, Shea butter, is fun to use. It's lathery and I felt like you only need a little bit which goes a long way. The body wash left my skin feeling soft. It was super nice compared to the regular body wash from olay. It was very easy to push and dispense the foam. The only reason it's not a five stars is because it's a small can and the price is high for ounces. It's a nice body wash and would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried Olay Foaming Whip Shea Butter Body Wash and liked it! The scent was fairly strong and lingered after showering; it reminded me of a fresh laundry type scent. The wash itself was easy to use and rather fun to play around with! It was very gentle on my skin and left it feeling soft, with a light moisturizing residue. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun alternative to traditional body wash or gel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product. It works so well in the shower. It goes on easy. It made my skin feeling very soft. Easier to use than other products I have used. Would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys using a shower product that is very easy to apply and leaves your skin silky soft. I would use this when I travel or camping.

I've always love Olay products and this Olay Foaming Whip Body Wash will probably become my favorite body wash. The foam was so decadent when I first tried it. It went on my skin like silk. I've been using a liquid body wash and this makes it seem so weak compared to the whipped body wash. My skin felt so smooth and moist after showering. It made shaving my legs a breeze too.

"At first glance the product looked like a mouse styling product from the outside, so it was a bit hard to find. The actual product came out nice and foamy with a creamy light texture. It did not smell like shea butter when dispensed, but smelled light and fragrant once it was rinsed clean your skin. It was a thicker foam so it did not rinse with steam from the shower, but I had actually to rinse it off with water and hands. In all a nice product other than the initial unpleasant scent.

"The shea butter Olay Foaming Whip Body Wash is lovely overall. I like the texture if the body wash, it feels like as air. I also enjoy the shea butter smell. This product quickly replaces my previous body wash in the shower! I will continue to use this and will try out the other scents in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Foaming Whip Shea Butter Body Wash is my new go to! I love the Shea Butter scent and how soft it makes my skin after use. I prefer the Foaming Body Wash to regular Olay Shea Butter Body Wash. The thick foam is easy to spread all over the body to cleanse and hydrate. I am loving using it and look forward to trying the lavender and strawberry varieties.

"Olay whips body wash is amazing! It smelled wonderful and the lather was great! I did not feel any sticky residue afterwards either. The foam was actually pretty fun too! As adults shower time is not fun time like it once was, using the foam made me feel like a kid again! It was fun to play with and it got me clean! The fragrance is strong which I like, and it stuck around after the shower as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Olay foaming whip body wash is fun and easy to use. It's light and foamy with a clean scent. I like how the Olay whip foam feels light and luxurious when it dispenses and smooth my skin.
The bottle seems like a good size but I don't think it will last for a long time therefore I think it's a bit expensive. I would still recommend it because it's fun and my skin feels soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this stuff! Super luxurious feel plus smells amazing!
The smell the texture just about everything on this product has simply blown me away ! So amazing
I absolutely love this stuff. It comes out as a beautiful foam thats never stripping or drying on my skin. It keeps me feeling hydrated. Couldn't recommend highly enough.
I just love the smell on my skin after using this product. Great price & I love how smooth it leaves my skin.
I just bought my first bottle and I love it! It makes me feel so soft and smells so amazing! I absolutely love this.
