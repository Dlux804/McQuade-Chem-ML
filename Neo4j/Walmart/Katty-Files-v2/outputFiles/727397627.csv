I am sorry I didn't read the previously posted reviews before ordering this item. The content of the bottle is definitely not the original Nerium product (I was a partner with Nerium a few years ago). I am disappointed.
DO NOT BUY THIS IS OIL OF OLAY IN A NERIUM BOTTLE!!! I DON'T KNOW HOW WALMART DOESN'T STOP THIS AS THEY CAN CLEARLY SEE THIS IS A RIP OFF!!! REPEAT DO NOT BUY!!!
BUYER BEWARE! This is NOT the real Nerium! Nerium Int'l went under. Their new night cream is JUNK. But I tracked down the REAL STUFF!
If I could have gone on without clicking one star I would have. This is in a Nerium container but it is not Nerium. Not happy at all a complete ripoff
Not authentic. Phony product
"First tip-off that it's a knock-off is the fragrance. I have the real thing which I just got from a distributor so I was able to compare. Container is slightly different, too. I wasted $80."
