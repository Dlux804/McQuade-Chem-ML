It's not too heavy, yet still moisturizes and leaves my skin feeling soft and looking it's best when I wake up. I haven't used it long enough to speak on it's long term advantages or effects but from my experience with this night cream I'd certainly recommend it.

Omg I love this stuff ❤️ Smells amazing and makes my face feel so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Im a guy and haven't paid attention to facial moisturizing until my 30s. I live in a very dry climate and started using this recently to care for my sun abused face. The scent is light and a little bit goes a long way. No crazy results on the lines in my face but my skin definitely looks and feels moisturized and healthy. This is also at a very good price point for the quality. Will be a repeat buyer.
"I've used the whole bottle now and I have to say this night cream has made my skin so smooth and soft. I was afraid to try this because of my sensitive skin, but I haven't broken out. This cream has left my skin so soft and moisturized. I would recommend to anyone who has sensitive and dry skin. The best part is the smell. It's a clean refreshing smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream smells wonderful and feels nice on the skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn't make my skin feel oily. I have not noticed much of a difference with fine lines, but it feels good and is gentle on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Used this product every day for the past 30 days and it works great. No terrible smell, no oily residue, I didn't break out and my wrinkles were reduced. Can't wait to see what the next 30 days holds in store for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night cream does a good job of keeping the skin hydrated compared to others within the same price range. It has negligible smell (I am very sensitive to any kind of smell in my cosmetics) and doesn't feel greasy on the skin after the first few mins of application [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is super rich. It feels so luxurious when applying. It is a bit thicker so maybe good for people with dry skin, perfect in winter. It absorbs fairly well and doesn't leave a heavy greasy feel, but it is still kind of silky on top. I hadn't heard of this brand before but would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product more as a general moisturizer than a night cream. I like it's thick consistency, but light feel. The scent is pleasant, and I'm usual very sensitive to scented products. I also have very sensitive skin and usually use unscented and very simple lotions. This was a fun switch up and worked well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Klassikko Restoring night cream worked amazingly. It worked 100% better than other creams I have tried. I would definitely buy this product! I wasn't aware of this product before participating but I am very glad I did. My skin has improved and is no longer dry. The cream is very smooth and makes your skin so soft without greasy residue. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had heard the brand before but had never tried it. I'm so glad I have now had the chance. This product left my face feeling incredibly soft throughout the night into the next morning. I'd for sure buy this again. It's better than other leading brands in my opinion. I definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer goes on thick and absorbs quickly, leaving a light feel. It helped my chapped nose and skin bounce back from the abuse of a bad cold, and has been very helpful in the dry weather. I do prefer unscented products and am sensitive to strong scents, but this had a very light scent that did not bother me or longer too long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is awesome and made my skin feel so soft! It absorbs really fast and doesn't leave a heavy feeling after. This is better than a lot of other night creams I've used because I like how it doesn't feel heavy on my skin. I really like the smell of it too. I have recommended it to a few people already!

"I live in Michigan and we have been suffering through some intensely cold winter days with subzero temperatures. My skin and face are so dried out and this night cream came to the rescue. I typically have problem with breakouts but this did not cause any inflammation of my skin. I would also use it around some really dry patches of skin on my face and neck during the day as well. And it smells awesome, kind of flowery but in a really good way. Will buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"First an foremost, I'm kind of upset they're sourcing water from natural springs in the Artic. Just leave the artic alone... When I put it on my face felt really good.

This moisturizer is gentler and less greasy than other moisturizers that I've used. It is thicker in consistency. I would buy it again especially at just under $10. I was not aware of this product until i participated in the program. I would recommend this product to others especially if they have sensitive skin or are looking for a more gentle product.
