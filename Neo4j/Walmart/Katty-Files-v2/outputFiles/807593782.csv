"I've been using this cream for years. It's great for chapped or dry skin, and prevents this from happening if applied before going out. Soothing for abrasions. Great for healing"
I would not be without this cult classic. I worked for Elizabeth Arden for 7 years....l know the history behind its multitude of uses. It got the name 8 hr skin protective because it heals within 8 hours.
My mother has used this forever. She is in her eighties and everyone comments about how great she looks. Best endorsement ever.
