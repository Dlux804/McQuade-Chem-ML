I do feel like my skin looks and feels better. I will continue to use this serum. I did receive this product free in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product in a VoxBox from influenster and was thrilled! The packaging is gorgeous and the red vial looks amazing.

I even have my mom on board and in a week we have noticed smoother more vibrant skin and some of her dark spots have started to fade. Definitely a great product for skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using this glycolic acid serum for a week now and I really like the results I am seeing. My dark spots are appearing lighter and my skin tone seems more even. When first applying it to my face it was very thick and sticky so I was turned off by it at first
"However, once it dries it is not sticky at all and really is effective. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok let me tell you, I suffer from acne and I have a lot of dark spot cuz the acne. I started trying the serum which I really like the texture.

I have been using this product for a few days now and love it. I love the dropper and it smooths onto skin easily and dries quickly. The tone and texture of my skin has shown almost immediate results. It looks smoother and more alive than I've seen it look in years. Definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only tried a handful of serums since I turned 30- searching to preserve my youth. This serum is light, not sticky, and fragrance free! A little goes a long way! I have been using the serum day and night for a week now, and have noticed a more even skin tone- and overall clarity to my skin. When using the L'Oreal revitalift skincare line all together, my skin feels baby smooth! Apply immediately after washing your face for the best results.

After just a few days of using this along with the revitalift moisturizer, my skin looks brighter and is so soft!

"This is a staple for my skin food. For my aging skin, I use a product that skin needs. It is essential to combat fine lines and wrinkles. I love that it is fragrance free. Some products have that strong smell of glycolic acid. For this serum, it is very lightweight and I even apply it as a primer for my dewy looks. I use this after cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing. It works competitively like a prestige brand. I super love it because it's easy on the budget yet proven to give results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Can't wait to see more results! #complimentary #revitalift @lorealskin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product suprised me. I was skeptical about trying a drug store skin care regimen and I am blown away. This product was sent to me along with a few others to try and review, usually I don't like the complimentary products enough to follow through with a review but wow! I'm only on day 3 of using this serum and I have noticed an improvement. I would highly recommend trying revitalift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary to try out and I honestly love it! I'm extremely picky about my skincare and what I use and I truthfully have added this to my daily routine! It feels luxurious without paying an arm and a leg, and after using both the serum and moisturizer my skin felt so incredibly soft and revamped which is exactly what I need after working a hard job where I sweat a lot and get dirty. I recommend this 100% [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I could feel my skin get a bit tighter after the use! Totally love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First of all the size of this serum is huge! Excellent value for the price. Glycolic is one of my favorite ways to exfoliate since it's less harsh than using physical exfoliators. This serum is super lightweight and has no smell. It absorbs quickly and my skin feels really smooth! I received this for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Got this in my Influenster VoxBox and have 2 weeks now using it, so far my skin loves it. My skin looks less tired and really revitalized plus absorbs super quick and does not let my skin shiny. I have oily skin and while using my skin looks very smooth and free of oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I was so excited to try this product as I was seeing all the good reviews online.

*I recieved this to test from Influenster & Loreal. All opinions are my own.
I really liked adding this into my skincare routine.
"It absorbs into the skin nicely. I use it morning and night and have notice my skin is brighter, plump and feels so much softer. I would 100% recommend and will repurchase when I run out."
I have been using this serum for about a month now and honestly has actually made my face smoother. I did learn that you don't need a lot. When I would get too much I would just rub the rest on my neck and chest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this trial through Influenster and I do like the product. I wouldn't say I love it but it has definitely helped with my acne and my acne scars. I like the feeling of the serum and it is not sticky at all. I put it on right after my toneR and then later my moisturizer on it and my SPF [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has helped change my skin! but I am not even to consistent with it as id like to be and I can honestly say my pores have shrunk my skin complexion has gotten better and less acne, so as far as the overnight results, my skin literally just looks less red and more bright in the am! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been consistently using this every night. My skin does feel much smoother. I don't have a lot of skin discoloration so cannot comment on that! I can say that it has reduced some fine lines. It does dry my skin out some but I follow up with the night cream. Don't let the price scare you away.. it is works just like the expensive brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I receive this as a Sample of influenster and i took my time to use it and to try it on my face and my moms face , we could see our tone of face skin is a little more clear and our face look more radiant like shinny and healthy , it helps my mom with her wrinkles near mouth and besides it's a little sticky at the beginning then it absorbes completely . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used many glycolic acids before, usually in toner or liquid form. My skin has always reacted well to it, but in toner form, it can burn quite a bit and leave your skin feeling tight. The added aloe and the formulation of this, despite being the highest percentage of glycolic I've ever used/seen, DOESNT leave an intense burning and the added aloe helps smooth and calm skin after chemical exfoliation."
I was sent this item for free by Influenster for testing purposes.
I received this complimentary in a voxbox from Influenster and I absolutely loved it! I have really dark circles and within a week of using it I started to see them disappear. I have really dry skin because of my thyroid but this product leaves my skin super soft.
"This opinion is my own, but I did receive this product at no cost so that I could try it out. I put this on before I use the night cream. It will occasionally make my face tingle slightly, but that feeling typically only lasts about 5 sec. I'm not sure if it's this, the night cream, or the combo, but my skin does feel moisturized. And hopefully it's looking younger! I have acne prone skin and this has NOT caused me to break out. YAY!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is clear and glowing! I've been using this serum for a little over a month and my skin tone is even and glowing. I've paired it with the Unscented triple power moisturizer and love how my skin looks and feels [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this in a influenster box and I am so glad because I was in the market for a new serum. but it is pretty strong listen to the recommendation of not doing this every night I dont have sensitive skin and I feel like once I started using this sparingly I was able to see the results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
when I received this serum I was so excited to try it out. after I had gotten out of the shower I applied to a clean face. the smell is not over powering and it doesn't leave your face feeling oil. I have combination skin and it has helped tremendously with my dry patches. I will continue to use this product.
I received this through influenster to try. This recommends use in the morning and at night but since my skin gets oily pretty quick I only used it at night. I've noticed since I started using this that my skin has become smoother and firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a complimentary product from Influenster. When I received the product, I was headed to the beach. Due to the warning on the product about sun exposure, I held off on using it until I returned. I must admit that I was also a little nervous about using it because my skin has been sensitive lately. However, this product works really well and has not irritated my skin. I will definitely keep using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this product. I've been slowly trying to incorporate acids into my routine. I really like this serum. It's not sticky and sinks in quickly. After just a few weeks, my feels smoother and firmer. I would definitely consider purchasing this again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was gifted this by influenster and my skin type is oily. It takes awhile to review skincare products but from the short time I've had it I can say that it has made my skin smoother in the mornings. I used it only at night. I'm curious to see the differences this makes in the long run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complementary for testing purposes. I have fragile skin due to hashimotos disease. As such I already cannot handle sun exposure. This product is not good for use on skin like mine that is already weakened and must be kept from any kind of sun exposure. As I could not use this product for more than three days, I am not giving it a low star rating. It simply did not work with my skin; but my skin is not the average skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary product to review and am so happy with it. The dropper works really well to get just the perfect amount of product. This really makes my skin feel healthier and I can't wait to see the long term effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product!! As soon as I put it on I can feel my skin tighten (in a good way!). It also really helps even out my skin tone! My skin looks so refreshed! It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin! I highly recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for reviewing purposes. This is a great serum for everyday use! It is lightweight, I put it on at night and my skin feels perfectly moisturized in the morning, while still leaving my skin matte. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product. I like things that are good at what they do, and this serum does just that. After the first use my face was so soft and even looking immediately. That's what I call a win. I received this item complementary but that doesn't affect my review at all. Try this if you are looking for something that actually works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was very lightweight and absorbs quickly like there was nothing there. I didn't see much differences in my skin. I have super sensitive skin and the good new is that it didn't make my skin any worst. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although a little more viscous than I thought it would be, this serum absorbed nicely into the skin and worked really well with the moisturizer. In the morning, my skin felt hydrated and plump. Over time, my skin looked brighter and more supple. I do recommend using this serum at night. It doesn't work well under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this complimentary from Influenster and I gotta say, I really like the results I have gotten. I normally have red spots and blemishes all over my gave but I have noticed that my face has become more clear and I somt even have to hide behind foundation anymore! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The serum has been my favorite of this product line. I use it mostly around my eyes and forehead. I use about 5-6 drops for each application. My skin looks and feels more moisturized after using this serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for a couple weeks, and so far I really like it. I have fairly oily skin so I started out using it every night with no issues of dryness or irritation. I think it's really helped with the appearance of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an amazing serum! It compares to my more expensive brands of serums and treatments with glycolic acids, ahas, bhas, etc... It doesn't burn or tingle like some others but it does it's job. My skin is smoother and I now use this a few times a week. This was given to me for free to review with my honest opinion."
"This serum has no overpowering smell, is applied easily, and I saw improvement in my skin overall within a few weeks. As a side note, it did dry my skin a little, so you want to make sure to follow up with the moisturizer every time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited and nervous to try this product and 2 other products from this line that I received from a contest. But it left my skin really soft ❤️ I do also have sensitive skin and didn't break me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for testing purposes and have been use a little shy of 6 weeks. I use the serum every evening prior to bed. I love how smooth soft my skin feels with continued use.

"I got this item for purpose of review from Influenster. I've been using this serum as part of a 3 piece set (with L'Oréal moisturizer and spf) and I have nothing but amazing things to say about it. I love the way my skin is looking and feeling. The products are not super heavy on my face and the smell is pleasant, nothing overpowering. I will definitely be purchasing these products in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a sample from Influenster and have been using it every day. It does an excellent job keeping my skin clear, smooth, and healthy looking. The serum has a nice, smooth texture as well. I am very pleased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I was convinced it was more liquid based than it is. It's a little thick but just enough not to slide down your face but rather slowly enough to be able to rub it in. I do like how its smooth to the touch and it sticky. It's easy to apply, just make sure you tap the dropper on the glass before removing it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved a sample of this product from influenster to review. It felt velvety on my skin and absorbed quickly leaving my skin feeling hydrated. After a few days of using my skin was visibly brighter than before [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this complimentary to try out. I have acne and some dark spots. Recently after years of product use I have gotten my acne to calm down now I have texture and dark spots. This has helped with all of my texture and dark spots. Spots have lighten and my face is smoother. I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this a few weeks now along with the SPF and fragrance free moisturizer from this same line. I have rotated products using them together and each alone to get a feel for each individual product. This is the only one that I cannot see or feel a difference when using. It's a clear and watery texture product and a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample for my review. I love it. Feels wonderful when on. My skin soaks it up and I don't feel greasy at all. I have dry skin and apply their moisturizer after. No problems so far with clogged pores. I'm a fan. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given this product #complimentary from #lorealparis and #influenster. Quickly became my favorite skin-care product. Notice a difference in my skin tone, wrinkles, dark spot in hist a few days. Amazing!! I couldn't be happier with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This serum was exactly what my face needed! I'm getting married in two weeks and this has noticeably made a difference in my overall skin tone on my face. My face has never felt better! Definitely take it slow if you have sensitive skin like me. It's worth the wait of going slow and building up a tolerance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this! Doesn't irritate my skin, and I wake up feeling like my skin is glowing! Really smoothes, evens, and hydrates me! I can see the difference in my skin in just a few weeks! I will definitely keep using it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample to try. I hadn't heard of this specific type of skin product before so I had no idea what to expect, but I am pleasantly surprised! My skin feels smoother and my skin tone looks much"
More even overall! This is so easy to apply and a little goes a long way making this an awesome value! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product food a Motl's over a month now and it's definitely become a part of my evening routine. Goes to easily and moisturizes immediately. I use it before my favorite face lotion (L'Oreal Triple Power Moisturizer) and it's a great 1-2 punch. I've noticed my skin feels smoother and looks fresh—still have some dark spots, but I don't expect this to be a miracle serum!"
Loved this serum for chemically exfoliating and brightening my skin. It is at 10% which makes it very effective. I found this was gentle on my skin. Not a fan of the alcohol being at the top of the ingredient list so this would not be best for dry skin types. Packaging also feels very luxe! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. My review is however honest and my own. :)
I really liked this serum. Glycolic acid is something I've been meaning to add to my regimen. Serum goes on smoothly and absorbs well. It feels light and goes well with the revitalift moisturizer. I've only been using it a few weeks and my skin feels smoother. I also have sensitive skin and I've experienced no breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love serums and tend to go through them quickly. I love that this is fragrance free and a little product goes a long way. Sinks into the skin quickly and works well in conjunction with other L'Oreal products. I use this 2-3 times a week and am pleasantly surprised so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this a month ago and used it once a day for about 3 weeks. I still don't see much of a change in my skin. It doesn't look healthier or worse from using this product so I'm not sure what to really think of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this in conjunction with the other new L'Oréal

I've used this product for two weeks now and my skin is noticeably softer with less fine lines. I don't have her many but I can see a difference. I like the texture of the product and it is also a great value. I plan on recommending this to others and repurchasing in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product in exchange for an honest review. Here's the deal, I have sensitive, fair skin that was starting to show fine lines around my eyes and had some texture issues across my forehead and lower cheeks. I used this product every three days for several weeks - and the results are noticeably awesome. My skin looks clearer, and the fine lines are so much improved. I will continue to use this skin care line. Try it, it's ahhhhhmazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I haven't noticed much change. My skin seems brighter and smoother for about 30min after use but goes back to its normal state. And my dark spot hasn't changed at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free for an honest review. This product is good . I was skeptical to put ""acid""on my face but it does tighten nicely. The only real problem I had was a little pimple here and there after the first couple of uses but it didn't continue. All in all I would recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't know what to expect when this arrived. It pleasantly surprised me with how effective it was. I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to try a serum that does a little more but not yet ready to shell out tons of change for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free as a test. I really like it. I haven't noticed a drastic difference in my skin, but it does feel very hydrated and smooth. My wrinkles are slightly better, but not gone. Overall good product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product for a few weeks. I'd already been using a retinol product, so I'd compare it to that. This product is good for a drugstore serum, but I'd prefer to spend the extra marginal cost on the medical grade brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of the few serums that I've tried, I have liked this one the most! I really like how smooth it instantly makes your face feel. It's very quick drying compared to other serums. I used this product in combination with the moisturizer and was very pleased with how quickly fine lines and wrinkles lessened. I also felt like the products gave an added brightness to my face! Would definitely buy in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product to try in my VOXBOX. This product definitely helped with dark circles under my eyes, but of course did not take them away completely. I used product day and night. I did get some compliments on my complexion after using product for a month. I did feel like this product combined with moisturizer caused a weird film sometimes that peeled off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really thought that 4 drops wouldn't be enough but it was. Those tiny 4 drops felt like they were bringing my face to life. It felt like my skin was being energized. I really like the the whole package of all 3 steps. I would definitely recommend it.
I received this complementary via Influenster for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This serum is super easy to apply and very light weight. You can feel it working quickly and it's absorbed within a few minutes. I loved the light nature and have noticed a reduction in my dark sun spots over the past couple weeks I've been using it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
went on fairly lightweight and dried quickly.
"I had a lot of breakouts on my lower jawline and chin, don't know if it was because of this. I did like using it on my neck where I felt I could see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product in a VoxBox by Influenster for free and boyyyy am I glad. I'm in love with this. I've been using it for about a month now and my skin has never treated me better ! I have such clear and smoother skin now. My fines lines and acne marks are all gone. It felt like magic haha. The only down side of this serum is that it makes the skin very sticky but other than that it's a great product ! Way to go L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was using a different brand of glycolic acid but then ran out, and luckily was able to test this product out. I feel like it does the same job as my other product, which is a win in my book, since it did not cause me any adverse reactions & my skin tolerated it well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this product about a month ago and, since I have sensitive skin, I only use it 2-3 times a week, but I am already seeing a change. My skin is brighter and healthier-looking. It also feels smoother and silkier. I put this on at night before my moisturizer and it just makes my skin feel fresh and calm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product for several weeks. It has a nice thick, liquid texture and no smell. I could only use the product a couple times a week as I have sensitive skin. It did slightly irritate my skin when I did use it. Having said that, I didn't notice a difference to my skin. But I'm sure it's more effective if you use it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in a Vox box from Influenster. One of my favorite products. I don't have fine lines or wrinkles but my skin is dry and I feel like this kept my face super moisturized. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since using this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved the L'Oreal Revitalift serum from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes in exchange for my honest review. Ive been using this serum for over 2 weeks now and Im thrilled with the results! Its so lightweight yet powerful! My skin looks great! Works well with sensitive skin, helps with dark spots and can be used under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This serum is the real deal. Be sure to follow the instructions and try it every other day/ every two days first to allow your skin the get used to it. I don't consider my skin sensitive but I did feel a bit of a tingling sensation on occasion when applying. The glycolic acid does a great job of helping to renew the skin and make skin smoother and brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was not expecting too much about it but was gladly surprised! In two week using the serum I could feel the difference in my skin. It is easy to apply and it works! It gets a little bit sticky in the first few minutes, but it goes away. I love it! Already bought to my mom too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for testing purposes and I have to say that I am impressed. I am getting more into serums and this product is a game changer. Dries fast amd my skin glows in the morning. Highly recommended [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a tester to try and I love it! My skin feels amazing after using it. I've noticed my skin becoming drier as I get older and I feel like this product has really helped with the even skin tone and smoothing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love that you only need to use a few drops of this every night. It feels very light and goes on quite easily and absorbs very well. Have noticed a more even skin tone. My pores look smaller and my skin feels very hydrated. Received this from influenster and would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a very nice serum, did not burn much with application, and was fairly easy on my skin. I‘m not sure I saw much change in my skin, but willing to chalk that up to not using it long enough for a big change. I also have young skin, so definitely recommend the product as a whole. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always weary about drugstore anti-aging products but wow...I was very impressed with my skin just after a day! It evened my skin tone and my face was very clear and youthful the next morning. I ended up testing it every night for 5 days and my skin looked completely replenished every morning. It's hard for me to tell if it benefits fine lines, but so far I Love this stuff!

I received this product for testing purposes and I have to say that I am impressed. I just turned 35 and my skin has changed. I am more into skin care than make up and these product is a game changer. Dries fast amd my skin glows in the morning. No scent which I love. Highly recommended [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary from #influenster. It came at the perfect time when I was in need of new skin care. I am loving this. I like the little feeling I get when it is applied. It has made my skin look and feel softer and has evened my skin tone. Ever since using this, I have opted for my makeup that doesn't have as much coverage because I really don't need it anymore. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. My skin looks and feels smoother and brighter in the mornings. I have also noticed that any small breakouts I may have are gone when I wake up the next morning. Absorbs quickly and is a quick and easy step before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always been self-conscious about my bare face because of my red, uneven skin tone. Using this serum each night, in partnership with the triple action moisturizer, I have noticed a brightness in my skin and a more even complexion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary from L'Oréal and Influenster. I would definitely recommend the serum. I have noticed it does not leave my face feeling oily after. It leaves my skin smooth and gives it a glow. I think over time it will definitely become a product I am grateful to use for dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved my voxbox complimentary from influenster. I gotta say, this stuff is amazing! Not only does it help with fine lines and dullness but somehow also my adult acne. I've even started putting it on my back its making my face so soft and clearer by the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for about a month now and have really liked it! I've been putting it on at night before bed before my moisturizer. The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbed rather quickly. I feel like it evened out my complexion and am interested to see the long term effects! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free from influencer and absolutely fell in love with the way it made my skin look and feel! I have really sensitive skin and this product was gentle and I saw results within a week! My skin was clearer and more even toned. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So this Glycolic Acid serum. With lovely red glass and a nice dropper, it's visually pleasing and easy to use. I didn't need to use the recommended 4-5 drops, I tried and it was way too much product. I've had no issues with it, but they give alternative instructions for it if you have sensitive skin. It's a pretty high concentration of glycolic acid, so it's going to help shed that dead skin. I noticed a difference with only a few uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product through Influenster and just in time since I was looking to buy new skin care. This serum amazed me. I always ease into using serums that are acids since they are very strong and don't want to irritate my skin, it did tingle the first time I used it. But after a few weeks I've been getting compliments on how great my skin looks! Beautiful product and affordable. Worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm an oily girl and I'm wary of any kind of oils or serums but this sunk into the skin nicely without any extra residue. Didn't break me out and I'm optimistic that it'll help with my dark spots over time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"About a month ago, I had received this product #complimentary from Influenster, and as I have been using this serum, along with the moisturizer, & the spf lotion I have noticed my skin has more hydration and the wrinkles on my forehead have diminished a lot!! I am happy to continue to use these amaing products from Influenster to use and review!! And will continue to use this serum!!"
"I received this product for testing purposes from influenster. After using it for almost a month, I can say it has improved my skin! My skin looks brighter & the few wrinkles I hadn't have greatly reduced! Highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great texture and feels calm on skin. It's doesn't burn at all. It's has a good job with moisturizing. However after using it day n night for weeks, I don't really see any significant result of firming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this serum about a month ago. I've never tried a glycolic acid serum at home, but I was kind of skeptical. I've been pleasantly surprised with how well it's worked. My skin hasn't been dry or flaky at all. It absorbs well, and doesn't make me greasy later. I've noticed a nice glow to my skin since starting using it, and I think with continued use it'll start to help with some dark spots and help to lessen some wrinkles that have started to develop. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I received this product from Influenster, and I am shocked at how much I really love this product. I have never been a fan of glycolic acid in the past because it has a tendency to irritate my skin. However this product is light, airy, and is quite soothing on the skin. In addition, it lays well underneath makeup and plays well other skincare products. @lorealskin #revitalift #complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been loving this glycolic serum. It has a nice gel consistency. It doesn't leave my face feeling dry or irritated at all. It has no scent either which I prefer. Leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, and glowy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this about 2 to 3 weeks ago and ramped up my skin care being in my 30s as your skin changes. After using this with a combination of the revitalift moisturizer you can see a glow and freshness to my face.
I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a glycolic acid serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I hate skin care routines that take all night to do. But this treatment works really well and it's quick. I have dark spots on my forehead that I'm very self-conscious about. After using this as part of the routine they got lighter and my skin got noticeably brighter. I really enjoyed using this. It was quick, easy, and it's very effective it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received the Loreal 10% Pure Glycolic Acid Serum about a month ago and I'm in love with it. I've tried other serums in the past, but they were too oily or didn't absorb into your skin well. This isn't like those! Easy to apply, absorbs quickly and easily, and really does work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this serum for a few weeks now. I've noticed some slight differences but no major changes. My skin feels a bit firmer and smoother and my skin tone is a bit more even. I do like that it absorbs well and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I don't recommend using after an intensive exfoliation though, it burns. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed a big difference in my skin tone with this product. Before I started using it, my skin was so uneven from dark spots and such. But once I started using this serum, my skin evened out and started looking great again! I'll 100% continue using it and I totally recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this as a complimentary gift and I have been suing this serum for over a week now along with the revitalift lotion and moisturizer and it has literally changed my skin. It is now soft and renewed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this complimentary for reviewing purposes and I must say it works well. Helps my skin to feel hydrated without being irritating and oily. I like using it after my toner but before my moisturizer and usually only use it before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given this product at no cost to try. I've used it pretty consistently for a couple weeks now. I definitely notice a change in my skin! My skin feels more hydrated, appears more even in tone and seems tighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this serum along with the other products in the regimen daily for about a month, my skin feels more moisturized and I can see a change in the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles. I received this product complimentary for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this serum every night for nearly a month. I think it's been working well with the Revitalift moisturizer. It's gentle enough to use everyday but still very effective. The bottle design is simple, easy to use and efficient! The price is also decent for a glycolic serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I absolutely love this serum ! It's very concentrated so a little goes a long way which I like (means you're getting your money's worth). From the very first time I used this, my skin instantly felt quenched and moisturized. After a week of incorporating this into my daily routine I can feel and see a difference. I'm very happy with the quality of this line. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Those ingredients are perfect for exfoliating and even the skin tone with a smooth effect. Revitalift serum is for morning and night uses. Some benefits are: a gel texture, dry faster, feels soft on the skin after application, and fragrance-free for sensitive skin. Also, it comes with a dropper applicator. My experience was great, and I saw the progressive results in the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this serum nightly for the past month and I can visibly see my skin is smoother and brighter than before. The best part is that you GET SO MUCH product for the price because your daily usage is only a couple drops. This will easily last months! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was lucky enough to get to try this product out for free. I'm glad I did because this serum is wonderful! I have really dry and red skin and this works wonders! I put some on before bed so that it soaks in and some in the morning after shower! I would highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm typically not inclined to try a “drugstore” skincare products but this changed my mind. I don't have particularly sensitive skin but I also don't think this would bother someone that did as long as they didn't use it everyday. My skin looked immediately smoother after application and a bit more even after regular use over three weeks but I did use other products, including the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am almost 38 years old and started really getting into skin care about 3 years ago, as I didn't have a need for it before that. I have been reading a lot about Glycolic acid serum and was thrilled to get this to try for my honest review. I began using it about 3 weeks ago, and so far, I've noticed that the lines on my forehead are diminishing, and my face is SO SOFT after using it and the following days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I waited a while to do a review on this because I was really hoping if I gave it more time I would see more results but after about three weeks I haven't seen my dark marks fade. I use this day and night and I thought I would see more results but the only thing I've noticed is my skin does feel smoother. I will not be getting this again once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I was a little scared when I first recieved this product. I have only used retinol a tiny bit and know it can dry out your skin if you do not use it correctly. This is a great price for what you get. I have very sensitive, oil, acne prone skin and I am starting to age. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product 3-4 times a week for the past 3 weeks and I really enjoy it. It is lightweight, dries fast, and my face feels more firm. I feel like you get a lot of product for the price as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The 10% Pure Glycolic Acid Serum contains a resurfacing agent that is blended with aloe. According to L'oreal the 10% Pure Glycolic Acid Serum will immediately make skin smoother and refined and will even skin tone and reduce wrinkles over time. This is the product I love most out of the line. After applying the Serum my face would immediately appear and feel smoother. And after 30 days of use, I've noticed some of my most pesky dark spots have started to fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First thing I want to say is that as soon as I opened up the bottle I did get a small smell of alcohol & upon further inspection of the ingredients list denatured alcohol is one of the top which is a little of concern. The product is super light weight & doesn't feel heavy on the skin. You actually get a ton of product for the price which is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This item was gifted to me. Such a great product!! Goes on light and dries in minutes! Leaving your face feeling smooth and moisturized. I noticed my dark spots starting to go away too!! Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product free for testing purposes from Influencer.com. I really like thos serum. It not only helps clear up my complexion and help with my dark spots from acne but works to help plump up fine lines. My only complaint is that it is a tad sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster and I've tried SO many brand name serum that have been ok. From my experiences this product is definitely in my TOP 5 serums. Not sticky. It has lightened my dark spots! Highly recommended !!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this from Influenster to review and i am so happy i did. My skin is looking flawless after just a week or two. My fine lines are even finer my skin looks younger and smoother overall.I truly am in love with this product. It does burn just a little for a sec but that tells me its working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I applied the product it did burn initially but it was expected. In a weird way that made me feel like it was really working lol I love the way it made my face feel after! It was very smooth and moisturized [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product from Influenster, and I'm so glad I did! I'm in my mid-thirties, so am seeing more effects of aging and the sun on my skin. I don't have many wrinkles other than the ones I've had on my forehead since childhood, so I can't really gauge the difference there. However, I do feel that the overall smoothness and softness of my skin has improved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product as part of a trial and I'm so glad I was picked! This serum is a little miracle in a bottle! I put in a few drops in the morning and at night and could tell a major impact in my skin's firmness! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used a higher end brand serum in the past, but never felt as though it lived up to the hype. I am honestly surprised how much smoother my skin looks after just 2 wks of use with this more affordable L'Oréal oroduct. My tone looks even and tight and bright! The serum is easy to apply and feels refreshing. I have super dry skin and this gets absorbed easily and I then layer with the corresponding Revitalift moisturizer.

"I have used the Revitalift Serum for only 2 weeks and I have already noticed results. my skin feels smoother and appears more even toned. My skin is very sensitive, so I love that it is also fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that my skin is vibrant and it has a new glow. It I felt a little mild tingling feeling but nothing major. I am probably gonna buy this product after testing it for a few more weeks.

"I was pleased to find with this product, I have sensitive skin and it wasn't irritating at all! When I started using this I was coming off of an allergic reaction and this helped soothe my skin back to normal. I feel like this helped lighten some darker spots on my skin. I'm definitely going to keep using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've waited a month to review this product because I wanted to make sure how I feel about it. My skin is so much brighter and softer, always feels moisturized. Love the consistency of the product as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that this product has no scent. It has a nice texture & the bottle is so pretty! It's a little sticky & I think it'll be great under makeup. i received this product from @influenster for free & to give my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this serum! I have oily skin so I don't like serums that stay oily or that I can feel on my skin and with this I didn't have either of those problems! I also feel like my skin tone is starting to look a lot better. I can't really say anything about the wrinkles because I don't have any but I really do like this serum A LOT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this serum twice a day since I received it complimentary and it is by far the best serum I've used. The instructions recommend 4-5 drops but 3 works for me; a little goes a long way and the bottle will last quite some time. After 4 weeks, I'm half way thru the bottle so you def get a good bang for your buck- I will surely continue to use and will be purchasing soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this religiously since I got it. I even went out and bought one for my sister in law so she could try it! I feel like it's evened out my skin tone. My skin feels so great since using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this for about a week and a half and I love it! This is lightweight and doesn't feel heavy on my skin, and it absorbs super quickly! Definitely seeing results already. Very happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product to review from Influenster and I'm glad I did! Great price point and feels luxurious down to the packaging! I have sensitive skin that irritates easily and I had not issues. Within a few days my skin was feeling softer and looked brighter. Will purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've noticed some change in my skin texture, smoothness, but not really the complexion. I follow it with moisturizer at night and also in the morning, plus the sunscreen (all products from the same line). I will have to try it for a full week or two before I can give my full and honest review. Do not use after exfoliating or any facial scrubs as this serum will burn.

I received this product as a promotion. I started using it a couple weeks ago and I can notice the difference in my skin! It isn't too heavy when I put it on and my skin overall just feels better! I layer it with the loreal moisturizer at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for an honest review. My honest review is that I would not recommend this product to anyone. I broke out horribly after my second use. I honestly haven't struggled with break outs like this puberty. Nothing in my skin care routine changed besides adding three L'Oréal products which are supposed to be used together. I don't have sensitive skin either. I can't imagine what this would be like for someone with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this stuff like seriously. I've seen a huge improvement in my skin. I recieved this in a voxbox from influensters and I'm super happy I got it. I've been using it for about a week now and just absolutely love it. Makes my face feel soft and smooth too. Honestly has anyone with acne prone skin noticed your face being clearer? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Got this a couple weeks ago and forgot to put a review! I've used it since and made it a night routine for the moisturizer and serum at night. I loved the spf lotion for the morning made my skin feel brand new. Reduce oily skin and made my skin super soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
*Disclaimer: I received this product free for testing/review from Influenster*
"Product works as intended, no problems. Absorbs fast, no obnoxious scent, leaves skin smooth. A small amount goes a long way so this will last a long time. Really enjoying this line, it's very likely to become a new regular in my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a serum that is high quality but a good value. This serum is that and more! It doesn't leave my skin sticky or dried out. It instantly softens and brightens my skin and after only two weeks of daily use, my skin feels firmer, smoother, and my dark spots are starting to fade. I have very sensitive fair skin and I haven't had any signs of irritation, even with daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really s great serum. Skin feels dewy and soft. A great base for moisturizer and make up. My only complaint is that my skin felt a bit sticky for a few moments after application. But other than that, great formulation. After a few uses I saw a difference in the texture and brightness of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently got this as a trial product and have been using it religiously. I feel like it's evened out my skin tone and helped with fine lines. Definitely going to add this into my routine and love that it's so easy to get - no need for specialty boutiques. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
There's no question that this serum is effective. I put it on after my essence or toner has dried and then the Revitalift triple power cream. It has left me with soft skin every morning and removed that dehydrated layer I often have. It tingles only slightly when applying but make sure to wait five minutes before applying the moisturizer at night. Otherwise it will pill! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I hardly ever go anywhere without makeup! After testing L'Oréal Paris Revitalift I find that I'm more confident in just going natural. The best part is that if you don't like going all natural, you can still mix Revitalift with makeup! My skin feels softer and it hasn't caused me to have breakouts like I've experienced in the past with other skincare products. I found that this product did not cause irritation or buildup. This is definitely something I could get used to using! ❤ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can't rave more about this product. I started using chemical exfoliates about a year ago and this is my favorite so far. My skin looks smooth and even and I noticed within only a couple uses. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this serum in an Influenster voxbox and was excited to try this. I like the heavy duty feel of the bottle. I also like the size. I feel like for the price this will last you for a while. The serum is not runny or heavy feeling on your skin. There is no scent. After a few days of using this once at night I could tell my pores were smaller. My skin felt nice and plump and hydrated. I really like that this is not messy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for complimentary testing and could not be more happy that this was sent to me. I'm 28 years old and have started developing small indentations on my forehead that I'm super self conscious about. After 4 days of using this product at night before bed, these wrinkles are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced and it's almost like they're completely gone...in just 4 days! So worth it, didn't know this was even possible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have waited a few weeks to write this as I have very sensitive skin, but I can say that even with daily use, my skin feels so good and is improving each week. I feel like it is helping with smoothing and plumping. Usually my skin is incredibly dry and irritated, and after using this serum and coordinating moisturizer, I don't need additional moisturizer or other face oil like I normally would. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I exfoliate religiously, usually with a physical exfoliator because chemical ones tend to be too harsh on my sensitive skin. Though I still generally prefer physical exfoliator, I can say this is the BEST chemical exfoliator I have ever used and if it was less expensive I would most likely keep it in my regular rotation of products.

"I was a little weary with using it after I read that it can cause you to get sunburned, but I used the SPF lotion with it and had no issues. I noticed better skin firmness and tone. I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I always always have dark spots due to acne scars.
"This is perfect to help youwhit that. A must have in your face care routine. You'll notice a more even skin tone in like 10 days . And is not a thick formula, which to me makes it easier to apply. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this the Glycolic acid for over a week. So far I have noticed my dark spots have diminish a bit. I'm 30 yrs old.and I dont have wrinkles yet but under my eyes I have a few and this product has helped a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this set through Influenster in a #VoxBox. To be honest I don't usually buy drug store brand skin care, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try it out. I could tell the difference after the first night. I had a couple deep cysts from hormonal acne and the first few days this scabbed them lightly, and they cleared up within days instead of weeks like usual. I'll be continuing to use this set!

"I'll be honest, I didn't think this was going to work. BUT, I was wrong. This product is light weight. Use 4-5 drops and rub on the face. It's odorless and doesn't leave the skin sticky. I think my skin glows now and has gotten tighter. I like this product a lot and would definitely recommend it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I got a few pimples from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I will start by saying I LOVE serums. I feel they are so effective and really work well on my skin. I use them combined with a moisturizer. This glycolic acid serum is one of my new favorites! I was previously using a vitamin c serum and will be replacing it with this one! It leaves my skin feeling softer, fuller and brighter. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from Influenster and I really like this product! It's very easy to apply and spread all over the face. I could feel a slight tingling sensation so I'm assuming the product is working. I've been using it for a little over 2 weeks now, I can't say I notice a difference in my skin yet but maybe over time it will make a difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I receive this as a free sample through Influenster and I'm glad I did! I have smoother, clearer skin since starting it. My skin tone even seems more even! This is definitely a product I will invest in again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a free sample and I must say I fell in love after the first use! You only need the recommended 4-5 drops for your entire face as this product spreads evenly and dries fast. It's only been a few days yet I can already see steady improvements. This is a great addition to my nightly skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this serum as an overnight treatment and I am really happy with the results. My skin looks refreshed and smooth every morning . I feel that it has improved the appearance and texture of my skin . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This serum it's easy to apply, comes in a very nice bottle. 4 drops is enough to cover my face and neck, it's fast absorption and has no fragrance. I've been using it along with the moisturizer and since the first application has notice my skin brighter. This is my fourth day of use, I will continue to see how it works with the dark spots. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has really evened my skin out. I don't have many wrinkles but what fine lines I do have it really helped even them out. The serum really brightened my skin and made it overall smooth. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. At first I didn't believe I had a need for a product as this hence I'm only 28. But I must say I'm quite impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the product for two weeks now and my skin still adjusting. I understand that this will help slow the aging process or for others to get that youthful skin. I like it and I have it in my skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this serum as a complimentary from influenster. I just received this so i dont know if it really works. But the little time i have used it i can day this. Its non sticky and absorbs quickly i will have to keep using it so i can notice if there is any difference, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this !
I received this product complimentary from influenster to test and review and it has worked so well on my sensitive skin. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or oily which I love because you use it at night . I wake up to my skin feeling softer than ever and I can see a different in my texture and overall skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this serum for about 3 weeks and have been pleased with the results. The oil is light and soaks in my skin easily and does't leave my face feeling oily or sticky. It's great to put on right before the revital lift moisturizer-I have been using it in the morning and a night. Definitely recommend giving this a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the 10% pure glycolic acid serum complimentary from Influenster and it is now a part of my morning and nightly routine. I layer it with the triple power moisturiser by loreal . I gave it 15days time to see the result and i myself can't believe what a wonder it does ! Honestly its a life changer. ♥️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just started using this product and I already notice the fine lines in my forehead have seemed to become less noticeable. The formula isn't sticky and glides on smoothly. You really do not need to use a lot of the product, a little goes a long way! I can't wait to see more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary for my honest opinion from Influenster. First time using the product i loved that is was not sticky like most serums i have tried. I have noticed some of my dark spots faded since using the product. I am excited to see how faded they get when finishing the full use of this product.

I received this product complimentary for my honest opinion about 2 weeks ago. I do notice some diminishing of the appearance of some of my lighter fine lines and wrinkles already. My overall skin tone is a bit more even. Slowly but surely. It didn't happen overnight and compared to other similar products I've used this one seems to be working at the same rate and at a fraction of the cost. I will definitely repurchase and I recommend trying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary to test - so far I'm loving it! I've been using this along with the accompanying moisturizer and they've been an excellent pair. I have extremely sensitive skin, and while this has not reduced my acne yet, I do find these products giving a more even skin tone and smooth texture. It does go on a little sticky, but does not leave any shininess or unpleasant feeling by morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved that the dropper provided exactly the five drops I needed to cover my whole face. Easy to apply and roll into the skin, and absorbed relatively quickly - about 5 minutes before I had to apply moisturizer. I saw a difference in my skin tone in less than a week which was impressive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was gifted the product from Influenster for reviewing purposes and wow! Recently I've had a lot of breakouts and I was left with dark spots and scaring. This product has helped out a lot with minimizing the appearance of my scaring and dark spots. I love applying this every night before I go to bed. Sometimes I'll apply it randomly during the day too but I make sure my skin is clean before I do so. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this product and felt a difference in my skin texture in 2 days. After using this for 2 weeks, my skin looks radiant and bright. My dark spots are fading and my skin feels soft and replenished. I recommend using this with the moisturizer. There isn't a strong scent and it can feel a little sticky but it dries down and feels soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this every night before bed for a week. It makes my skin feel so soft! Even though it��s a serum, it does not make my face feel oily or greasy like some serums. I have it 4 stars because it does sting, just a little when I put it on after washing my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received these in a free vox box to try out products and this serum is pretty awesome! The directions say you need about 4-5 drops of serum, but I found I only needed about 2-3. The serum is light on my skin and doesn't make it feel dry or itchy! I've been using Day and night and can definitely tell a difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product to try compliments of Influenster. I've tried glycolic pads, but have never tried the serum. The product is easy to use. It is applied via a dropper. I found the serum to be not too heavy but not all that light either. A little goes a longgg way so I expect it to last a while. Not so sure I would use this in the warmer months. It's too early to tell its affect on my skin but I'm excited to see the results! Loreal also has a 100% satisfaction guarantee so why not try it? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as a complimentary from Influenster and have been using this the whole week. This has became my holy grail! I love the texture. This left my skin smooth and I can see the difference on my face texture. My skin become smoother and less visibly dark spot. Obivously I will take this as my night routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this to review through @influenster. I have been faithfully using it for seven days and it has changed the texture of my skin. It's so silky smooth and the fine lines are starting to disappear. If your on the fence: jump you won't be sorry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the 10% pure glycolic acid serum complimentary from Influenster and it is now a part of my nightly routine. I layer it with other serums and face oil. I love how soft and even toned my skin looks in the morning. I'll definitely purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a full size complimentary bottle and I've been using it for about 2 weeks now. This serum is awesome! I love everything about it. I can already see improvement on my dark marks., my skin feels so hydrated, looks plumped and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"An answer to an ongoing problem- I have an oily t-zone, but slightly dry/textured cheeks. This serum has CHANGED my skin in two short weeks. I'm amazed and can't wait to see/feel my own skin a month from now! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. I was a little skeptical because I've tried different serums in the past and they can be heavy and goopy but this one wasn't. It went on very smooth and didn't leave my face sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free to try out and I am SO excited to say that within the first week I am starting to see a difference! I have blotchy, acne prone skin so when I noticed my blemishes visibly lighter than they were a week ago I yelped in excitement. Stoked to continue and see the results in a few more weeks. I highly recommend this product. The glass container and dropper are a clean way to dispense the product and the tingles make me feel like it's actually working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free as a part of the Influenster program. I have been using it for about a week and a half, and I have forgotten to use it a couple of nights. I'm not sure if it's making a huge difference yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing how it works! I do like using it and the way it smells. I'm excited to see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this serum a few weeks ago to test, and I have really enjoyed it so far! I was already using a Glycolic Acid toner, but still needed to ease my way into daily use as I felt a bit of a tingle at first. My skin tone is more even, and I've noticed a recurring in some fine lines near my eyes. The texture of the serum is perfect - not too thick or runny, and send almost completely fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was excited to try this because I have heard great things about glycolic acid. I have really uneven skin and redness. My complexion is something I struggle with and I felt after one use it did even it out a bit. I will be curious after using it in my skincare routine what kind of difference it will make. I have dry skin and it did not make my skin oily. I've never used glycolic acid so I have nothing to compare it to but so far I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my serum a few weeks ago and it is the BEST!! It doesn't leave my skin oily, there isn't any irritation to my extra sensitive skin! My skin has been glowing and it has become part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this product thru Influenster and I am a serum addict, so I was super excited for this. After a few uses at night (only) I can definitely see a difference in my skin, and when I stopped using (bc honestly not always great with my routine) I can see a negative difference lol! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"You really could tell that it is a quality product. It's not made cheaply, and when it goes on the skin my skin loves it. I received this from Influenster for a complementary testing. I have never tried L'Oreal products before and now I'm sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I waited two weeks to review this product because I specifically wanted to see if there was a change in my dark spots. I'm happy to reveal that there was drastic improvement. The formula is light and doesn't weigh down your skin. My skin is definitely brighter, softer, and clearer than before. My spots aren't completely gone yet, but I'm sure in another two weeks, I'll have baby clear/soft skin again. Definitely recommend and will continue to use even though I received this compliments of influenster for testing purposes."
"I have sensitive, normal to combination skin with a slightly oily t-zone. I've been using this for about two weeks now and my skin has loved it from the very first day. My skin feels firmer and has gotten brighter, those small pesky dark marks have faded DRASTICALLY. Even those those marks aren't old, they weren't fading away quickly or at all with the products I was using prior. This makes my skin feel smoother, firmer. its a great addition to my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using a complementary bottle of this stuff and love it! I'm usually not a glycolic fan bc I don't feel I need it but I can tell a major difference in my skin! It is mostly just tighter and brighter. And for the price, you can't beat it! I actually plan on using it even after it's gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for a few weeks now and really love it. Initially I was using too much (I only need like 3 drops at most) and it felt really sticky and I wasn't a fan. As soon as I adjusted how much I was using (from 4/5 drops to 3) I noticed a huge difference. My skin looks and feels great! I've been using it along with the L'Oréal anti aging moisturizer and sunscreen and it's been a great trip! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For reference: I usually use benefit total moisture cream for my routine moisturizer. However, I tried this serum in combination with the revitalift moisturizer and I feel like my face has been the most moisturized it has ever been. It's a very faint scent, if any at all, and it goes on so smoothly. I feel like it helps a lot with the absorption of the actual moisturizer to follow. Best skin care regimen I've ever used y'all!! I'm in love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an amazing product. Super light and glides smoothly onto the skin. I've been using it morning and night, and I can tell a difference in the tone of my skin. It's a lot more even toned and I've noticed shrinkage in my fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this for testing purposes and I'm in love with this! My skin feels so soft and plump from using this for almost a month now. I have noticed an even skin tone, smaller pores, and fewer wrinkles. The serum hasn't irritated my skin and I really enjoyed that it's fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary through The L'Oréal VoxBox and I am SO HAPPY that I did! I took a before and after picture and I definitely saw a reduction in wrinkles and overall a better complexion. I used this before the moisturizer. I definitely recommend testing this product if you have sensitive skin though. It definitely stings a little when applied, but for me, that was just the product doing its magic [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't sure what to expect when trying this product but I loved the feel and it has provided great results. I have combination skin with sensitive tendencies especially with chemicals and exfoliation. I loved the gentle smoothing effect of the glycolic and the serum texture did not clog my pores. Great experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really wasn't sure what to expect with a product like this but so far I'm impressed. My skin feels soft and hydrated. I like that there is no greasy or sticky feeling to it. However I can't help but think there has to be a better way package this than with a dropper. Gets a little messy. I received this free in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying this product for 2 weeks, my face has never looked so smooth. I have a much more even skin tone and darker spots have become lighter. I will continue using this! Also, my face feels super hydrated and oh so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was the first time I used this product and I love how the appearance of the texture of my skin seems to be smoother and brighter and I like that fact that I can pair it with other products as will. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complimentary from Influenster and I cannot say enough good things about this product. It's thicker than other serums I have used which I like. It makes it easier to feel it on my skin. When you rub it in it does take a little time to soak into skin so be mindful of that. My skin looks plump and radiant after using. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started to use this for about a week now, and I already see results. I tend to get uneven skin tone and dark sopts in the Summer because of being outside. But with this serum, I find it evens out my complexion. I think I may have found my favorite serum to apply before bedtime. It leaves my face looking nice and refreshed in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this this #complimentary to try and the trio is perfection. The serum did sting a tad the first time I used it. I had no open wounds, so not sure why. I saw a difference in my skin in a few days. All sun damage from this summer is gone. My skin has never looked smoother! It's absolutely incredible. I wish they had full body lotion that would do this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been trying this very other night for a few weeks now. I have very sensitive skin so I wanted to start slowly and I've been happy that this serum has not irritated my skin. Layers nicely with moisturizer. Love that's it's fragrance free and it leaves my skin smooth and bright. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't use this product every day and I only use two drops. This product is great with the L'Oréal revitalift triple power moisturizer. I will say if you have sensitive skin just be careful and use with a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Glycolic acid peels at the salon are so expensive! I love this serum because it's gentle and still gives great results. My skin feels smoother the next day and my wallet isn't empty haha! Plus, the packaging is beautiful and that's a nice touch :) I use this at night only and follow with a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so honored to be receiving this product through influenster. I've been using it for a week now and it feels great! My skin tone is even out. The serum absorbs quickly into my face. I absolutely love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary to test out, and am so glad I got it!! My skin not only feels amazing but looks amazing! I suffer with dark spots and the fading of them in the two weeks I have had this product is great! I haven't had any luck with products that help with this one issue, so to get this find, I'm in business!! I will definitely be recommending this product to friends and family!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product along with two others in an Influenster VoxBox. I LOVE it. Each time I use it, my skin feels so soft, and not at all oily or greasy. I use it in conjunction with the Revitalift Moisturizer nightly, and it has worked wonders for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for a week now and omg I am obsessed! Worked wonders on my skin, it's more clear and texture is way better! I recommend this 100%! I received this complementary from Influenster in return for my honest opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product goes on very smoothly and doesn't feel greasy or oily at all despite being an oily texture. It doesn't have any scent, which is what I prefer in a facial product. It has a weightless feel, but very hydrating. I haven't noticed any changes in my skin yet, but I like it enough to continue using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this serum!! Price is good and it makes my face smooth and has helped with my fine lines. I only use it 3 times a week for now. I received this product to sample and give a review. I will buy after i use all of it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. I love to use serums in my daily routine and this serum is fantastic. It's smooth and it absorbs into my skin so fast. I love how it has no Fragrance. When I pulled it out of the box I was amazed on the packaging looks expensive! I would totally buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes. I didn't have super high expectations, but it was free, so what the heck. I felt like I could FEEL this serum working. I've only been using it for a week combined with the moisturizer. My skin looks brighter and healthier after only a week. Not sure if my wrinkles are improving, I don't really have “fine lines”. I have deeper ones, it's only been a week, so we will see what happens with more time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary.
Let me start off by saying I am shocked that this product does not irritate my skin! I've been using for almost a week and my skin feels smoother and it's not dry at all! I love how its fragrance-free and it seems like this bottle will last forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complementary from Influencer and have been using it nightly ever since! I LOVE that it's fragrance free!! Its helping clear out my pores and I've had zero irritation. Will definitely purchase when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for over two weeks now and I'm liking the results so far. I put this on after cleansing my face and my skin feels so smooth and hydrated. As someone with oily skin I don't like any product that's too moisturizing and this was a good balance. I follow with a eye cream and wake up with soft skin. Can't wait to see the results a couple months from now as I've been reading great things about glycolic acid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I waited two weeks to write this review. I've been using it every night. The first week you can feel that your skin is a little irritated and a few pimples but after that I started seeing results. My skin felt softer and clear. Also, it start to feel more tightened. I will for sure recommend this product and ai can't wait to see more improvements in the upcoming weeks. Thank you L'Oreal!"
This is a high end grade serum at a drugstore price. I was THRILLED to try this for free! I was pleased it didn't have a fragrance. Soaks into skin quickly and instantly you feel plumped and more hydrated. I've been using it for a few days and haven't broken out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this serum a little over a week and i have noticed a change in my skin tone! I have a little bit of uneven skin tone and texture, and this serum seems to have helped it in a short time. My texture has gone down and my uneven skin tone seems to have smoothed out. I love that the serum includes a dropper! All you need to use is 4-5 drops and it looks like the bottle will last a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way this serum feels on my skin. It hydrates and locks in the moisture. It doesn't feel sticky and goes on perfectly over moisturizer. I definitely will be using this during winter. I also love the size, it's double the quantity of others I've tried. I loved being a tester for this skincare line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I noticed a difference in my skin even after the first use! I used this before bed along with the L'Oreal revitalift fragrance-free moisturizer. My skin looks like it had a glow that wasn't there before. I've only been using it for a week. I have acne prone skin and had no issues with breakouts.
I received this complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product complimentary for my honest review. Wow, 10% really packs a punch! Previously I was using a toner that has 8% glycolic acid. When used in combination with Triple Power Anti-Aging Moisturizer - Fragrance Free I notice it does make my face sticky, which I'm shocked to see nobody else has said. I plan to use only at night now. Anyway, it's great for fine lines and exfoliation. My skin feels so soft and looks great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this complementary and was very excited to start using immediately. This is a powerful serum! I've only been using about a week and a half, but I think the wrinkles in my forehead have lightened a bit already. I am using only before bed and my sensitive skin has not had an issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is probably the best complimentary items I have received yet from influenster. Talk about results! I've been using the serum and moisturizer combined and my skin has cleared up so much in such little time. The serum is nice and thick. A little goes a long way. It hydrated the skin so well and leaves the face glowing.
"I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I am always pretty weary of putting new products on my face because my skin is so sensitive, however, I was pleasantly surprised!! It doesn't sting, or make my face tingle. I've been using it for about a week now and I'm starting to see visible results. My fine lines and wrinkles are a little less visible. My face seems brighter and clearer too!! I actually love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just started to develop my skin care regimen and have been searching for a great serum. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I love it!

"I HAve used this for a week now and I must say my skin feels so much more hydrated, my wrinkles and fine lines that were developing are literally going away. My face feels definitely tighter, I am plus size so you know what a tighter firmer face means to me lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary . The serum is awesome. You can't actually feel the tingling sensation which I love. For some the strength may be a little to strong for sensitive skin. I actually like the serum which can also be layered under your makeup application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this a week ago and I just started using it and I'm loving it so far. I apply at after I shower and I feel my face so much fresher and looks brighter too. I'm excited to see what it can do after using for more time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a complimentary package to test out and this was one of the products. I have very sensitive skin and there are a lot of products that are too harsh for me to use, but not this! A little bit of the product goes a long way and it soaks into the skin so quickly. I will definitely be purchasing this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this in my VoxBox and I fell in love immediately. I put the drops on my face and then rub in with my hands. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated but not greasy. Doesn't leave a film either. I've noticed the dullness disappear and my skin looks more alive. My new go to serum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a complimentary gift and was skeptical because I haven't been able to find anything that really made much of a difference. I've been using this serum for a week now and I must say I notice a glow that I haven't seen since my pregnancy days! (That was 10 years ago. LoL) my skin is noticeably brighter and my fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. It's not greasy and soaks into my skin like a dream! I'm in love!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this item in my VoxBox through Influenster. I have been using it for a week and am loving it. It leaves my skin so smooth and silky and it has a fresh scent. Excited to see the results after further use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product in exchange for my honest review. After about a week I did notice a little more smoothness around my forehead area. The bottle says to use 4-5 drops, but 3 drops was adequate for my entire face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm normally a little bit of a skincare snob, but I feel like this serum tops a lot of the high-end and pricier glycolic acid treatments I've used. It absorbs quickly and although I've only been using it for a few nights, I've noticed a positive difference in tone and texture. I received this product for review purposes via Influenster, but I'll likely purchase once I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The directions say to use 4-5 drops which is the perfect amount. It goes on smooth at first, but the more you rub it in, it gets a little tacky/sticky. The moisturizer goes on after the serum, so it helps to relieve the stickiness. My skin does seem to be softer after just using it 3 days though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free through influenster to test it out. I am not one who likes a heavy scent on my face so I love the fact that there are no perfumes or even a scent to this product. It dries quickly (as it says), no oily after effect, and my skin is instantly toned. I did not review 5 stars yet, only because I've only used this product for a couple of days. But so far everything this product says it does actually works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this complimentary as a tester and I loved it! I was pleasantly surprised at how it made my skin look and feel at such a great price point! I have used lots of expensive luxury skin care products with glycolic acid and this moved to the top of my favorites. Will purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I haven't noticed any change in my skin yet, but I will definitely continue incorporating it into my routine for a while longer to see how it works over time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a gift part of the Influenster campaign and boy was I happy. This product made my skin feel amazing and overall made my skin tone even. My skin was a bit ‘grainy' before I started using it and it felt amazing. I will definitely recommend it
"This serum compares if not performs better than my high end AHA serum. Compared to the other product (from Farmacy) I notice a significant change! My skin looks more plump and smooth, and I have no reaction to the product. I think I may keep repurchasing this simply because of the price tag and how well it performs! I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this serum because I have a jade roller and hadn't yet decided on a serum to go with it. I use this daily, after cleaning and before layering the triple power moisturizer. My skin feels firmer and looks smoother and brighter in just a week of using this. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this serum. Ive never been one to like serums because they either leave an oily film or are just greasy looking.
