"Have been using this in combination of the cleanser. Putting this on my face afterward. It has given that add moisture I need after using the cleanse. Also, it helped reduce breakouts that have been troubling in the past with other products."
Sam/NC USA . loved the old formula but this new formula completely drys out my usually oily skin. It's unbearable. It's 90 degrees here in NC and my skin is still tight and dry. Very unimpressed and dissatisfied
Bought the cleanser and moisturizer about a month ago and it worked okay at first but then I started noticing that my cheeks got super dry. It got so bad that when I put my foundation on you could clearly see my skin was super dry. Unfortunately this product just wasn't for me.
I've been using aveeno for a couple of months now and I recently bought two bottles of this product and it left me with horrible acne all over my forehead. I usually don't get acne just pimples here and there but after using this for two days I have broken out in horrible acne. Maybe I got a bad batch or something but a couple of months ago when I started using it I had the clearest face and my skin was so soft but now it's horrible.
Been using this moisturizer for a few years. Have very sensitive and acne prone skin. It was always gentle and never made my skin problems worse. Ran out so I had to re- purchase. I noticed the design changed but figured the formula was still the same. Upon minutes after applying my skin is so red and inflamed. So upset.
"I was trying to find the closest thing to the old soy based moisturizer due to having combo/acne prone skin. tried this. not only does it CAUSE more breakouts, it doesn't nearly moisturize as well as the old one. please go back to the old soy based only moisturizer."
"I've been using this product for years. However, recently they have changed the branding on the product and the formula. It has caused my skin to breakout and does not moisturize my skin as well as the old formula did.When I took a closer look I even noticed that the product number is different as well. Now I'm in search of a new product to replace it. Aveeno, please change it back to the original formula."
"I thought maybe it was me but after seeing others with the same reaction, I am not using it anymore. My skin is dry and full of pimples; which I never had. Not sure why but I am breaking out like I was a teenager..."
Just bought this to add to my collection of the best moisturizers on the planet and I love it! First of all it is The perfect size bottle! Fits in yr hand perfectly. Love the soft clean scent and the texture. Goes on smoothly and free of unnecessary ingredients. Has just a tad of SA so does not dry out the skin. Use this when my skin is a bit oily to keep pores clean. Like the fact it has no sunscreen because use one over anyway! Thx Aveeno
I've struggled with acne for years. I haven't had clear skin since middle school. However this product has changed everything. I use it morning and night and my face has cleared up tremendously!! I've been prescribed medication and ointments by the dermatologist and this is the only thing that has given me real results within just a week!!
"ever since i started using this product, i have been having rashes on my forehead and breakouts on forehead. very unsatisfied with product"
"Very happy with other Aveeno products I've used. However, this one completely dried out my face. Had to stop using."
"I've had this for a while and I use it all the time on my combination skin. Even though my face gets oily, my cheeks and nose are always flaky dry. Not only does this moisturizer fix my dry skin, it also tones down redness IMMEDIATELY after application. This miracle stuff also completely helps my acne!!"
I am an African American female. And I have blemishes on my face. I used proactive and other products made for African American women and none of them worked. I started using Aveeno products for my face and body and it works great! I'll stick with Aveeno products from here on out!
"I have recently discovered the Aveeno Clear Complexion line of facial products and I couldn't be happier! This moisturizer is amazing! It hydrates my oily skin and leaves it soft, even, bright, and clear - not at all shiny or oily. It is incredibly light, but very effective at keeping my skin clear, and it has done wonders in evening out my skin tone. I share my love for this product with everyone!"
"I have been using this product for 10+ years, just bought a new bottle last week, it has a different smell and BURNS my face! I have sensitive skin, have never had ANY problems with aveeno. I am wondering if the formula has been changed? And when I say burn, I mean sting, red, and peel like a sunburn. I would hate to have to find a new product after all of these years."
Having complexion issues for 50 years now I find your fantastic product :) Not harsh or drying at all & clears the larger pores & blackheads. This feels so great on my face in all seasons. If you are older with sensitive skin this is THE product! AND affordable!
"I've been using this along with the cleanser for about 1 week. At first it was working really well and clearing my skin, but it quickly turned my forehead and cheeks bumpy, dried and rough. I'm not sure why - it started working well and then make my face dry, itchy and rough!"
This is an amazing product! I'm in love with the way my skin feels and looks!! I've been washing my face with aveenos clear complexion cream cleanser and right when I'm done I apply this clear complexion daily moisturizer & my face feels and looks sooooo clean and fresh! In just one week!!! I love this!!!
"Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer is an excellent product ! I have used it for many years in combination with the Clear Complexion Bar Soap. Together they keep my skin perfectly clear. However, since you have discontinued the Clear Complexion Bar Soap my skin is suffering. Please bring back the soap! Thanks, A 54 year old Aveeno user"
I have NEVER wrote a review for anything in my 30 years but I felt that this great product deserved my praise. I have used Expensive products almost all my adult life and it has never kept my skin as clear and polished as this. I will never go back to the expensive creams and I have turned many of my friends on Aveeno and I have even switched to Aveeno for my 1-year old. nothing has worked better for my skin and my baby's skin. I am not sure you could say that for many other products out there.
I use to use Aveeno clear complexion bar cleanser (which was awesome by the way but they discontinued) so I decided to try this moisturizer about a month ago hoping it would help my face. Well I wish I hadn't. Now my skin is covered in small tiny bumps and it's dry and flaky. Worst purchase ever.
"I've been using this moisturizer for years now. It's the only one that doesn't make my face feel greasy, and it keeps any pimples under control. The only thing I cannot stand is the pump! It'll work for a few weeks, but when the bottle gets down to half-full, I end up having to unscrew it and wipe some onto my hand. For whatever reason, the pump fails at this point EVERY TIME. Drives me crazy."
"I have sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and bought this product believing it would decrease my acne, and clear my completion due to the low percentage of salicylic acid, as other products were too harsh. However, it became worse, and was much more oily than normal. I will not purchase this product again, nor will it recommend it."
"Please make a fragrance-free version of this moisturizer. Pros: •great texture •absorbs well •leaves matte finish / isn't oily •doesn't cause breakouts Cons: •Nauseating smell that may irritate skin on some. It's an intense flowery/perfumey smell that makes me feel as if I'm rubbing toxins on my skin. Please remove. The smell may also be counter-effective when fighting blemishes, as it can be an irritant to sensitive skin."
I couldnt get rid of dark blemishes on the left side of my face...the right side was fine but the left just wouldnt stay clear! I decided to try this product because I was already using the facial wash & I liked its results....boy am I happy I did. I saw results within a week. I cant really pinpoint how long Ive been using this..probably like a month or less..my face is completely clear. No breakouts & no dark spots. Thank u Aveeno!!
"This was the first aveeno product I tried many moons ago. I love this moisturizer! I will always repurchase this moisturizer until it get discontinue. Because this moisturizer does not contain any SPF in it, I use it as a night time moisturizer and it works amazing on my skin! The next morning my skin is plump, hydrated, and my pimple will reduce in size and redness. This moisturizer really does clear up your skin."
I don't normally do reviews but with this one I just had too! Saw the price and said this stuff must work! gave it a try and it has my skin is looking and feeling amazing. I used along with clear complexion exfoliating wash. Only down side is it takes at least 4 weeks to see a complete difference. Must try!!
"It doesn't clog my pores, I haven't broke out since,, I do sew a difference, my skin is clearing up slowly and its super soft, I have really bad blemishes and nothing works like aveeno, I had a bottle last year when it was done I couldn't buy it again because I am a student, but I bought it again and will continue by all means necessary. This is a great line. I've been using it foe 15 days can't wait to see what my skin looks like in 2 months.ncant wait to go make up free. And oh the cleansing pads removes makeup like a charm"
"I have very oily skin and moisturizers seemed to only help for about an hour or two. This moisturizer kept my oily skin under control all day and helped clear up my acne as well. The only downside is the strong scent which Im not a fan of, especially being a guy. A non scented version would make this product perfect"
"I started using this moisturizer a little over a year ago and it's my all-time favorite! It completely cleared up my skin and I VERY rarely get any pimples. However, I stopped using it for a bit (just because my skin looked so amazing), and my face started breaking out again. So, if it works, you have to continuously keep using it. It feels fine on my face and I have combination skin."
"I was breaking out and my skin was oily so someone recommended that I use a facial cleanser that ended up drying my skin out on my chin, cheeks, and around my nose. This moisturizer fixed that problem within 2-3 days! Ah-maaaazing! I noticed a difference after the first use! I would definitely recommend this product to someone with dry, combination, or even oily skin."
"Bought this product along with the clear complexion foaming soap, and it did nothing but make my face break out even more and WORSE! Not sure if my face is way too sensitive but then again this does have ingredients that are rather more natural so I don't know."
"I have used both the bar soap and this moisturizer for nearly 10 years and my skin has never been better. I am in my mid- forties and struggled with acne terribly during my teen years. As long as I don't vere from my regimen, my skin is smooth and blemish free. I frequently receive compliments about my skin and how young I look."
"Recently purchased this to go along with the clear complexion cleanser and they work well together. Keeps my skin balanced all day, not heavy greasy or drying. In the humid south especially now through september my skin cannot tolerate a heavy moisturizer. I have had no breakouts and I feel it is helping my skin to heal. My face feels soft, smooth and firmer. Will continue to use. Thanks Aveeno!!!"
"I'm 22 years old, and I have been waiting for my pimples to go away, but it wasn't happening. I was looking for a product that would eliminate blemishes in my skin as well as prevent pimples. Thankfully, I found Clear Complexion from Aveeno. This product really works, I wouldn't be writing my first review ever if this product didn't work. Great product, my pimples are almost all gone, and I can notice the tone of the skin becoming more even."
"I am young so finding a great product is very hard since I keep having to try new things, however this product had worked wonders for my skin! At first when I used it, parts of my skin looked overly dry and flakey. (I have combination skin) By the next week I noticed that my pimples had gone away and my skin was beginning to look even. By the second week I was positive that this has made my skin clear, even, and encredably silky smooth. Thank you so much for this lovely product! I will use no other. (:"
I absolutely LOVE this stuff. But if it does break you out I would check to see if you're allergic to soy. My mom broke out from this and she found out she was allergic to it. So then I took it and it literally is magical for my skin. I will never use another moisturizer again.
"I'm 24 and have been using this product for a couple years. My friends and family have complimented me on my skin, and have asked what my secret is. Needless to say a few of them have converted. However, I recommend using it for a couple months to really determine if it's working. I also don't use it with any other products besides washing my face with bar soap. It is my favorite moisturizer I have ever had."
"I have been using this product for the past three years and absolutely love it!!!! I have sensitive skin and this moisturizer protects my face to be blemish free, clear and keeps it looking healthy. My only request is to make this product available in a Tinted Moisturizer (with no light reflecting minerals)."
I have have acne since I was about twelve and I am now almost 20 and started using the aveeno acne products a couple months ago... my skin has improved so much it is unbelievable. I don't remember the last time my acne was so clear. I have some acne scarring but before I couldn't even consider scar treatments until my acne was clear. but now that it almost is i can start looking into scar treaments. THANK YOU AVEENO!
this moisturizer is absolutely amazing!!! it doesn't irritate me very very sensitive skin-which gets irritated by almost everything!!! .not only does it clear up my acne it improves the overall integrity of my skin!!! my skin is so much smoother and so much more even...thanks aveeno
"I have named this my new go-to moisturizer for sensitive/oil skin. I am 57 years old and have never found a good moisturizer for all over my face until this one. If it was the right ""oil-free"" kind of moisturizer my skin would break out terribly. This takes care of all of that and my skin looks radiant with even few clogged pores for a first! Thank you Aveeno!"
My skin is acne prone but very oily & sensitive. (really sensitive) I use the aveeno body wash and figured I would give this a try. My skin is so smooth and hydrated after the first use. The red bumps on my face have become smaller and less irradiated. The dry skin under my eyes is not flaky anymore its smooth!! Why didn't I try this sooner!
"I love the moisturizing feel of this product. It's very light, and I use it before I go to bed. But two days after I started using it, my forehead broke out. I don't usually get acne, but my face gets very oily. It could just be my skin type, I don't know."
"I bought this product and the cleanser. It started off clearing my skin but a month in my acne breakouts came back even worse. I'm still using it everyday to get my money worth but will not be buying this product again. Both the cleanser and moisturizer felt great on my skin, since I have to oily skin most products make my skin feel clogged. Aveeno products made my skin feel smooth and cleared some of my blemishes up but only for the first month."
"I have always had a very high opinion of the Averno product line, and I wasn't disappointed with this wonderful facial moisturizer. I felt as if it helped clear my skin, but it still felt light and non-greasy. I also was happy with how it helped my makeup glide on so nicely. I like knowing that the ingredients in the moisturizer are gentle but still effective enough to clear my blemishes."
"I have sensitive, dry skin and to top it off acne. I have tried tons of products even from the dermatologist and nothing has worked as great as this moisturizer. I love it! It isn't oily, leaves your skin soft, hydrated, helps fade spots and of course with acne. I do use the cleaner and moisturizing bars as well, which I love as well."
"I use this moisturizer morning and night after using the Aveeno cleanser, and it has evened out my skin tone, softened my skin , especially during these dry, cold, winter days. My skin has never looked better. Thank you for coming out with an excellent product line."
Usually in the fall my skin will get very dry thanks to the lovely New England weather. This year was especially bad around my nose and I had purchased multiple moisturizers that just didn't work - until I tried this moisturizer! Within a few days my skin started to look noticeably better and after a few weeks my skin is soft and the redness is fading. This is a miracle lotion! It's not oily at all and feels silky on my skin. I'm so happy I found this product.
"This is an amazing product. It does everything. First of all, it's a fantastic moisturizer (my skin isn't too dry but I was using drying products) my face would feel tight then I'd put this on and within second the tightness went away. It also does a fantastic way of evening out your skin tone and helps with blemishes. I've changed my skin care routine ALOT but this as my moisturizer will never change. Love this product!"
"I absolutely will recommend this product, my daughter have been using this product for a few years now. We get so many compliments regarding our complexion. My face feels hydrated and soft. My daughters face look flawless and beautiful. Thank you for making a product that I can use."
"After I hit 35, I had to totally chance my skin care regime and had the worst time finding products for my now tempermental skin. I had friends that highly recommended Aveeno products so I thought why not. And I am so glad that I took the risk! It helped tame my angry itchy patches, cleaned up the acne and gave my complexon a glow I havent had in a long time. It has a faint smell, which is good because I dislike facial items that smell."
"I was kind of skeptic of using this at first because it was quite expensive for such a small bottle, but after one use it was like magic! I saw a HUGE HUGE difference after one use and I definitely recommend this to anyone with normal-oily skin. Love it!!!"
Started using it after all the other acne moisturizers I used dried me out. Been using this stuff for more than 5 years and absolutely love it. Every time I try another facial moisturizer I break out. This stuff keeps my skin happy and not too flakey.
"I love this Moisturizer! I'm almost 17 and I use it along with the Aveeno Clear Complexion foaming cleanser, and my skin has never looked this good. I barley get break outs anymore, which is so awesome! It is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It really helps my dry cheeks that I get during the winter and it doesn't feel oily at all! It was about $19.99 at the drugstore, but it is worth it! Love Aveeno :)"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer and it has worked Wonders on my skin. My face is much clearer and even toned since I've been using this. Downside is, it is kind of expensive to be bottled so that you can't get the bottom half inch or so of moisturizer up through the pump or out of the bottle. A lot of money for so much waste."
"I have been using Aveeno Clear Complexion for over a year now and recently ran out so I picked up a new bottle. Upon buying, I noticed that the new bottle had a completely new look and also included a tone correcting treatment. As soon as I used this it immediately dried out my face and broke me out like crazy. I went from having the clearest most beautiful skin to having ridiculous breakouts. Please go back to the original formula. I want my skin back :("
I'm buying this moisturizer since 2004 I love it no more pimple after I used this moisturizer thank you!!
"I completely LOVE this product. Ever since I starting using this my face has had hardly any breakouts, and the texture and tone of my face has improved incredibly."
I'm in my 40s and have been using this great moisturizer for 3 years now. Definitely acne gone. Skin is brighter and not oily at all. Recommended this product to my niece and I hope she'll love it too. Aveeno is amazing!
I use this in combo with the Clear Complexion foaming cleanser and together they work great. It has cleared up my acne in less than 1 month and my past marks are fading. Please give it a chance you will not regret it.
Its an Oil-free moisturizer especially for those who have Oily skin works the best.It really moisturizers and works well for Oily and acne-prone skin.You will definitely see a difference after using this product.
This product is great!!! I have acne prone skin and oily skin and this has done wonders. It's not super oily and it feels great after it's on. I use this with the clear complexion cleanser and my face has cleared up so fast. SO GREAT!
Finally a moisturizer that does not make me break out and does not make my skin oily. It helps clears my acne and makes my skin look fresh. It has a great smell. I love it!
"Love this product!! I have used this everyday for the past two years and have noticed a more even skin tone, reduction of fine lines, and wonderful control of oil. Highly recommend!!"
"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AVEENO PRODUCT FOR THOSE ACNE SUFFERERS WITH DRY, BLEMISHED, UNEVEN SKIN. ALSO THE CLEAR COMPLEXION FACE WASH GOES WELL WITH THIS. I LOVE THEM BOTH! THANK YOU AVEENO!"
The clear complexion daily moisturizer is the only moisturizer I trust for my skin! I have very acne prone skin and this does NOT break me out and it takes away dry spots so fast! love love love :)
As soon as I put this on my face it feels great. I like that there is a face moisturizer that can clear blemishes as I have some on my cheek bones. Other moisturizers give me rashes because I have eczema.
I've only been using this moisturizer (as well with Clear Complexion scrub) for a week and I've already noticed the effects - smoother and clearer skin. Looking forward to the next few weeks for more improvements.
"I use this a lot, and I like everything about it! All you need is one pump, and it's so soft on your skin, but not like some moisturizers where it gives too much oil. Whether you have normal, dry, combination, oily, or sensitive, it's just great!!"
I have sensitive combination skin... I mean very very oily and extremely dry(in the winter) on top of it so it was impossible to find something that would work! This is the ONLY facial moisturizer I have found that does NOT make me break out!
"I'm in love with this moisturizer. I was paying for expensive skin care lines such as Jan Marini which was $75 for their ""good"" moisturizer and my skin had been terrible up until last week. I started using this along with the facial cleanser and my skin has changed drastically. I used to have great skin and then I hit 25 and it was terrible. I was embarrassed for the longest time. Then I started using Aveeno and I could not be happier about it."
"I can't say enough good things about this moisturizer! It helps with acne, acne scaring, and moisturizes dry spots within minutes. I recommend this to anyone with acne or very dry skin. I got by brother and boyfriend hooked on this as well. I hope Aveeno never stops making this!"
"This product is amazing !!! I use it every day and absolutely love it . I have combination skin , my skin is oily is some areas and dry in others . It works perfectly for my skin type , within weeks I saw improvement . I would recommend this product to everyone . Aveeno Clear Complexion is the way to go !!!"
i was looking for a new moisturizer since all the other moisturizers i use in the past broke me out i was kind of scared to try this one . i have really sensitve dry skin and this has been amazing ! i recently have started to brake out this year and this product saved my skin ! i havent had a brakeout since i started using this ! i love it . i recomend this to all my friends . try it out you wont regret it !
I love this...it even has SPF in it and I wear this everyday under my makeup...and all my pimples are basically diminished away...love!!!!! Try it!
My daughter uses this everyday to help her control her acne while moisturizing at the same time. Such a great combination of effects!
This moisturizer is the best! I apply it during the night and the next day I wake up my skin feels so smooth even. The product is at a fair price and it actually works. It also helped prevent acne. Love it!
I tried aveno after trying several failing and expensive products and this one isn't the cheapest but it works really well. It doesn't over moisturize and i could immediately see changes in my acne .
I love this moisturizer. It's light and smells fresh. My skin is somewhat oily but it sinks right in without leaving it greasy in any way. It's a great balance of thickness without feeling too heavy.
I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it. It makes my face feel smooth and not oily. It helps with blemishes and it never dries my skin out. I have sensitive skin and never had an issue with using this. I recommend it to everyone.
"I have been using Aveeno Clear Complexion Moisturizer since I was 16. I am 27 now and hands down the best. Keeps my skin clear, soft, bright, and healthy. My only wish was is it also had spf! Other wise I highly recommend this to everyone. People are always surprised when they ask what department store skin care do I use and I respond with Aveeno.. you can get at Target or Walmart ;)"
"I was having unexplainable and frustrating breakouts for a while that were leaving scars on my face. I tried everything to clear it up. I hadn't used this product for a while but loved it back then, so I decided to try it again. I have to say it has been working wonders for me. My skin has become noticeably clearer over this last month or so and I couldn't be happier. I will definitely keep using this product!"
"This is amazing. I had gotten a terrible rash on my face... it was to the point where it hurt to just touch it. My mom wen out and got this for me to try, and by the second night of using this, my rash was almost gone! I was so pleased. This is my all-time favorite moisturizer."
"As I've gotten older I'be been disappointed with the tone and uneven look of my skin (along with some breakouts). I can't believe how much better my skin looks. I ran out while I was traveling, and I had to purchase some other type of moisturizer - it was so bad compared to Aveeno! I couldn't wait to go buy my Aveeno elsewhere and throw the other stuff away. I noticed the difference right away. I use with the cleanser as well. Love it !"
"This product was introduced to me years ago by my best friend when we room'd together. I loved it so much, I decided to purchases it myself. Finally realizing how expensive it is, I opt to other alternative products but never got the same results Aveeno offers. That's when I found out Aveeno is the only product that works for me. Despite how expensive it is, Aveeno products are money well spent."
"I have very sensitive, combination skin and I still get the occasional outbreak at 36 years old. Aveeno's Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer is the perfect moisturizer without adding unneccessary shine, helps clear up blemishes, and super gentle enough to use on my very sensitive skin everyday."
I wish this had an SPF in it. This is my only compalint.
Great product for a great price! I just wish it had SPF 15/30 in it and I would use it FOREVER!
"Use all the clear complextion products , they help control outbreaks & and fade your blemishes"
I don't wear makeup and don't have to because Aveeno keeps my skin so clear and pretty.
Love this lotion! It smells great and isn't thick or greasy. I use it before bed and it really helps keep my acne from coming back! Love it!
"One of the only products that keeps my skin happy, no break outs, no dryness, and no allergic reactions. Amazing!"
Aveeno Clear Complexion works wonderful to keep adult acne under control. I have been using it for many years. I would not used anything else.
"I have no clue what they changed a few months ago about the bottle, but I've had three now that do not pump. I need to unscrew the top and wipe the wand on my face. I love the cream though!"
"Very good product. Does not leave any greasy skin feel. Great to wear under any make-up. With menopausal issues, this product is great with the day to day skin surprises and break-outs. Love, Love!!"
"I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin and in only 2 weeks my skin tone has improved and acne is clearing up. I use along with the foam wash and pads. For me the smell is amazing I love it. Thanks Aveeno. :)"
"I use this moisturizer once a day (at night before bed). I still breakout but I always have and based on my mothers skin I always will, BUT my breakouts go away much faster than they do without this! I love it!"
My skin gives me problems every now and then at those times I use this product. It helps my skin clear out any breakouts gently and I can still apply it around my eyes. I don't like products where you have to avoid the eye area because later as you apply makeup the product ends up in the eye area anyway making the eyes sting or peel. I don't have that problem with Aveeno that's why I keep repurchasing it.
"Was looking for a light alternative for days when I don't want a moisturizer with sunscreen. This one isn't as light-weight as I was hoping for, but it does have a lighter feeling after drying than the Ultra-Calming moisturizer with SPF, and it doesn't dry tacky."
I have a problem with my skin then I found this product not knowing if it would work. Well to my surprise it does and my face is feeling refreshed and the color is coming to a new and I am so happy. I look forward to going out in the world and don't mind the way they look at me.Because the see me a new and renewed me I should say.Thank you.
I have been using this product for at least 5 years. It's wonderful! I use it as my daytime moisturizer. It's not heavy or greasy. I suffer for adult cystic acne but this does not cause breakouts. It really helps my skin to look acne free and radiant! Highly recommend!!
"As I said, the best one I have never had! Highly recommend to everybody! Love aveeno!"
Amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing
I've used this for years. Sometimes I think I want to give something new a try but I keep going back to this. I use it everyday!
"I just started using this product and I'm really impressed with the results! Clean, clear, and soft skin! Love it!!"
"Lightweight, not oily, but leaves your skin nice and moisturized without being greasy. I use this every day, along with the night cream and love it!"
All other brands of face lotion I've tried would leave a burning itchy sensation on my face. Aveeno is wonderful and calming to my skin.
I decided to give this a shot a couple yrs ago and I loveeeeee it.. keeps my face clear and mosturized without an overbearing smell. I use it everyday..morning and night..love it!
I love this product and have used it for years! I've had an acne problem since I was a teen and continue to have one as an adult. This product is a great moisturizer that doesn't make my fave feel greasy or oily.
Love this product so much! It's so light on your face and doesn't leave it feeling oily like other. My skin has improved so much with this moisterizer and the face wash.
I'm having trouble with red splotches on my cheeks and little red bumps. I got better for a week using Aveeno but then I started getting worse than before. Even my forehead has bumps and it never did before. I thought maybe it was the cleanser but after reading reviews I'm starting to think it's the moisturizer. I hated looking in the mirror before but I really hate it now
I started using this after I tried Ponds sensitive skin(left greasy feel on skin). It does work but started noticing it leaves little white pumps along chin/jawline. I had read people can be allergic to soy. So going to stop using it for awhile and see if that is the culprit.
this is a great product that I use on my face daily when I go to sleep and wake up and it's amazing
"I have sensitive and dry skin, this moisturizer is the best."
"I love all Aveeno products but clear complexion is the one I use the most. My face feels smooth and soft all day long, with a clear natural look."
The best moisturizer ever except tht I have very very sensitive skin please take out tht smell mayb a fragrance free other thn tht my iluv it
I love the lightness of this moisturizer. I tend to have oily skin and this does a great job balancing that out for me!!!!!!!!!!!
This product is amazing! It moisturizes my skin and does not make it oily like a lot of other products do. There's no irritation either.
"I love this stuff!! It smells good and absorbs right away. I need to get a bottle, I forgot how much I liked this."
I love this cream it really works on blemishes! Evens skin tone and it feels refreshing when I apply it! Great scent & calming sensation! My absolute #1
"Absolutely love this product! Non oily, smooth's, clears my skin."
I recommend this moisturizer because it doesn't irritate my skin.
love this it is true to what it says and at a low price one of the best products out there
"This worked with a first day use, it's amazing it did not fade the blemish away right away but I could see that it was getting lighter"
"USo este producto cada día, no salgo de casa sin aplicarmelo. Deja mi piel nutrida y protegida."
this is so gentle and it dont clog my pores. i looooveit
Love this lotion. It goes great with the cleansers in this line.
"This worked with a first day use, it's amazing it did not fade the blemish away right away but I could see that it was getting lighter"
"USo este producto cada día, no salgo de casa sin aplicarmelo. Deja mi piel nutrida y protegida."
