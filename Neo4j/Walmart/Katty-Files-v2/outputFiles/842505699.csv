"I bought this for my sister and the second after she put it on her skin looked beautifully matte and healthy. She has such oily skin and that has always bothered her, and this product is a great and affordable way for her skin to look significantly less oily. It applies nicely, removes oil like magic, and leaves behind a healthy and natural looking mattified skin."
I have bought everything for my oily skin !!! This is the best I use this over my glam glo mattifing moisturizer everyday ! If your oily this will be your best friend ! Helps my makeup last all day and keeps oils at bay .
"Wow. I just got this lotion and it leaves my face so plump and soft. I have very sensitive skin and this works so great. The smell is not super appealing but that's a given having tea tree in it. If you are used to that earthy smell, not a huge deal! The quality of this product w. The pump is wonderful!"
"I bought this product probably a month ago and I have been loving it since. As a teenager with oily and pimply skin, this and the clarifying drops are an absolute life saver. I have been using both together and have had a significant drop in the number of breakouts i exoerience and a reduction of the oil buildup on my face at the end of the day. I wouldn't reccomend this for dryer skin/flakey skin because it will not hydrate you enough."
"Bought this at the beginning of the year and actually really like it, I have very dry but acne prone skin so just putting regular acne lotion on my face seems to make things worse. I combine this everyday with my Clean and Clear Acne lotion (Two parts elf, one part Clean and Clear) and my skin is doing great, very little acne and hydrated with a very smooth surface. I don't recommend this alone to people with dry skin but definitely to use in combination. Will buy again."
"I got this product a few days ago and I put it on before I put my makeup on. Later on that night, my face was tingling and had this awful itch and once I washed my makeup off I had tiny little white heads on both cheeks. Very painful and irritating. I love elf but this product isn't for me"
"I bought this about two weeks ago and my skin started progressively getting worse. At first I thought it might have been something else, but I normally have great skin and have little to no breakouts. This is the only new product I've been using and it seemed like it made my skin worse after every use."
"I purchased and used the same day. This product is amazing! My nose and forehead usually look like an oil slick but not when I used this lotion my T-Zone looked so clean and clear! I love the smoothness and the smell of the product, it's so pleasant. I will definitely be purchasing another when I go back out! Thank you E.L.F"
I purchased this product about a month ago and I've been using it on my light makeup days as a primer. I have combo skin and this has been providing the moisturized feeling while matte. It has also improved the wear of my makeup making delayed blotting possible. This lotion also has a cooling/tingling sensation upon application that I really like. Will definitely recommend this product.
"I have super oily skin. By the end of the day, my makeup is usually sliding off my face from how much oil comes up to the surface. Most moisturizers make it worse. I use this every morning with the putty primer and my skin stays matte and moisturized with no oil all day. I'm absolutely obsessed. I don't think I will ever use another moisturizer again! The only downside is that is smells a little odd. It has tea tree oil and I think lemon, which is a weird combination. However, once on the skin, the smell disappears."
"This is super what I needed. My OILY skin been knocked out but this. (Not by itself of course) but it does make you SOFT and plump, and Matt feeling. The smell of tea tree does go away. 100% would buy again."
"if you have extra oily skin , give this a try. I have used high end primers NONE of them worked. This really mattifies . really good.make sure you skin is hydrated after as you can feel some dryness. the smell is not my favorite ."
This is the only product (with the blotting mist) that has aided in clearing up my skin! For the past month and a half I have been using it 2x a day and there is significant improvement. Hope this stuff stays on the market forever because I will continue to use it!
"I bought this a few weeks ago. I have very oily skin and wanted something that could keep me matte during the day, with or without makeup. This is very matte, which I really appreciate! And I really like that it has tea tree oil in it, which can help with acne. The one flaw is that I don't feel hydrated after using it."
"I've been using this product for about a month now for my oily T-zone. It's been very hot and humid where I live and this has helped keep me from having that afternoon shiny face, without reapplying."
I have very oily skin. Nothing ever works to stop it. My makeup is sliding off my face no matter what in about 2-3 hours. This stuff literally helps it last ALL DAY. Also I have very sensitive acne prone skin and since I've been using this plus the clarifying drops my skin has totally cleared up! I'm thrilled. Buy this!!! You won't regret it.
"Long story short- I have a rare skin condition so I'm always super nervous to try new products. My skin frequently bounces back and forth between dry and oily. At first I was nervous that it wasn't going to absorb because it felt slimy, but it completely absorbed super fast and is very lightweight. The smell isn't terribly strong and didn't irritate my skin whatsoever. Plus it's a lot of product for the money. Absolutely buying again."
"I have the oiliest skin ever. I usually have to bake my entire face to stay matte, and even then I go through anywhere from 8-12 oil blotting sheets a day. This lotion changed EVERYTHING. The only shine on my face is my highlight. No oil, no sweat, and I've been outside in the 80 degree weather for hours. My skin is matte, soft, and calm. Absolutely worth every penny!"
"I bought this at Wal-Mart a few months ago. I tried it out for 6 weeks and it is just not good for my oily combo skin. My skin was extremely matte and worked well after I went to the gym but for daily use it was too drying and made me break out even more. Just be wary unless you have extremely oily skin, I wouldn't recommend it."
"I had my doubts about Elf because I just assumed that with the cheap price, meant cheap product. However, after watching JStar's review of Elf products I got super excited and had to try. I'm so beyond happy that I did, because I've started to buy elf EVERYTHING. THIS THOUGH!!!! THIS MAKES MY FACE FEEL WONDERFUL ALLLLLLLLLL FREAKING DAY. I'm in love. Thanks elf."
This has enough moisture in it to keep my skin hydrated yet I'm not oily throughout the day. Not tinted but really just smooths out skin tone
"I do feel that this makes my face more matte when I put it on. It's not a light feeling as other lotions I have used, but I still like it. This doesn't really help control oil for me tho, I still get oily pretty quick."
"I have combination, acne-prone skin and this product moisturize my dry areas without making my oily areas super oily! I'm in love!"
I like this lotion so far I'm not fully matte throughout the day but less oily which is good. Has a tea tree oil type of smell which fades away after a few minutes.
"I bought this yesterday, used it last night. Overnight my eye and lips swelled tremendously. I'm never allergic to beauty products. My eye doctor got me in immediately and confirmed it's an allergic reaction."
I love that this moisturizer came on their website. It's got almost a witch hazel scent with a hint of mint. But it instantly mattifies the skin. I think this is going to be good for people with oily or combination skin specifically. I have combo skin and I don't think someone with dry skin would enjoy this because like I said it instantly mattifies the skin and has a very soft almost powdery finish. I really like this moisturizer and I recommend it if you're thinking about pulling the trigger. For $8?! You can't beat it.
"I have extremely oily skin that is also super sensitive to pretty much everything except water. This lotion helped to absorb most of the oil for about 4 - 5 hours without reapplying. It also didn't irritate my skin or clog my pores, which was great. I only gave it 4 stars because when I used it under make up it only lasted for 2 hours. Not sure if this had an effect on that or not though. Might have just been the foundation since it works pretty good by itself as just a regular moisturizer not a primer."
100% works from the first application on. I battle with a very oily t zone no matter what my dermatologist gave me. I'm on week 3 and no breakouts or oily skin. I love the scent as well. I never write product reviews but this one deserves a great one.
I love this !! Makes my face look and feel amazing! I put this on before foundation or without but either way is great
I love this product! Definitely keeps my makeup matte and keeps it on longer! Bought this with the blotting powder and they work amazing together. The tea tree oil is great too for acne prone skin! Definitely is one of my fave product!
"I just received this in the mail today and I'm already IN LOVE! it works so well! I have yet to try it under makeup, but so far so good. Only downside would be the smell. if you don't like tea tree the smell might bother you. very earthy and herbal smelling."
bought this awhile ago and added to my routine and it really broke me out. seemed to clog my pores and cause painful acne.
I love the lotion . Its not an excessive amount of oil control but a great deal of it and it leaves your skin ao soft and smooth. Elf please come out with a face wash with the tea tree! I love your products with this scent and feel!
