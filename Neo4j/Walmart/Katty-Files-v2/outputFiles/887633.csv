Please get this item back on the shelves? Love this product cuz it works better than anything else I've tried!
"I've been using this for a few weeks and it's the best thing for face moisture, it's not thick, it soaks in easy, and it makes your skin soft. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle. My skin is glowing."
"I have been using this product for years, love it. I have sensitive skin and it being oil free, really works well for me. It doesn't break my face out like other moisturizers do. Plus it keeps my face from getting sunburn. Great product!"
"This is a great product, my skin is better and not oily what it used to be, highly recommended"
This is such an excellent moisturizer. I can't remember the last time a drugstore moisturizer didn't break me out - I regret not trying it sooner!
"Not greasy, highly moisturizing, non irritating - highly recommend :)"
"I am 72 years old can't use soaps on my face. Cleanse with water to clean face and then this moisturizer. This is the only cream that does not break me out. Have used for many years. Beautiful skin, radiant and glows."
This moisture is great for winter skin. I have not have any bad skin reaction since using this moisture. Its not greasy or your skin doesn't quickly.
I really like this moisturizer. It's my first time using it and it feels and smells great. It's light on my skin and does not weigh it down. I don't smell of the sunscreen because it is very faint.
"I used this moisturizer hoping it would help with controlling the shine on my face. Unfortunately, it caused me to develop pimples on my face (which I don't normally have). Then I remembered I used this product a few years before with the same results. Even though it is non-comedogenic, it caused me to have more problems. After I stopped using the moisturizer, within 2 weeks my pimples were gone again. Very disappointed."
"I recently bought this for my dry face. For me, I only like using lightweight moisturizers and this one is perfect. Its hydrating and is very light weight. I would recommend this to people with dry skin."
"Even though the box said its oil-free, on my skin it still gets pretty oily just after 30 minutes of applying. In terms of hydration, my skin felt relatively moisturised and soft. Personally, I don't enjoy the scent."
"I have dryer skin and this lotion makes it even worse. I put it on and my face immediately felt tight and hard to move, almost like I had a face mask on. When i rubbed my face it started peeling and rolling off in clumps. I had just washed my face and didn't have any makeup on, so it was just the lotion peeling off my face to the touch. This product felt so cheap; putting scented body lotion on your face would probably give you better results than this drying moisturizer that flakes off your face."
as soon as i started using this the next morning my face was super dry and were lots of white heads around my chin area...and my skin was rough and patchy....please save yourself l
"I have been using this moisturiser on my face for around 15 years - it is light and easy to apply, really works on my very dry skin, keeping it feeling soft and supple all day."
"It definitely controls oil, and helps my dry spots...but for some weird reason after I apply and it soaks in my skin...I would rub my face and it would appear that all my dead skin or the product would just run into my fingers and it's kinda gross. What's happening?"
"Ive been using this everyday since 8 grade in 2008. I love this product it leaves my skin feeling hydrated I use it in the morning, at night sometimes, alone, and under makeup. It doesn't clog pores its very light weight I swear by this product and never have had any major issues at all with breakouts. In the winter I get extra dry but I'll just combine this with another moisturizer. The bottle usually last me a couple months and given the price you get a long use out of it."
I have combination skin where I get super oily on my forehead and really dry around my mouth and nose. I was at the point where my nose hurt so much from being super dry then getting oil over it and the other moisturiser I was using wasn't doing anything. I was in so much pain and after 2 uses of this product I had absolutely no more pain and my skin started to heal. I use one pump after I wash my face now and my face has never been more soft and healthy. thank you Neutrogena!!
I have combination skin so I got this moisturizer. I put it on after taking a shower and washing my face and it left my skin so dry I thought maybe I wiped it off by mistake with the towel. So I applied a bunch more (like 5 pumps although it tells you to use 1 pump) and still my skin felt dry and tight.
"I wrote a review on this site stating how much I liked this product before the fragrance was added. You say there isn't one, but obviously a lot of people including myself disagree. Are we enough of a business loss to bring back the old formula? Please return to the old formula, so I don't have to look for something else to use on my face. Thanks"
"I bought this last night, and used it twice (last night and this morning), every time after I applied it on my face, my forehead began to sweat, and the sweat is so watery. I'm afraid that the sweat would wash off the moisturiser before my skin could absorb it."
"I have been using this product for years and loved it until the latest formula change- now it leaves my skin feeling greasy within a few hours. I am also unsure whether it provides UVA AND UVB protection like it used to, the new description is a little elusive. I am so disappointed that you tampered with what used to be a five star product."
I recently purchased this as i use the moisturizer without SPF. Worst mistake it caused me to break out made my cheeks red and itchy. This was the only thing i changed in my day to day routine. I put it away today and went back to the one without SPF. I have oily/ acne prone skin and this did not help!
"I have been a Neutrogena user for 20 years. With my most recent bottle of the oil-free with sunscreen, I have a burning sensation on the areas around my eyes. I noticed there is a new ingredient, Avobenzone, and it appears I am not the only one attributing the burning to this ingredient. I hope you take my feedback and that of others to make a change to this product."
"this new formula is burning my skin and eyes. like other reviewers i thought maybe I got a bad batch, but it wasnt. Please please change it back, I just pitched my new bottle in the garbage. I was a religous user of your formula for years. why mess with a good thing?"
"I can no longer use this product. Since they have added Avobenzone to the formula, my face burns badly when I use it. It also has a very strong sunscreen smell. I once loved this product because it did NOT have a strong smell. Why did Neutrogena not advertise that they were changing the formula? Looks like I'm in the market for a new brand of moisturizer. Farewell, Neutrogena. You really screwed up this time. Can I get my money back for the new bottle I just purchased that I do not intend to use???"
"Used product for over 6 years every day and “loved” Just bought a new bottle and face turned bright red and was burning. Red is not going away, face is on fire. I am not on any medication so that is not a factor. Very disappointed as I use to LOVE this product and recommend it. What happened?"
"Until a few months ago, this was my favorite, can't live without beauty product. Simple, effective, SPF 15 moisturizer perfect for my dry yet prone to sunburn skin. However, as others have noted, the switch to ""broad spectrum"" sunblock, which has a number of new ingredients that led to a HORRIBLE burning and itching sensation all over my face, along with a red rash. Stay away from this product!"
I too just opened a new bottle and had an immediate reaction to the new formulation. The new active ingredient appears to be the Avobenzine (1.5%). I also just realized that the Visibly Even daily moisturizer with sunscreen (SPF 30) that also caused a rash on my face also has Avobenzine (3%). The Visibly Even BB cream daily moisturizer with sunscreen (SPF 30) which does not cause any reaction does NOT have the Avobenzine. Please bring back the original formula!
"I recently purchased Neutrogena Oil-Free with sunscreen SPF 15 (I have used the product in the past and loved how light it felt on my skin). This time I put the product on and immediately felt my eyes start tearing up! By the end of the day my face felt hot, dry and itchy. I tried the product one more day and it was even worse! Today, I didn't use the product and my face is still itchy, tight feeling and feeling flushed! What did Neutrogena do to the formula!!"
"I used to call this my ""magic lotion"" because it was so good - it even helped heal a severe sunburn very quickly once. Now this ""fragrance free"" lotion smells like watermelon Jolly Ranchers and doesn't moisturize at all. PLEASE go back to the old formula."
"I've been using this moisturiser daily for two months now and my skin loves it. It doesn't make me break out in pimples, and absorbs into the skin a few minutes afterward. There is some weird tingling sensation that might put some people off straight after application, but it goes away soon enough. My skin glows with this product."
"My sister gave me this product when I was only 32 years old! I am now 55 and people tell me I don't show my age, especially around my eyes. I thanked my sister for giving me this product the year I turned 50. I'll continue using it as long as you all carry this product. Tried & true, thank you!"
"I opened a new bottle and thought it might be old since there was a definite unpleasant smell. However, after reading the other reviews, I realize that you have changed the ingredients. I use only fragrance free products and I am very disappointed in this new oil free moisture lotion that is certainly not fragrance free."
I have used the same Neutrogena moisturizer for YEARS. My mom and grandmother also used it. Now none of us can use it any more. The new bottle is completely different. It smells perfumey and it stings my skin when I put it on. I've never ever had a problem with this moisturizer before. Please bring back the old product! You've lost 3 lifetime users.
I have used the oil-free moisture with sunscreen for years and was surprised when I used the latest version. It caused irritation around my eyes which I have never had before. I then noticed that the active ingredients had changed. I am hoping that there is another moisturizer with sunscreen out there that will work for my sensitive skin!
"I agree with the other reviewers. The new product (broad spectrum SPF 15) smells horrible. I had used the old version since 1998 and LOVED IT! Why did you have to change it now??? Does the old formula still exist? I am very, very disappointed that this new formula has such a nasty odor. I will no longer buy it."
"Loyal customer for more than a decade, but the recent change in formula for this product causes a burning sensation. Definite change in active ingredients listed. Reportedly fragrance-free, but certainly has a fragrance now. Already called customer service. Sad to report I will no longer be using Neutrogena products."
"I've been using the oil-free moisture for a few years and loved it. My old bottle ran out a few days ago, and I am extremely upset because the formula is not the same! Immediately I noticed a fragrance that I'd never smelled before (which would be tolerable), but it's also burning my face. I, unfortunately, will not be able to keep using this product."
"I've been a long-time user of this product and, like so many others have said, I do NOT like the changes they've made to the formula. First, you're hit with a highly unpleasant odor then moments later the stinging and burning begins. I, too, thought maybe I got a bad batch so I bought another bottle and unfortunately experienced the same issues. I'm sorry to say I have to break up with you, Neutrogena. I can't put my skin through this any longer."
Something has definitely happened to my face since using this the last week. What happened? The smell is different and I have bumps all over my face. I am terribly disappointed. Please return to old ingredients - I cannot continue to use this product with a bumpy face. I've used this product for at least 10 years. What a shame.
"I have been using this product for many years and loved it. The old formula was fragrance free-but the new formula surely cannot be. I have also started breaking out which is not normal for me. The back of the old bottle used to say ""won't clog pores, alcohol free, hypoallergenic, and fragrance free"" but the new bottle does not. Why change a product that was so great?"
"I have used this for years as my main face lotion and will continue to. I like that this is lightweight while getting the job done, not thick like many face lotions. I have olive skin and the spf is just the right amount. Very happy, wouldn't change a thing!"
"I have tried everything, from the most expensive to least expensive. This product leaves my skin feeling moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy and without ""the just came out of a sauna shine"" on my face. Excellent price, I use it twice each day for a year now. I use a light foudation as well. Excellent results and holds up all day."
I have gone to great lengths to buy this product over the years as I moved back to UK from USA 15 years ago. Very disappointed with recent purchase - thought I had ordered the wrong one as smell and product is different. Now realise it is a totally different product and my skin is very red after using.
"Living in Arizona and outside walking my dogs, I am also looking for a sunscreen that does not feel oily or heavy on my skin. The oil-free moisture with sunscreen is the best choice for me. I need all the mositureizing and sunscreen protection I can get and to have it feel good on is just a plus."
"I have been using this product for about 15 years. It has always worked well. I'm guessing the new formula has cheaper ingredients, or else why would you change it? Sorry if I sound mad, it's just that I can't use this product any more with the new formula. You lost a loyal customer. Honestly, I would much rather pay a dollar or so more for the original formula than not have it avaliable at all."
"I finally started using it after trying loads of facial moisturisers that didn't do anything for my combination skin. Unlike other moisturisers, it doesn't dry out my skin and moisturises dry areas and balances oil as it claims. It does its job perfectly. I highly recommend it if u are a teenager like me and have combination skin hard to control. It leaves my skin balanced and soft. This is the perfect moisturiser for me and I won't switch to any other for years."
"After seven years of using heavy duty acne creams and washes, my skin was left dry and flaky. I decided to try something new in order to replenish my skin and make it feel softer and less flaky. Wow! After using this product for only a couple days, my skin has completely changed textures. I no longer have dry skin on my face, and my skin feels extremely soft! Also, the product has not broken me out. If anything, I seem to have less acne. Thank you!"
"I used the product and my sensitive skin rejected it in the worst possible manner. I also had a similar reaction to the Nivea Sun Protect and Moisture SPF 30 in the same manner, among a few other products. Can you help me find out which of the ingredients might be the culprit?"
"I've used this product for years. I typically apply after showering each morning. I used to be really pleased with the product but after receiving my latest bottle, something is different about the formula. It smells of fragrance and irritates my skin and can make my eyes water. Bring back the old formula, please. Currently looking for better product."
"Have used this prod. for years. Recently my skin became very itchy, puffy, red. It was diagnosed as contact dermatitis and the doctor asked which skin products I was using... I thought Neutrogena was reliable.... However, when I came to this website, I learned that the formula had changed. Did some research and discovered ""oxybenzone"" has a high rate of SKIN ALLERGY (Environmental Work Group website, Dermatology Times, 1/16/11). Very disappointed with this company. I now have to deal with this dermatitis..."
"Why did you have to change a good thing? This new formula is horrible, it not only leaves my skin feeling sticky it stings. I used the old formula for years and never had a problem. I have read some of the reviews and pretty much the new formula is not liked. I do not like the smell either. Bring back the old formula. I am going to have to find a different product now."
"I have used this bottle of what used to be ""heaven"" on my face. I recently ran out and bought a new bottle. After a couple times of usage, I thought the product was expired because it made my skin burn, turn red, and super irritated when in the sun. I am sad after reading reviews Iv learned this product has changed. I am also upset at this company for not advertising this change. It is unfair. One more customer lost. What a shame."
"In response to a question about this product, a Neutrogena representative told me that this is in fact a reformulation of this product. I loved the old formula for my face and neck. The new one is thick and sticky--feels like ""regular"" sunscreen. I will not buy it again."
"I have been using this product for over 20 years. I just bought a new bottle. I didn't know that the formula had changed, but I did notice that there is a scent now . I prefer no scent. But the biggest thing is that this formula stings my face, especially under my eyes. I' m glad that I went to your website, because I now know that I' m not the only one with this problem. I hate to have to look for a new product. Please bring back the old formula!!!"
"This is the best moisturizer I've ever come by in my years of skin care! It says combination skin, but due to the reviews, it's probably best for people with only oily skin to use it. I have EXTREMELY oily skin, and this baby gets rid of all the shine while making my skin baby-butt soft. One pump is enough for the whole face, it's fragrance-free, and will NOT break you out. It's the best!"
I have been using this for a long time (not sure how long but this bottle definitely lasts awhile!!) and it's my favorite ever. I've gone through so many and could never find one that didn't make me feel greasy but also made me feel moisturized!! This is my holy grail of moisturizer!
"I've had horrible breakouts on my face after using this product. My skin gets rough and bumpy, peels and then turns red. I've used it on and off to make sure it was the factor and indeed once I stopped using it for a while, my skin started clearing up - although it took at least a week to do so."
"I have been using this product for years and have always liked it until now. I don't know if it has been re-formulated but when I replenished my stock this week, I did notice that the bottle size has changed. For the first time ever, the product caused burning when I applied it and today I look like I am sunburned. So disappointing. I guess I will need to find a new moisturizer."
"I have used this product for years - it is the ONLY thing I found that I could use twice daily with no problem at all. I recently bought a new bottle. It made my face red and made it burn. It says it is fragrance free, but my bottle certainly has a fragrance! I thought I purchased the wrong thing. Double checked and bought a 2nd bottle. Same result. I'm so sad - it must have changed. I have to find something new - what's up Neutrogena??"
"I have the typical oily T-zone plus dry cheeks problem, and I happen to spend my time in countries with humid climates (Malaysia and Australia). I must say I'm happy that I can find this product in both countries, especially because my 'oiliness' decreases when using it. I'm a bit put off by the smell...but that's a small sacrifice to pay because I love the way my skin now feels. Such a pleasure to be able to use a moisturiser that can cover both oily and dry areas."
"I have been using this product daily and faithfully for over 20 years. Now I can no longer use it. Immediately after applying, my face turns bright red, burns and itches like crazy - almost like the moisturizer is triggering rosacea. I am disappointed and ticked off. I won't be buying this stuff ever again."
"I love using it! A lot of creams are just extremely creamy and thick. This one is thin, but it keeps your skin soft and nice. And the price is great! The bottle will last for like a year! But the con is that, personally, I think its causing me to break out more. My nose has been getting dotty, I've been getting zits. This product does what it says, but Id rather have dry skin then breakouts. ~Only my experience. the product is still really nice."
"i bought this a week ago after reading a few reviews from other sufferers of oily skin. they said it was amazing for controlling oil and moisturizing. the fragrance i could get past but the fact that after only 2 days i began to breakout in terrible acne was shocking. it goes on and actually stings, which i've felt from a probiotic cream before so i wasn't initially concerned but after the breaking out i immediately stopped using this."
"I've been using this for a few years, and just recently bought a new bottle. For some reason the new formula is (strangely) scented and feels really thick and greasy on my skin. I've had great results with the old formula, but the new formula is causing breakouts. Please go back to the old formula!"
"I am heartened to see that all the top posts are saying the same thing I'm thinking. I've used this product for over a decade, every time after I shower. I immediately noticed the new fruity smell. Stupid. But worse is that it's making my face splotchy. Why change a good thing? It would be nice to see a real response on this page rather than the autoresponse advice to call and talk to some customer rep. Sadly I'll start looking for a new product."
"I've struggled to find a worthy combination moisturizer because I tend to have really dry skin around my mouth, but my T zone is always oily. I randomly picked up this Neutrogena product last year at a pharmacy and have never looked back since! This stuff does great to combat both aspects of my skin. It's also really light weight and soaks in instantly."
"I have used this moisturizer twice a day seven days a week for about twenty years and loved it. My face always felt good after using it. I just bought the moisturizer yesterday ...used it...my face felt dry and burned terribly. I also don't like the smell of it. What a disappointment after loving it all these years! Please, please bring the old formula back ."
"In short, I love this product. I have been using it for years and will continue to repurchase it again and again. As a NYC fashion model, good skin is quintesential to my living. I have normal skin that is sensative to fragrances and gets dull, flaky patches in the winter. Every morning after cleasing I use this moisturizer to restore some balance and bounce to my skin. It's not too thick, too thin, too heavy, too anything... It's just right:) It's my reliable go-to."
I have oily skin most of the year but in the winter my skin drys outs. This moisturizer was perfect for my skin and I will be repurchasing this. This is my favorite non acne treatment moisturizer my skin has been so much more balanced then it was before I started moisturizing with this.
"I have very oily skin and this product appealed to me because how it was ""oil-free"" and plus it had some SPF in it. I've been using it for two months and it is the worst product ever! It leaves my skin oily and it felt as if my skin is suffocating. I also started breaking out on places where I never break out. In addition to my blackheads, I even got whiteheads from using this product! Worst product ever!"
"I like the fact that it has SPF 15 and is oil-free, but I still found it to be a bit greasy, which I just do not like. I have mainly dry skin that is a bit oily and sensitive. I think this product would be good for really dry skin, but other than that I find it to be a bit too greasy for my liking. The moisture it provides is fine, but feels more like an oily type of moisture. Bottom line, I will be moving on to a different product in the future and will not be repurchasing."
"Lightweight and perfect for every day use. Goes on almost like a gel and leaves no greasy or slippery feel whatsoever to the skin. My skin is mostly oily, especially in the T-zone, with occasional dry bits on my cheeks. I have seen a significant difference and would recommend this moisturizer to anyone who appreciates oil control!"
"i cant believe theres actually people reviewing this moisturiser saying it smells a little like sunscreen - it has an SPF.. what do you expect? in saying that, i can only smell the sunscreen resemblence when i first put it on, after a few minutes it completely goes away for me, maybe people are putting way too much on. its very light, and id reccommend only using one or two pumps, thats the perfect amount for me to cover my face, neck and chest area. its a great product and id reccommend it."
"I bought this a month ago and it's been amazing! I've always had trouble managing my combination skin and this has helped a lot. Works great in my T-zone but not so great anywhere else. If I apply it anywhere besides my forehead and nose, it hurts and gets red, so I have to wash it off."
"Bough this product a week ago as my current moisturizer was causing some breakouts. Well, this one is certainly not causing any breakouts because it is sucking all the moisture out of my skin and leaving it flakier and tighter than I have ever experienced! Very disappointed with this product. I have never had flaky skin in my life until using this ""moisturizer""."
"Have relied on your old formulation for 15 years and always get compliments on my skin. New one has awful scent (fake watermelon?!?) and irritates my skin. I bought out all the old formulations I could find a year ago but now am down to last bottle. I will not use the new one again, and am about to go on hunt for new daily moisturizer. Please, Neutrogena, explain what happened here. Or is there a replacement product I could try instead???"
"I had been using the combination skin formula from this brand (with impressive results) for quite some time, and decided to switch over to this for the SPF. However, my skin has not adjusted well to the change at all. Within a week I started breaking out a LOT along my cheeks & chin, and within a few hours after each application my face looks like an oil slick and I need to rewash. Will be switching back to the combination skin formula as soon as I can."
"I have been using this product for years and I loved that it didnt have a smell. I bought the new formulated product but barley opened it today because I still had some of the old one. I didnt have any reaction to it yet,but did notice the smell and hated it. That alone makes me not want to purchase this product anymore. I thought I had bought the wrong one. I have psoriasis and sensitive skin. If anyone fines anything like this product before the change please let me know. Thank You."
"I have been using this product everyday for almost 10 years now, but am so disappointed in the new formula. It stings when I apply it, and my skin turns red and blotchy. I haven't found another neutrogena item that is a suitable replacement, so I will need to switch to a different brand. Please bring the old formula back!"
I have used this product for over 10 years and will not be buying another bottle. The new formula for the product causes my face to have an allergic reaction. The smell of the new formula is very off-putting and my skin starts burning as soon as the product touches my skin. I am at a loss as to what to try next as I loved the old formula. Please switch the formula back!
"I've used Neutrogena SPF 15 face lotion for almost 20 years. I picked up more from store and used it this week. The smell, the texture, the burning feeling on my skin was horrible! I then looked at the bottles. This new formula says ""Broad Spectrum SPF 15"" and the ingredients are changed. I'm glad to know other users are not liking this new formula. Neutrogena--bring back the old SPF 15 face lotion! Totally disappointed and can't use this new formula."
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! I have combination skin (oily T zone, dry cheeks) and this does wonders for my skin! I have never been able to control the oil on my face before. This moisturizer takes out all of the shine. I put this on at night before bed, and in the morning I wake up and my face is still oil-free and no shine! I also like that it is fragrance-free so it smells completely natural."
"I love neutrogena products. I have tried all the face moisturizers. I find Combination does not work for me. like many reviewers, it dries out certain areas and causes break outs. I find that sensitive works better for me and SPF is also great. But, Combo does not work for my skin."
"This feels very light coming out of the pump, but it felt very heavy after applying it to my face. I stopped using for a while and switched to something else, but when I came back to this, I noticed it caused me to break out quite badly. Unfortunately for me, the product lasts FOREVER."
"I was really looking forward to using this product. I applied it after cleaning my face with the Neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser (foaming). I was disappointed when I started to develop acne, especially in areas of my face where I never had acne. Therefore I discontinued the use of this product and only used the cleanser. My skin feels much better and the breakouts have subsided. I don't recommend this moisturizer to anyone."
"I am trying your other products after being a loyal user of the intensified day cream for many years. This product is more liquid than cream and has a slight smell to it. I am sensitive to smells (sneezing, allergy, headaches). Sorry Neutragena but will be looking for other brands that are like the intensified day cream product you wrongly discontinued. cm"
I was recommended this moisturizer by a friend and am so glad!! This moisturizer doesn't make me oily or dry me out. It is a great value and comes in a HUGE bottle that I will probably never use up! A little goes a long way for sure. Will definitely repurchase again...if the bottle runs out. lol.
I love this moisturizer. I use it morning and night. I have oily skin and this is the only moisturizer I've tried that doesn't leave my skin oily right after washing. It moisturizes without leaving an oily residue and a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time. I hope Neutrogena never stops making this product because I don't know what I would do without it!
I've been searching for an oil-free moisturizer with SPF that doesn't cost a ton and I will still have to search. I agree with another reviewer who found it to smell too much like sunscreen and that it makes your face greasy/shiny. I don't know if it has made me break out or not but my skin's been more congested since I've been using it more so now I'm just using it on neck and chest to use it up while I search for something better.
"Have used this product for years, and like the other frustrated customers, I am unhappy about the change. The new formula does not smell good, it stings the skin slightly. A tiny bit of it got on my lips and now my mouth tastes like sunblock. Yuck. Never experienced this with the old stuff. Just tried to call customer service but was told there would be a very long wait."
"Like many others, I have used this product for many years and was very very happy with it. I just purchased what I thought was the same product (packing is the same but later noticed it now says broad spectrum) and it has a terrible smell, like teenage acne cream, and stings when you apply it. The new ingredient seems to be something called Avobenzone. Please revert to the old formula which was great."
"I am 30 years old and have used this product since I was in high school. A week ago I bought a new bottle and immediately noticed a new fragrant smell and when I put the moisturizer on my face I had a burning sensation and my face turned bright red. Thinking it might have been a bad bottle I went out and bought a second bottle, same results though. I loved this product and swore by it before the formula changed. I hope the old formula comes back, until then I will have to find a new moisturizer."
"This is a great product. Super lightweight and goes on without any shine at the end. There's no scent which is great, so you don't have to smell your face after your application. I've tried Clinique combination skin, Aveeno, Oil of Olay and nothing seems to work like Neutrogena for my skin. Great products for good prices. I just wish this came wih SPF as well. I don't understand why only the regular oil-free moisturizer has SPF but the sensitive and combination skin doesn't."
I bought this in need of a moisturizer that wouldn't dry me out but control the oil on my face! And it does just that and more! I have noticed a lot of my acne has gone away and my face feels smooth especially right after I put this on it also brightens up my face. I love this I recommend it to everyone!!:)
When I first ever used this product on my face it was wonderful!!!! But one day when I used this moisturizer on my face my skin started to flake out a little. I was really disappointed with this moisturizer because I thought that I had finally found the perfect moisturizer for my face. So now I will go back to my old facial moisturizer which is another brand because it was much more great on my face than this one.
I have combination skin so when I saw this product I thought it was going to be my holy grail. When I first started using this product the acne on my forehead disappeared but I noticed that around my mouth started getting dry patches. I thought it was nothing and went over it with another layer. After about 2/3 weeks in my whole face was sucked dry of moisture and I couldn't even put on concealer without it making look like I had dry patches EVERYWHERE! I had to discontinue because my face hurt when I smiled.
"I usually apply my moisturizer after I have exfoliated my face and before I put on my makeup . Must say that this is by far one if the best moisturizers to use . Its oil-free, it doesn't clog pores, it's light weight, and it makes my makeup look flawless ! For years I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for my acne-prone skin and I'm super excited that I've finally found one !"
I had used Intensified Day Moisture for many years and was very disappointed you discontinued it. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!! I tried this as an option and it is ok. I have sensitive skin and break out. This one was not as light and nice as the Intensified Day Moisture. It almost felt greasy even though it is oil free. It didn't break me out but I am going to try something else. Didn't like odor at all.
"I use this every morning and night as my moisturizer. After a while, it started to hydrate my face and it didn't look as dry anymore. The only downside of this product is that it leaves my skin VERY shiny.It doesn't absorb quickly into my skin like the description says."
I wonder if this product is really designed for combination skin. It may not make the oily spots shine and sweat but it doesn't do a thing for the dry/normal parts. I made a mistake of buying it in late summer and there is no way I can use it for the rest of the year. It is way too expensive for what it is. It might be okay for people with excessively dry skin but not recommended for someone with a real combination skin. Not good for winter!
I had to stop wearing sunscreen because it burnt my eyes and left a white cast but I knew I needed it because I use retinol and alpha hydroxy at night so I tried this in the morning over my vitamin c serum and cream and it did not burn or sting and absorbed completely with no white cast I will use this brand from now on love it
I thought I had bought the wrong product as soon as I put some on my hand. I have severe allergies and this stuff stinks! More like insecticide than a product for your face. It is listed as UNSCENTED. That is definitely not true anymore. I have used this for years but no more. Not sure why you changed it but new is bad.
"I had no problems with the prior bottle of this product. After use, I broke out in a hive-like rash all over my face which has taken days to heal. I should have read the fine print which states ""stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs"". Too, I looked up the ingredients and have found that while oxybenzone is indeed a sunscreen agent, oxybenzone can cause an allergenic reaction and affect the immune system."
"I started using oil- free moisture for combination skin several months ago. It has made a huge difference in my skin. I am glowing, I am radiant. My skin doesn't look ashy, or dry, its not oily, it doesn't feel tight. Its the best my skin has been in years! I live in a very dry state and this product has kept my skin healthy even in the harsh winter months."
"I bought this moisturizer only because it promised to be a grease-free sun protection. And, while it is not oily, there is no statement anywhere on the packaging or Neutrogena website that it actully protects fron UVA. SPF only guarantees UVB protection (sunburn), yet the UVA protection (main cause of skin cancer) is a question mark. I fell light burning sensation every time I use this moisturizer. I wonder if one of irritant ingredients is really harsh."
"this is been my summer day moisturizer for a couple years now. I have combination skin and, in the summer, it gets really oily in certain spots, no other lotion can control that as this one does. The humidity here is really high, so this might not be a good choice for someone leaving in a dry climate as thislotion is not really rich."
"I have combination skin and this product prevents both my problems. I can see that my skin didn't dry in the cheek or oily in the T-zon anymore. The product absorbs in y skin really quick, and it feels like I have nothing in my face. Then, I use my BB cream and it works really well on my face. Great for both winter and summer."
I'm so glad they haven't added SPF to this because I have allergic reactions to products with SPF. This product is awesome! I have oily T-Zone. My skin feels so much smoother and it definitely helps in my T-Zone area! It's also great on the rest of my face that's drier. I've tried many other products and this works best for me.
"I'm honestly not wild about how this performs, it seems to kind of put a thin barrier on your skin rather than really hydrating the skin, however, it's the only spf moisturizer i've tried that doesn't irritate my skin or cause it to break it out, so for that reason i absolutely love it. and it's great value for money, a bottle lasts for ages"
"It didn't really mousturize well and left my skin just as oily as before. However, it was better than no mousturizer. This was fine as a nightime mousturizer because I wash my face in the morning, so my face wouldn't be that oily. I would NOT recommend this to anyone"
"This face lotion has so many great qualities. It's light and absorbs easily, yet it still provides the moisture I need. It doesn't make my super-sensitive skin break out or itch. It's been a standby of mine for years. I love that it has SPF 15 as I wear it daily under makeup, and I don't need an extra product to protect my skin from sun-exposure. It's great for my neck as well. It doesn't have a strong scent either. A big bonus."
I originaly bought the SPF 15 (green color) version of this mositurizer but it still left some dry areas on my skin and I didn't like the greasy feeling it had to it. I had tried the Clean and Clear mositurizer but that was even worse. This one has been the best so far I wish it just wasn't as pricey.
My 11 year old has acne and her dermatologist recommended this as a moisturizer in her routine. It is great. It has provided moisture without causing a greasy or shiny appearance. It is not heavy and you only need a very small amount to cover your face. Although it is only a 4 ounce bottle it has lasted a long time. We love this product and recommend it to others.
"Not too sure on this product. It's ok for the summer when it's really hot & you want a very light moisturizer at night. However, it didn't do much for moisturization on my cheeks. I reapplied a couple of more times & it was a little better, but not by too much. I have very sensitive, easily irritated, combination skin that's prone to breaking out. I ended up going back to the store & exchanging it for the oil-free sensitive one. Sticking with what works for me!"
"I bought this moisturizer a few days ago and am in love with it! i use it twice every day. after just two days my face feels so soft and smooth! i love that it's also oil-free and contains spf 15. unlike other moisturizers i've tried, this one doesn't make my face feel oily or look shiny. to sum up, it's a very powerful, but lightweight moisturizer."
"I want to have great skin, but I'm a broke college student and I am very unwilling to spend big money on a moisturizer. I used to use Olay products, but I found that they made my skin feel oily and I could not wear them under makeup. In comparison, I can't even tell I'm wearing this moisturizer! I'm sure I could find better moisturizers that feel lighter at higher prices, but this works just fine."
"Coming from a department store moisturizer to this, I am pleasantly surprised by the results! It could be a BIT more moisturizing, but for my skin type, it clears up all of the dry patches and leaves the skin feeling tight and firm without feeling too dry or uncomfortable. It can be a little hard to blend it in, but for the price point the quality is amazing and it's definitely worth a try!"
"I wouldn't recommend following the instructions on the back of the package. I have normal skin, and using a whole pump full of this stuff is way too much for me. I also wear glasses, and if I do follow the instructions, my glasses slip and slide everywhere. Also, my nose and my forehead look really greasy after using this product. Now, I just use a little less than half a pump of this stuff and it still moisturizes and works fine. Plus, the product will last longer too!"
I bought this product to try something new and have been using it for about 4 months. When you first rub the product on your face it will make you appear very shiny and oily. After about 10 minutes it will be unnoticeable. It has really helped my skin become softer and I love the built in SPF. Definitely a great product!
Finding this lotion was such a relief for me! I've always been frustrated by trying to balance my dry yet acne prone skin and this works like a dream! I have yet to find another product that works as well as this one. My only complaint is that it is a little pricey for a working college student.
"I have tried a lot of different moisturizers and they all made my skin feel oily, greasy and made me break out more. I tried this one because it was oil free and spf and I LOVE IT!!!! It doesn't cause me to break out it leaves my skin feeling soft. I don't get shiny with it at all. Its the best moisturizer I've tried."
"I have been using this for about two years now, and I don't think I'll ever stop. I like that it has SPF, and doesn't have a tacky feel like other SPF moisturizers I've tried. Over the past two years I have tried other moisturizers, including expensive ones, and this is still the best for me. I have very oily skin, so the oil free aspect of this really helps. I highly recommend this product."
"I use this moisturizer in Trinidad when I go home to visit and in the UK where I currently reside, in the Spring, Summer Autumn and Winter and the results are the same. Great on the skin not oily and so easy to glide on make up over. Does not make my skin break out infact the entire Neutrogena line is excellent. I find it hard to use anything else on my face . An Aesthetician recommended this to me and since then I never looked back. Wish I could get it easier in the UK though. Have to get it from Trinidad."
"i struggle with acne and have tried many oil free moisturizers ( mostly expensive brands), but this is the best one by far. When I started using it my cleared up completely when other moisturizers left it slightly clogged. Love it and will continue to use it."
"I used this product for a whole month and may I say, it didn't work at all. Firstly, it stung. When I put it on, there was this unpleasant stingy feeling. Secondly, it didn't hydrate my skin where it's dry, nor did it control my oil in my t'zone. I put more of it on my cheeks, and no moisture at all. It felt like grease was sitting on my skin during the day and while I was sleeping"
"I have tried other three step procedures with other (more expensive)products, and this is the first moisturizer with a UVA/UVB SPF that doesn't leave my skin greasy. When I use this following the Alcohol-Free toner and the Deep Clean cleanser my face is oil free all day. It's light, the pump provides the perfect amount and it is oder free. Excellent day cream for a great price!"
"The first couple times when I used this product I had to use one pump, let it soak in and repeat 2-3 times because my skin was so dry on my chin and cheeks from climate change. After a week and a bit of using it, I only need one pump and my skin is moisturized all over and Ive noticed that I have not had to use powder or oil blotting sheets on my nose as much as before(once a day vs. 3-4). This is my new go to moisturizer:) Thank you neutrogena for helping with my shiny nose."
I accidentally purchased the SPF 15 sunscreen moisturizer instead of my usual Sensitive Skin moisturizer. This product makes my skin sting very badly. I tried the product in the same bottle a couple times - just to make sure the stinging wasn't a one-time result. I use regular sunscreen and have never had a reaction like this. I cannot recommend this product. It should be pulled from store shelves.
I have combo skin and this product for some reason made my skin more oily! It's interesting because item is listed as alcohol-free yet an ingredient contais alcohol. Will be returning.
"I've been buying this moisturizer for years and love it, but something's not right with my latest purchase. It smells really bad, like chemicals. Has anyone else noticed this? I'm afraid to use it."
"Love this product! I have sensitive skin and have no problems with redness or sensitivity. It is light, non-greasy and can be worn alone or with makeup and does an excellent job of protecting my skin from sunburn."
I bought this product about a month ago and I have been using it and it makes my skin very oily! It does not give that matte look as stated on advertisement
"I've used this product for 16 years. I just purchased a new bottle and immediately noticed the smell. Not good. Also, it burned when I put it my face. I only used it for a few days but will not buy it again."
"I have been using this product for over a year and love it. I wear it under foundation, for a bit extra moisture and sun protection, but it's light and clean and doesn't cause any breakouts (which I still can get at fifty-something)."
I've used this cream for years and I loved it but recently the formula has changed along with the packaging. It now leaves my skin feeling oily and it burns a little. Why did you change a perfect product?!?!
"ive been using this for more than a year now, and I've noticed it makes my whole face extremely oily. It's lightweight and moisturises well but it makes my face look very oily and shiny,"
Very disappointed with product changes. New formula smells and irritates skin. Looking for a replacement after many years of swearing by this product - very disappointed.
I bought this moisturizer yesterday. I used it last night this morning and tonight and I can already tell how clear and soft my skin is. It smells wonderful too! I will definitely be buying this again!
I have used this product for many years because I have sensitive skin but now when I use this product my skin has a burning sensation. Is this a new formula? I will need to find an another product to use.
"I don't like the new scent...it smells like fake watermelon. It's funny because it says that it's fragrance free but it's not anymore. And yes, it stings my skin too. Why did you have to change something that was working so well before?"
-Stingy on skin -irratative for the first 20 seconds -a little bit dry at first but gets oily throughout the day -soaks into s'kin good -compatible with makeup -good for acne skin -dont feel the lotion after it's on
"I have used a lot of moisturizers, and this is the best by a long shot. It moisturizes my dry spots perfectly and controls oil and shine. It could only be better if there was a little SPF in it."
"Have used other moisturizers, but I can definitely see the difference. It's not too greasy, or to thick. Thanks Neutrogena for making a great moisturizer."
"I have used this product for years and have until the last few months or so, loved it!! Not sure what you have done to it.... Eyelids burning, swollen, awful!!!"
"Seriously, I've been using this product for 10+ years and loved it, even better than expensive brands. Just bought a new bottle and my skin is stinging....why change the formula?!"
"I have always had oily skin on my T-zone, but dry on my cheeks, around my mouth, and upper forehead. But since i've been usuing this, my skin is so much clearer and softer!"
"seems to work well in controlling oil, but it drys weird on my skin it will create white patches that sheds off my face so its impossible under makeup and I end up wiping it all off my face because of how much it peels off"
"My combination skin is so soft now. Less oily on the T-zone, but not drying to the other parts. My skin is soft, and smooth all over. Touchable and beautiful. Greatly satisfied, nice product!"
"I love this moisturizer so much! I bought it four months ago and I still have 1/4 a bottle left. I use it every day, too. It's perfect for mixing with foundation to make your own tinted moisturizer."
I tried this product for a long time but it didn't work my skin at all. I have a combination skin but it didn't moisturize my dry areas even though I put a good deal of it on my skin.
"I always used the tinted oil free.....what happened to it? Neutrogena is the only product i can use on my face without breaking out,. Always used the tinted but I guess they have stopped making it....very disappointed."
"After using this moisturizer daily for many years, I find that the new scent (of watermelon) is off-putting. I also seem to experience itching on my eyelids. I am now looking for another brand."
"While I love this cream, it does bother me that I can't find any information on whether or not the protection is for both UVA and UVB. Living in New Zealand, that is an important criterion for me. Could you please clarify Neutrogena?"
I am very oily in the T zone so I thought this lotion would be perfect for me. After 3 days of using it my skin feels like I'm wearing a mud mask and very dry. I will be going back to using the Sensitive lotion and dealing with the oily skin.
"I was nervous the first time I put the moisturizer on. With the SPF I thought it was going to be greasy and smelly, but as soon as it hit my face the SPF smell went away and my face was grease free and oh so smooth!"
"I was excited to use this product... but when I put it on, there was this stinging sensation to my face. It also made my skin feel really heavy and greasy and then dried to leave my skin flaky again."
"I've been using this for about nine months. I like it. Don't love it. Says oil-free, non-greasy, but it makes my skin kinda slick. If you can afford to buy something better, I would."
I AM 43 AND HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT DAILY FOR YEARS AND I HAVE PEOPLE ALWAYS TELLING ME I LOOK YOUNGER THAN I AM. I SWEAR BY IT. IT ALSO COMPLIMENTS ANY MAKEUP REGIMEN I CHOOSE AND NEVER LEAVES ME GREASY. I WILL USE THIS PRODUCT FOREVER.
"Takes about a minute or two for the greasy feeling after application to disappear. Doesn't control shine on forehead during the day. Great for sensitive skin. Overall, leaves face feeling soft and smooth."
"This is clean moisture, oil free and very effective for sensitive skin."
"I have been using this product for a week now and it is the worst moisturizor I have used. I thought this was going to truly help my skin but I thought wrong. My whole face irritates so much that when I scratch it gently, my skin turns red. My skin feels so dry and discomforting. I DO NOT recommend this product."
I was excited to try this product because I have extremely oily skin in my tzone area. After a month of being puzzled as to why my blackheads are bigger and deeper than ever and why I kept breaking out I realized the only difference was me using this lotion. Im very dissapointed because I've always like neutrogena products but now am wary to try anything!
"At first, I loved this formula as it really helped keep my T-zone oil-free. However, within a week I developped a terrible itchy rash and pustules all over my cheeks and chin. I now have to take antibiotics and cortizone creams and my face has never looked so awful. Only an ice-pack gives me any relief from the itch. Use with caution and test before applying to your face!"
I have an oily t-zone and dry cheeks so I thought combination would be best for me. A couple hours after I put the moisturizer on my skin still felt really dry and the moisturizer dried and turned into white flakes. I noticed it when I touched my face and there was white flakes all over my clothes. I am definitely not buying this again.
"Before i started using this face moisturizer my face was clear, but then once i started the next day i ended up with pimples at first i was wondering maybe my face is dirty, so i would wash my face whenever i get home, but it seemed like the pimples would go away and i would get more and more. I been using it for 2 weeks now, and there is no change. I know everyones skin is different, but this is just not for me."
"Sadly, this product makes my eyes burn and tear. I try to avoid getting it close to my eyes but.. My face also feels a burning sensation right after I put it on. I purchased another Nutrogena product and it does the very same. Even my co-workers comment on my eyes tearing. I won't be able to purchase again."
"I have trusted this moisturizer for years, but the new formula made my skin burn horribly, so much that people asked me if I got sunburned at the beach even 2 days after using it. I loved the old formula, but the new one is absolutely horrible. Also has a strong cucumbery scent which I do not prefer over the old unscented version. I am so sad that I have to look for a new moisturizer that works."
"This was the first moisturizer I ever tried, and I was horrified with the results! My skin broke out immediately and it felt greasy and heavy on my face. I tried it once and had at least 2 break outs, but when summer hit and I wanted to try it again (it has sun protection) I regretted it, as the same thing happened again. Maybe this would work better for dry skin... like very dry skin. If you don't have dry skin, I wouldn't recommend this moisturizer."
"Nothing is better for my skin than this moisturizer. It perfectly moisturizes, is not greasy or oily at all, and does not react with my sensitive skin. I have tried the normal moisturizer and the sensitive skin moisturizer, but both react with my skin and are a little tiny bit greasy. Strangely enough, the combination skin moisturizer seems better for my sensitive skin than the sensitive skin one."
"I have tried many moisturizers and this is the only one that ever made my skin break out. My skin felt sticky and stiff after applying, not hydrated. It didn't moisturize my dry areas and within a few hours it made my t zone incredibly oily and shiny. I can't believe I wasted so much money on this. I wish I could return it!"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have hyper-sensitive skin which is very oily and acne prone. Since I have been using the combination skin moisturizer, the condition of my face has improved dramatically. My face has been cleared of acne. It is more even toned. There is no itching, stinging, or burning feeling. My face is no longer severely oily. This moisturizer calms and soothes my eczema spots without further irritation. I use it morning and night with no problems at all, with or without make-up. Thanks Neutrogena!"
"I have extreme oily skin , with large pores but super sensitive to breakouts . so it was a real gamble trying something new. I started using this In October 2016 and its been amazing . My skin has not reacted negatively , its gentle to use but i still get the right moisture , no clogging . Great to wear under makeup . ( I've seen reviews about tanning but I'm Dark-skinned so hard to say but so far haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary ) I will definitely recommend this product"
"So I've been using this product for several years now. My dermatologist recommended that I get a higher SPF moisturizer so I tried RoC Multi Correxion 5-in-1 Daily Moisturizer because it has SPF 30. Boy, did I make a mistake from switching! Not only does the Oil-Free Moisture feel light on the skin, it is well worth the price! I won't make the same mistake again, Neutrogena products never disappoint!"
"I have acne-prone skin, and I was worried that the moisturizer was going to cause breakouts. Not only did this moisturize my skin, but it also didn't leave my hands feeling greasy!! I have been using this for a few months, and I have no complaints. It would be great if it came with SPF though."
"Even though it says it is oil free, it leaves my face really oily. It also causes me to break out and I've never had acne problems. It also causes my face to burn. Whenever I stop using it, my face returns to normal. When I start to use it again, I start breaking out everywhere. Not going to keep using this."
This moisturizer was too drying for my skin which is normally oily in the T-Zone. I had severe dry patches on my cheeks and forehead within 10 minutes of use and also after applying a powder based foundation. May try the sensitive skin formulation to see if it's any better for my skin.
"I bought this product after years of using the sensitive skin moisturizer because my skin has become combination skin as well as sensitive. I do NOT like this moisturizer at all! It does not rub in completely and makes my skin look ashy and dry, especially on the jawline and neck. My skin itched and had some blotchy red areas on it after using this. I was very disappointed in this product and will not buy it again."
"I have been using Neutrogena products for as long as I can remember. I too have tried other 'high end' brands and always come back. My skin has continued to change over the years (with age as we do get to!) and their make up, facial cleansers, and this great moisturizer have been my go to. I have a gluten intolerance, and one of the down sides is flakey skin. I also still have a tendency for some oiliness but this really does make the difference."
"Thank you Neutrogena! Please don't ever change this formula. My extremely sensitive skin cannot take oil or fragrance, which are extremely irritating to the skin So thankful to see your oil and fragrance free line of products and broad spectrum sun protection. As always with neutrogena you get great quality in the ingredients."
"I started using this product at the same time with the Oil Free Acne Wash. Since that really dried my skin, this moisturizer helped. I really like the texture (silky) and it helps my skin. However, I did get minor break outs, but that could be anything, so I'm not completely blaming the product. I also wish it had SPF! Overall, its a good moisturizer but not spectacular."
"I have never had any problems with acne or pimples on my neck, until I started to use this product. It works great on my face, but as soon as I started to use it, each morning and night, I began to notice my neck starting to break out. So much, they I didn't even want to go out in public because of it. Might be great for some, but not for me."
I was so excited to find this product. I have the oily t-zone and some dry skin areas. This product left my oily areas even more oily and the rest of my face very dry. My whole face felt very sticky. So disappointed as I have always liked Neutrogena products.
I have been using this lotion for over 5 years now and I would never use anything else..even turned my sister onto it a few years ago and she feels the same way! It's lite feeling and does exactly what the bottle says it's going to do for your skin!!!!
when i bought this product i put in on right when i got home to test it out and it smelled like sunscreen...after like a few minutes i asked my mom if i smelled like sunscreen and she said no this product is really great i truley love its one of my favorite things one thing id change is not to have a sunscreen smell at first. if you want a spf lotion for your face id get this one
"i have very oily skin all over, not just my t-zone. i also get itchy on the sides of my face, near the jaw bone and after a week with this product the itch has stopped. this moisturizer is soothing, fast-absorbing and most importantly combats unwanted shine from oil."
I bought this product a week ago and already my skin looks and feels better than it ever has before. I have combination skin with a lot of oil in my T-zone so I was always afraid that a moisturizer would just make it worse. This product moisturized my dry spots and kept my T-zone oil free. It's super lightweight so i can wear it under makeup but my skin looks so great I can go without!
Great product for sensitive skin....Only moisturizer I can use....No sunscreen as sunscreen makes my eyes swell.
I bought this about two months ago and I love it. With the spf it does smell slightly of sunscreen but it doesn't make me oily witch is great
I bought this to put under makeup for additional SPF. This product burns my face and especially in the eyelid area. I am throwing it away.
If you have uneven skin and have problems with acne this will be a good face lotion to use morning and night
Acne all over my face after using this for about a week.. Is that normal reaction?.. I dont know if i have to still apply this to my face..
"I bought this product because it is fragrance free and contains sunscreen. After using product just once my skin, both cheeks, are red and burning."
Given the advice of my skin doctor I use nothing but Neutrogena now. My skin has never looked and felt never better.
I've been using this for over a year now every day. I have never broken out from it and it goes on well.
A small quantity is enough for whole face. Does not cause breakouts. good for both dry and oily areas.
Wife thoroughly enjoyed product out here in the New Mexico high desert where it is very dry and one experiences greater UV due to altitude
Pros: It really is oil free! Great sunscreen coverage. Works great for daily use under foundation. Will use the bottle up.
I've been using this product for 5 years now and it has been nothing but helpful. I 100% recommend it.
"The moisturizer works AMAZINGLY, but I wish it had SPF. It gets really annoying to put on sunscreen as well as moisturizer."
This product really dries my skin out. I can not use with foundation because it makes it cake up and flake.
"I got this a month ago as I was looking for a new moisturiser with spf, but this hurts my face! Doesn't make my skin feel soft, is thin and really irritates my skin."
"I'm a 20 yo guy and have pretty good skin, it just gets oily on my forehead and my nose. This moisturizer does nothing for that. It's a good moisturizer, it just doesn't do what it claims."
"I use this as my day moisturizer and love it! I never thought I would find a sunscreen/moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin, cause breakouts and make me look oily!"
I love this product! Some SPF product clog my pore but not this one. It is very light and goes on evenly. I also love the pump because it insures that I don't use to much product.
"I always liked this moisturizer, but unfortunately I do not find more in Brazil. Thera are very little products that we have here and the size are very small, some only found here and they don't have the same quality."
"My skin is a combination of oily and dry. I tried this instead of the sensitive skin one, but it left my face feeling un-moisturized. I definitely like the sensitive skin moisturizer better. It stripped my skin feeling flaky around my t-zone."
"This product doesn't bother my sensitive skin. It is fragrance free but does not smell bad. The smell reminds me of sunscreen, but it is very simple. I love using this product everyday."
"I have oily skin in my ""T"" zone but my cheeks always get dry. This moisterizer works perfectly without being greasy and offers all day protection from the sun. I use this daily after using my Neutrogena face wash and astringent...highly recommended!"
I really love this moisturizer! It's lightweight and makes my face feel really soft. My skin is super sensitive and has a tendency to break out with moisturizers but this didn't break my face out!
i've been using this product for only two days and i can already tell that my skin isn't even close to how dry it was! definitely a great moisturizer.
"Would really recommend this product. It's light, non-sticky, and absorbs really well. The pump dispenses the right amount, and it also lasts a good while too."
I have had this product for about a month and it seemed to be working in the beginning. I liked how it was a thin product but now a couple weeks later my skin seems to be dry after I put it on. Even after two or three applications of it. It just doesnt leave my skin without flakes and dry patches and doesn't seem like a great moisturizer.
After I wash my face my skin is dry but throughout the day my face becomes oily so I thought this would help. Ohh was I wrong. It caused my face to break out. I've never had acne and now I do. I can't even wear makeup because I'm scared it's going to make it worse. I'm so upset.
"I used this 2 times and now my face is covered in tiny red bumps/acne and has skin peeling off because it's so dry. I normally have very oily skin and don't breakout often but I noticed hours after using this my skin was irritated, extremely dry, and red. I can't tell if I'm breaking out or if it's a rash. Either way, I would not recommend this to anyone! Waste of money and now I have to figure out how to get my skin back to normal."
I have oily skin and this product helps balance the oil out while giving my skin the moisture it needs. The biggest problem is that theres no SPF and I would love it even better if it had that. Please put SPF in it! My skin has gotten so much better with this product overall.
I use this right when I get out of the shower when my face is already damp and it actually sucks the moisture OUT of my skin so that in less than thirty seconds my skin is not only dry but pulled taut across my face. The same happens in the morning after I wash my face I'm extremely disappointed in this.
"I have oily skin. My acne is moderate, mainly around my t-zone. I use this product during the winter, in the mornings after I wash my face. It really helps with the dryness effect, and softens my skin to an irresistible touch. It doesn't clog my pores, so it does the job perfectly. Bottom line I would recommend this product!"
"I have an extremely oily t-zone. I've tried several other products and after applying the moisturizer and my foundation, my face would become oily after only a couple of hours. This moisturizer controls the oil all day. I've never had to apply face powder or use a shine-control sheet anymore!"
"Regret getting this moisturiser. It's so runny and it just makes my face even oilier. I thought that this moisturiser wouldn't make my face goes red because i have rather sensitive skin and it also claims that it is hypoallergenic. But every single time when I apply it on my face, my face instantly turns red and hot. Definitely won't repurchase this product."
"The product leaves a greasy look on my face(not as noticeable as regular sunscreen) but enough for my skin to look like I am sweating. I believe this product does not work for those girls with dry skin and an oily t-zone. The product has worked for two of my friends, but they are very fair in complexion and already have nice skin to begin with. This product does not work well by itself when it comes to combatting against the sun for me; If your skin gets tanned fast I suggest an extra sunscreen on top of your face"
"Well, I have been using Proactiv for some time and my skin was finally starting to clear when one day I spent a ton of time outside and that night when i was washing my face, my skin started to feel like it was burning! The next day I was at Walgreens and I saw this! It looked perfect for me because it wasn't pore clogging and it gave me sun protection. Now I've been using it for about a month and I love it!! It makes my skin glow!"
"I know it states its hypoallergenic but I had an allergic reaction to this moisturizer. My skin broke out in a rash. I do have sensitive skin, so I thought that this would be sensitive enough for me but it most certainly was not. Also like other posts I too had oily skin after use."
"I have oily skin. I have purchased the Neutrogena moisturizer for combination skin and it worked great. Since I don't have combination skin, I assumed the moisturizer intended for oily skin would be more ideal for my skin however I was wrong. I realized a trend of skin break outs (I have really clean skin and I rarely get acne) and i am more oily than ever while using this product. I love Neutrogena's other products, this one is just not one of them."
Great product. I've been using this for years. But it is currently 118mL which is over the international airplane carry on limit of 100mL and I've probably had to give up a dozen of these to TSA over the years. Please reduce the size (and cost) just a tad!
"I have super sensitive skin. I had flakiness in all the wrong spots like my T-Zone and the creases in my nose and chin. This product reversed my flakiness, it absorbs very quickly! When u first apply the product it does feel slimy but it immediately absorbs into a soft, non-greasy moisturizer."
"I really wanted this to help my skin, but I've been using this for almost 2 months and its just OK. I use only half a pump because thats all you really need, and it has protected me from the sun so far this summer (I do reapply another sunscreen on top of this if I'm at the beach). It does smell like sunscreen and its a bit heavy, but after a couple of minutes it absorbs. I've had a few breakouts but thats nothing new, so it hasn't made my skin worse, or better."
"I've been using this moisturizer for less than a week with the deep clean long-last daily scrub and it works great! Im really excited about this moisturizer because its non-comedogenic, and fragrance-free which doesnt irritate my skin. Im in love with this product already. I strongly recommend it to people with kind of dry/normal skin."
"I always tried to find a moisturizer that would keep my skin soft and that wouldn't clog my pores. My skin is a bit sensitive so it always feels dry after I wash it. Most moisturizers I bought wouldn't keep my skin soft or were too heavy! Neutrogena's mosturizer is the best by far! i started using it a month ago, during the winter season and my skin look great and feels so soft! I LOVE IT"
"This moisturizer is the best. It doesn't cause breakouts but rather balances the skin. No more dry cheeks and oily chin! This is a great, light, everyday moisturizer. It works better on my sensitive skin than the version of this lotion designed for sensitive skin!"
i just bought this yesterday along with the Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask i was a little skeptikal but the reviews were so good and i never used a mosturizer before so i bought it BEST THING EVER this is the first time i ever write a review on a product its almost 4 pm and i have not had to use any of my oil absorbing pads at all today and i usually use 4-6 a day BUY THIS PRODUCT IT WORKS INSTANTLY!!
I am currently replacing my expensive store brand that no longer works with Neutrogena products. The first time I used the Oil-Free Moisture for combination skin it started healing my dry skin. My skin especially takes a beating during the winter months (my nose peels constantly) and this lotion works so well in keeping my combination skin oil free and hydrated at the same time.
"I love this moisturizer! I just started using it and I have been very happy with the results. I have combination skin, and this definitely gives me moisture in my dry and flakey areas, and keeps my oily spots under control. My favorite discovery about this product is that by mid-day, my skin still has a matte-appearance as if I just put my makeup on. I have never experienced oil control like this from any other makeup, powder, or moisturizer before!"
"This moisturizer is so lightweight and smooth, it is unbelievable that it actually does anything, but it works really well. I have dry skin in some spots and acne prone oily skin in other spots, and to top it off, my skin is VERY sensitive to chemicals, but this moisturizer fixes everything without irritating my skin. It is also very plain (in a good way) and free of SPF and anti-aging anti-wrinkle anti-skin junk that every moisturizer is chock full of now-a-days. I am glad I found this product, and won't be using anything else in the future."
"This is the best facial moisturizer I've ever, EVER used. It doesn't leave my face feeling greasy after application or dry once evening rolls around. I love that it has SPF 15 too and I use it year-round to help protect my skin. The bottle usually lasts me a couple of months so it's well worth the price! I'd recommend it to anyone!"
Nice product. Makes skin soft and feel nice. Also smells nice.
Why change a good thing!?!? Not a fan of the new formula...
This is the first moisturizer that didn't make my skin feel greasy/helped control my oily Tzone.
Light not greasy or sticky. Nice light fragrance. Good sunscreen too.
I have been using this product for 5 years and I just love it.
I love this facial lotion! I have an oily T-Zone and this lotion helps keep my oily areas down.
"non-oily, goes on smooth. Immediately relieves dry skin. Been using this for about 5 years. Still satisfied."
If they ever discontinue this I will scream. It's not heavy/goopy on my troublesome combination skin. And it doesn't smell weird.
On the first and second days It left my skin feeling smooth clean and soft! On the third day it took away almost all my acne problems! Love it <3
It's oily and makes your face really shiny. I'm getting more pimples because of it. Might have to look for another moisturizer
"this product is supposed to be oil be oil free, but it leave my face feeling greasy. i think it's even causing me to break out which i rarely do."
I love this product! It protects my skin from getting sun burned and it keeps my face from being oliy. I love it!!!!!!!
"This product does what it says at a reasonable price. It is not a ""wow"" experience, but it keeps my skin moist and protected."
Excellent! Love the moisture that I get from this cream especially since it doesn't feel oily at all. Great for using under makeup.
"This is the only face cream I will ever use, it absorbs into my skin fast & really makes it feel smooth. I love it a lot !"
I absolutely love this product I wear it every day it controls the oil in my T zone where I get oily and Moistures my dry skin areas and I use it as a primer as well and it makes my make up last so long absolutely in love
This product made my face greasy even though it is supposed to be oil free. It felt like a greasy film on my face. I had to wash this stuff off immediately. Don't buy this product. You will be throwing your money away. Buy something else instead.
"I found my new face moisturizer. The aroma smells like the beach, so fresh and light. Within seconds, my face feels so soft and smooth. I will keep using this product daily because it's oil free. I live in Florida so the SPF is very important."
I have only been using this for 2 days and i love it. It feels great on my skin! I never used a moisturizer before and i love it. I used the oil free acne wash by neutrogena which dried my skin but this moisturizer rejuenvates it!!! SO buy it
"I have sensitive and oily skin and I bought this and after about a week of using it, after using it makes my skin dry and have white flakes. I will probably not get this in the future for it doesn't serve its purpose for me"
I used this for almost a year and it's lightweight and gives me the perfect amount of moisture without feeling greasy or oily. My cheeks are mostly dry while my t-zone gets oily and this moisturizer works great for my skin!
"I have used this moisturizer for years and love it. I have oily/comination skin and live in a hot, humid climate. This product protects my skin with a good SPF but doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts. A wonderful, affordable product!!"
"It's the only facial moisturizer I've used so far that does not make me break out. Only a small quantity needs to be applied, so it lasts quite long. Works great when used with the original formula Facial Cleansing Bar. Awesome product!"
"I use this every day. It's not greasy, has sun block, and feels great after shaving too. Excellent product to moisturize and protect without clogging pores or feeling greasy."
"I used this after the wave Sonic, and my skin felt fantastic! my skin actuall had a glow to it. Which is important since I have such tan skin that can be oily. I found that adding a moisturizer actually reduced the oil amount in my face."
I use Proactiv 2x everyday and this is the perfect finish! I use it on my face and neck after step 3 and it helps keep my skin hydrated all day & protected. Thank you for making it :D
I find Oil-Free Moisture SPF-15 does a great job of hydrating my face without leaving it feeling greasy or slick. I plan to continue using this product regularly as a part of my daily cleansing routine
"I have combination skin (oily T-zone, dry cheeks) and I love that this moisturizer takes care of both of those problems. It feels really light and clean on my face. Thanks Neutrogena! :)"
"I been using this one for years. It great.I been recommend neutrogena it to people for year,and I'm 55.Looking for eye cream now. Thanks Neutrogena"
"I have sensitive skin and I thought this would be great because it's oil free and water based, and is advertised to moisturize while controlling shine. I will put this on in the morning after cleansing and by the time I get to school my nose and my forehead are shining badly. Since using this product I also started to see clogged pores on my forehead and blackheads. My skin might just not be ideal for this product, but from my experience I was not happy."
I bought this moisturizer because it is oil free and I had been dealing with some breakouts on my combination skin. I used this product for about 2-3 weeks to give it a fair try. WORST MISTAKE EVER! This product left my skin soooo dry. I had to go get a facial to add some moisture to my poor skin. I have tried several moisturizers and this has been by far the worst I've used. I was so disappointed with this product that I decided to write my fist review ever to warn others!
"I got this product because neutrogena's grapefruit scrub left my skin feeling dry. At first, I felt strange using moisturizer, because I hadn't used it before, but I soon came to love it. It really leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. Having combination skin, my t-zone is especially oily, and my cheeks can be really dry. But this moisturizer balances everything out... I love it!"
"This product is amazing... I have oily skin and I've tried most of the products that I was recommended to use, but this moisturiser is the one that works for me. it slightly makes my face shinny which isn't a bad thing I guess. also I did not breakout when using this product, which is a huge thumbs up."
"I have been using this since 2 months, suggested by my friend. It was working good till now, but since a week my face becomes very oily within 2 hours.. If i wont use this cream my skin will be normal, because of oiliness am getting pimples. Kindly Suggest."
"I have very oily skin on my nose, cheeks, and forehead and while this product does moisturize the rest of my face well it does absolutely nothing to mattify the oily areas (like it claims) . But it doesn't break me out and feels noticeably lighter than every other moisturizer I've tried (alot) so I'll stick with it until I can find a something better."
"I'm not a big moisturizer person, but during winter time my skin gets a bit dry so i thought I'd give it a try, and I've always had oily t-zones so this was suppose to be perfect, while it does its best to control shine, my skin still feels dry, and even after i put it on my skin just feels tight and not exactly moisturized. If you have dry skin I would not recommend this product."
"I have naturally oily skin and this products rocks at keeping this at bay. I use this in conjunction with the face wash (the orange one). Every moisturizer I used prior to this one would create an even bigger oil problem leading to acne. And at my age, I shouldn't still be combating acne. So if you have oily skin and need an oil free moisturizer, this stuff will do."
"I bought this face moisturizer for my combination skin, and it has worked really good for me. It keeps my face matte almost all day, it gets a little oily but not that much just a hint. I have tried Yes To Tomatoes Clear Skin Daily Balancing Moisturizer it did not work for me my face would be oily 30 minutes later. I also tried Equate Dual Power Moisturizer the same as yes to tomatoes. This one worked really good for me. I just kept trying until I found the right one for me."
I have combination skin (obviously) that is extreme. My dry spots get very dry and flake if not moisturized and my oily spots get wayyyy oily if over moisturized. I used to use the Dove moisturizer but it was discontinued. Ever since then I have experimented with many different face lotions that either made me too oily or didn't moisturize enough. I bought this moisturizer about a month ago and I am glad to say I have found the moisturizer!!! It goes on light but gives you moisture. It is amazing!
"I've always suffered from dry skin and scars on my face. but once i used this cream, my face has gotten so much better! Everyone has told me my face looks a lot more healthier, and clean. i use this cream before i sleep after washing my face, and in the morning. I highly recommend this to others. But yet again, every face works different but it worked well for me. Just remember to wash your face then put the cream for better results. And put it under your makeup. I will forever use this cream, i love it!"
"I love how quickly this sinks into my face, and it feels so nice. It doesn't have a weird smell, and it lasts FOREVER. The only downside for me is that it is only spf 15. I have tried the spf 35 and it feels and smells completely different to this one. Obnoxious. I have been using this for 3 years though and I will continue."
I have combo skin and this really makes my whole face feel kind of oily and greasy :/ The spf is good but it really does take a long time to sink into your skin. I think for combo/oily skin this can make you look greasy but my mom with dry skin swears by this! She buys this in bulk lol. Just not for me.
"I have tried several products for my face that promises to deliver, finally I found one that did just that! I have also purchased the facial bar cleanser, the pore refining toner and the night time rapid wrinkle repair! Great stuff. Neutrogena keep up the good work! :)"
"I have been using this sunscreen for 2 weeks, and it started to burn. Not goood :("
"Love the smell of the lotion. It goes on light, makes my sick feel soft, and doesn't feel greasy."
I've been using Neutragena for over 40 years always exceptional value!!!
I have been using thid product for 10 years and it keeps my skin supple and balanced.
I have flaky oily skin that breaks out mildly. This product really helped my skin break out less and look and feel healthier. Best I've tried.
This product has worked great for me. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. It's light and you don't even know you have it on.
This is my favoriate product. It cleanses and softens without drying. I have a healthy glow. Thanks Neutrogena
"Ive tried them all. All are thick to me and smell like sun screen. I cant walj around smelling it. Im sensitive, combi skin. I dont wear any make up but eye make up. Not acne prone. Over priced!"
I like how it moisturizes my skin but the odor burns my eyes. There's another cheaper brand that uses the same ingredients which does not burn my eyes but it makes me look oily. I thought this would be better.
i have used this for over three years & have combination skin with acne scars and a few pimples arise every once in a while. its a good moisturizer but thats it. nothing more special...
This moisturizer is great for sunny weather with UV rays. The bad thing is it smells just like sunscreen so if you wear it when it's cold you will smell like sunscreen. It doesn't leave your skin dry or tight.
"This product defiantly helps you have dry and oily skin. It keeps most of the oil controlled and the dry patches disappear! Overall, an almost everyday product for me. Thanks Neutrogena!"
it's okay I wish it was a little thicker and worked faster. I was using proactive and it really dried out my skin so I used this and u don't get fast results at all. Bottom line not that impressive.
"It makes feels greasy when I apply it and it appears greasy but the look does eventually wear off (although I can't tell you how long it takes). From what I can tell, it had not broken my skin out yet."
i use this item every night with first toner and night cream and then moisturrizer. also i use every morning just toner and this. my skin feels smoother than before.
"I have combo skin, oily T-zone and super dry flaky cheeks. I've tried EVERYTHING. Nothing has worked better than this amazing product. I wish there was some sort of SPF in it though ):"
"I have combination skin and this is fabulous. Right after I got it, I tested it out. My skin immediately felt softer. Yes, it does smell slightly like sunscreen like people said but it's not overwhelming. I will definitely purchase this again."
"Neutrogena finally reformulated the active sunscreens in this, to include Avobenzone, so it now provides both UVA and UVB protection, which it did not before. Some people might not be happy with the formula change, but there is no point in using an SPF product that does not provide both UVA/UVB protection. This also smells so good, like watermelon! I find it sinks in/absorbs quickly, but will leave behind that sunscreen sheen, that all SPF's seem to. I will re-buy!"
"I really wanted to like this product. The reviews were decent and the product promises to moisturize and control oil. Sadly, I was let down. I broke out after using it. I used it for over a month to give it a chance, but now I can firmly say that this product is not worth buying."
"Firstly, I was excited about this product because it was made especially for people with combination skin like me. I had high hopes for this product. However, this moisturizer did not moisturize my less oily places and did nothing to decrease the oil in my T-zone. ): I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"I wanted to purchase an oil free product since my skin is already oily. However when I searched the ingredients of this product I saw there are some fatty acids and oil in it. then why do you write 'oil free' on it? also it is written 'fragnance free' too, I am not sure because the product smells like a parfume. this brand is a dissappointment for me after purchasing this product, I cannot trust you anymore."
"This cream is drying my face out sooo bad. What kind of moisturizer cream drys your face out? Says NO Alcohol, but when you look at the ingredients there is alcohol in it. I am soo upset your cream has done this to my face. All dried and cracked up. Thanks Nutrogena!!"
"My daughter has been using this product for about a year. About 3 months ago, her face began to itch and turn red. It slowly spread all over her face and got so bad her eyes were irritated and puffy. Her doctor asked her to stop using all products. We thought it was make-up she was using. After 2 weeks of using nothing, her face returned to normal. However, she used it once yesterday (and wore no make-up) and woke up with her face all red and puffy again! The company needs to look at the ingredients again!!!"
"Even in my T-zone, which is very oily, this product dries my face out like crazy. Within 30 seconds of putting it on, my entire face is so dry that my skin is pulled tight, and it physically hurts when I smile, raise my eyebrows, etc. Don't be fooled! This product will only work for you if your skin is very, very oily and needs to be dried out."
"This product is okay, but that's it. The price is fine and I guess it's okay for the money, but this makes my face really oily, especially by the end of the day. My face is not at all oily naturally, and after putting this on it's okay but after school this feels really heavy and it makes my face really oily. Wouldn't recommend..."
"I either have an incredibly oily T-zone, or this product is not working. I combine this moisturizer with two other cosmetic products from Neutrogena that are advertised for controling shine in the T-zone...and yet have four hours my skin is shiny and oily again. Not to mention that with the dry season approaching, my skin has been sucking this moisturizer up so much that my cheeks feel dry right after I put it on. I will probably stick to their sensitive skin moisturizer since I never seem to go wrong with those."
"I bought this hoping that it would help me produce a lot less oil throughout the day, because my skin is very oily. It helps, but my skin still produces a lot of oil, so I don't think that I would repurchase this. Maybe it's just because my skin produces too much oil, or maybe this product is not really made to amaze."
"I normally used a Biore Daily Moisturizing product but for some reason they stopped making it, or the store I was getting it from stopped stocking it. Anyhow I decided to try this Neutro moisturizing product but I really don't like it at all. It says oil-free but feels super greasy when putting it on. Almost like spreading vaseline on my face. Won't buy again."
"my skin is oily type..so i have many acne scars,blackheads n whiteheads..i've been using many other moisturisers but it make my skin worst..this is my 3rd day using this product n so far so good for me..it control my oily area n hydrate dry area at my face.. =))"
"I haven't used this for all that long and I know that I'm going to really like this moisturizer. It made my skin soft and smooth, and it's really hydrating. And it does help control the oil on my face. It's not the cheapest moisturizer out there, but I can tell it will last a long time, because I don't even need an entire pump for my entire face and neck. I was using Clean & Clear Dual Action moisturizer before this, and I needed close to four pumps just for my face. So although I wish this was a little less expensive, it's worth it."
"I applied this for the first time before going to bed last night. This morning I woke up with puffy eyes, and the skin around my eyes and hairline had a rash and was irritated. Who knows how long will until my face looks normal again. Will be returning this to the store."
I've tried quite a few moisturizers and this one is the best of all! I have combination skin and this moisturizer hydrates the dry areas and controls shine in the oily areas at the same time. I've been using this product along with the Deep Clean cleansers for years and I absolutely love it!
"I really like this moisturizer. It's really lightweight and that's great because I'll put a little bit in some areas and a lot in other areas and my face won't feel all gunky. It controls oil for about four and a half hours in my oiliest parts and almost all day for the dry parts. Really great! It's unscented and only irritated my usually non-sensitive skin when I started a new topical acne medication. Other than that, no problems there. Great buy!"
"I have been using this product for more than 20 years. I love it. This moisturizer provides me with a nice smooth, non sticky, non tacky moisturizer. It also provides me with SPF coverage. Plus it's fragrance free or if there is a smell it's minimal. I have very sensitive skin & this product doesn't make my skin breakout."
"Neutrogena's Oil-Free Moisturizer turned my dry skin areas into normal skin. It also does not cause acne on my acne-prone face. It even prevents my face from producing too much sebum. I use this product after exfoliating my face at night. Overall, a great product that does not leave an oily residue on my problematic combination skin. I like how this moisturizer does not contain SPF. I hope Neutrogena keeps on making this product."
"I bought this product for [$]. The first time I was happy with this product. On the second day however, I was thinking in the office with my hand on my face. White dust (similar to what we see after rubbing eraser on a piece of paper) stuck to my fingers. I looked into the mirror and when I rubbed the skin between ear and cheek, more white stuff was peeling off. It was the moisturizer, as I didn't wear make up or sunscreen. I am disappointed because my expectations were high from this product."
"I love neutrogena products and I think they are a quality brand. This moisturizer didnt work for me, I may have picked the wrong one for my skin type but I do consider myself as having combination skin, anyways I felt like this cream was drying my face alot and that I had to reapply. It also made my face feel sticky. This is one didnt work for me but im sure it will work for someone else"
"Light weight, non greasy. Perfect for everyday use."
This is one of the best moisturizing cream for my face. it leaves my face very soft.
It was a pleasure to know it works good helped with the blackheads.
"This product is not greasy, feels good on the skin, has medium SPF protection and softens skin."
I like the fact that my daily moisturizer has sunscreen.
It worked pretty well on most of my face but didn't do very much for my oily T zone.
This is the best face cream I ever got.It works fine in both cold and hot weather.
It tanned my skin. It also made it itch I used to use the sensitive moisturizer. I will be switching back.
"I turned 64 last week but I look the reverse (46), I believe it's due to good genes and Neutrogena skin care!!!"
"My cheeks are usually rough and blotchy, but this moisturizer is really moistening and softening my skin!"
"i have combo oily skin and do tend to get breakouts occasionally... tried this today for the 1st time, so far, so good!"
i have combination skin. when i used this my skin became very oily and shiny! I got lots and lots of pimples on my face. The smell is not that bad as mentioned by some.
This product is the best thing you will ever use i have the softest skin i have ever had and i have spent 100s of dollars on expensive name brand moisturizeres but this is your money's worth.
"So I have oily combination skin and I decided to try out this moisturizer today. After putting it on it completely dried up my skin, feeling a bit sticky as well. I do not recommend this to anyone."
I looked everywhere for a facial cream that wouldnt make my skin more oily and so.... HAPPY to say i found it and its not that expensive as other facial creams :D
"The smoothness it's light texture and it works, rejuvenation of my face Margr"
Neutrogena oil is fantastic
works great i use it on a daily basis
"Works great for my skin, doesn't leave it oily"
I have been using this moisturizer for many years. I love it.
A little goes a long way. It goes on without being greasy. Love it!
I have used this product for my face for about 20 years. Love it!
"This product might be good, but it smells like medicine. Also, my skin became red when I put it for the first time. Will return it."
Its my first time use this product. I love it!!!! Left my face fresh and so soft and smooth. It's a keeper.... :)
It works great
caused acne every time I used it........................................................
If you wear makeup this would be a great moisturizer for your skin and excellent in the winter.
