I've used this for as long as I remember.. .every morning after washing my face. I am 65 now (!) and people remark on my skin-- how clear and fresh it looks. I hope they never stop making this!
"I've been using Neutrogena face lotion since my early 20's and I am 50 now and look like I'm about 20 years younger probably due to using the Neutrogena lotion with sun protection around my eyes. The lotion is light, doesn't make my skin break out, properly moisturizes my skin, and keeps my skin smooth. It does the job!"
daily it burns and your skin flakes but slowly overtime you lose that dull fine wrinkly look that drives most people to crazy town. i absolutely love this product. use it everyday with some extra sunscreen and you will look amazing for the rest of your life! have used it for over 15 years. people think I am ten years younger.
"I know this product is advertised for the face, but I use this lotion on my arms. I used to have red bumps all over my upper arms but I haven't had any bumps for years since using this lotion. I love it!"
I've been using this product for close to 10 years. I receive compliments on my skin and feel it's primarily because of this Neutrogena moisturizer with alpha hydroxy. I'm not even aware of my skin when I use it - just love it!
"Have you ever had a complete stranger tell you your skin is beautiful? I have - all the time! Young, old, men, women - everyone! I started using this product years ago. It was inexpensive and didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I keep using it for the results I get - and the results make me smile. I don't go to makeup/skin care parties anymore because everyone wants to know what I use. I keep a picture of my Neutrogena products on my phone so I can forward it to people. Makes me smile."
Great lotion! I'm 53 and have used this for years. It makes my skin look fresh and young.
I've been using this lotion for several years and wouldn't trade it for anything.
I am 81 years old and have been using healthy skin lotion for 35 years. People that I meet compliment me on my skin and want to know the secret. I have never used anything on my face except soap and water and healthy skin face lotion.
I bought this product thinking it would help my skin look refreshed which it seemed to at first but it burned quite a bit. time goes by and I use it one day and the next day my eyes are swollen and irritated. then there was some kind of burn or chaff or rash in the areas that were swollen. no more neutrogena for me.
This lotion contains 2 things that are a must for women: Alpha Hydroxy which helps turn over the top layer of skin to bring a lovely smoothness to it & SPF 15 which we all need to wear during the day to protect ourselves from the aging effects of the sun.
"I have bought this product for years, it is fantastic and delivers all you could hope for in a face cream. My frustration is the push top applicator continues to break. Third time in a row I now have to open the container and get the cream out manually."
I have been using this product for some time now. It works great with my skin
Switched to this product because I could no longer get the Healthy Defense moisture lotion SPF30 â€”which I have been using for (honestly) at least 15 years. This makes my face sting upon application and even though it is only SPF15 it smells as strongly as the HD SPF50. I doubt I will finish the bottle. I hope the HD SPF 30 is not a thing of the past.
"I bought this product today to replace the moisturizer I just ran out of. I showered and washed my face and then proceeded to put this product on my face. As soon as I put it on, my face starting burning so bad I had to wipe it off. I do not have sensitive skin or allergies to any ingredients. Why did this burn my face so bad that it's red??"
This combined with Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Fragrance Free Liquid has really changed my skin. I am very happy.
I have been using this cream for many years and although I am now 66 people still think I'm in my early 50s...I wouldn't use anything else [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this face lotion for a couple years and its really great. It's light but does the job without leaving a thick layer on your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product fo several years. It does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin and in my case does not cause a breakout of acne or a rash. My skin is smooth and soft and is my favorite lotion.
"I love this product and have used it for years. Besides good genetics, I am convinced this has helped keep my skin looking and feeling healthy. People never guess my actual age!"
"I have been uising Neutrogena face lotion iwth SPF 15 for a very long time. I tried to remember when I started uisng it, and found this site to look up when it was first made. Anyways, I have never missed a day uisng it and I am 67.5 year of age, and I am told that I look in my early 50's. I have three small scars from an fall as a kid, but few wriinkles. It's incredible. Please don't change it."
"For thos who first start using it, down the road they will love it! From Nova Scotia, Canada."
"I'm a 23 year old female who has mild acne and moderately oily skin. This product significantly reduced my acne, reduced my acne dark spots, and has evened out the texture of my skin. I wake up with a glowing complexion... I use this product at night only bc it has a low level of spf and the alpha hydroxy in it makes skin especially prone to sunburn, thus, premature wrinkles. The product does sting and it has a sunscreen/acidic scent, but the results it gives are well worth it!"
"I have been using this product for about 30 years. I give it credit for my youthful-looking skin appearance at 59 years of age. It has done wonders for me. While I use it in combination with other Neutrogena products, I have used the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion the longest. My husband is also a user. He added it a few years back to his skin regimen and I can see the change in his appearance."
I have tried everything. I am 53 and no one guesses my age. They think my 31 year old son is my brother. I love the Alpha Hydroxy and sun screen. My dermotoligist told me that if I use a good retinoid product and Alpha Hydroxy product my skin would look almost the same in 10 years. This is the best on the market.
"The initial uses brought a tingling/stinging sensation to my face to the point of pain. A few days later, I now have scaly bumps under both eyes and they turn red. I actually missed a day of work this week because my face was so swelled up, it was almost hard to open my eyes. I admittedly have very sensitive skin."
"My boyfriend also uses this lotion with absolutely no issues and actually, he loves it. His skin actually looks really great. I think I am just unfortunately not able to use this product."
"I am a clinical aesthetician and has been working in a plastic surgeons office for the past 15 years. Over the years we have carried top of the line skin care products. I have to say that out of all of the ""best"" products and the most expensive, Neutrogena healthy skin with alpha hyroxy acids is the absolute BEST!!!! I have been using it for several years and I recommend to all of my clients!!!!"
"You won't be able to find many AHa products in the store that come in a ph that will exfoliate your skin. This does. It comes with antioxidants too. It leaves my dry skin looking hydrated, not greasy. Has not caused breakouts. I wish the spf protected you from both UVA and UVB rays of the sun. People guess me years younger than I am."
"The first few times I used this product, it felt like I was rubbing my face with steel wool. After about three days, the burning feeling was gone, and my skin was visibly brighter. Make no mistake that this product works. The burning feeling is pretty awful, but it pays off in the long run. I love the way my skin looks and feels, and there is a warning about burns on the bottle."
I had tried every skin care cream and system in the book! I don't have severe acne but i do have some blemishes here and there and this stuff works great. It helps keep my face clear and moisturized! I live in Florida so SPF is a must and its a great combination mixed into a bottle! Bottle lasts quite a while because you only use two squirts and as you can see it isn't expensive! LOVE love love!
"I received a sample of this lotion from my dermatologist when I inquired about how to get rid of a very large sunspot on my cheek. I used this product for a couple months and the spot was completely gone. It was amazing. I continue using this as my daily moisturizer and I love it. My only request would be that it have a higher SPF. But please, Neutrogena, please continue making this product."
"I have been using this product for many, many years. Sure I have tried all the trendy things theat promise youth and vitality. I'm 60 and my skin is great, i have to say. No wrinkles, great texture and the tone is just wonderful. I also have no weird dark spots or ""age spots"" either. I love that SPF is built right in and you will too. I suggest that if your unhappy with what you are using, or confused about what to use-try this, it's just a great product with great ingriedients from a great company."
"i am a 41yr old who looks like she is in her early 30s. I ALWAYS protect my face from the suns harmful rays. This product isn't heavy on my face,smells great,helps with fine lines and protects my face from the sun. Whenever asked what I do to make my face look so good,I tell people use sunscreen but definitely use neutrogena healthy skin face lotion with SPF 15..thank you for making a great product"
I love this product. I would get hormonal breakouts every month and my face was always a little red and blotchy. I started using this lotion regularly about 4 months ago and have not had one breakout since and my skin is even and soft. This has been such a relief to me as I had tried so many products before this one.
"I've used Neutrogena oil free facial moisturizer for several years. I can't find that any longer and bought this new item, Healthy Skin Face Lotion. Tried it today and it immediately burned my face...tingled. I immediately wiped as much off as I could with a tissue. I've used Neutrogena sunscreen for years, body and face, with NO issue...love the line! A few hours later my face still tingled. I checked on line and found similar reports in previous ratings! I will be discarding this product."
"I have no idea why this has sunscreen in it, this would be a holy grail product if the sunscreen filters were removed as avobenzone is known to irritate skin. Don't call something non comedogenic and let everyone who has a tendency for clogged pores suffer. I love that it has glycolic acid, panthenol, and ascorbic acid and it works wonderfully as a moisturizer, maybe a bit greasy from the sunscreen. However, it isn't worth using if it's going to break me out."
Me and this product we go way back. More than 15 years. I've been using this product for so long that I am looking for an upgrade. I look young with no wriggle so far. I have not use any anti aging products. Just Neutrogena soap and moisturizer. I am proud of myself for not spending thousand in anti aging products I have recommended this products to my mom and sister and they are happy with it.
"I have been using this lotion for as long as I can remember. I am 41 now. People always comment on how young I look. I credit the youthful skin in large part to this product. If I ever catch wind that it will be discontinued, I will buy a major surplus of it!"
"I have combination skin (oily at t-zone, dry on cheeks) and this moisturizer worked amazingly well for me. It was especially good when I lived in SE Asia and I could not use my regular jojoba oil moisturizer because it was too greasy in the tropics. Totally recommend."
"I have been using this product for 19 years now, and I swear it has made a difference. You need to give it a ""break in"" period, but once you adjust to it you'll notice a difference. I'm 53 and can pass for late 30s, early 40s. I give this product a lot of the credit"
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I use it everyday. It has helped my lines. I am a Neutrogena girl. I start my day with this face lotion, Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye Cream (I don't have crow's feet!) and I finish with Neutrogena Sunscreen. Don't ever change! I love all your products. Thanks!"
"I used to use this product years ago , I decided to try it again. My face was so rough and blotchy , nothing worked. So I started with Healthy Skin 2 weeks ago and about on the 10th day my face was itchy and rough,. I decided to continue with it by day 12 my face was smooth and glowing . Even some small wrinkles that I had were diminished , I didn't even buy the product for wrinkles .I am happy and I will continue using Neutrogena"
"The Neutrogena product I had really loved was discontinued. It was the one that was radiance-boosting with no alpha hydroxyl, or retinol. This product burns my sensitive skin where the other did not. It is a good product for those who do not have sensitive skin. I like the fact that alpha-hydroxyl is an exfoliant revealing new skin by sloughing off the dull top layers. Just keep it away for the eyes."
I have used Healthy Skin Face Lotion since I was 22. I'm now 43 and I will never stop using it. This is my one staple product I will NOT do without. I look like I am in my mid to late 20's and I place all recognition on this moisturizer. When you have used a product this long and it has worked for you for this many years that speaks volumes for a product.
"My skin is smooth and clear. At age 57, I am constantly told how great I look. Part of this I credit to genetics, part to a health lifestyle, and part to using this product to moisturize and protect my skin since for at least the past 15 years. I have very sensitive, dry skin."
"I find this product to be very good. I am 72 yrs. old and have always had good skin but sensitive to many products. I find with this product my skin is clearer, more elastic and looks better than before. I use a moisturizer in top and suntan lotion with zinc. It is excellent and I highly recommend it. I do not get irritation with it. I also use the eye lotion."
"i m suffering from sun damage and acne marks.my overall skin tone is so bad,i bought this lotion to take a chance. i like it very much after first use i saw change. and my skin is improving for me its not sting not irritating. this is my second week and my acne makes getting lighter.i gave it 4 star because for me its little oily this is summer so my face looks oily after the application.but i apply my press powder after that so its OK. its not give me breakout that a plus."
"I'm glad the label is honest about the fact that users may experience some irritation at first. I did, but I used it just once a day until my face got acclimated to it, and I have to say it's fantastic! I seriously can't recall the last time my face felt this soft and hydrated. I like that it contains SPF 15, as well. I've read you need to protect your skin from the sun every day, regardless of the weather. I love this lotion. My skin is SO soft & smooth!"
"Healthy Skin has a very light and clean texture. I add it to my foundation every morning and put the excess on my hands. It makes my skin smooth and evens out blotchy skin on my face and hands. The stores that I usually buy this product have stopped carrying it and replaced with another NEW Neutrogena product, so now I will buy this one online. I'm addicted to it! :)"
"I have been using this lotion on my face and neck for many years. I love it for the SPF and Alpha-Hydroxy ingredients. It's smooth, non-greasy. And I totally believe it has helped maintained my younger appearance. Downfall, it use to be available in two sizes...I don't like it is only available in the smaller size now."
there is a reason why neutrogena is dermologist recommended
"When it says it may sting a bit, they really mean it, other than that I like that it's not greasy and it absorbs fast."
I just wanna touch my face all day. I noticed my pores got smaller so my make-up looks more natural. Its not greasy. Some negatives are the bottle is small for something that's 10 bucks and the smell isn't pleasant but its still worth it!
Not sure if it is the sunscreen/alpha hydroxy in this product but it burns and dried out the skin around my eyes. Love your other products such as the Oil Free Face lotion but this stuff is not good.
Seemed a little too thick for me and being that I am sensitive to smells in general I didn't like that aspect too much either (it smelled like a regular sunscreen as opposed to a beauty face cream) the moisture was just ok.
"While I normally like Neutrogena products this has caused severe burns, swollen red face with severe itching. Even required visit yo Dr to. Reduce effects. Will never use again."
"I have bought this product and love it! However, I cannot find it in any stores anymore. I typically do not like to order on the internet. Can you let me know where I could get some? If I ever find it again, I will buy a few bottles."
"I also have used this product for decades. It smoothes, conditions and preps my skin for makeup. People actually guess me decades younger than I am. I believe the Alpha Hydroxy and retinol help."
So glad I tried this lotion out! I had all but given up on a product that wouldn't make my skin oily. I love this lotion. It feels light weight and goes on easily.
I've been using this for 10 years and I will never go a day without it. I'm 46 and get mistaken for my early 30s all the time and ALOT of the credit goes to Neutrogena. I have 10 bottles stock piled just in case they ever stop making it!
I am in my early 60s and in the past few weeks I have had 2 people tell me how young my face/skin looks. I have used this product and the eye creme daily for 40 plus years. I attribute my 'good' skin to this product. Thank you Neutrogena!
I have used this product for about 15 years and people usually think I look between 5 to 10 years younger than I am. I don't doubt this product has played a big role. Alpha hydroxy does wonders. Shhhhhh!!!!
"i bought this a week ago, and i applied it to my skin and it burned my whole face. I am prone to eczema and dry skin. i now have red scales on my face from this."
"I've used this product on and off for years. I've taken breaks thinking to either save money or go with a more expensive product, thinking it's going to be better. I ALWAYS return to this. My skin never looks as good with anything else. This is simply my Holy grail of moisturizers."
"Neutrogena is a excellent brand , amazing product . I recommend it to everyone !"
"I am prone to very dry skin, and I have eczema. However, I applied this to my face and it immediately started burning, and I had to remove it. I thought that maybe it was because of the dryness and rashes, so I tested it below my wrist and it still burned. I will continue to use their regular 15 spf sunscreen instead, which I recommend."
"I purchased this product two days ago. The first time used my face tingled and was red. I thought it was just the use of alpha-hydroxy since I haven't used this product for a while. Today I woke up with a swollen, red, itchy face. The swelling/fluid around my eyes is impeding my vision. Completely dissappointed as I have loved Neutrogena products in the past - including this one. Will try to return to the store where I purchased. Never again."
I'm am sorry about some people's experience with this product because I have such good results. I have been using for many years twice a day and hope it is never discontinued or formula changed. It is an exfolient that leaves skin more smooth and fine lines diminished and plumped. If your a first time user it takes time for your skin to adjust.
"I have been using this product for so many years I can""t remember. It""s the only cream I use on my face. The skin of my body is rather wrinkled, but not my face. I use it everyday, I ""ve read it helps with the production of colagen. It's a pitty that in Uruguay, where I live, they stopped importing it so I have to buy it in USA.I strongly recomend it!!"
I only bought accidentally when taking a flight; the bottle was small enough in ounces to carry on so I bought it...WHAT A GREAT ACCIDENT! I have tried all kinds of acne products only to be disappointed. I have been using this for 10 months and have never been so happy about my appearance; others have noticed also. Tingles when I first put it on then goes away...definitely worth anyone who has acne problems to give it a try! :O)
"Really like this lotion. My skin looks and feels more smooth, radiant and hydrated. It absorbs very quickly, it's light and not greasy at all. Now I'm trying it to my cleavage zone to fight dryness caused by the sun. Hope it will work as well it does to my face skin!"
I have really dry skin in the winter time and it would flake and look really bad. Once I started using this I have had no problems. I haven't had dry skin since and it doesn't clog pores so I don't have to worry about break outs like I did with other products. I have been using this for years and won't be changing any time soon.
I love this lotion! I've used it for years and have always found it to go in smoothly and in quickly to make a nice base for make up.
I love this product. I started using it in my late 40's and have had many compliments on my skin tone. Wouldn't be without it.
I have used this product for years and it is the only sunscreen I can use where I don't breakout around my nose.
"Amazing, feels light but has a tingle. Love the alpha hydroxy acids and sunscreen a must for oily skin!!"
"Neutrogena is a name I trust completely. I've been using this product for years, and it makes a big difference. My skin looks younger than my 60 years!"
I started used this product in my early 20s and I have found that this lotion has been beneficial for me over the last 10 years of using it. The information on the package and bottle is accurate. It does leave a dewy finish.
ive been using this product under my makeup each morning and it creates a smooth canvas and makes my makeup last all day. it really keep my oily skin under control and smooths my skins texture :)
I love the Healthy Skin Face Lotion! After just a week my face felt reviatlized and more vibrant! Its non-greasy formula is amazing and I have reccomended it to many friends who love it as well!! Thank you Neutrogena!!
Great!!!
made my eyelids burn
"I used this product almost every day for the warmer months and it was great- no problems, skin felt great. Then I switched to a heavier moisturizer for the winter and then back again in the spring. A few hours after I applied red blotches started appearing with a burning sensation. I think it is the Alpha Hydroxyl and my skin needs to build up a tolerance to being able to take it, using a very small amount at the beginning and not every day."
"Unfortunately, I must add my name to the list of women whose face burns horribly after using. I inadvertently bought this recently by getting it mixed up with the anti wrinkle cream with SPF. I love and use other Neutrogena products faithfully, but would strongly suggest the company review this product given how many of us have had this problem."
"I am 66 and have been using this product for more than 10 years. My dermatologist recommended it and I love it! Whenever I have tried another product, my skin breaks out, doesn't feel as soft or look as good! I will continue to use Healthy Skin Face Lotion with sunscreen SPF 15, because it does what it says it will and works great for me! It's the best lotion for my skin. I am often told I look much younger than my age! Yes, that's great incentive to stay with what works!"
I have been using Neutrogena face lotion for more than ten years. People frequently tell me I look nowhere close to my true age. I appreciate a product that works for a reasonable price. My daughter began using in her teens and only product that does not irritate her sensitive skin. I'mean glad she started early either the SPF.
"I've loved using Neutrogena since I was a teen. It's addressed all my skin concerns as it changes. I've used the Healthy Skin Face Lotion with and without SPF for over 10 years. The Alpha Hydroxy Acid (AHA) must be the best part. It brightens my skin, leaves it soft and helps to clear away blackheads that my combo skin still gets. Since I've also got sensitive skin I use the lotion about 1 to 2 times a week and the improvement is noticeable. Highly recommend and will always use. A KEEPER Neutrogena!"
"Been using healthy skin lotion for about ten years when my face started to show sun-related skin damage (dark spots, lines, redness). Within ten days to two weeks of first use, this product was amazing in bringing back uniformity & a healthy glow. No worries as a sensitive skin user either. Heading into my mid-fifties now and still don't wear foundation under my make-up, which is saying alot since I work under harsh fluorescent lighting! Only complaint is the pump frequently gets clogged (quality issue)."
Great lotion for your face! Not greasy or oily and keeps face hydrated all day! Highly recommended!
My skin feels sooo soft .I am worried not sure if its discontinued can't get it in Cape Town now.
"Moisturizes without clogging pores. Skin looks bright, smooth, even, and healthy!"
It's an excellent moisturizer with a nice scent
Used this product for years. I even have spa technicians ask me what I use.
Please remove the toxic sunscreen! Would be perfect without it!
Clears belmish spots. Perfect face lotion.
"I have used it for years...,love it. I can't always find it in stores so I have learned to go directly to you guys."
I put Healthy Skin Face Lotion with sunscreen SPF 15 every monring to protect my face from sun rays.
"I like this product, that's why I bought it. I've researched spy moisturizers, and this one serves my every need. The price however, is higher than three retail stores in my area. I will buy this product again, just not through the Internet. TP"
"I have been using this product for many years. I am happy to say at the age of 70 I am always told how great my skin looks, many people ask me what I use."
"I have been using this product for only three weeks along with my neutrogena deep clean cream cleanser which i've been using for years and the result is astonishing, and in only three weeks.... Will not stop using it!!!!"
I used this lotion in the morning after my shower. Immediately my face started burning. The next morning my eyes were puffy and swollen and my neck and throat were red and irritated. It's been four days since I used this product and I still have some swelling around my eyes and my skin on my neck is still irritated. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.
"Even though this product is hypo-allergenic, my face stings when I apply it. I'm not sure what is in it, but as soon as I apply it in the morning or at night, it stings in my upper cheeks and underneath my eyes where my dark circles are. The stinging is so much worse when I apply my foundation. Of course I wait until my moisturizer sets to apply my makeup, but this has not happened with the previous moisturizer that I used from a different brand. It makes my skin red and the stinging hurts a fair amount and I'm not impressed.."
Used the old version for several years without any trouble. Started using this and had a bad reaction similar to a sunburn. Very unhappy with the change in the product. The label warned there might be a bad reaction but I've been using Neutrogena since I was a teen and never had a problem. Sad to lose a good product.
"I tried this product and it made my skin sting when I put it on. I have generally liked neutrogena products in the past, and really enjoy their other combination/sensitive skin moisturizers, but this one made my skin uneven and red. Perhaps due to my very very sensitive skin. Not recommended."
"I initially bought this last winter and although I can't say it reduced wrinkles, it did make my skin feel softer, so much so that my sister started using it too. I am now on my second bottle and I have had to wash it off completely lately because of the burning. Strangely, my skin and especially around my eyes feels like the top layer is coming off. VERY DRY. Can't say for sure it is this product but I'm going to try something different to see."
"This lotion made my face (especially around my eyes) break out in a rash. I was on vacation and my eyes were so swollen and broken out I had to go in to urgent care and get medication. It took me a few days to figure out it was the lotion causing the swelling/rash. Once I stopped using it everything cleared up. I use many other Neutrogena products including the oil free moisture lotion (no SPF) and have not had any issues, not sure why this one is so bad."
"I have been using this product for almost 15 years - literally since I was a young teen! I use it after I wash my face in the morning and again after showering at night. I find that it has a slight tingle when first applied, as it contains alpha-hydroxy acid which helps helps rejuvenate the skin. I've tried switching to other face creams, and my skin immediately breaks out. This product is the perfect balance of moisture (without being too heavy) and rejuvenation, and my skin loves it!!"
"This product made my under eyes swell up badly. Woke up in the night with them puffy, red and itchy. I figured it was this lotion because I hadn't used anything else different on my face. It's a good thing I work at an eye doctor as she told me what I should use to help. Will not be purchasing again."
"My forehead was a rough patch of horribleness before I started using this. Yes, there was some slight irritation at initial application when I first started using it. However, that went away completely after I had been using it for a few weeks. This moisturizer has completely softened and smoothed out all my problem areas, including my forehead. As a bonus, it's no problem taking it with you on the plane as it's under 3 oz."
"I bought this product and used it, than immediately broke out in huge hives!"
"It's the ONLY lotion I can use on my face. I started using it around 2002,"
I have problems with some items due to sensitive skin and eyes. My regular product was not in stock so I tried this thinking Neutrogena was derm tested. The skin around my eyes burned for hours even after removal and repeated cold water flushing.
I bought this product over the Neutrogena Men's product because it appeared that this one did a better job with moisturizing. It smells like it has kind of a feminine fragrance to it though. Is this a product men can use?
"I tired this as a replacement for the Daily Moisturizer w/SPF15, which I loved. I cannot stand the strong smell of this stuff on my face. I cannot eat while I wear it. And it has a Sunburn Alert!! Do not go out in the sun while wearing this product --- but it has SPF15 in it!!! I am sorry I bought it and have thrown it out! What a wast of my hard earned money. Bring back the Intensified Daily Moisturizer!!!"
"I've been using the healthy skin face lotion with sunscreen for almost 20 years. I receive comments regularly that my skin looks smooth and young (with no wrinkles and I'm in my 50's, and this daily lotion was my only beauty regimen). You have changed the formula and added avobenzone and this lotion no longer moisturizes my skin and it clogs my pores. My skin is dry and has now started to show wrinkling around my eyes and age spots. Do you have any product similar to the previous formula?"
"My face broke out in a red rash, my eyes swelled and the only relief was to try to wash it off. The ingredients listed are very bad, according to internet sources and the micro font size makes it difficult to read.. Neutrogena says they changed the ingredients but judging from the other reviews, they haven't solved the problem. Take it off the shelf!"
"I've used Neutrogena products for many years and love them, but this one has way too much of a perfume smell. I thought Neutrogena was more of a fragrance free line. It has Alpha Hydroxy acids so it should be used every other day at first until your skin gets used to it. I wouldn't use this lotion as a sunscreen because you aren't supposed to go in the sun with the Alpha acids on your face. I use it under makeup when I go to work and wear a regular sunscreen if I'm outdoors all day."
"As another reviewer noted, after using it my face was so swollen I was unrecognizable. Burning rash. The doctor thought it was a reaction to bug bites.I too had to go on Prednisone to take the swelling down. Used this again in winter, -30F no bugs, and yup, withing 6 hours my face was burning and swollen again. I have always used Neutragena products, never again."
"I understand everyone's skin is different, and I have never had a problem with neutrogena products before, but this is awful. I washed my face with their clear liquid face wash, followed with this, I immediately wiped it off with a cold wash cloth because IT BURNED. I'm talking chemical peel burn. I do not have any open zits or anything like an open wound on my face, so I don't know why this burned. I'm not sure what ingredient is the cause of this, but oh my gosh never again. Stay away from this one."
I purchased this product because I have used other Neutrogena products without issue. I have sensitive skin but never experience any problems in the past. I applied the face lotion and it burned so much I had to wash it off. Even after doing this my face was warm for about an hour or so. I must say I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this from Neutrogena. I am going to look for my receipt to try and return the product to the store and get a refund!
"I used to love this product! It left my skin looking young and clean. I just bought a new bottle, though, and holy swollen eyes. I must be allergic to it now :( I feel like it's kind of unfair to write a bad review based on a reaction, but I'm disappointed. Make sure you spot test before you use if you have sensitive skin."
"I was really excited when I bought this face lotion, I thought it would be perfect as a moisturizer and sun screen however it continued to burn long after the initial 3 days and I found that it made my skin feel ROUGHER and dry. My face did not feel moisturized. I have soft skin but lots of small blemishes and it did not do anything that it said it would on the bottle. Once I stopped using it I found that my skin felt better. I guess it works great for some people but has this effect on others. I have T-zone skin."
"I see that other reviewers have had the same experience I had. I can't think of anything positive to say about this lotion. First off, it stinks. Secondly, it has a weird, almost waxy consistency when you put it on. It feels heavy and sticky. The biggest negative is that it instantly burned my face when I applied it! My face got hot, red, and prickly. I will never use this again. Horrible!"
"I bought this lotion because it had the SPF I was looking for in a mosturize, the price was very reasonable and I know neutrogena has a very good reputation. I purchased this item almost two months ago and the lotion itself is great and my face is nice and soft however it seems I more redness on my face than before I started using this product."
"I have used other Healthy Skin products before and I bought this one when my last tube ran out. I didn't realize I had gotten a different product. But this has dried out my skin so badly it is flaky and peeling and breaking out worse then it does when I PMS. I still have about half the bottle. I am so disappointed as I love all the other products I have used. (rapid wrinkle repair, healthy skin moisturizer and wash, healthy skin eye repair)"
"This burned my face, I broke out in hives and my face and neck are all patchy from only one use."
Healthy Skin Face Lotion keeps my skin soft and reduces
This is great face cream. Works as good as any expensive face cream. Have been using for about 6 years!!
This moisturizer is awesome! The smell is also positively intriguing! It really helps if applied before makeup or after washing your face!
"It burns my skin whenever I apply. It also leaves a slight greasy residue. It gives my skin a nice glow at first, but then it just starts to look oily. I also find that it doesn't moisturize as well as I though it would."
"I have used it once. The skin of my face, inside of my mouth and even the gum swollened, itched.... When I stopped using it, the situation went back to normal after several days."
"This product offers the adage - non-greasy and lightweight,. i find it heavy and it leaves a residue. Disappointed, and the fragrance is heavy...fumes are heavy."
I love using this product. It exfoliates very well and has several great ingredients! I am concerned about the SPF that is used though. Does it block UVA & UVB rays? : )
"I don't usually write reviews but on this one, i feel like i have to. This is the worst product ever! I don't have an acne prone skin, but after using this product for the first time. I had a bad breakout and rashes!! And this has a strong odor, ."
It said lotion on the box but it is sun screen and burns my face!
It's very good you won't look ur age!!
I love the manufacturer but this just isn't good
"I have sensitive skin, and when I tried this product, it burned my face! I immediately returned it to the store!"
I have used this product with for only four days and Ihave had intense itching redness and a rash on my face.
i think im going to have to stay home for a few days or go to the doctor...its that bad! red bumps all over my face and neck! and inflammation!
This product has made me breakout so much! It caused me to even go to the doctor and get prescription meds. so the swelling from it would go away.
Great product
