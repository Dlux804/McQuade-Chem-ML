"Found Sensitive Poppy Lotion is calming, hydrating, great for ANTI-AGING. I have rosacea, super sensitivity, dry skin, fine lines. I had not heard of California Poppy before and did some research. I found a product similar to Found's, let me tell you it was high end pricey to the tune of $58 for a couple of ounces and had unhealthy ingredients. I love this lotion that makes my skin look and feel better. It is super soothing at an affordable price and at Wal-Mart and is full of natural ingredients."
"I love this line of sensitive skin products! It has tremendously helped my skin, and it is so reasonably priced! I've had bad skin for years, and have spent so much money trying to find products that work - this does! I also like that I can buy each individual product as it runs out."
"I really like this lotion. There is no fragrance, which I love! I hate smelling like flowers or something on my face! It absorbs very nice and in the two weeks I've been using, I notice a difference in the softness of my skin (in conjunction with the other products in the sensitive line). The ingredients are pretty good, so overall I feel really good about this option!"
A light moisturizer good for daytime. No harsh ingredients.
