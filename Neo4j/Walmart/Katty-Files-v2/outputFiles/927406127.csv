I like it. I've used olay in the past and this gives me the same feeling afterward. I can see a noticeagle difference in my skin.
I have used this for years and love it. They have changed it a little-it didn't use to be dyed so pink
the scent isn't the best but also not the worst. I've been using this moisturizer every night for a week and I've noticed that my skin has definitely gotten softer and more glowy! and 2 oz of this will last you a long time since you only need to use a small amount. super satisfied
"I truly LOVE this cream! Yes, it's cheap. And, yes, it's Equate. But it is my favorite face cream! Over the years (I'm in my 60's) I have spent a fortune on face creams searching for the fountain of youth. No -- I have not found the fountain of youth, but this cream works wonders for me. It absorbs quickly -- No greasy film -- and leaves my skin very soft and -- dewy. It is my favorite face cream. Love it!!"
"I LOVE this cream. Have been using it for several years and now I can't find it at Walmart or online. A great alternative that I've used for many years for under makeup cream is ""Vitamins E, A"
The equate night-time cream didnât work as well from me. The Olay brand is much better.
"I have to apply this cream in small amounts and rub it in really well to prevent it from leaving a weird white film on my face that has to be scrubbed off. I usually like Equate brands just as well as name brands, but this one is very disappointing."
I do not recommend this product. I found this product to be very drying
