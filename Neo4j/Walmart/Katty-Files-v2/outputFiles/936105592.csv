"I bought this about a month ago and keep using it daily.I personally love it from the beginning cause i have dry skin.I use it everyday as my last step in my skincare routine cause i need something thick to 'seal' it up.But usually I didn't use it every morning except when i feel my skin is a bit dry.Now my skin really feels more moisturized,plumpier and looks very healthy! I definitely suggest this to everyone to add this to their skincare routine"
"I love this mosturizer so much. I've got combination skin and a lot of acne, and this didn't make me break out. I've struggled with a lot of mosturizers because they either leave my skin oily, too dry, or make me break out. This formula left my face feeling smooth and hydrated. I appreciated that it didn't have a strong scent. I'm so glad that Influenster sent me this product complimentary for me to review because I've found my new favorite mosturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this a few weeks ago while searching for a daily moisturizer that would not irritate my skin or give me acne. This is the best product I've found in a long time and definitely a new favorite for me! A little goes a long way and it's almost like putting aloe on your skin—very soothing. Keeps my skin supple and bright! 10/10 would recommend!
This product hydrates my skin even when it feels extremely dry while traveling. I keep it in my purse at all times and it has changed the way my skin feels and looks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using your gel cream for a number of months and my sensitive skin loves your products. What is soooooo frustrating to me is your packaging. I always have to fight to get the last few applications out of the tube. Am I the only one who thinks this? Please consider repackaging so that no product goes to waste. Thank you!!
"Lately I've had really dry patches on my face , I used this product for a day and already noticed the difference ! Some dry skin products are super oily and sticky on the skin but this was like water and wasn't sticky at all !"
I got this Simple hydrating gel cream through Influenster for free! I was very excited to give it a try! I've been using it for about 1 week now and I've noticed my skin get dryer unfortunately. I was very excited because it goes on like water and feel very refreshing. I do live in Minnesota and have to walk to classes everyday so I do struggle with dry skin. I would say if it was summer this would be the perfect hydrating moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love Simple -Water Boost Hydrating gel cream. I have very sensitive skin and use Simple products anyway but this is the best yet! My skin really does feel hydrated and soft.
I have tried other “sensitive skin” moisturizers and this one has been the nicest to my skin. Light and water-like but still moisturizing. I love this product but I really really wish it came in a bigger bottle.
I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I didn't feel that it moisturized my skin. It felt sticky and unnatural. Would not recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, the cream did a good job at keeping my face hydrated. I usually use it in the morning under my SPF. It doesn't get greasy and it also works well under my makeup. Overall i liked it - reminds me of the hydrating cream from First Aid Beauty (which costs a lot more) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really snjoued how lightweight and refreshing this was on my skin. With the limited ingredients in this my skin did not react negatively at all! Will definitely recommend if you suffer from sensitive skin!
I received this product as a complimentary tester from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer provided lightweight moisture. I have oilier skin and I was happy with my results. I use moisturizer primarily before bed because of my skin. It refreshes my skin instantly. I received the product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Nice texture readily absorbed, good under make up, not perfumed. It's an awesome daily go to without all the frills. My last moisturiser cost $300 and I'm just as happy with this as is my skin. Perhaps none of the anti aging components the more expensive products boast but happy skin is good skin!"
I was at my wits end with a severe allergy on my face and neck which had dried out my skin unbelievably. I was about to fly out to Thailand for a holiday and called in at a pharmacy on the way to the airport. I saw this on the shelf and thought that it would be worth a try....thank goodness I did! It saved my holiday from being a disaster. My skin feels wonderful and I will certainly be using Simple Hydrating Gel Cream as part of my regular routine. Thank you Simple !!!
"I've only used this probably about 5 times or so... however, being a girl who's very into skincare and has had her fair share of products-this product changed me. I NEVER find moisturizers that feel this great. My skin feels amazing, no breakouts whatsoever, it's light and refreshing!"
"I got this cream as a free sample from Influenster, but I will definitely be purchasing it. It's one of the best moisturizers I've used on my face. It's very lightweight and not greasy at all. I have some spots that are oily, and others that are dry and flaky, and this works for my whole face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this free to test from Influenster. This product made my skin feel amazing. Especially in winter, my skin get very dry. This product prevented that and kept my skin feeling hydrated and fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been struggling to find a good moisturizer that keeps my skin from getting dry, but also doesn't cause me to become oily. This moisturizer is the answer. I have combination skin, where too much washing of my face can result in dry skin, but most lotions cause me to break out if used too often. This lotion I can apply at least once a day and it never cause my skin to become oily, but it also keeps me from drying out. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have super dry/combination skin in the winter and applying this gel cream at night and after I shower makes me feel really hydrated. I love this product because it's thick enough to eliminate my dry spots, but it doesn't leave me feeling sticky or oily. You only need a little bit too, so it'll last you a while! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am pretty picky when it comes to gel creams...but I really enjoyed this one! I used it at night and before my makeup. I found it to be very hydrating and not too thick. I have combination dry and oily skin and it hydrated by dry areas and kept my oil under control. I received this product as an influenster testing product and I am very happy with it overall! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent this product as part of a promotion and was very excited to try it out. While the cream was moisturizing and kind to my sensitive skin, it felt and looked very greasy and heavy on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was free as part of one of my Influenster Voxboxes. I was hoping to love it, but I just couldn't. The moisturizer was too oily feeling for my face and took a lot of work to get all the way in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product from Influenster to test and I really liked it! It will definitely be my summer go to moisturizer from now on. My only complaint was that some areas of my face stays so dry during the winter that my skin flakes nonstop, and while this product helped more than anything else I've found, I hoped for a little more. Overall super satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this free from Influenster and it is an amazing moisturizer! The only downfall is I felt that it didn't absorb as quickly as my previous favorite moisturizer but overall it is a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is light weight which I loved but I didnt feel like it lasted long when used alone. My face became oily after a few hours because it was not moisturizer enough. After a week, I tried using this product prior to applying my makeup (as a primer almost) and it work great which is why I gave It 3 stars. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion and review of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the hydrating gel cream in my influencer box for free. I have really dry skin so just hydrating gel cream really does the job for me it keeps my skin very hydrated and healthy looking. I also love it as well because every time I do my make up my make up just looks so healthy and natural and not Cakey. I would be purchasing the hydrating gel cream again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Super great moisturizer very hydrating but the formula is light. I have sensitive and very dryly skin and this helped hydrate my skin with out any irritation.

"I love the feel of the cleansing wipes, they feel so fresh on your face. I wouldn't recommend relying on them for makeup removal because they don't work great for that use. The moisturizer is great super light and makes your face feel fresh as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this a few weeks ago & can tell a dramatic difference in the softness of my skin! The texture of this is very lightweight, but ultra hydrating. It's perfect for all skin types & won't leave behind any greasy residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have dry skin so I was excited to try this. I was disappointed. It felt oily and just left my face feeling funky after I was done applying. It isn't something I would buy.
I did receive this complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this hydrating cream. I use it for my moisturizer day and night! It's important not to use too much or your face might feel wet or oily. However, if you use just the right amount, it does the trick and hydrates the skin! I received this complimentary item as part of a contest in return for my honest review! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. I was using a green tea moisturizer, but I noticed my nose and cheeks were always super dry. But using this has definitely helped those problem areas. It's lightweight and doesnt feel like I'm wearing something super heavy or greasy. I received this from Influenster, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer felt like amped-up water on my face, and I mean that in the best way possible! I am never switching moisturizers. It was so lightweight, scent-free, so lovely. I received this product complimentary for testing from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for a little over a month now and my skin has never felt better! I am someone who does have dry skin and this product has fully prepped me for these cold and dry winter days! I am so happy that I received this complimentary from Influenster, it really has changed my skincare routine for the better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really liked the formula of these products. They were fresh and clean feeling, not harsh. However, the hydrating gel cream seemed to break my face out in all the high points of my face where I applied it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product as a free sample to review. It honestly came at the right time. I have been struggling to find a new face cream for the winter and I think I found the right one. I usually spend a little more on face cream, but with this product, there is no need. My face is loving the gentleness of the ingredients and the moisture it provides. I had a couple of dry patches around my nose and this product cleared them away. I also like the fact that its a gel, no greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have dry patchy spots and at the same time oily skin. I struggle from time to time to find a balance. The gel was a great middle. Not dry and at the same time not too oily. I received it for free to test it out and I will buy it again. I just wish it had some spf in and then I would use it like a moisturizer everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As soon as I received this product, I knew I'd love it. I have used it every day and night for the past 2 weeks, and it has not only hydrated my skin so well, but it prepares my face for makeup so well too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used many of the high end gel creams on the market and this one works just as great for a fraction of the price! My skin has been super dry this winter and this helped restore my skin when other creams couldn't. I would definitely repurchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have pretty sensitive skin, so I am pretty wary of what Products I use. The hydrating gel cream brought so much moisture to my skin without leaving any residue. My skin felt hydrated all day!"
I recieved a free sample for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love these wipes!! I am not normally a person that used wipes, I just like to use a cleanser. But these wipes are awesome! They clean away dirt and make-up! They leave my skin refreshed and soft! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Simple Hydrating Gel Cream was a surprise! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at this price point but it works and it doesn't leave a sticky residue at all. I love using it on my face, decolletage and hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this for free to review and I have to say I really like it. My complexion is typically very dry, especially during the winter and this really kept my face feeling hydrated and healthy all day long. It goes on smooth and feels great, I recommend buying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer melts in right away and doesn't leave any oily residue! Other moisturizers that I have tried have left a sheen across my forehead even if claimed that they wouldn't and this one doesn't do that at all. I am very happy with it and can't wait to try it out in the summer! If you have dryer skin the winter, you may want to stick with a heavier moisturizer but otherwise I highly recommend this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For years, I used a higher-end gel cream facial moisturizer. I really loved it, but was always on the hunt for a dupe. Luckily, I found it in the Simple Waterboost Gel Cream Moisturizer, it may come in a smaller tube, but this moisturizer really does the job. It absorbs quickly into my skin, but leaves it soft and hydrated. I received this for FREE as part of my Influenster VoxBox, but I'd definitely purchase on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely dry skin in the winter and this hydrating gel leaves my face feeling refreshed and healthy. I wish I would have found out about this product sooner! It is definitely going to be one of my holy grails. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer was really light weight, and soaked right into the skin. It wasn't enough moisture for my dry skin though. I felt like i still needed a heavier cream afterwards. Great for makeup prep though because it doesn't feel oily at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very satisfied with this product! I was not a fan of the gel aspect for morning application but I put it on every night before bed and my face feels unbelievably hydrated!

"I have used simple face washes before but have never tested any of their other products, the hydrating cream is amazing! I actually started using it as my moustirizer under my makeup everyday and my makeup never looks flaky.

So i didn't review this product until I used it for a time to see if its work or it good from my skin.

I got this complimentary of Influenster and I love it! I got a 7oz moisturizer over a month ago and I still have it! A little deofietly goes a long way! It's extremely moisturizing and I have beyond dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was a good feeling face cream but it didn't do anything special for me. My face felt like I didn't put anything on it within minutes of my application. Fast absorbing, I get, but it literally felt like I didn't put anything on my face. I got this cream, along with the hydrating wipes, as a package deal to test out for complimentary use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product through Influenster for free, and it has now become part of my beauty regime. My skin is SO soft and it makes me feel prettier. Definitely a must buy product! I can't go without now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I revived this to test in my VoxBox from Influenster and I feel it was exactly what I needed! It's a bit thicker than I expected it to be, but after the first use I could feel my face instantly feel less dry. I like that I doesn't have chemicals or smell either. It's plain and to the point and really made my face feel revitalized and restored moisture which is what I've been looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I also got this in my Influenster VoxBox and it's amazing! My skin is so soft and hydrated! I use the wipes first and then I apply a little of this before applying my foundation and thank goodness for all this moisture! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Since I was a kid I'm familiar with sensitive skin term but recently I'm taking this subject so serious and I'm thinking in becoming a beauty nerd for real. I had the chance to try these amazing products and I have to say thank you Influenster for this amazing gift for my skin. It's a really hard job to find affordable products that reacts so well on me. Since I'm using the @simpleskin wipes and gel cream #Soakltln my skin had felt so fresh and hydrated. I found this product amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for free from Influenster's voxbox. It has a nice, light texture. Goes on smooth and feels pretty nice, but don't be too heavy-handed; takes some time for it to absorb. It's a little too light for a winter moisturizer, but I'm excited to use it more in the summer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have extremely dry skin, including my face. Foundation used to be my worst nightmare. Not anymore! Thanks to Influenster sending me this for free for testing, I just apply a little before my makeup and voila, a baby's butt smooth face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product from influenster I have tried it for several weeks and since the first day I love it, it is a gel of light consistency that leaves my skin hydrated throughout the day, in the first week I notice my skin softer clearer and brighter, I love it. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product on behalf of Influenster and let me just say its so refreshing to use. I use this product before going to sleep and wake up with my feeling hydrated and great! I hope to find more at a location near me! I have very sensitive skin so im worried on using new products but this specific kept me wanting more for my face. Very gentle and good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this complimentary cream from influenster a month ago and was sooo glad I received this in my box to try. My skin feels so amazing and hydrated after using this for a whole month!! My tip is to use it at night after washing your face and in the morning you wake up with a refreshed and mousturized face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It was great have moisture sent directly to my door! The Winter is always harsh on my skin.I was happy to see that I had received the Hydrating Gel Cream as I am always looking for something to moisturize my dry skin. Simple has done it. It is light and does the job. I have been using it every day since receiving my complimentary sample in the mail from Influenster! I absolutely love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This gel is super light weight which I love. It feels so nice on the skin and it's not heavy. I love how it also soaks into the skin very quickly unlike some creams that make your face sticky for a lot of time after application. I received this free for testing purposes and will definitely be buying more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm in love with this gel cream! Best moisturizer I've found at the drug store. It really hydrates your skin without leaving it greasy or oily. I've used it at night and during the daytime and it works well under makeup. I also have sensitive skin and it doesn't break me out. And it smells good! It has a really natural, clean, plant smell. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how this moisturizer is a gel because it really works on my combination skin! My dry patches are now hydrated, and I haven't noticed that it contributes any extra oil to my t-zone. I also have very sensitive skin, and this doesn't irritate it (many products do, so I tend to stick to higher end moisturizers). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So one day I was rushing and couldn't find my regular moisturizer. Well the gel cream was staring at me so and the decision wasn't hard, ‘grab and go Sassy!'. That's what I did and I'm so glad I did. A hot shower and rushing calls for a spiked adrenaline rush but the cream not only sufficed as my moisturizer, it cooled me down until I could sit down and catch my breath. Very pleased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given a sample of this nearly a month ago. After regular use I haven't noticed any drastic changes. My skin has mostly just maintained its usual state. Moisturized to a certain extent, but still had uneven day paches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I know this is a face cream but I actually used it on my hands because I'm suffering with extremely dry skin and grabbed this to see if it would work.
"To my surprise it did! My dry skin was instantly hydrated and moisturized and I loved the consistency of the gel and how quickly it dried. I really love gel based lotions so I'm a fan of this. Since my hands are so dry, I know this will work well on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've enjoyed this product when added into my skincare routine, because I felt I still needed more moisture. This gel is perfect for night time use. I definitely feel it's helped make my skin feel more alive during this dry winter season. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. Where I live it is very cold and windy, so my face is always dry. This product keeps my face hydrated all day long without making it feel greasy and you don't need to use a lot for it to be very effected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this stuff! I received it free from Influenster and have been using it for a few weeks now. First off, the product goes on so smoothly and feels wonderful on my skin. I have oily skin so I was worried that using a moisturizer would be bad, but I don't go a day without using it now. It feels so natural That I don't even worry about it. I'd highly reccomend this product for any skin type! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have combo/oily very acne prone skin. I'm always terrified to try new moisturizers because most break me out, or leave me greasy. This has been a life saver this winter for my dehydrated, tight skin . It feels like a drink of water for my skin, and stays moisturized through the day I like most gels. I am so impressed, and will repurchase. I have received this product, for free from influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin has been SO DRY this winter. Nothing that I've used has worked to remedy how dry my face has been. And then, the heavens opened up and Influenster sent me this amazing hydrating package. This gel Creme is the most moisturizing face product I've ever used. When this runs out, I'm definitely going to get more! I put a layer on and then I mix some with my primer and it works like a DREAM. I love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster, for testing purposes and was so excited to try it! I have very dry and sensitive skin so I am always looking for a product that moisturizes without irritating my skin. This is the one! It also has a great texture to it, and doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This gel cream does provide lots of hydration to the skin. It feels really great applying to the face after washing. However it does tend to make me a bit oily. I wouldn't recommend if you have oily skin. Also, it does not sit that well under makeup. However after a deep wash this cream is perfect! I received the product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The hydration gel cream is definitely different. It does moisturize, but it does feel like it's hard to completely rub in to my skin. I chalk that up to being a gel like cream. All in all it was gentle on my skin, and I had no issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this along with the hydrating wipes and the two together are life-changing. This product made my skin glow and hydrated it throughout the night. My makeup the next day would always look amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! So light weight but doesn't skimp on hydration. It makes your skin porcelain smooth and plump. I also really like that it's not heavily scented! It's really nice to be able to go to sleep with this on your face and wake up without being stuck to the pillow in a cloud of perfumes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the texture of this product, it's not goopy and cold like a gel, but isn't heavy and sticky like a true cream. It's the perfect balance of the two, with a very faint and clean scent that doesn't bother me or irritate my sensitive skin. I slap this product on heavy before bed and then in the morning do a light coating under my primer for my makeup. My skin feels so smooth and very hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this hydrating gel cream. It worked really well on my skin and left my face feeling softer than before! I definitely recommend this product, plus you can find it almost anywhere at your basic drug store! I'm in love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
With it being the winter my skin is highly likely to dry out easily. Putting this product on my face at night helps give it that extra boost of moisture that is needed! The consistency isn't too thick and it's not too thin. The product seems to be naturally cool touch so putting it on my face was very soothing. I got this product complenarty for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Once I received, this product I excepted it to have a lotion texture, but it has an even better consistency! It feels like an expensive hyaluronic skincare most MedSpas carry! Once the product meets your skin, it melt in and immediately hydrates! Even better, a little goes a long way! I received the product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes! And so glad I did! I love it is so silky and hydrating without being greasy and is really gentle on my sensitive skin! I really love there are no chemical irritants or perfumes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, and wow I am so glad I did! I have very sensitive skin and am pretty picky on what I use. This has no harsh chemicals or purfumes. I have had no issues with it. It feels silky and light and absorbs pretty quickly.! Will be purchasing in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary sample of this product for testing and review purposes. I used the gel right after the wipes. The gel seemed to take away some of the hydration from the wipes. It didn't make me feel like my face was hydrated compared to the wipes. Throughout the day, my face seemed dull. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I lay out the Hydrating Gel Cream and whether or not I'm stepping out/omw to work or hitting the sheets my skin feels refreshed. This non-greasy formula leaves me with less texturizing feel & more of a dewy fresh yet smooth finish. The best part is they're odorless and have no harsh chemicals! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Was very hydrating as visually there was no dry skin in the morning. The cream did sting a bit when putting it on / sink in and I'm not too sure why/ wasn't expecting that and so this product was ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as a complimentary to testing the products out. I really enjoyed this moisturizer especially during the cold, dry winter months. My skin is typically oily in the t-zone, but as been very dry everywhere else on my face. This moisturizer kept my skin hydrated all day and gave me a little glow as an added bonus. If you have dry skin, I highly reccommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm ready to hit the pillow now that I tried this sleeping cream from Simple Skin Care. My face feels softer, rejuvenated and fresh. It dries quickly and isn't sticky or oily. I really like this night cream and would buy it. Thanks for letting me try it Influenster! It smells good too. And a little goes a long way for my face and neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product for free from Influenster. This product has such a moisturizing consistency, it is like a soft gel. I have not been using it very long but I definitely feel that my face is more hydrated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is very hydrating! A little goes a long way. Usually when I use any type of moisturizer on my face that is hydrating, it'll cause breakouts and this hasn't! I always use it before applying any makeup. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Influenster, and I am a huge fan now! I have combination skin and sometimes struggle with finding a moisturizer that is hydrating enough without making me too oily. This moisturizer does the trick! I've been using this product for a little over a week now, and the results are wonderful! Many days I am able to skip priming simply due to how moisturized my skin is. Buy this product!!!

I received this product as complimentary gift and let me just say it's very lightweight for the night time routine. I love it's softness yet still textured consistency and I must agree that it does help with skin issues.

"The cream itself feels very light and airy. Dries into the skin quickly and does not feel greasy or look glossy after the first 2 minutes. I've been applying it for the last 3 days, every morning and before bed, I already feel the difference. In the winter my skin always gets very dry and peels so I need moisturizers that last all day and I will continue using this one as well as recommend it to my friends.

It definitely achieved the job of hydrating my skin but it made my skin feel sticky afterwards, I wish it had more of a natural feel too it.
