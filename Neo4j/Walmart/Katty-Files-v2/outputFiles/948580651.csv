The cream goes on quite smooth and leaves my face feelings refreshed
This product did provide overnight mosturization! I woke up with nice and shiny skin! It just felt great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Creams made me sweat it all off. This gel is amazing
"Was using regenerist and was sad I wasn't getting the results I wanted, fortunately I stumbled upon the oil of Olay skin advisor, it asks what your concerns are and you take a selfie. Well they recommended this and I'm seeing results already at 1 week. Do yourself a favor and take 5 minutes to complete the skin advisor. You won't be disappointed."
I really like how the product works into the skin immediately-no greasy feeling! It smells fresh and I can see my skin is better moisturized and I feel real happy about that! Moisturized but I do not feel like an oil slick!
Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels great, both when applying it to my skin and while wearing it. It is not heavy at all, like some facial moisturizers. I like how easy it is to apply and then how my face absorbs the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't notice any smell however it feels amazing and absorbs quickly into my skin. In such a short period of time, it's made a great difference in the appearance of my 67 yr. old skin! I've bought very expensive facial creams and I believe this measures up or excels! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like the feel of this product. Haven't actually been using it long enough to know for certain how much it is moisturizing. It seems to be a nice, light moisturizer. I'm just not one to go with scents, so I probably wouldn't continue with this product unless I do see some amazing results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"HA is the it ingredient for anti-aging products right now...and it's not cheap. Olay's version is affordable. While I love the lightweight and smoothness of the gel, the smell is a little overpowering. I don't think I've used it long enough to see lasting results on my lines and dark spots, but thus far, it's done a great job in providing moisture to my skin (esp. during these dry summer months). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It looks and smells like thick laundry detergent. It was alarming how similar this smells to Tide, not something I felt excited about putting on my face. It works moderately well, moisturizes adequately but a bit greasy for a gel moisturizer. I picked this up for $4 clearance. I can see, no, smell why. I've used gel moisturizers before and wanted to give Olay a shot. Not great."
"This Olay hydrating gel moisturizer was so light and refreshing. It absorbed quickly into the skin without feeling sticky or gunky. The scent was light and pleasant without being overwhelming. My skin felt soft and smooth, even in the morning. I look forward to seeing results of continued use! Big fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing, it made my face feel and look so much more smooth and has even started helping with discoloration on my face, which nothing has helped with in the past. The gel goes on smooth and a little goes a long way! It is definitely worth purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy using this gel moisturizer. It feels light, not sticky, and absorbs quickly into the skin. My skin had a softer feel after using the product for only a few days. It's like a little pampering in a jar and we all need a little pampering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way this feels on my skin, and it does seems to smooth my skin a little better than my regular Regenerist in the red jar. I live in a very hot and humid climate, and this is perfect for Summer. Highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way this moisturizer glides on and has a light feel to it. It is not heavy. It also has a nice scent and does not leave the face shiny. However, it does not seem to last throughout the day for me. I have dry skin and need something heavier. I usually use Olay Regenerist. Also, this product does NOT contain SPF. I would probably purchase this product but not use it everyday or maybe just use it at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This produce is very soft and goes on smooth. You only need a very small amount. It has a very nice scent. And it takes the dryness away. I haven't used it long enough to see a difference in my wrinkles but will continue to use it. I like it very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay Age Defying ADVANCED Gel Moisturizer with Hyaluronic Acid is worth every penny. Leaves your skin soft like it use to. I'm 72 but my skin says I'm a lot younger.

Just bought and used tonight. Not impressed. My skin doesn't feel hydrated kind of feels like rubber and definitely not radiant. After I write this I will be putting on a different moisturizer.
"I have been using it for several weeks, and I see the difference. It is not greasy, lightweight, and smooth. Also, it is not an expensive one. I would highly recommend it!"
