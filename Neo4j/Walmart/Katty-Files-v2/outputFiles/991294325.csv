"This is absolutely the best neck cream I have tried, and I have tried many! It has a smooth, luxurious feel, with a slight, pleasant scent; and most importantly, it works wonders. While it is a little pricey, it is worth it to see those lines disappear and that wrinkled, saggy skin firm up. You do have to use it as directed and you may not notice immediate results, but it does work if you stick with it."
I have been using this for over 15 years and the results are amazing!! I am now 65 years old and I do not have any wrinkles on my neck at all. My neck looks like I am so much younger! I love this product and hope you never change it or discontinue it!!! Thanks for making me look beautiful!!
"I tried so many products I lost track. None of them really worked well, until I tried this. Now it's the only product I use on my neck area. I can't live without it. It really will take 10 years off the way you look. The neck area is really critical in skin care, and this product will do the trick. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
I've been using this Neck Cream for years & love it. I'm 71 and I'm repeatedly told I don't look my age - I think having a tighter neck just makes a person look better.
"I will be 68 in a couple of weeks and have been using this product for over a year. The beginnings of the crepe looking skin on my neck has disappeared. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this product! I give it my highest recommendations!"
I started using this Advanced Tightening Neck Cream just two weeks ago. I can already see the firming and smoothing effect this cream has on my neck. I am 69 years old and have tried many different products that have been very disappointing. This is an awesome product.
I've been using the TL Advanced cream for about 2 years now and it has worked great for me. I just bought the TL Advanced cream PLUS and am looking forward to the results from it. I haven't been disappointed with any of the StriVectin products I've used.
This has been a great product since I started long ago. I am in my senior years. My neck skin is still tight! I have always taken care of my face and body. It has now proven that care prevents problems and pays off in the long run. Many thanks!
"I have been using the neck cream for about four months and could not be happier with the results. I have proven to my sisters they can get results like this too, so now they use the neck cream. We love it!"
TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream really made a difference. I love how it made my neck look less loose. It is worth the price as it delivers what it says it will do.
"I've never written a review for a skin cream. I don't even want to write this one because I want to keep this amazing cream a secret for myself!! It does everything it says, everything. Tightened up the jawline and my neck feels smoother and looks nearly line free. It may be a little expensive for a cream but hey it's cheaper than surgery!"
"I've been using Strivectin Tightening Neck Cream for a few years now, and have definitely seen a difference. My neck feels soft, and is not saggy. At 59, I am not ashamed to have my neck exposed in shirts or blouses, because it looks great! I am excited to try the new formulation by Strivectin and will continue to purchase their neck cream."
"This is a wonderful product for visible improvements of the neck. The skin on the neck appears more youthful, tightened and firm. Results observed within the first month of consistent use. Pleasant cream weight and fragrance. Very pleased with this purchase."
Sometime ago I found a small sampling of the cream and thought I would
try it on my 70 year old creping neck. Voila within 4 weeks no crepiness.
"I was referred by a friend who has beautiful skin. Although her mother also had the same, I was still encouraged to try it. I am now on my second bottle, besides other products from your company"
"I see a positive difference in my neck, love this product and will continue to reorder. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to tighten their neck."
I'm on my second jar and I'm very happy with how it is working. My neck has definitely tightened since using this product.
I have been using this cream for a few years! My neck looked much more firm in justo a few weeks! It definítely does what they say it does!
I'm a third of the way through jar #1 and have already purchased jar #2. I only wish I'd started using it twenty years ago! It has helped mitigate the crepeiness on my neck and using it reminds me that caring for your skin from the chin down is as important as anything else.
It really works and it works quickly. The skin on my neck looks smoother and and tighter and feels softer.
"I bought it several weeks ago. I cannot tell a difference in my neck, however, I love the feel of the cream."
I've been using this cream for at least 6 months now and can see a visible difference in my neck and chest area. I'm stuck on it!
"I love this stuff!! I started this at the same time I bought a Rodan & Fields regimen. The StriVectin neck cream is by far my favorite of all! The skin on my neck feels so soft, it is amazing!"
"I'm 70 years old, in good shape, take care of my skin, but thought the crepey skin on my neck couldn't be helped. I was wrong. No longer do I need to camouflage my neck because this neck cream has given me new freedom and clothing choices! Yay!"
I have used Their products for over 25 years and I would not use any thing else They are great products and they keep My skin great I am 81 years old and I do not look more Than 60 years old I love Strivectin products
"This product is wonderful. It keeps my neck moisturized. Not getting rid of wrinkles like i hoped, but my skin is soon damaged and i don't know what will help."
Great Product! Perfect for mature women; I look years younger because there's not sag in my neck! I swim daily and use twice a day. Worth every penny!
After testing the new neck cream I can honesty say you can feel the tightness on my neck after applying the cream. I am 62 years old and have been using Strivectin neck cream for the last ten years. I have a tight youthful neck area. With no winkles to show my age. I highly recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the advanced neck cream and my neck feels and looks smoother
I have been using the neck tightening cream for three month and I do not see and visible difference.
"The best neck cream I ever used. Instant results! Goes on smooth, adds the perfect amount of moisture without leaving a greasy feel. Love it!"
"AN AMAZING PRODUCT...instantly see a change. I have only used for a short while, seeing anfd feeling a difference. Love this product!"
I love this neck cream. I prefer much more this “plus” version then the other version.
After 4 weeks of wearing it I see a difference on my neck lines. It's less visible
"What can I say? Been using this for over 18 months, I am 66 with a 45 neck!!! Love this stuff!"
"Use this twice a day, once in morning and once at night before bed. It really is a great cream. I keep buying it, so it must be working:)"
"Over extended use, it does improve the neck tissue. It doe not cure it. Starting when your young and continued use does make a difference."
"I was using the original until recently, when I purchased this one. So far, I like the product and haven't noticed a big difference yet."
I loved the consistency and creaminess of this product. Unfortunately it gave me a
rash where I applied it
Amazing Neck Cream! I have tried so many! This is the best by FAR!
"First time I sampled this I immediately ordered a full size; I love everthing about this it actually works, you see those neck lines deminish, its light, and rubs in great, plus has a pleasant scent. This is my new norm in skin care!"
I originally received a sample of this product to test. I noticed a positive difference within just a few weeks and liked the product so much that I purchased it after the sample size was gone! I'm 53; I love the way this cream makes the skin on my neck and décolletage look and feel. Great product!
I have only been using strivectin tightening neck cream for about two weeks but you can already see a difference in the quality of my skin. I had red crepey skin and you can feel the smoothness coming back and the redness has calmed down. Miracle product.
I am 72 years old and I indeed did notice a visible difference using this product. Thank you.
This is as good or better than the original. Use twice a day.
It has given me a rash on my declotage. I've only used it once. Afraid to use it again. But this time I will use it only on neck.
"I am very dissapointed because I bought an ""offer"" which said ""free full size cream with the purchase of..."" I ordered a neck cream and I did not receive an extra full size but a little sample of the cream..."
"The best neck cream I have ever used, I have tried others but always went back to this miracle cream, my neck and decollete are firm , soft , looks and feels moist. I'm 65, so I do know when I see results!❤"
I absolutely love the feel of this cream! I have a friend that has already been using for awhile and her neck looks great. So thought I would give it a try
This is the best cream I have ever used. I am 51 years old and my neck was really looking really bad. I started using this two weeks ago and my neck looks exactly like it did when I was 30. I recommend this highly!
I have been using their neck cream for YEARS.
"Now I don't know if it's genetics or the cream or both but all I can say it has and does make me very happy the way my neck looks. I highly recommend using it every day, starting as young as you can."
They just keep improving this neck cream!!! I can REALLY see the difference in the firmness with my StriVectin Neck Cream Plus. You've done it again .....
I use the TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream morning and night and the results are remarkable. The skin under my chin looks ten years younger than when I started using this product a month ago.
"I have been using the Tightening Neck Cream for a couple of years and love it. The reason I gave the advanced cream a 4 is that at this point I see the need to spend twice the price for half the product. It definitely works, but I don't feel that it works any better."
"Haven't used it long enough I guess but after 3 weeks of proper use, I don't see a difference"
I'm so happy with the great product since I started long ago. I am 58 years . My neck skin is still tight! I have always taken care of my face and body. It has now proven that care prevents problems and pays off in the long run. Many thanks!
I've been using Strivectin products off and on several.years. This is my first experience with the neck cream and I love it. Have not noticed miraculous overnight wrinkle disappearances yet my neck feels very soft and reduces the harshness of neck creases overnight. Will buy more!!
"I bought this neck cream, perhaps out of desperation: crepey skin, old lady cleavage, etc. What I found Was that it deply softned my skin and also softened the old lady cleavage. I think it was just a week of regular night time usage when I saw that the crepiness had given way to thicker, softer skin. Really."
Love this product really works on the turkey neck noticeable results
"I bought this and other strivectin products for the amazing reviews I read from happy customers. However, I still haven't seen results of any kind. Since I got the products I am going to use them till the end maybe I get to see the good things people talk about and will come back here and tell you about my experience..."
I'm only two days into using this product. I haven't seen any visible results yet....too soon to tell yet.
Have been using for a couple of months now. Has definitely made a difference in the firmness of my neck.
This product works. I am over 60 and my neck has not changed a bit in all the years that I have been using this. I look 40. Amazing!
"A friend recommended this,so I thought I'd give it a try. It's been about 2 weeks, using am and pm, and I can see a noticeable difference! Amazing. No more turkey neck."
"I used some of my mother's bottle while visiting her in Oregon just two weeks ago, and loved it!"
"She swears by it and considers it her ""fountain of youth"" secret."
"I have been Strivectin's neck cream, and now the new TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream Plus, for many years. I refer to the cream as ""my neck"" when I am asked about this product. I look at the necks of women my age and younger and I feel so very fortunate that I learned about this product before my neck began to show signs of aging. I believe that I am giving my neck the best care available with this neck cream."
"This entire line works... I've purchased repeatedly as there is an absolute visible difference. If I have to start “scrutinizing” whether a product works - it doesn't, but this truly does what it says and you will see and feel an obvious difference in no time. Very pleased!!!"
"This is a great product! To say I have ""problem skin"" is an understatement. Not only is it extremely sensitive, prone to breakouts and aging, I developed rosacea about 5 years ago. It truly is one of the few products that keeps my skin clear and even without drying it ou"
Have been using for 3 weeks. Neck and chest wrinkles gone. Amazing!
I am using this in conjunction with the firming neck serum. It feels great and I'm seeing results.
I have been using in a regular basis and I see the difference. My double chin has disappeared. Will continue using.
"I've been using this neck cream for two weeks, and I love it. I can definitely see a difference. I can see a difference in my jaw line too. The best stuff."
I have been using this for over 2 months and unfortunately it hasn't tightened my skin at all. I would like my money back.
"I bought it for small lines in my neck. After one bottle, I didn't see the results for reducing lines, but it does tighten the neck skin. I just put another order to see the results after long-term use."
I bought this along with the face tightening cream several months ago. I see m face and neck looking firmer. I also love how they really moisturize. I'm a devoted follower of all the Strivectin products.
this produce turned from a white cream to an orange gel and smelled funny - I will never again by this product. On the plus side I love all other products and used for 11 years and am complemented regularly on my skin
"Have been using for 2 weeks, but not sure Insee any difference."
Just received this........but so far I am liking it. I've tried other neck creams before and they were like putting on putty.......they didn't sink in. I will use the jar and see how it goes.....so far.......so good......... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really love this day and night...see much tightening
"I've had this only for a few days, but it feels wonderful on. The jar is large and should last for a while unlike many others. Glad I bought this."
I have been using this since December 14th.. 3 months and I see no difference in my neck.. so disappointed..
"I have only been using a short time, but do notice some positive results. Does not seem to provide the desired results on the decolletage. I plan to keep using it though to see if the results improve."
"The product made my neck look worse a bit scaly, I feel dooped This is snake oil for me"
"Literally the best... there just really isn't too much out there to compare to, but I've tried a lot of Lancôme and Estée Lauder products, they don't touch those rings on my neck or wrinkle on chest"
I had tried other strivectin products and can say this one does not disappoint. My neck is my problem/area of concern. It needs tightening and moisture very desperately. I was honored to try this cream and found it making me want to touch my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is by far the most effective cream I have used for firming the skin on my neck. It improves the sagging and fine lines within moments of application and keeps my neck looking firmer all the time after several days of regular use. I am very pleased with the results and will continue using this amazing neck cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My initial reaction of the new TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream PLUS is positive. I've been using the original version (not the PLUS) for some time, and I like it. I've only been using this sample for a few days, but I like that the cream feels thicker and creamier than the original, and I expect that this one will be even more effective. I didn't give it 5 stars because I have little experience with it so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always been a huge fan of the Strivectin neck cream, and was skeptical that it could get better. But when I tried this product not only did it tighten the skin on my neck, but it also made my skin smoother than ever before. I am in love - can't imagine a better way to keep my neck looking young. Of all the beauty products I use, this is my favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought dis a three month month ago
It's so nice beautiful
So far so good. I love the feel of this and feel like I've already gotten results in just a few weeks. It's just so horriblely expensive for me. I got this bottle at a department store that was going out of business so it was half price c
"I have been using this amazing cream for a couple weeks and WOW. It goes on smoothly, nice consistency and best of all - my neck is looking great! Love it!"
This product is very light and smooth to put onto the neck area. I really like how smooth and tight my skin looks when I apply it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received sample and immediately applyed to neck. I was surprised how quickly it absorbed. I have a scar on side of neck that plumped up where it was nearly invisible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recently started using this product and it feels amazing. This combined with the tightening neck serum is a perfect duo for a great looking chin, neck, and décolleté!"
"I tried TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream Plus and I feel like it absorbs well. It's a thicker cream, but is smooth and goes into my skin well. I'm sure with continued use it will show even more improvement and smoothness to my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
A little goes a long way with this smooth gliding neck cream. After a few days of use there was definite improvement on my neck lines that seem to diminish more as I continue to use it in my nightly routine! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I really like the fresh pepperminty scent of StriVectin Advanced Intensive Concentrate which is missing here. (There is no strong identifiable scent with this cream.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this free sample for 3 days. Certainly not enough time to determine if it works or not. After application my neck looks smoother. Why do we feel the need for so many area specific creams? Isn't it all skin? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product since it was first introduced! I am 63-yr old with no wrinkles or sagging skin on my neck! I believe in these products and use them every day. They make a difference you and everyone around you can see. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this because the old version worked great on my neck. Then I received a free trial size, so I was super excited. This new version is creamier so it is easier to apply to my neck. It works as well or better than the older version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this product about a couple of months ago and it has made a big improvement in my neck! It has smoothed the fine lines and wrinkles on my neck. This is a nice rich cream that I apply in upward motion nightly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Strivectin products for 6 1/2 years now and am pleased with the results and the feel of the product. This includes the TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream! Great product and great results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The texture of this neck cream is far superior to the others. The label says it is suitable for your decolletage and it is. I wasn't worried at all that this formula would stain the neckline of my clothes. It was luxurious in texture and layered moisture onto the delicate skin in this area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great neck cream. Absorbs but stays with you so that skin still looks conditioned many hours after application. Smells nice too.
Tried the sample and loved the results. Recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Excellent neck cream. I have been using it nightly and love the results. It is a thicker consistency and therefore, runs out more quickly than some creams, but it also works better than most."
"I have now used 2 tubs of this cream. Product has made a great difference to my skin. Removed all the wrinkles under my chin, and they have stayed away. Now used 2 jars best product by far!"
"This cream has a nice, thick consistency and the neck feels hydrated for several hours. I have not been using it enough to assess reduction of wrinkles and sagginess. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the texture of this cream, as it seems much more silky than the other product lines. The proof is in the pudding, so to speak, as these products are better judged on a cumulative basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream PLUS to be a very satisfactory product. I'm no ""spring chicken"" (age 73) but this product does help alleviate my ""turkey neck"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My neck is the area of my most concern so I was grateful to try the new formula. I can see a difference in the tightness in my neck area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love and have used the original Advanced Tightening Neck Cream for years. The new plus formula applies very smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The sample arrived two days ago and I have used as directed. My neck feels very smooth and soft. I will continue to use it and purchase some to continue to see advantages. I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very happy with the results. My neck looks and feels firmer and smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried a sample of this product and found that the moisture held all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Feels good on your skin! Not greasy. I use it every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using the neck creme and saw immediate results! I recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has helped the wrinkles in my neck. My neck feels very moisturized.
