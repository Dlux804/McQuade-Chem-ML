Been using Elta MD for awhile now. Recommended for me by my Dermatologist. Jet offers a good price for this item [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Soft feel, not greasy at all. Goes on smoothly."
Cheaper than anywhere else and same great product. I have sensitive skin and this works perfect for everyday.
"Not fit for me, it causes acne."
