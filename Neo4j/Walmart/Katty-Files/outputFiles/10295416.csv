"I had tried everything including a visit to my doctor, nothing worked! Adult acne they thought it was brought on by stress! I saw this product and thought it will never work it's just too simple but bought it anyway just because I had tried everything else, I'm still using it and my skin has never looked better!!!"
I bought this because I wanted something to moisturize my face with after showers. It works great and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I have also noticed that my foundation looks better- no dry spots of skin. It does leave my skin feeling a little greasy at first but I leave it on for 10-20 min and then wipe my face with a dry towel then my skin feels smooth dry and clean.
"I have been using Jergens All-Purpose face cream since I was a teenager in the '60's. It removes my make-up gently and effectively. And it leaves my skin feeling so soft and moisturized. There is no residue or stickiness. Also, the fragrance is mild ~ not harsh. For me, in my area, I'm finding it harder and harder to find this product so I am so glad that Walmart still carries it."
You barely need any to cover your whole face. It goes on a little greasy but once it soaks in your skin is gorgeous and clean. I use it to remove makeup and as a moisturizer. It's the cheapest facial lotion I've found but also my very favorite. My skin feels great and it's also an excellent primer for makeup. It has a nice powdery smell.
Jergens all purpose cream has been my favorite for many years. I use this product to remove my makeup at night. I use this product on my face and neck at bedtime. Sometimes I use this product in the morning before applying my makeup. The price is great.
It has a nice feel on my skin and leaves a nice fresh dewy look ! Has a very minimum nice smell . Not greasy and blends quick ! Takes make up off too !! I think it's better than any of the more expensive skin creams out there. I would definitely buy this again .
This face cream works wonders for my face. It's an excellent makeup remover and it's also an excellent face moisturizer. I have very dry skin and this face cream has brought my skin back to life. A little goes a long way. So glad I tried this product.
"Jergens All-Purpose Face Cream, 15 oz $3.19 I read the reviews and I decided to purchase this cream. I love it!!! It really softens your skin. It also smells good. I know it's a face cream but I use it all over. I put it on my body, leave it on overnight and bath or shower in the morning and my skin feels so soft. The price is very good and it's a big jar. Thanks Jergens."
I have used this product for years. I love the way my complexion stays soft and never dries out by using Jergens as my daily cleanser. I am glad to know I can order it on line since I have discovered that not all Walmart stores stock this product.
I have been looking for this cream for so long Omg i just love love this cream. When i found it at walmart i order a few for friends and family we all love this cream it is the best. We are very happy with it.
I was so happy that I found them online because at the store they were sold out and I've been using this lotion my whole life. Its very useful at removing makeup.
"I've been using this cream for many years. My mother used it and now I use it to remove my makeup. I also use it as a moisturizer. Sometimes it's difficult to find but I know I can always find it at Wal-Mart online. We live in the San Francisco area and there are no Wal Marts so it is easy, convenient and affordable to purchase from you. There is noting like the good ""Ole Jergens"" cream/lotion. Been using Jergens lotions since I was a child. The fact that it was mailed and received within a few days, was awesome. Thank you."
"I've been using this my whole life - my grandmother used it & recommended it. Great for taking off makeup & moisturing dry, sensitive skin"
This product is perfect for the hands and feet at night with gloves and socks. Soft in the morning.
impressed at hoe well thid works on very very dry skin!
"Awesome , after reading many reviews of this cream, I gave it a try and I love it."
"After I shower, I apply this cream to my face and it stays hydrated and moisturized for about three days after. My skin is more on the dry side, by the way. Itâs also an excellent cream to use for taking off any makeup. I love how versatile this is! It really is a great face cream. :)"
On the oily side but ideal for the cold weather.. leaves skin soft in the morning
"This is really affordable and I love the way it smells and feels on my skin! The next morning after using this, my skin feels nice and smooth and looks hydrated! No dry spots whatsoever! I think I found the face cream of my dreams!"
"I love this product! I should have try this long time ago! At age 29 my skin starts to freak out and ive tryd all the expemsive product in the market, name it! But nothing works for me, this one is so good, ive been using it for 4days now, my skin is clearing up! I used this as a make up remover, and moisturizer bfore goin to bed, wen i wake up i have this pinkish white glow on my face...i wanna stock alot! Thank u"
"I have used this product for years. I am 72 and feel that my skin is quite youthful and smooth. I use it for make-up removal and moisturizer. I like the delicate aroma, and the simple ingredients. I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mentions the second main ingredient: beeswax...one of nature's treasures. I like the retro packaging, which represents its unchanged formula. You cannot go wrong with this product."
"It's basically mineral oil so it's shiny? But you can use it to remove makeup or as a night moisturizer. Has a nice light pink creamy texture. VERY large tub and great price. First ingredient is mineral oil (same as baby oil and Avons SSS) which is why it's inexpensive. Would be a great body lotion, too."
Great stuff
"This cream is amazing! I use it to take off both daily and performance makeup, and to moisturize. You need use so little, the big jar will last a long time. It takes off makeup easily, leaving moisture instead of tight skin behind. Other generations knew to use cream to cleanse, and my skin is not wrinkling like others' do. I love: the retro jar, it looks great on my vanity table; the pink color of the cream; and the scent. The price beats other creams by more than half. Thanks again, Walmart, for great products at unbeatable prices!"
"I admit it, I didn't think this cream was going to do anything but I thought the price was right and it was worth checking out when I saw it at the family Dollar. Now its the only one I will ever use and it actually makes my skin look beautiful. I also like how it also cleanses and clears my face While moisturizing. I definitely recommend it."
"I'm a 30 year old female and have just began to see the signs of aging (dry skin patches, rough heels, widened pores, etc). Since using this product, I've noticed that my skin is a bit softer and has more of a natural shine to it. My feet are also not as rough where pressure is applied from walking/standing throughout the day. The product was designed as a face cream, however I've found it to be most helpful as an all purpose moisturizer. 5 Stars! :)"
"Jergens All- Purpose Face Cream is wonderful for dry skin daily use. It smoothes on to give a soft, glow to your skin with a refreshing aroma. Great as a make up base. I have tried many other face creams over the years, but none compare, and I would not be without it."
"Finally found a store that carries this cream! I'm about to run out, the last jar was purchased at a swapmeet. Several stores don't carry it. It's an excellent cream, I use it daily on my face, especially in this cold weather, apply it liberally, put my mascara on, then tissue off the cream. Can also be used at night time to remove eye makeup, on cracked heels, you name it. I love it!"
"I love this moisturizer. I add Retinol, Argan and Coconut oils to it to make what one would pay lots of money buying in a department store. I have been using this for years. I am 60 years young, and people believe I am in my 30's. I encourage young people to start this practice."
This cream is truly worth its weight in gold. I have eczema on my face and tend to break whenever I treat it. I have been using this cream as a moisturizer at night for a week now and the results are fantastic. My eczema is almost completely gone and I have not broken out. I just wish that this product was sold online it is hard to track down.
I have extremely dry skin in the winter time nd after a recent chemical peel my dry skin got even worse. I found this recently in a wal-mart and decided to use it and it works great. This is better than any of the over priced creams that i have ever tried.
"This cream is so great! I bought it once from a random store and now am hooked!!! I mainly use it as a makeup remover because it is so smooth and takes all of waterproof and face makeup very easily. The first pod I had lasted me forever, almost 3 years so it is definitely a steal!"
"I love this stuff. I bought it because it was cheap, and since it's been around forever, I figured there had to be a reason. I have super dry skin, gas heat, and spend a lot of time outdoors. I'm using it as night cream, and it's awesome. No breakouts...no complaints. I've used it as a cleanser as well, but I prefer to leave it on. The first night I used it, my husband asked why I was sweating, but the next morning he told me my skin looked really pretty. Would definitely recommend, and will buy again. A little goes a long way. Great value."
"My skin definitely looks 95% better from using this product. started using it a year to date and everyone sees the difference in the elasticity of my skin, less breakouts and softer and clearer skin. I use it on my 3 year old as well from his head to his toes- he has an incredible skin tone, can't stop kissing his cheeks. We are happy customers. From all the other products I have used, this one sure evens your complexion and gives you more confidence in your appearance with or without makeup."
"It made my wrinkles more noticeable especially around my eyes. It wasn't until I stopped using it and switched to a different product that I realized that this product was the culprit. Also, it smells like old lady perfume. And this contains mineral oil which is occlusive. It doesn't penetrate the skin. It just sits on top of your skin."
I have dry skin I use Ponds Cold Cream when I am able toi afford it. I came to Florida on vacation so having a replenishment agent was a must my sister introduced me to Jergens and I am HOOKED you just need a small amount to do the job of removing make up and moisturizing and it leaves your skin feeling clean. I still have half a bottle left from December. You cant lose with this purchase its effective and economical
Great to use as a cleansing cream for my face. Wash off with hot bath cloth. Leaves skin feeling so soft.
"This is my first review on Walmart!Just for this product.At the beginning I found this is very oily,but after one sleep,my skin looks much better!!My pores almost dissapeared!"
Seems like the roducts of my mother's generation have come full circle. This cream re vitalzes your skin. Put on before you go to bed at night and the next morning it's like new skin
"I have used this face cream for decades. It is a very good lubricant and a fantastic, inexpensive eye makeup remover, including waterproof mascara. It lasts a very long time and is the best value even after all these years."
"this is ok for your money but I prefer Pond's Cold Cream. The smell is much better and the product is thicker, like a cold cream should be. If you want to save a few pennies, this is your go to for sure!"
It's kind of loose and greasy with pink tint to it . Not a bad fragrance and it reminds me of something my mom used to buy in the 60's/70's but the price is right for its size
I purchased this because i have dry skin and i was going to use it as a night cream for moisture. I was dissapointed because its super oily and extremely âold ladyâ smelling. Highly fragrant
I have waterproof makeup that would not come off in the shower. I put this stuff on my face and wiped it with a washcloth and it came right off. It also makes the skin soft and hydrated.
"I was skeptical about this product, but it works better than any other face cream I've used. There is a subtle floral scent that I didn't expect, so if you have allergies keep that in mind. I love how bright my face feels and I feel that I look more vibrant"
"I was really excited to try this cream since it had so many great reviews, but I had a different experience. The very first night I used it, it was thick and it made my face look very oily; it was uncomfortable to wear. If you buy this, make sure you use a little bit to see how it works for your skin, but keep the receipt just in case."
Very satisfied customers.
"Love this face cream, my Grandma and my Mom used it. There face was always so soft as mine now."
Good for removing makeup at night without irritating skin. Cost is very reasonable.
"This is a very basic face cream without all the fancy ingredients which can dry or cause some allergic reaction. My face became dry and sensitive after using a Vitamin E oil and a Rosehips oil on my face so I was looking for a moisturizer that would let my skin return to normal. This is the one I found that made my skin feel normal again. I've continued to use it as a night cream, as it is rather greasy for daytime."
"I live in a dry, windy climate, I've been using this since I was 16 (1965) and it's still my go-to face cream."
"It has a nice smell and soften my skin well. It does go on a little greasy, so be careful not to use much."
hard to find. Jergens may have discontinued product but Walmart had it in stock on the internet but not in stores
I absolutely love this facial cream! Its perfect for the winter when you're face is dry and cracking. Its affordable and smells great too
Love this product!! My sisters can't live without it!! Would recommend it anyone who wants to have a healthy-looking skin!!
I've used this for years. It is not greasy and takes off all the makeup residue. Price is good value and a good product.
love this thing! use it for home facial...it's very oily when mixed with some water for that perfect home facial..it leaves the skin soft and supple afterwards
"I'm very impressed with this product! It's very thick, lightly scented and moisturizing. A little goes a long way to keeps my skin feeling hydrated and smooth for hours! And it's less than $4 for 15 ounces!"
Absolutely favourite for dry skin. It's really greasy so does the job well
"very good product works as a moisturizer and make up removal product, it really is all purpose, I even use it as an all over body moisturizer after showering."
"I have used this face cream for years. The mineral oil makes my skin soft, not greasy. It cleans very well, without fuss, and inexpensively. I hope to keep using it forever!"
"I was initially skeptical about this product because I wasn't sure it will work for me. After I ordered and tried one jar, I am in love and hooked. It makes my skin so soft, shinny and even lightened my complexion. For just 3 bucks, you get a MIRACLE IN A JAR. I will highly recommend this for those with Dry Skin. It works like MAGIC"
"I had been searching for an inexpensive make up remover, so for the price I picked up a jar to see if it would remove my makeup off without irritating my eyes . I wasn't impressed with this product removing my make up and I had to pop out my contacts to use this product, which I really don't have time for. I finally found my perfect make up remover (which I can use with my contacts still in, never irritating), so I use this for my feet and hands and sometimes on my neck/face. I won't repurchase, but it does make your skin soft."
I used a micro abrasive cream under my eyes and got a chemical burn. I tried several creams to help alleviate the pain but they all added to the pain. We were out and I saw this on the shelf for less than five dollars I thought what could it hurt. It's awesome no pain and cleared up my burn quickly!! Love this stuff!!
"It has many uses. It easily removes make-up leaving your skin feeling soft and smooth. It can also serve as a moistureizing agent over night to help nourish the skin on face, legs, feet and anywhere else the body needs to rehydrate. Really awesome product!!"
I wear alot of high end makeup and its very difficult to get off even scrubbing using soap! This is a magical unknown secret for the BEST MAKEUP remover ever!! I put this all over my face use a warm wat washcloth and it all glides RIGHT OFF!! AMAAAAZING!!
"I love this cream as a moisturizer, but can I use it under my foundation?"
The best face cream in all the world!
"This cream is the best for massage, it is not sticky but stays silky to the end."
Thank u love it sooooo much
Couldn't be happier with the softness of the changes in my dry skin..
Love this product! I use it to remove my make up! The best!
It helps remove make up and cure dry spots. Only issue is it is tested on animals.
"I like the way the cream makes my face feels, and I like the smell as well."
I bought this for my mother the scent was not what I thought and it was to thick. not buying this anymore.
Has a strong scent. Pretty oily going on but makes my face soft. You can't beat the price for the amount you get.
"This is an awesome product for the price. It gently removes make-up, including mascara. I use it every day!"
I have been using this product for many years and think it is great -- great value and great quality.
I use this as make-up remover every night. I just use tissue and don't need to use water. It is not at all greasy. It takes off all the make-up and moisturizes at the same time. I'm very happy with this purchase.
This NOT a CREAM...it is a LOTION. I opened it at an angle believing it was thick. Half of the tub hit my carpet. I can not get it out. The packaging needs to be corrected or the product be thickened. I also expected the cherry smell....not so. Not happy.
I LOVE JERGENS ALL-PURPOSE FACE CREAM!!! SO SMOOTH!!!
The best moisturizer-base-makeup remover ever.....my Grandma started me on it a long..........time ago. Don't ever change the formula!!
"Jergens is a time tested product and it does moisturize your skin. I used it mostly at as a night cream. It is a little heavy in consistency so if I do use it as a morning cream, I use very little. Overall, I am pleased with this product"
"It's very greasy. I didn't realize this is a cold cream to remove make up, I didn't see that in the description. It did remove my face makeup nicely (I wouldn't recommend it to remove eye makeup) and it did leave my skin soft."
"I purchased this a long time back & it has ONLY been used once. I thought I might use on my legs, but I CAN NOT stand the smell, it stinks. It is a pink cream & feels ok,but who can stand something that smells this bad & I have tried all the moisturizers & this has to be the the worst thing I have EVER smelled. How anybody can use this is beyond me! YUCK It is VERY GREASY, VERY. It is made in the U.S."
Makes my face feel very soft. And cleans my make-up off better than soap
Works as well as the expensive brands.
"I love the smell of this product, it's so moisturizing and does a pretty good job of cleansing. It is pretty oily, for me that's ok. I wouldn't recommend to someone with oily skin."
"I have used this cream forever, and was very pleased that you still carry it."
LOVE IT!
Love thz cream
This cream has a very strong fragrance. It irritated my skin and my eyes.
Cream looks oily on the face.
"Works very well to remove makeup, as well as using to moisturize face."
Been using this cream for years and love it.
