I use this every single day. It is absolutely awesome it does keep my skin moisturized all day. I often get comments on the scent. I having been using it for years it keeps my skin glistening in the summer months and skin tone even.
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT DOES WONDERS FOR THE SCARS ON MY NECK. I REFUSE TO WEAR ANYTHING ELSE.
"I bought this on line a month ago because it is hard to find in the stores. I love the hand cream , I've been using it for years. I don't understand why sometimes you can't find it anywhere????? Love My Palmers!!!!"
"I am very, very dry. I use this all day, every day. I put it on my feet right after showering. No more dryness, no more flaking, no more itching or discomfort. No callouses!!! My feet look and feel like a baby's feet. I also use it on my elbows and hands. At night I put it on with gloves to sleep. I can't say enough about how much I love this product."
"I use Palmer's Cocoa Butter Cream for my feet, arms, and legs, which are extremely dry. This product lasts so much longer and keeps the moisture in. It works very well on extreme roughness and cracks (on foot bottoms). I'm not wealthy and the cost is a great value. I use it almost everyday (there used to be a time when I had to use it Every day) and it has reduced dryness and cracks to almost nothing. As a diabetic, I am greatful for it's properties and good value."
"Living in Wisconsin in the winter time does a number on one's skin. My skin becomes very dry, especially my hands. The Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E is a solid, not a lotion. The solid absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it feeling and looking hydrated."
"When they call this stuff ""butter"" they are not lying. It doesn't feel like it goes on thick, but it covers the skin even in water. Smells great. Promotes healing really well. Will continue to use the remainder for every day use."
"I have been using this for years, I have exzema on my hands and this really helps and all of the places where I purchased it quit selling this particular one. Great for dry hands legs, etc."
"I received a free sample jar of this solid and I LOVE it! I use it everywhere, a lot when I go to bed. Lips, cuticle, eyes, face, etc. Will be buying a lot of it!"
"I would recommend this product for anyone with dry skin. You don't need to apply a lot plus it smells like coca butter, which I like. My skin is getting better and not as dry because of the winter season."
"I have purchased this product for many years, it goes on smoothly and leaves my 64 y/o skin feeling soft and supple."
"As an bonus, the children I work with at school say I smell like hot cocoa! LOL"
I decided to give this a try since other lotions weren't helping my dry skin. My hands get very dry in the winter and crack and bleed. Not fun. So I tried this and put it on in the morning and when I went to bed. My hands felt much better on the third day of using this. I don't put it on any more through out the day because it's oily for a while and that's annoying but it's worth it.
"Thirty day challenge to use this product on my torso...where Shingles have left their mark. Choosing not to use on side/back in order to see the difference. After 2 weeks, marks are beginning to fade. Scratches, nics, discolored marks...all starting to fade AFTER JUST TWO WEEKS! Good for Black Men who shave their heads and face as it soothes and minimizes irritation from shaving."
"good price and good product. clears dark spots, makes skin smooth to the touch. softens feet too."
I have used this for years. It Really moisturize my whole body and face.I have one for my son as well ( 10mos old)
I love the thickness and smoothness of this lotion WITHOUT the cocoa butter fragrance. And it's NOT greasy! Absorbs into the skin perfectly.
I was looking for something to sooth my dry ankles...this product does the trick! I love the results and the subtle scent!
I've had a problem with very dry skin around my heels. Even using a pumice stone hasn't helped. I've been using Palmer's every night. I see a big difference!
"This is the only lotion I can use to help calm down the redness/rosacea in my face. Sometimes I still get a little bit of redness even after I apply this lotion, but I have not been able to find another lotion or cream to keep my redness under control. If possible, can you please come out with a facial cocoa butter that has no fragrance or alcohol in it that can help with redness or rosacea. It really would help a lot of people. Also, a facial mask with no fragrance or alcohol can help as well."
"All throughout middle school I had extremely bad acne, the sides of my temples were left with craters and my cheeks were left with dark marks after the pimple went away. It's been three years and I apply this lightly during the night on my craters and unevenly colored acne marks and they're all almost gone! It's so worth buying!"
"I used your cocoa butter years ago for post baby stretch marks. Recently after having a tiny melanoma removed from my cheek, I spotted your Daily Skin Therapy on a shelf & have used it for several months. I now would use it daily as my only face cream, but tell me, please....Am I the only person who has a problem getting the product OUT of the bottle??? Tell me how, please!"
"I have tried many, many other skin care products especially on my face because my face get a dry sometimes and acne-prone, but this is the only formula that does not cause my skin to go crazy!! It does not weigh down my eyes and it smells SOOOO good!! My little sister bought this for herself at first but I kind of have stole it."
"I have been using this product, basically since I was born. I never really experience any type of acne, pimple in my face. People ask me what I use to make my face clear. I don't use makeup all the time. I wash my face with water or sometime St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub. I use COCOA BUTTER FORMULA"
"I have used this stuff faithfully for the last 15 years and very disappointed with the new 24 hour moisturize additive/ change that has been made and added to everything!. I have eczema and very sensitive skin and the original formula worked for me. This is more like a water down version or the original. The smell is bad, it does not stay on 24 hours, and it feels gross. This was my favorite coco butter but not anymore. :("
I have bad dry cracked hands and this lotion is AWESOME. Within one day of using my hands were already soft. I have not had soft hands in over 5 years. I can't thank you enough for this great product. I have tried just about every lotion and saw this at the store and couldn't believe how cheap it was and not tested on animals i figured i would give it a try. SO GLAD i did. Thank you!
"I tried this after seeing an ad in a magazine and I am now completely hooked on it! I have dry skin and I've tried almost every other lotion out there, with adequate to good results, but this product is spectacular! It is WAY better than anything else I have ever tried. Thank you for making such a fabulous product. It really works and it smells divine!! I can't wait to try the other products you have. No need for phony perfumes anymore and it's good for my skin. LOVE this!!"
This cocoa butter is a great buy to fade away dark spots.
It makes my skin so soft and moisturizer love it
Loved and needed the lotion.
It really does give temporary relief & helps to slow dry & peeling skin.
You don't have to put on every day and heels stay soft
"Love this size. Keep one in my bag, one in my car."
Love this product. Great for deep moisture. Very greasy.
My hubby used this on his hands. He really like t.
I've been using this product for almost two years and I love it. My skin always feels so soft after using. I wasn't following a consistent routine and my skin was really dry. I noticed a difference immediately and haven't used another product. I think it's supposed to be hand cream but I use it on my whole body so it would be nice if it came in a larger bottle.
good
I love the size and the scent is amazing. It works great at moisturizing my skin. I will definitely go to the store to get more.
"This product line is great for anyone wanting healthier, smoother skin. My daughter has a form of excema; she uses this daily and you can't tell she does. It's the best skin hydration."
I previously order 4 of these and received the jars which gave me 30% more product which I thought was a excellent value and decided to order an additional 4 jars and I was a bit disappointed be cause I didn't received the same excellent value. Is this an promotion only given certain times of the year?
"I've been using this product on my hands, legs, feet, and elbows for 3 months and it has changed my life. I used to be so embarrassed by my skin and now it really is soft to the touch and moisturized. Thank you so much Palmers!"
Great product!
Great for skin
"I received this hand cream by happy accident from Palmers, but this hand cream doesn't have quite as strong of a fragrance as the body lotion which is a good thing. The worst thing is to get a hand cream and then smelling it all day after application. It's quite rich and emollient and I may buy this again..."
"I am so in love with this daily skin therapy lotion. Love the fact that it's paraben and phthalate free. Once your half way through the bottle, it's very hard to squeeze the bottle for more. This is disappointing. I lay down the bottle and push down on it to get whatever at be left!"
"This Fragrance Free moisturiser feels silky, smells lovely, and so good for my skin. I love it. Thank you. It's the only one I have used for many years and always make sure I keep extra on hand. It would certainly be beautiful and healing on dry, rough skin but I use it as a facial moisturiser. I get compliments on my skin and I know it's because of this lovely lotion."
I have been using this lotion for the past week and it is amazing. It isn't completely fragrance free it has a light scent of cocoa butter but I've gotten used to it. I love that it lasts until the next day and moisturizes without having to re-apply it. A+++
"This lotion does not have a potent fragrance, as noted in the previous review. Either this person is referring to another brand, or is simply ignorant! This product offers that traditional cocoa butter fragrance, but with a lighter appeal. Palmers is an outstanding brand!"
Feels great while it reduces and diminishes marks
Use this product more often
"Smooth and soothing for just shaved legs. Nice smell, too!"
"I keep this in the house as my go to moisturizer. The product is very thick and the squeeze container does not dispense the product. After a little is removed, I have to put hot water in the bottle and mix it like heck to get a smooth lotion. If the product needs to be this heavy, it should be in a jar so one can scoop it out."
"I bought this product just four days ago, and I've seen a HUGE difference! I always have dry and bloody hands in the winter, and no cream I've ever tried has worked... until I tried this one! I've tried vasoline, hand lotion, etc., and none of it worked. I'm truly amazed with how fast and well this product worked, and I will continue to use it!"
This is a great body and face lotion. It doesn't leave me oily or with a greasy feeling. It literally improved the quality of my skin. I might be reaching but I swear any scratches I get heal faster and completely disappear like they were never there. It smells great.. this is my official go to lotion.
Love that this is available in a larger container than we've bought before. The smell also reminds me of brownies. Win win :)
I've been using the lotion for several weeks. It helps keep very dry skin lubricated. Eczema is well under control. Great job.
The only thing to keep my skin hydrated during cold dry winter! Certain parts of skin get particularly dry in winter. Also help keep skin warm. And The bigger pot last through the winter usually.
I purchased this product months ago and fell in love so its a must try
"I have been using Palmer's cocoa butter for more than a year, and I've noticed fading in stretch marks, smoother skin and reduction in cellulite. I love it, and will always use it. The price for this size is very affordable compared to the smaller size. Also, the ingredients are more natural than most lotions and moisturizers."
I would recommend this product to everyone because it definitely works for marks and rough edges on ur skin. looks oily from outside so better to use only at night. no spf so dont use it in the daytime coz its oily nature might absorb lots of sunlight. i love this moisturiser. I think im gonna use this for the rest of my life.
My children are grown. I started using this cream on my dark stretch marks and now they are just about all gone. My husband and sons use it for scars where burn marks remain. The scars become small and unnoticeable or go away. The earlier you start to use it the better.
This cream is very thick so a small amount goes a long way. be careful not to put it on too thick and make sure to massage it into the skin to help with the absorbtion or it may feel greasy. but if you use a small amount it leaves your skin super soft and gives it a beautiful glow. not to mention it's a great buy compare to all the other similar products in the market. highly recommend it!
"This product is great to use when you shower right before you towel dry. A small amount, about a tsp, is enough for the whole body. Skin will be soft, with a sweet cocoa smell that disappears after a while. Great for elbows, legs, knees and feet. Excellent value!"
"I have stubborn stretch marks on the insides of my thighs and after using this for two weeks, even the darkest ones are fading! I thought I'd never get rid of them. This product also works wonders on scars and blemishes. Just remember, a little goes a long way. Excellent quality for the price."
Over all I'm very please with this cream it made drastic changes to my skin. My breast had red stretch marks so as my stomach and now their white and some you cant see depending on the lighting your in. You must know though that this won't work overnight you have to be putting this for months.
"I am a diabetic and always have dry skin. But this year from August 4, 2015, on the rapid changes in weather and temperatures made me look like an alligator. After spending many dollars on lotions and ointments, I decided to try Palmer's Cocoa Butter with Vitamin E. It was quite a turn-around. The skin spots are disappearing and my knees, elbows and wrists (as well as my arms and legs) are once more becoming smooth."
"I read all the reviews. I didn't see anyone mention how greasy this was. Think of real dairy butter all over your hands and feet. That's how greasy it is. I bought it for someone who had cracked feet. And I bought myself one as well. It didn't help their feet and I just can't stand how greasy it is. Maybe it is great for belly scars, but for hands and feet? You better be ready to not walk to touch anything. Just think real dairy butter and that's what it is like."
"I like that it covers and moisturizes real dry skin as it says. I purposely bought it for knees, elbows and back of the arm leading from the elbow to the armpit where you get those fine bumps sometimes; also, my legs where hair bumps arise. It has done exactly what I hoped; the bumps are disappearing daily."
"I have severe psoriasis on my legs, and itch so much that my skin is often scarred and bruised. I tried so many different creams and lotions and oils--including prescription remedies--and nothing worked like this lotion. My legs look amazing, my skin tone has improved and is no longer red and splotchy, and I love the scent, too. Plus it absorbs well and isn't greasy. I love it so much that I'm going to try other Palmer's products!"
Palmer's Intensive Solid Formula was recommended to me for my mastectomy scars to keep them soft and supple. It worked wonders! I continued to use it through radiation treatment and it helped reduce the skin damage and blistering. I swear by this product and still use it every day.
"Definitely, I used this for a nice unique, Celtic, 3D sleeve tattoo. I did the first 48 hours light on the A&D and then switched to this stuff at the request/instructions from my tattoo artist. I got the touch-up work done 10 months later and she, my artist couldn't believe how well the tattoo healed and remained with the same shading and pigments as the original design/tattoo. My sensitive skin was not a problem and this worked beautifully for and with it."
"A tiny dab will temporarily cure the static, dry, fly-aways that strike hair so often in the winter (it washes out very easily). Dry, chapped skin is instantly soothed. It's great for preventing windburn--just slather it on your face. And a very unconventional use: it's the best water-proofing cream I've ever found for my leather work boots!"
"Trust me... They don't want you using cocoa butter. They don't want you to be smooth. The ladies always say I smell good.. I don't use no cologne... Only cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is the key. To the people at Palmers, bless up. Love it so much I'm buying another one."
"I used it 3 years ago and it was great but, i bought it recently and it gave me ITCHY RED RASHES all over my arms and leg! I stopped using it and now my legs and arms have brown spots all over. If there is something in the ingredients that is causing this please fix it because i am not the only one with this problem."
"its a good cream for the price. it does truly melt into skin..stays greasy for sometime and then gets absorbed completely. however it didnt work for my dry skin patches because it doesnt have a water component..the ingredients are all oils and butters. if you are fine with mineral oil , fragrance"
I finally decided to try this product for this first time and I absolutely love it my acne has calmed down my old scars faded my skin is smooth and soft only con is that my husband just holds and sniffing all the time now
"This is great for massages, dry skin on elbows and knees and a wonderful creme after swimming, friends have commented this keeps their psoriasis at bay because it is so creamy and rich, I can not argue with them on that!!!"
i have been using this for 42 years! got my first jar at 14. i recently got a beach sun burn and it's saved my face! i will never stop buying it!
"I wouldn't do without this as a woman of color. This is a rich cocoa butter formula with essential moisturizers. I use it twice a day, after bathing, and my skin is just elastic and glowing! Plus I smell yummy too! Love this product!!"
"I have been paying the same price for one half the size-I use this alot so it was a great deal!I use it for suntaning-works great,smells great & keeps skin sooo soft!"
This tub of cocoa butter is a great deal for your money! It works wonders for dry skin and I'm using it on recent scarring and the scarring is looking better too! Buy it - you will like it!
"LOVE this. Used it on my tummy thru 2 pregnancies and NO stretch marks! Use it now to remove eye makeup and as an eye cream being that I am over 50, and an all over moisturizer. And no parabens in this one!"
"I bought this at the drugstore on a whim, and this changed my life. My hands have never been that soft in my entire life. It heals my dry hands very quickly, smells like chocolate, and absorbs quickly without leaving a residue."
"I bought the 17 fl oz pump bottle of this, which I absolutely love. The problem is the bottle is half full and the pump has stopped pumping. Now I have a half full bottle I fight with every day to get some to come out."
"I have psoriasis on my hands and feet, very painful when I have a flare up. After two years of using this product and that product, I tried Palmer's. It is the only lotion that doesn't burn my skin and I believe it has helped with the flare ups."
I love this lotion so much. It does everthing as advertised. I dont have to worry about putting on more throughout the day. It has easily become one of my body care staple items.
"I keep a supply of this and have since the late 90s. It keeps my skin moisturized and it's smoothed our some blemishes I couldn't get rid of previously. Not to mention the smell, I love it!"
"So at first I put this product on and didn't like it because it was greasy. But once I rubbed it in I was totally in shock. The product is not oily at all and made my skin super soft. When I get wind burn or chapped hands due to the cold, I use this and it works fabulously. I apply a good amount to my body every night and every morning. Also works very well on my face. Thankyou palmers for making a product better than any others!!"
"I can`t stand the conventional ""mens"" scent, so I went for the unscented. I have skin that is both greasy and dry at the same time and is a real pain to find a good lotion for. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this one exceeds my expectations as it is not only nourishing and moisturising, but helped fade the bulk of my scarring and stretch marks. Thank you Palmers!"
"I have been using this product faithfully since high school (I am 30). It is literally a cure all for me. When my skin is dry or sunburnt I put a layer on to prevent peeling, it helps with chapped lips, rough elbows, rough knees, and a million other things. I still love the smell after all this time, it is so comforting. I ALWAYS have a jar of this in my bathroom, I would recommend it to any and everyone!"
I loved the regular lotion for its scent and when I saw this at the store I instantly fell in love because it smells even better! Not gonna lie it was a little awkward to use at first because it is solid but I found scraping around the edge an effective way to get a good amount of product. I love how smooth it feels and how my skin doesn't hurt from how dry it can get haha
"I take very hot showers and have to shave my legs often so my skin gets desperately dry and itchy. This formula is super thick and rich (I dig it out with my knuckles so it doesn't get under my nails). The smell is AMAZING. Somewhere between cocoa butter and honey. The best part is that it's not particularly oily at all and seems to soak in well. I also highly recommend it for dry, cracked hands because the slight waxy-ness really seals in moisture."
"This stuff worked wonders for my feet, especially my heels. I started putting in some lavender massage oil and voila! It smells heavenly. I also apply it on my stretch marks around my thighs, butt, and now my pregnant belly. The ones on my thighs and butt have decreased in appearance so hopefully it does the same for my belly, post pregnancy!"
"I bought this when a growth spurt gave me wickedly deep, purple stretch marks. I was so embarrassed, they looked like scratches on my thighs and were very sensitive. After a few months the marks are my regular skin tone, they look, and feel much better. I Highly recommend this product!"
"I bought this last year from a glance and even on my first use, I noticed a difference that it made. A little goes a long way and it goes deep into the layers to moisturize and protect. It also works great if you have eczema, my skin hasn't cracked and my hands have a nice glow. I love it! Give it a try for a few days and you'll love it too"
"I absolutely love this product. It keeps my skin moisturized and healthy looking. It leaves a nice ""glow"" to your skin. I use it on scars and dark spots. A little goes a very long. I usually mix with a little bit of Vaseline and it just does wonders. It's getting a little hard to find this product, especially the size I have (9.5 oz jar) so, I'm trying to preserve what I have lol. I would highly recommend to anyone."
"I LOVE THIS!!!! I had a lot of dryness around my nose and between my eyebrows, so I used this for about 3 days morning and night, and all my dryness went away in 2-3 days. Also have acne and this hasn't seemed to break me out. I was amazed. Such a great product for face dryness"
i had alot of problems with my skin being dry all the time so i started useing this and it works wonder from head to toe literally i put it on my feet after shower and put my socks on and my feet have never felt so smooth and soft and my legs to so soft and stretch marks on my hips are dissappearing lil by lil so i would definitely recommend this product to everyone young and older.
"I ran out of one of my other Cocoa Butter moisturizers,and I went to the chemist immediately and brought this product....I absolutely love it!I will continue to use these products,they helped my skin so much and it gave me so much more confidence. Thank you!"
I started using palmers coco butter on my tattoos instead of a normal a&d ointment. This stuff has helped me get through the tattoo healing process on 7 tattoos. Now Ithat it's winter my hands started cracking from dryness. Although I could do without the oily look and feel after this stuff has helped heal my hands in less than 24 hours!
"I'm a man 57 y/o. I have always had dry heels. It was to the point they were cracking open. I asked my Dr. at the Veterans Hospital for lotion, that did not work. My daughter gave me some of this lotion to try on my heels and it works! I would recommend this to anyone male or female."
"This product is nice, though I have only used it on my hands to try it out. I read everywhere online that it's a very good product, and it is. I can feel a difference on my hands. However, the smell bothers me and I won't be using the bottle i bought because of it. Next time will definitely be an unscented purchase! Overall, I like this stuff. It's neat."
"At all times I keep at least 2 of these on hand and use it daily after showering. My only complaint is the container. The pump usually works (even if I get a dud...I keep on on hand!). But my issue is that there's still lots of lotion in the container that will no longer pump out. Then I remove the pump, and it's a real mission trying to get the remaining lotion out."
I have had dry skin for all my life and this is one product that actually works. I only apply it in the mornings and at night and don't need to during the day as I have to with other so called dry skin lotions. It is so great to find a product that actually does what it says. I will be a customer for life with this product.
All the places that used to carry the exact cream of yours that I want no longer carry it. It's a great product that I reccomend to everyone. I need it I had to buy your stretch mark cream to get me to my new bottle of the regular cream when it comes from online shopping.
"After trying this product for a few days, I noticed a difference with my extremely dry skin. This is by far the best moisturizer that I've use in a very long time. I went from rough, dry skin to soft skin. The fragrance of this product was refreshing. I highly recommend this product!"
"I've been using this product for years and I love everything about it from the scent to the way it feels and smells to the way itlocks in moisture...there is no substitute for palmers! I have tried other cocoa butter lotions and they can't even come close. keeps me looking young, even toned and firm and smelling delicious! love, love LOVE."
"I tried this as a substitute for their Shea butter lotion when it was out of stock... Since I loved that lotion, I knew I'd like this. The smell was awful... Too strong and for myself unpleasant. I returned the lotion! May be ""ok"" on the skin... But, carrying the odor was not for me!"
"I absolutely love the smell of this. It smells like chocolate, like most cocoa butter lotions used to. I've noticed lately that other cocoa butter brands smell like coconut and not like cocoa. . . Anyways... If you like the smell of chocolate. This is for you!"
"I have been using Palmer's for 25 plus years. Started in my 20's when I got pregnant and never had a stretch mark. Loved it so much, I continued to use it. I then branched out to their other products. I also always used Pamer's products on my children when they were growing up. Both in their 20's now, they use Palmer's products all the time. Right down to the hair conditioners and lip balms!!"
"A good product, a good price."
perfect. as is all palmers cocoa butter products
"Great product, great price, great service"
"I used palmers on my last pregnancy and on my current one & I had absolutely NO stretch marks after the baby. Trust me do not use any other brand or the lotion version, it has to be this can because it has a very thick consistency so whatever they put in it....WORKS!"
I've always used Palmer's! It's the only thing that has ever truly helped my skin. Highly recommend it
Really works . Heals very dry cracked skin better than any other cream.
I love that Palmer's cocoa butter lotion. It keeps my skin nice and smooth.
It's really good for my son face leaves it shiny and soft
Great product for skin. Feels creamy and moisturizing great for elbows and wrinkles look smooth out.
I have been using the solid formula going on 50 years!! I have not had any reason to complain because
This stuff works great! I like what natural smell there is. It is faint and smells a bit chocolatey.
I love Palmer's Cocoa Butter it is my best moisturizer for my face and body. I have used it for years and I will keep using it
"I think palmers changed the formula recently cuz the lotion doesn't smell good anymore. Dissapointing, why ruin a perfect thing?"
"I like the cream itself, but the plastic tube perished and cracked on both sides, making the whole thing unusable. Maybe an old batch that's been too long on the shelf, I don't know."
I just bought this product today and I'm very pleased with it. My skin feels much softer. The smell is awesome. Palmers products never fail to amaze me!
"First off, I LOVE THIS STUFF! My problem is that it comes with no protective cover of any kind. My suggestion is that it should have one. Nothing prevents someone from putting their finger in the jar. I ALWAYS open jar and look before buying."
"I really like this lotion, however, I would to like to see this come out with a lighter version of the same scent. Smells great but just too strong for me. I only use it on my legs because of this."
First started using this product at basic training for the Army and fell in love !! I have used it so much the past 5 years !! Highly recommend. The smell is amazing and it restores your skin amazingly !!
"Previously I always change brands once finish a jar but once using Palmer's, I know that I found the best. Been a user since 2015. Perfect moisturizer for my extremely dry skin and it last long. Decent smell & very affordable. Love xx"
"DJ Khaled uses this so obviously it's bomb. It's the key to more success. They don't want you to use this, they don't want you to have soft skin so you have to make sure you have soft skin"
"I have psoriasis on my hands and feet, very painful when I have a flare up. After two years of using this product and that product, I tried Palmer's. It is the only lotion that doesn't burn my skin and I believe it has helped with the flare ups."
Have been using Palmers for over 7yrs. They continue to do a good job and their product quality never changes. Wonderful product for people with dry skin
I have been using this lotion for years and when I opened my new bottle i noticed it smelled different. Please go back to the original cocoa butter scent that I always got complimented on.
"Absolutely love this product, moisture really last 24 hours.. skin feels smooth and appeara youthful. I am allergic to parabens so that fact that it is free of them makes this an awesome product!!"
This Cocoa butter formula smells amazing!!! I have stretch marks and I'm currently using it to keep my skin moisturized- no reactions or burns so far from my skin being sensitive!! love it!!!
I am so disappointed... I have used ONLY this product for over 20 years...BUT the last 2 bottle I bought have a strange aroma not the normal soothing cocco butter scent. Hope they change it back .
A very good value for the money. I use it on a recent surgical incision. It was used at my physical therapist office and I was impressed at how it faded the incision scar.
I have been using Palmers Cocoa Butter Concentrated Cream and the Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E for as long as I can remember and I absolutely love it
I used the original lotion during pregnancy and I didn't get any stretch marks.
This did make my face really soft but it also clogged no pores
Love it! Really helps with my summer cracked feet. Makes a huge difference.
This product is fabulous! Healed my scars from 3 surgeries really quickly when applied daily. It softens heels of my feet so well apply it every day after bath its wonderful and all natural!
I've been using Palmer's Cocoa Butter Cream for several decades. I love how it moisturizes and conditions my skin. I feel like the formula has changed. It didn't used to smell strongly like stale chocolate. I'd prefer it if it were less scented.
"This product was a STAPLE in the black community. Now they cater to a different demographic, smh, I am highly disappointed in this company. They should have created one specifically for them instead of tampering with what worked!"
"I have used this product for years. After washing my face in the mornings and drying it thoroughly, I always apply this cocoa butter to my face. I look 10 years younger than I actually am and in previous years it has removed scars and burns from my skin. I will always use palmers cocoa butter."
"I have tried all the other cocoa butter stuff for pregnancy and none of it moisturized like this did. The others would only last for a couple of hours and then I would have dry itchy skin again. This stuff lasts all day, it is kinda oily when you put it on though. I have no stretch marks and even better than that, since I have been using it every day my scars that I had for years have now faded and aren't raised anymore. I am very satisfied with this product."
I love this lotion. The natural scent is light and smells chocolaty.
The best. Be I have tried hundreds of ther types. I love it
excellent cream at reasonable price...very effective in reducing stretch marks during pregnancy.
Wonderful for making scars and blimishes fade.
This is an excellent product for dry skin and the price was totally excellent.
Since using this product my skin looks healthier and feels so soft. Definitely buying more!!!!
Leaves your skin soft. Love this product and would recommend to a friend.
Perfect lotion for the winter time. Makes my skin softer.
However it is in a solid way. Kind of hard to use. Smell great.
Ive used this product forever and my skin is amazing ! I love Palmers best brand around.
Palmer's Cocoa Butter is EXCELLENT for dry skin. This is my summer jump off. It's smells delicious!
"I use this every day on my whole body, including my hair. The chocolate scent is heavenly."

Was not happy with product. Very hard to get out of container to apply to body.
Good product - a little greasy
It makes your skin look youthful and is a wonderful moisturizer all u need is a little bit an it does wonder I highly recommend
It has done away with acne and cracked heels.My skin looks lovely and beautiful.I feel so confident.Thank you Palmer's!
"I love this lotion, but the lotion is sooo thick that I have a terrible time trying to get it out of the bottle."
"I love this lotion so much. it smells heavenly, moisturizes beautifully and my skin just drinks it all up!! holy grail :)"
I have been using Palmer's Cocoa Butter since I was 14-15 years old. I have used this on my face and body over the years and it has worked well.
its good for the skin in the summer&winter makes you look younger i wish it was more in each bottle 20 oz
Takes care of ash ad last all day. It leaves you smelling like a cupcake but it takes the ash away better than any other brand I have tried.
I love the product. I've used it for years and it's just as described. I dislike the container. It's very hard to get out of the hard plastic bottle.
"I used this product before and it was good, but the one I bought last time definitely makes my skin itchy and causes red bumps and spots. Either it is a some new ingredient in formula, or I developed a new allergy:("
"This lotion has a very strong and very unpleasant odor that is irritating to my eyes and nose when I use the lotion on my hands. It was a great disappointment; I was looking for less scent, not more."
My lady used this product for a few blemishes a few years ago and I said let me give it a try! I have been using this product for 15 years+ and people can't believe me when I tell them my age. They say I have the youngest looking skin they've ever seen for a guy in his 60s!
"i have been using this wonderful formula since the mid 80's to soothe stretched skin due to pregnancy as well as eliminating marks. Not only do I recommend this especially to pregnant women and those slimming down, but buy in bulk to give as gifts at wedding/baby showers as well as birthday/holiday gifts"
"Good price. Excellent product for skin, especially the stomach during pregnancy."
I love it. I use it right after a shower and it makes my skin soft and smells delicious
It just melts into my skin .. I have never liked any cream so much. Even my husband loves its scent
"After 66 years (and 11 months) of using everything else, I finally found Palmer's Cocoa Butter."
I love love this. It has done wonders for my skin.
"I found out if you squeeze the bottle, the cream comes out easier."
"This product dries my skin, by absorbing the moisture. I do not recommend it at all."
One of Dj Khaled's MAJOR KEY TO SUCESS. Its great so I'm getting ANOTHER ONE.
"this cocoa butter is a major to my success, just like dj khaled told me. so good i have to get"
After applying in the morning my dry skin feels soft all day!
Great for keeping your skin hydrated. Great for hard working hands
The solid formula is the only product that I use on my face
The lotion has a great fragrance and it's not watery!
"By far, best moisturizer I've used. Great for moisturizing skin but doesn't make your skin look oily"
I am pregnant and have been looking for a cream for my belly. This is perfect and it literally keeps your skin moisterized until you take a shower again!
"If you don't have this product yet, you need it! I own three and keep them all around my house. I use it for my chapped lips, skin and makeup remover. It is absolutely the best!"
I love the way it moisturizes the skin and the lips. I also love smelling like chocolate! It is indeed the best product I have ever used...and I tried just about all the other ones on the market.
"I bought this cream several months ago. I use it on the rough spots of my feet, my dry elbows and knees. It has really made a difference. No more rough, itchy, dry areas."
"I've been using cocoa butter for years. Heals skin injuries from running, new shoes and too much dancing. Smells like chocolate, very pleasant and easy to travel as ur doesn't spill."
My fingers crack painfully in the winter. I rub this into the cracks each night for fast relief. The smell is so good and it does not sting. My fingers heal quickly using this very thick butter.
Have liked this particular formulation of cocoa butter & vitamin E for years. The smell is also great!! Use it all over body in lieu of a moisturizer.
I bought these thinking I was purchasing the big size. The web page had those and a smaller size. Now I'm disappointed that the big one was not listed.
"I bought Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Jar, 7.25 OZ months ago and it's still going strong. Palmer's is a household name for us. I use it everyday, and it keeps my face nice and clear. I highly recommend this product to everyone."
"I have been using Palmer's Cocoa Butter since i was a child. It is not the same, yet it does keep my skin moisturized because I suffer from dry skin."
"This product is very oily, solid and has a fresh light fragrance. It is great for the dry skin that Diabetes produces. This one 7 ounce jar has lasted over 2 months. A little goes a long way!"
"I keep this in my list and I re-order each time I am running out. This Item is great for the skin and prefect price. We all uses it in the house, although we have other body cream, this works best I even uses it as my lip balm; crazy maybe but it works."
Have been using this product for over a year and ordered several jars to share with family. It is truly a great product!
Got this for my handicapped son who had a rash. Nothing seemed to help. Used the cocoa butter creme and cleared it up in about a week. Miracle cream.
"I use this stuff on my feet when I get out of the shower and I LOVE how soft it makes my skin. Buy it, you'll be very happy with it."
Sometimes when I go walmart they never have the side of jar But when I order it online I do get it & it's kool
"I have been using this Palmers cocoa butter for years , even befour I had my son and he is 21years old now and it has kept my skin looking great all these years."
I use everyday to moisturize and softenjoy my skin after I shower .
"Helps promote healing, especially dry skin."
Smooths my dry after surgery skin/scar very nicely!
This is my favorite product. I have used it for many years!
I absolutely love your product. I will be re-ordering
Thank you
Jo
