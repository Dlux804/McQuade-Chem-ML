"This was my first time trying Clearasil, Stubborn acne control 5in1 One Minute Mask, and it works great. It doesn't dry out my face. I apply just a small amount and it goes a long way. It clear out my adult pimples. Also my teenage uses it and his face is starting to clear up as well. I will buy this product again and again for us. I recommend everyone to try it.

I absolutely love this stuff. I didn't have acne problems as a teen but ever since I have had kids I now have acne and nothing I have got before worked. This stuff has been amazing after a week using twice a day I seen a big difference. It smells good and leaves my skin so soft and smooth. I would rate 10 stars if I could! I highly recommend this!

It contains salicylic acid acne medicine. It can be used 1-3 times daily to be most effective. I would recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This products works wonders I really enjoyed how easy to use it was and it actually works!!! Definitely would recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Recently they discontinued Clearasil tinted with sulfur to the disappointment of many I'm sure! I had been using that product since I was a teenager and I can tell you that was quite some time ago! Nothing seems to compare so I gave this product 3 stars.
"I was shocked when I opened this tinted acne medication. I don't know what the tint is supposed to do but it's WAY too orange to use as a cover up. Granted, the medication does help a great deal with my acne but I can't wear it around other people. It's a great price for the strength of the active ingredient."
"This Clearasil Cream seems to work just fine at covering blemishes, etc., but it was a bit too dark in color for my skin tone, and as far as I know, this product is not available in different shades/colors, unfortunately."
"I love this cream. I have been using it for years and it's the only thing that works to keep my chin, nose and forehead clear of breakouts. I also love that it's tinted, I use it in place of foundation under my makeup."
"Tinted too dark, darker than the picture. The other Clearasil which was a lighter also worked better. Bring it back."
Changed label and ingredients but still love it. Needs to be in stock at stores though in this town.
"Picture on order site is of ORIGINAL Formula which is what I thought I was ordering. Shipment received was of newer formula product which just does not work. I will be returning. That being said, shipping was fast as promised."
Can't find it in stores.
Great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I put these on my daughters shoulder last night and when she woke up this morning you could tell the redness and swelling had completely gone down or subsided. I'm hoping that they continue to work even after we remove them. I wish I had something like this when I was her age! Glad so far that we bought them.
"Clearasil needs to bring back the formula of Resorcinol 2% and Sulfur 8% and get rid of the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, which not only dries out my skin but turns it red. Not to mention the color of the product is all wrong and is too orange. Or they should at least have both products available. Maybe I have sensitive skin but this product turns my face red and makes it itchy."
i wouldn't recommend this if you have dry sensitive skin. i used this product only for a few days and it dried out one pimple so much that there's a scab the size of a button on my face :(
"I think that the Clearasil company changed their tinted color to match the growing population of darker skinned people. I ordered the tinted color because I have used it for years as a light foundation under my other makeup. WalMart and other stores have cut back in stocking the tinted clearasil, so I had to make a special order. I had always been happy with the natural beige tint, however, this last purchase the cream color is too dark and orange. It doesn't look like a tan..."
"Um these are amazing. 31 yrs old- never had cystic acne until now and it's SO EMBARRASSING. I bought these on Sunday for a zit on my chin that just would not go away. After just one night, the bump is completely gone and it's totally flat and dried out. Used one again last night and the red patch is now half the size. I'm honestly shocked!!! Highly recommend"
"I have acne that is caused by PCOS, a hormonal imbalance. This didn't seem to help the underlying issue. If seemed to help dry out pimples after they had been popped, but I didn't seem much help with I popped pimples. I haven't ever found a product that really worked for me, but this could possibly help others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control 5in1 Pimple Patch 18 Count for my adult acne. Any time I feel a pimple coming up I put on on of these clear colored patches on. I put them on in the nighttime and in the morning I can see how much the patch has brought up. These help with quickening up the healing time. You could even wear these during the day for monster pimples! Since they are clear, they are barely noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited to try my sample of Clearsil Stubborn Acne. I'm in my 40s and still have trouble with this! I also have two teen sons that have occassional problems . This worked really well for all of us. It took care of my acne and helped remove dry skin . I would definitely buy this again , it has worked much better than other products I've tried and a lot faster. It didn't cry out my face and it smell s nice.

I was a bit skeptical when trying these patches. I was nervous about creating areas of dry skin but it didn't happen at all. These patches are not only convenient and easy to use but also work effectively to clear acne spots without drying the skin. I'm definitely happy that I tried these patches.

I first thought that Clearasil Acne Mask was a face wash. Nope. I was wrong. The mask had a smooth texture. It went on very well. It did not take much to get complete coverage. It was surprised that the mask did not sting my face. I've had some do that before. It did not weight heavy on my face at all. It washed off very easily with warm water. My face was left feeling very soft and smooth. This is a must have. It's become part of my face washing routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This definitely helps speed along the process during a breakout. As a weekly product, I feel like it is a great way to clear out the pores and deep clean to help avoid having a major breakout. This was the first time I had heard of this product. I received it as a sample and will definitely be purchasing more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a very greasy face and with my line of work I sweat a lot which creates not just normal pimples, But those huge ones that people can't help but stare at when they're talking to you. I tried this product and it's magic. It did take me two nights of putting the patch on to completely get rid of it but after the first day it had went down a lot. I am always going to have these handy in my house. A thousand thumbs up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the Clearasil stubborn acne 5 in 1 pimple patch and thought it worked great! I put it on before bed and the next day my pimple was almost completely gone and way less swollen! Perfect to use for the random acne breakout. They work well and quickly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product worked ok. I only have been using it for two weeks. I haven't seen any results still breaking out and isn't really keeping it under control. Maybe I'll see results the longer I use it. I would reccomend as a face scrub to help your face feel fresh, but not for controlling acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My daughter and I have been using this scrub for a while now. It has definitely cleared up both of our faces. Especially her face. She uses it on a daily basis and it has totally cleared her up. The only problem is that it does dry out the face. If used roo often. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Im VERY impressed with Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control 5in1 Pimple Patch 18 Count ! My son has terrible acne and used it and the next morning PIMPLES GONE! VERY IMPRESSED! by far exceeded my expectations [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried these little patches for a week. Looking at the box they looked pretty uncomfortable and stiff and I thought I would have trouble sleeping with them, but I was very wrong. I forgot I was even wearing them as soon as I put them on. They worked to help my acne a little bit, but not something I would purchase again. I get those deep painful zits and didn't try them on other kinds of acne that they may work better for. Overall, I would recommend trying them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control 5in1 Pimple Patch were easy to use and effective. They worked better than products I have used in the past. The patches were easy to apply and worked really well.

"I am facing some breakout and acne problem recently, and these came on the best time to try these. I put one of these on three nights in a row. The first night it reduced half the size, the second night made it much smaller. The 3rd night it was gone HOWEVER it left a red mark/scar. It took weeks to fade. It covered easily with concealer but still. I would put it on two times then wait a day between if you still need it. It pulls all the gunk right out though. It is amazing.

"Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control 5in1 Exfoliating Wash is a great face wash. This is the first product from Clearasil that I have used and really enjoyed it. The product is easy to use and lathered nicely on my face. It did feel a little oily at first, but once it was rinsed off, my face felt clean and smooth. The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming which is nice. My skin is clear and does not seem as oily as it usually is. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.

I was happy to be able to sample the Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control One Minute Mask. I really like the effects and I like the way the one-minute masks feel. An acne mask was a brand new concept to me and it's amazing to me how it can do the job in just one minute but it sure does. I recommend this product to anyone with acne or who has children with acne. I trust the Clearasil brand and this is a Clearasil product I think they should continue to sell for a long long time.

"This facial cleanser is very effective! The exfoliating beads work well to get rid of dead skin cells. After washing my face, it feels clean and refreshed. It doesnt smell like chemicals, nor does it have a fake floral scent. It smells very clean and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My Son is teenaged and going through a particularly rough patch of acne. It's very stubborn! He exercises good hygiene and isn't a popper or picker! I've noticed a breakout on his chin and jaw line. We used 4 of the Clearasil patches and he slept overnight with them in. 3 out of 4 blemishes came to a head and opened. 1 did not. The 1 that did not was a little angry and drier. I felt like 75% was a pretty good success rate! We will definitely use these again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

But this product makes my skin almost perfect, you can feel the difference at the moment of using it, zero fat and you can see how the grains disappear with their use, easy to use and a pleasant smell 100% recommended [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These dots helped the pimples on my face clear up faster. I put them on very night for a week and also wore them under makeup. And my pimples seemed to be less red, less inflamed and healed faster. There isn't any acne medication in these but there is something that helps your skin clear up faster, might be shielding the skin from the elements.

"Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control 5 in 1 Exfoliating Wash is the best face wash I have used. It has cleared up my face within one week. No face wash has ever done that.

I use it twice daily with Shea butter as a moisturizer after and my skin is very healthy. I got this as a free sample and will be buying it from now on :) If you have dry skin I wouldn't recommend it more than once a week, but I have oily skin and it works wonderfully.

The clearasil stubborn acne control I feel works fairly well. I used it for a Whitehead and it removed the head. The aftermath is the surrounding dried skin.

I can't rave enough about this product.

I am very surprised by this tiny product. I have never tried anything else like it. It was so tiny and thin but really did a good job at covering up the blemish. It reduces the redness and blends right in with the skin. It feels like nothing is on. And is not drying at all. I think I will buy this again when we need it and tell my friends about it too. I have seen products like this in other brands but did not know Clearasil made them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does exactly what it says. I am very shocked at how well it works. I am to old to get acne yet I still do and it is embarrassing.

"I used this product for a week in exchange for my opinion. It is definitely heavy on the exfoliating! I wonder if it was a perhaps a bit harsh for my skin. I don't have sensitive skin, but it felt really abrasive. I didn't get any new breakouts, so that was a positive. I miss the brightening aspect of my regular face wash.

I had not used clearasil since i was a teenager but I decided to give it a try again in my 30s with a recent flare up. I now remember why teenagers swear by it. I tend to have dry skin but my skin held up just fine with this product. The microbeads provide a good scrub and my face is soft and clean feeling afterwards. It's also easy to rinse off.

"I've been using this mask/face wash for around a year now. Thus far, it's been the only acne product to actually clear my face-not just for a short period, but for as long as I use it. In fact, when I stopped using it for a short time, my acne came back; when I started using it again, they went away. Overall, I 100% recommend. Bear in mind that all products work differently for everyone, so it may not work for you. Nevertheless, it wouldn't hurt to give it a try."
This product is very easy to use and very quick to dry down & do its work - it is perfect for busy people or people who just want a quick and effective solution. It has a bit of a smell but not bad though. There is sometimes a bit of a tingling feeling as it does its magic. Would highly recommend to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My son who is 14 has had acne for about 6 months now. He has been using the Clearsail Stubborn Acne Control for 2 weeks and we have seen a huge improvement with his skin! It really helped clear it up. Its nice to notice his eyes and smile instead of his acne again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Clearasil Stubborn Acne Control One Minute Mask was a master mask! The recent ones I have bought for my son (which I tried) did not prove too effective and ended up getting returned or thrown out. This worked like magic clearing his skin - and that stubborn acne. I have already bought another one for his trip coming up and recommended it to other moms. Great to have been able to try it as I had seen it but never ended up getting it. You won't be disappointed!

"This acne treatment really is working. I usually don't fall for these ""fast working"" products, but why not? I was desperate! WOW I saw results in just a day and day two was crazy!

"Never ever got one of these Clearasils that was such a weird color. It was actually like A dark pink blush color. Too much hassle to return, so just tried to add some !light make-up to the mix. Not very successful, so threw the rest away...."
I grew up on clearasil 70's child I truly wish they did not fade out on the regular cream. I read some of the other reviews and I have dark skin this tinted stuff is horrible and it smells really bad. The tube I purchased I only used at night just so I would not waste my money. This stuff leaves an awful ashy looking residue on my face. I agree with another reviewer they changed the formula this ting stuff is not for everyone. I wish they would just bring back the regular untinted cream.
Great price for size
