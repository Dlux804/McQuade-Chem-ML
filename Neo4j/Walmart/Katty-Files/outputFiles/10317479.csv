"This is a review for Clearasil rapid rescue deep treatment wash. The bottle is pretty big for the price, almost seven oz. This is a value for this face wash. In the warmer weather, I have oily skin, and this helped to dry some of that up, and kept me shine free. This has a salicylic acid to dry up any acne, and it works pretty quickly, especially with regular use. I'd recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My daughter used the clearasil spot-treatments-rapid-rescue for two weeks and she is very happy. She gets break outs often and since the pollen count has been high she hates he skin. The Clearasil has helped to reduce the length of her break outs and decreases the amount of spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was very easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I definitely saw improvement after a few hours. The redness had went away and it seemed like the acne spot had started going away some. The area I applied it seemed smaller and less noticeable. It feels lightweight on your skin and absorbed quickly and is scent free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"great product for both exfoliating aspect as well as the acne fighting, black head removing, acne/ oil control. plenty of micro scrubbers.has helped me control my acne problem. It just takes a tiny bit, It has a pleasant odor and leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually decided to get this for my fianc√©e his skin tend to break out a lot It was a great help didn't damage his skin the areas actually became softer and less visible very quickly and looked almost healed by the next day. I would recommend this product a little goes a long ways with this product #freeproducttest #viewpoint [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the product! I even have my teenage son using it along with me. It is fast acting and gives me a visible difference in just a few hours. Great for spot treatment or all over care. Perfect for a blemish that appears, but you have plans that night. It gets to work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It did work, but left a residue. When you add your other face products, this ends up coming off in like a ball like form. I didn't care for that. But it did help with diminishing my pimples. I would purchase if there wasn't a different brand to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"You really do notice your pimple disappearing by the next day! I have only been using for a day but it does what it says. Not sure about drying skin out but so far so good. Will purchase again, will and just did recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the cream and within minutes of applying it as directed my face became hot and red, followed by splotchy which then became extremely swollen. I have used other products of theirs with no problem even the old rapid treatment"
I tried this product on my teenage son and it dried up some of his pimples. It wasn't harsh on his skin and it works pretty well. You don't have to apply too much to the area which is good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just received this sample to use and try. My skin had a few troubled spots. I have been usjng this treatment nightly. I am seeing a slight difference. I would most likely buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has been the most effective cream I have ever used. It really does reduce redness in very little time, and the spots go away in no time. My face cleared up in about 2-3 days. Very happy with this cream, will be buying again!"
I switched from Retin-A to Clearasil when I was pregnant 10 years ago and I've never looked back. I love my Clearasil vanishing cream. I use it every single night and pimples are reduced or gone by morning!
I would not recommend the product i bought it because i have bad acne and i tried it on its own and woke up the next day to find my face burnt like i just had a day in the sun.
I've been using this product for almost a month along with others by this brand (the pads version of this and daily set) and they haven't been doing shiii for my skin but then again that might just b me so buy at ur own risk
This has worked wonders on my daughter's acne! I love that it is a spot treatment and dries just the area and not her whole face since she has combination skin. Wonderful product and works just as described! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My son used this everyday for 2 weeks and saw almost no improvement in his acne on his face. His face became red and his skin began to flake in the areas he applied the cream. I do not believe this is an effective treatment for a stubborn breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My 2 teens tried the clearasil , in one weeks time the acne was gone and their faces was cleared up. My son who has really bad forehead acne was very happy. My only problem is the first 2 days they used it it dried their faces out really bad. Seeing as how it worked so well, we're def gonna but this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Clearasil Rapid Rescue pads for about two weeks. I swipe the pad over my T-zone after cleansing, I'm amazed at how much dirt and oil is removed by the pads even after cleansing! I have also noticed fewer breakouts and less shine/oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got these when I was having a bad breakout. I used 2 pads after cleaning my face. One before bed and one the next morning. It didn't clear up the breakout but it definitely stopped it from getting worse. Now the smell of the pads is very strong and just wiping my face with it made my nostrils burn. If you can get past that then I'd say buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a little skeptical about it working within 4 hrs but it did! A little product goes a long way. I am very impressed with this acne treatment. I highly recommend for anyone that has pimples that need a spot treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My daughter and I use Clearasil Rapid Rescue Acne Spot Treatment as soon as we notice a breakout. We apply it right away and sometimes leave it on over night and the pimple will just about be gone. This stuff is a life saver for my 13 year old as she's been breaking out on her forehead and this has made a dramatic difference in her breakouts. If you suffer from breakouts this is definitely worth trying, I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this for the past 2 weeks and definitely noticed a difference in my skin after the first time using it! The product is smooth and barely has a smell, which is good for my sensitive nose. It doesn't feel tingly/burning like other acne products can. My skin is smooth and pretty clear without having to use multiple products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about week now and am really enjoying it. I use it in the evening as part of a multi cleaning routine as my last cleaning step before adding my moisturizers and serums. You can absolutely feel the tingling that let you know it is working and deeply penetrating your pores to get all the nasty out. I love the price point as well, it is very affordable yet the quality is amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually like foamy cleaners and this was a cream one which I actually didn't mind compared to cream ones I've used before. The smell wasn't too overwhelming which was good. It left my face soft and not dried out. As far as my occasional adult acne, it didn't really give me the fast results as it claims but overall I like this face cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Has a very nice texture and feels like it cleans deep in the pores. I really like this compared to other brands but I do need more time to see how it works over time. It didn't clear up my face as fast as I thought it would, that's why I only gave it four stars. But after time it does keep the acne down. I will buy this again and continue using it to see the long term effects on my acne. I would definitely say that this is worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many products in tbe past for my acne and nothing ever seemed to help.Until now.The clearasil rapid rescue acne spot treatment cream works and works fast.The cream doesn't have a foul order amd its not greasy.Overall a great product that I use everyday [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used Clearasil many times over the years and this product from their line did not disappoint. My face is only prone to breakouts once a month....every month. The Rapid Rescue Spot Treatment Gel did exactly what it was supposed to do. I put just a dab on the problem spot a couple of times a day and it dried right up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I only had to use a few times on a zit. I really didnt notice a difference as to clearing up sooner. It didnt dry out my skin which is good. I really dont think i would waste my money on this product though since there was no change for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Clearasil rapid rescue spot treatment cream usage and results are better than i expected. My daughters and I have both used it. Does not cause any redness on my sensitive skin, works as expected and as advertised. I really think this is a great item. It did not cause any dryness or redness, even on my sensitive skin. It did work well after only a few applications. very happy with the results. will purchase to use again in future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Whenever I see a pimple forming, I pop Clearasil Rapid Rescue on it, and the next day, it's to a head. Minimizing the wait time, as well as the pain of it. You don't have to put a lot on your face, which is a really good thing. Just a small amount will go a long way, so it lasts a while.This, combined with your usual routine, will have your face looking better in no time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed the clean feeling after using these pads at night before bed . I have adult / hormonal acne (some cystic) which is hard to avoid and harder to clear up . I generally don't look at pads for my issue but I have to say I really think they helped calm and get rid of my breakouts faster then my normal routine and without over drying my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product works okay enough but their is a very strong odor to them. I wouldn't say they are the greatest at treating acne and because of the very strong smell to them am not sure I would buy them again. They come in a great container that's very portable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I suffer from acne still at the ripe old age of 36! While I don't agree with the 24 hrs of acne being gone as it took about 3 days to completely rid one I had, I have noticed a big difference in the acne that I do get! It takes a little bit of using it for it to work it's magic but it is great! Just don't count on your acne being gone in 24 hours [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely painful acne so I didnt really come in with high Hope's of it working for me because even proactiv doesnt. While this did not make it go away or anything it did however help it not get as bad and as painful as past experiences. I'll continue to buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So easy to use my grandson used one pad in the morning and one at night. I have wasted so much money on products that don't work, I can see a 50 percent difference in his face in one week. You have a new customer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I used this once a day for the first week on my pimples. It worked ok. It was not a fast result. Redness did go away after a day but bump was still there for a couple days. The next week i used it twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the night and it worked better. Redness disappeared quicker and bump went down faster. I liked that it was easy to use. The tube its in is simple and its easy to carry in my purse. I would use again if i had a really stubborn pimple that needed help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Clearasil Rapid Rescue for a few weeks now and I can say it has made an improvement to the texture of my skin as well as helped to clear up acne faster. It has a nice gritty texture that feels so good to help scrub away dead skin and clear out my pores. It washes off nicely and does not leave an oily residue after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Finally a good acne product that gets the job done. As soon as I used it on bad pimple within hours about 4 the pimple dryer out and cleared up. Medicine takes the redness and gets rid of the pimples fast [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't sure about this product at first because we've all tried products like this that just don't have the results that they say they do. However I can honestly say that after using this for my husband and daughter that it worked very well for both of them. We could see noticeable changes just as stated on the package. I wasn't aware that this product was out there until I received the email about it. It's easy to apply and works well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was great to not only clean your face, but also just clean areas you want to address. When there is a small flare-up, you don't have to use a lot of product, simply wipe it with a pad. It was easy and convenient to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My teenage son has been using this product for 3 days so far. I noticed a little difference. His acne don't look as red as it would before. He's had no bad side effects. He will be continuing using this product. Overall I think it's a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My two teenage daughters and I all use this product. For me, a small blemish every now and then, but my girls, mush more frequently. It is made an amazing difference in my youngest daughter's appearance. She's so happy now, being able to clear up blemishes before they become a major ""flaw"".. I am very pleased. It works like it says, which is hard to find [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of clearasil rapid rescue acne spot treatment cream to home test and review. First off It doesn't work in ""four hours"". You have to start using it two to three times a day before actual results are visible. We've been using it for over a week now and it is showing some results. in my opinion this is a good product it you stick with it and stay strict with it. All in all, I would definitely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as a sample and both my son (severe acne) and I (occasional breakouts) gave it a try. My face felt clean after using them. They smell terrible. I didn't notice a difference between them and other brands that I've used in the past. My son felt like they made a difference for him, so I let him have them. He also complained of the smell. Overall, probably worth it if you have significant breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
These pads are fantastic. They work quickly - I saw results within a day or overnight. They are a nice size - easy to handle. They have enough solution on them to cover your entire face and neck with plenty left over. A great thing is there is no burn or stinging feeling. They leave your face feeling refreshed. Pimples seem to disappear and you are left with smooth refreshed skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Clearasil Rapid Rescue Deep Treatment wash is thick and goes on smoothly on the face. It does not sting or cause any irritation to the face. I do have to say that it helped dry out the pimples I had on my chin but it did not over dry my face. I skin was still soft and moisturized. It does not prevent other pimples from coming out but it does help to remove them. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my clearasil from viewpoints.I had been using other brand acne cleansers but the either dried my skin out or irritated it.This did an okay job.It kinda dried my skin a little but not so much that it flakes and peels.I has help to clear up and stop the breakouts as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have very dry skin with a little bit of acne on my chin. It doesn't seem to clear it up and makes my chin peel a little bit. It has a pleasant fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My 14 year old daughter used this for the first time, & daily for a couple weeks. She had a little acne breakout & harder time clearing it up this time. She really loved using it (she's pretty picky too). She said she liked how clean her face felt & it did not irritate or burn her skin. Little by little it started helping clear hee skin up. About 7 days. We are familiar with Clearasil but weren't aware of the Rapid Rescue 12 Hour line. I would definitely buy it again & recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not realize that Clearasil had a Rapid Spot Treatment. We have always used Clearasil for breakouts and for my teenager as a cleanser. I have a pimple that pops up with hormonal changes and it usually takes about 4-5 days to disappear. Used this treatment and it was almost gone overnight. Goes on and feels a bit tingly that goes away. It also doesn't dry out the area around the pimple, which I like. My teenager used it a few times and was impressed with the effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really impressed by the way that this Clearasil Rapid Rescue Deep Treatment Cleansing Pads worked to control breakouts but also to help with breakouts that were already present on my skin. After only using this product a few times I noticed a big difference in my skin and how it looked and felt. It is also gentle and doesn't burn or dry your skin out. This product works amazing and would definitely recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has been a God-send for my daughter who struggles with acne. There was a significantly noticeable difference the next day after one use on her troublesome acne.

"If you're looking for healthier, clearer skin, then this is your product. I love the way it fizzes when I apply it. Doesn't burn or irritate the skin. I simply love this ! I have very oily skin, and I constantly have breakouts. It reduced the size and irritation of my pimples very fast. Will recommend to everyone, and I will definitely be buying more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have a 14 year old son and his face had started breaking out bad. I had bought lots of different products but none actually cleared it up.

"When I had received the product I was super excited because I was experiencing a pop up blemish the same day it came! I instantly used the product in hopes that it would help reduce the red lump on my face but unfortunately it had no effect. I continued to use the product for about 4 days, I personally wouldn't purchase the item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually only break out before my period which happened to be when I received this product to try and review. I tried it for 5 straight days. I didn't see any results after the entire 5 days let alone seeing any sort of results in 4 hours like they suggest on the packaging. I also didn't think it absorbed very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I definitely liked this acne spot treatment. It works well without drying out my skin too bad like some other spot treatments can. I would definitely reccomend for anyone looking for a good spot treatment. Now I did not notice much of a difference after 4 hours like the box claims, but it worked decently over night. It made some of my acne less noticeable, but it was still there. Overall, it was a good product and I will be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this for the first time. I just had acne so it was perfect timing to use this. I get acne due to hormon changes. I was hoping it would work as it says that start to see result as early as 4 hours, but it didn't. After 12 hours, still didn't work. It started to get better after a few days. And also it dried my skin too. I may or may not recommend this product. Maybe good product for someone with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had a painful zit below the surface of the skin in the crease of my nose. I applied this cream in the evening and by morning it had came to a head. By the afternoon the swelling and redness had gone down. I was shocked at have fast it worked and in only one application! Definitely worth the purchase if you have troubled skin.

"I had a really big, underground pimple growing on my chin. I could tell it was gonna be hard to deal with but i put a thin layer on it amd went to bed. In the morning it was reduced by at least 50%. In 2 days it was completely gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have to be honest, I've never really thought that this product will work very well, but I was suprised. This cream effectively halts the progression of any pimples and starts the reversal process within the first 4-6 hours. Apply this overnight and you will most always see a major difference in the size and redness of pimples. I don't have really bad acne, but when I have a small breakout, this helps control it almost immediately [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3 of my teenagers were very eager to try this. All have acne and we've had no luck with alot of other products. There was definitely noticeable results in less than 4 hours.

"I don't know how I have lived so long without this product. I had a huge spot that appeared on my chin. I got this in the mail the same day. I followed the directions as stated and waited. Within an hour, the redness and swelling were gone, by the next day there wasn't a spot at all! I wish they wuld have had this when I was a teenager. Would have saved me from a lot of teasing in high school. I would buy this product again in a heart beat! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've never written a review before, but I felt compelled to, because I've been using Clearasil Hydro Blast for years and I really like the product. This new product, with an awkward name is more like a cream, then a wash. It doesn't foam or feel like you're washing your face, it just smears. It also doesn't feel like it is washing off as well. It doesn't give you the same feeling that Hydro Blast did, where you feel refreshed after washing. I am disappointed with this product and now have to look for a Hydro Blast replacement."
"I started using this product a few months ago, and I cannot live without it!! I only wish it came in a much larger package as I run out very quickly. It works great though when used everyday!"
I bought this today used it after my clearasil 12hr face scrub and i put it on my big red acne bump and it has been about 1hr later and my big red acne bumps have gonne flat its amazing...

"When I first started getting acne, I used these. They started working within 5 days. I have noticeably clear skin and results. I also got comments on how clear my skin looked. I would purchase again!!"
The results of these pads are amazing!! My large pimples swell down after one pad over night and I hardly have any acne anymore! I would definately reccomend this product.
This product is terrible! Didn't clear up my breakout in 4 days much less 4 hours It did however dry out my skin out and caused red blotches everywhere! Needless to say I was very disappointed with this so called RAPID rescue cream.... Most certainly wouldn't recommend this product for anyone
I don't have bad acne just use it when I do break out works quicky
"I've used this for 2 years to help my occasional zits. It really works!! Once I see a zit I apply this product. For me, It takes about 2 days of applying this twice a day to see a noticeable difference in the size and color of the zit. I don't recommend applying this to a breakout, because it's been known to make mine worse, but it definitely works like a charm on a zit or pimple!!"
Left a clear and soft face... more than what I expected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
