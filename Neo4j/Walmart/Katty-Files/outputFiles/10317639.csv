This is my favorite for when those little but super painful hair line skin cracks that happen from dry air and my hands being in water too much without gloves. It's more for the healing process of already cracked skin as opposed to keeping it from getting cracks. Hope this makes sense...
"I like it. My feet are dry, crack, itch and peel, it really helped the itch on my heel within 5 minutes. I thought I was getting a 3pk offer that's why I ordered Creamy Daytime Creme but it was a misprint by Walmart. This works well so I may not buy the foot creme"
PERFECT FOR WEATHERED DRY CRACKED SKIN ON FINGERS! We have purchased this product in the past and hope to again in the future should the need arise.
This really helps my husband's hands when they are dry and cracked opened.
Several firends and family members are now using this product. I works so quickly on your feet you will be amazed. I also used it on my hands at night and placed cotton gloves on. My hands looked remarkable!
If I use other lotions I have to use a lot and my hands are still dry. Zim's Crack Creme works so much better. Thick and creamy and not greasy. I would not be without it. My hands are so soft.
"It is the only hand lotion that seems to work for me, without irritating my skin. It stinks, but that only helps, my wife and kids leave my Zim's alone!"
"For the amount I paid and size of the lotion container, it was a little pricey. The smell on this particular lotion isn't very pleasing. BUT, saying that I do have other Zims Crack Creme that I know works and I love. I haven't had the time to say if this particular one will be good for my cuticles or not, time will tell.."
