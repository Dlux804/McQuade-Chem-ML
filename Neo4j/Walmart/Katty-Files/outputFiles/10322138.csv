I've been using this every morning on my face for 16 years since my Dermatologist recommended it when I turned 60 and moved to sunny AZ. I've prevented sunburns and kept face skin supple even though I'm actively outside a lot. It doesn't give my skin that icky feeling that most lotions do. I don't know it's there. I hope it is still available for another 16+ years!
"This lotion is amazing, it goes on smoothly and makes the skin feel soft and supple. It gives the skin a glow of younger looking skin. I love that it has a very mild scent which is just right for the face. I use it on my neck and upper chest as well. I've been using this product for about 5 years and I absolutely love it!"
"Love this lotion, now there im close to the 30s im starting taking more care of my skin and this has been soo good so far I use to use the pink presentation of this lotion and I love both. Definitely recommend this lotion more ir@you want to prevent the age sings"
"I have used this product for years. I love that it makes my skin soft and supple. The spf that is in it makes my morning routine alittle quicker, not having to use both a moisturizer and a sunscreen. M daughters also use this and other Olay products."
Ive used this for many years ! My go to face moisturizer ! It works well and isnt greasy on your face ! Its a good value for the money and I always get lots of compliments on my skin !
"I love the moisturizing capability of this lotion, its not heavy, and my face stays moisturized for the whole day. However, the fragrance, while pleasant,is too strong, and I can still smell the lotion 4 hours later...very off putting. Would love a fragrance free option."
Love using this lotion. Soaks in quickly and no greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
great product but expense for the quantity. four star because of the price [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this facial cream! Makes my skin so soft without feeling weighed down. Gentle yet effective. I would highly reccomened it to anyone concerned about facial aging. Great size package for the money. Will continue to use day in and day out.
"This was horrible! I've used oil of olay for so many years, so i decided to try the age defiant one. It dried my whole face out after 3 days! I have the whole bottle and i cant use it!"
I really like this lotion. It feels smooth without feeling heavy or greasy. I put it on every morning and like that it has sunscreen to help protect my skin as well. Great product!
I found that this product was not my favorite because I thought it would be really cool to have a lotion/moisturizer and sunscreen in one but the sun screen was to overpowering and didnt really protect me from the sun. Overall this product was not my favorite and do not recommend this product.
I've purchased this in the past & have never had any complaints. It's a great product. The moisturizer is light & doesn't feel greasy. The only complaint is that the entire line of Olay products are pricier than some unless you are able to get coupons & sales.
This has been a old fav of mine and I will always use this.. I use a lot of age defying lotions and this will always be a classic fav of mine. My mother used this for 40yrs and she is almost 60 now and looks amazing so I want to follow in her footsteps and use this amazing brand that will hopefully keep me looking youthful.
"My go too face lotion, it is the only lotion on the market that doesn't break my face out when I use it. It leaves it smooth but not oily. Prefect for someone with combination skin like myself. Added bonus is it has spf 15 in it to protect from the sun uv ray"
I absolutely love this lotion it made my skin feel very hydrated I didn't leave my faces feeling sticky at all. I also like how this product has SPF in it. I Love how The packaging is very simple and easy to use. I would recommend this to people that love their face feeling hydrated.
My grandma has sworn by this all of her life and has almost no wrinkles at the age of 70 so i use it at night as well. I do have oily skin so i can't really use it as a day moisturizer but it is a great night moisturizer for me or when my skin is dry to use during the day. You can't beat the quality for the price point.
"I really like this product. My skin usually gets pretty dry, especially during the winter months on the East Coast, so the hydrating aspect of this is great. Also I have pretty sensitive skin, and that means that I have to be careful with what I use."
"Best product in the whole world! I wont go outside without putting this lotion all over my face!! It is just so smooth and my skin thanks me every time I put this on, it does not leave my skin oily even thought it has sunscreen and I love that the fragrance, because is not strong at all and it has a very fresh smell."
The same facial cream especially suitable for dryer skin. An expensive yet a good product for wrinkles around the eyes and lower neck. But changes don't occur really soon. Packaging is great and it feels heavy. I would recommend this as a night cream.
"Great consistency, doesn't leave residue. Helps keep my skin smooth and without wrinkles. It also seems to work as sunblock too! Smells great. Super light compared to others I've tried. Would definitely buy again and again. huge fan. I recommend it to everyone"
"I love Olay products, and nothing beats having this classic lotion on hand. I really like that the daily sunscreen I need is already in the lightweight lotion, and it didn't leave my skin greasy. This is a staple in my daily routine and I am happy to recommend it to everyone!"
Good product in my opinion. The smell reminded me of something someone older would wear but the lotion itself is amazing! I put it on before bed because of the smell but waking up my skin is always so soft and looks hydrated. It's not too expensive either. I would definitely recommend this product to others.
I love this lotion for day time use only. I use it before applying my makeup. It's not too oily. I wish it had a more creamy substance because it's very thin when applied. Not heavy. I get dry skin and it would help me personally if it was a bit on the thicker side.
"I love Olay! It's one of those brands that have been passed down. I was exposed to this brand when I was a kid from my mom and her mom actually used this too. It's super classic, and it works! I love it and I use this daily in the mornings because it does have SPF in it. I just wish it had more than SPF in it"
"Smells like original Olay works so good and very effective , repeat user always will buy again never disappointed, package is always great with any Olay products , it does exactly what it says it does and doesn't disappoint deffinitly recommend it to others"
"Olay Age Defying Classic Protective Renewal Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15. My skin is very dry and this product keeps my face nice and soft and hydrated. I have used this product since it came out. When you find a product that works, why change it. Give it a try, you'll be glad you did."
What a great product this is and has been around for a long time! This Olay Age Defying Classic Protective Renewal Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 keeps my face soft and smooth. Their is a light scent and it is very gentle on my skin with no irritation..
"Love this product! This is my go to day cream in the summer because it's so light on my skin, but has all the anti aging benefits. I'm a repeat user of Olay in general because I love their products. The packaging is nice and the product smells great! I'll definitely use again ⭐️"
"The best simple moisturizer I've used. No strong sunscreen smell, very light, and decently moisturizing. Can get a little greasy on its own, but I use it with an acne serum and it stays fairly matte. Hydration lasts all day and I never get flakey or dry when I put this on in the morning."
Great quality skin-firming daily moisturizer at a great price point! This moisturizer keeps my face feeling hydrated and smooth all day and the spf adds protection without feeling heavy or greasy like some spf moisturizers tend to do. This moisturizer feels light and soaks in your skin so nicely. I've definitely noticed a difference in firmness and it's made my skin so much smoother with daily use. Highly recommend this moisturizer!
"This is a good lotion for any type of skin. But it has a really runny consistency, It is a reasonable price for the size of the product. Over all it blends really well, but it personally leaves my dry skin looking oily for the majority of the day. So no, I will not be purchasing this product again even though I have been using this product for a couple years now, it did the job then but certainly not now."
"I really like this Olay moisturizer, especially this time of the year. My skin tends to dry out with certain moisturizers but this one keeps my skin moist all day. Plus, I'm glad that it has sunscreen in it. Our skin really needs protection from the sun."
Bused for 30+ years love it
Bought is as a ift for my mother. she loved it and the price was just right
Been using this item for over 20 yrs!
This is added to one of my staple products I buy.
"I have been using this product for about two years. I had used other more expensive moisturizers under makeup, and they were not satisfactory. The other moisturizers would curdle or become bumpy under makeup. This Olay moisturizer provides the perfect base for a smooth finish."
I like using olay to moisturize. I am 45 years old and am very happy with the lack of wrinkles I have. I like the price of Olay.
I'm not old but it still moisturises and nourished my skin. Would be great as well for older people. Would recommend.
Good daily go to. Not too thick or nonabsorbant. Definitely not the best I've ever used but perfect for the price point!
This has been a staple in my routine since I was a little girl. I say it's a great price it's light weight its truly a great product. It is perfect under makeup as well it is very gentle and is perfect for sensitive skin.
I swear by this stuff. My mom and grandma also use this daily and they both have super soft lovely faces. This is the only stuff they ever use. I have been using it daily as well and my face feels great.
"I only had the opportunity to try this product twice as I had forgotten my moisturizer and was borrowing my sisters while at her house. It felt great though, lightweight and easily absorbent!"
I was not happy with the overall feel of this age defying. I thought since their foundation was so creamy this would be. It felt more like a drug store thin lotion
Really good face moisturizer. It has spf 15 which is nice for running errands and you will be out in the sun for short period of times. Really soaks nicely into the skin. Dont know if it is making me look younger but my skin loves it
This has always been a go-to moisturizer for me. Its a very good moisturizer & has always been a reliable product. I love anything that is Olay. Not only is it a great product but the price is very affordable. I would recommend this to anyone!!
This product works wonders. I put it on every day and it leaves my skin feeling very healthy and I could layer my make up on top as if theres nothing underneath. I would definitely recommend this product.
I have been using this product for years. Idk about the anti aging effects but it is a lovely moisturizer that does not break me out or irritate my skin. And for the price it is a great deal
Love this product. It doesn't make my skin break out and it is great moisturizer. It isn't greasy and absorbs well. I have used this for years and just love it.
My mother used this when I was a kid and I use it now. I love this stuff. And the sunscreen keeps me from getting those dark spots and uneven skin tone on my face from sun exposure. I love this stuff!
"Olay Classic lotion is a good lotion. It's not that good for women that are older and need help with dryness. It doesn't seem to penetrate the skin, it just kind of sits on there."
Alot comes in the bottle so it last longer. The price is good and it makes my fine lines seem to disappear. It is effective and will not disappoint you at all. I buy it in stores
The Olay Age Defying renewal lotion with sunscreen is great to use in the summertime. I am very fair complected and burn easy. The SPF15 is great for every day. It keeps me from getting burned when i go outside.
This product works so well. But when you use it only use a little bit at a time. This product is so gentle for soft skin. I am a repeated user of this product for sure. Yes I only have to re buy it like once every 4 months.
My go to daily moisturizer. It's not heavy on the skin and doesn't make me breakout. My skin is really sensitive but I can use this as much as I want without irritation.
"Product does what it says it will, protects from the sun. It is lightweight and does not feel too heavy under make up. I like that it doesn't have a strong sun screen smell like some products do. Would like to see spf 20 in the future."
I've used this lotion for years and it keeps my face fresh and feeling clean and clear. It's easy to apply and doesn't leave and oily residue. Definitely buying again!
I really feel like this protects my skin in addition to feels good and non-greasy on my skin. A little pricy and feels like I probably could find something similar for less. I am not sure if I would purchase again however.
The standby light moisturizer. It's no frills and not advanced like a lot of skin care but is a good basic everyday moisturizer. Inexpensive and lightweight.
This was a good basic sunscreen. I can't really speak on it's anti aging properties because that wasn't the reason why I bought it. It works well as a sunscreen though.
It's a good standard moisturizer but defiantly doesn't not work as long or leave skin as moisturizer as higher end department store moisturizers in my opinion.
Olays renewel lotion is a great way to freshen your skin through out the day. I swear by olay and my mother before me. The prices are not outrageous and have great products.
"It is not the best moisturizing lotion, and the SPF is not as high as I would like it to have been. All in all it is not a terrible product I just have very high standards."
"This is my favorite lotion for my face! It's super moisturizing and has a lovely, clean scent. It's the perfect size to carry in your purse or backpack! This size also lasts forever! I feel like I get so much use out of it."
I love olay moisturizers. I have been using their product since was 16. Great product great price. I have recomended rhis to alk of my friends and family.
"its a lightweight sunscreen lotion and works amazing, I use it morning and night and is very effective and has made my skin very soft for a good value."
Amazing product matches perfectly with my skin Olay Age Defying Anti Wrinkle Eye Olay Age Defying Classic Protective Renewal LotionOlay Age Defying Instant Hydration Serum with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15Cream
"This is my go to moisturizer. It works great for my sensitive skin and it has spf so 2 in 1!! Love a multi tasking product! Product is not greasy, sinks right into skin and very hydrating."
"On the affordable side compared to higher end products. It was too heavy of a lotion for me though. However, I have sensitive skin. I won't be buying again, unless they change the formula to make it lighter."
"This is very light, slight fragrance and feel nice and smooth on my face, Perfect every time. The packaging is simple and clean looking. It meat my expectations The price is reasonable."
I am very pleased with this product. I have used this while at the beach and I have never been sunburned on my face. This lotion protects my face from the suns damaging rays.
"As someone with relatively sensitive skin, this is the perfect moisturizer. Not too heavy on the skin or too light, leaves your face feeling super hydrated and soft."
Good product doesn't cause breakouts non greasy light scented . Affordable to the average person. Its a must to use moisturizer on your face. Trust it
Are use this product for years and I was younger I just love the way it smelled. I love the way it made my skin look and feel. Now that I'm older I don't use it. But I would recommend it to someone who wanted a light moisturizer.
I use this especially in the summer time. It is not fragrant. Met my expecations does what it says and protects from sun. Packaging is great in a little bottle. Its not pricey.
My grandma used this stuff forever!!! I always thought it was old lady lotion lol. I since have used it and love it! The smell is light and it moisturizes very nicely. I would recommend and rebuy over and over
I Am An Olay fan! So im Always grabbing something of Olay when im out & about and i Honestly loved this product! The smell was Great & its very Affordable. I will buy again when i am running low!
"A good lightweight moisturizer for daily use. I use a pea sized amount at a time and a bottle lasts me a year or 2. Cheap. I swear my Olay, just like my great grandma."
"This moisturizer was a classic from my teenage years. This is what my mom used, and was the first moisturizer she bought me. It has a delicate feminine fragrance and lightweight feel. I wouldn't purchase this again, but it does bring back memories."
I have used Olay since I was a teen and am now 49! It isn't heavily fragrant and I have very sensitive dry skin and it always quenches it and feels fresh and clean
I tried this Olay product it's not quite as heavy as the one that comes in the red bottle but I prefer the one in the red bottle seem to work a little bit better but it still is a good product.
I have used this for years! I have tried others but keep coming back to Olay. I love it has sunscreen built in. Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin with Vitamin E & Aloe Vera
This is the only moisturizer I use hands down. It keeps my face oil free. It drys fast so I can immediately put my primer and makeup on. It has spf in it so protects me from.getting sun burnt I love it
A little expensive for my budget. However left my skin nice and smooth and I did notice it helped my skin. The bottle is very easy to hold and the cream doesn't really get stuck.
I find Olay to be pretty good with my skin. My skin is very dry so sometimes it's not quite enough moisture for me. I find it to be gentle in my face and is a great value.
Love how it makes my face feel while having spf protection from the sun. It's really gentle on my sensitive skin. Price is decent. It has met my needs for face care. I would definitely buy this again
I love the classic version of Olay. Add in anti-aging properties and it's a power house. I was first introduced to Olay by my cousin when I was 8 years old. She was so beautiful and I loved how soft her skin was.
"I've used this product for years, it keeps my skin soft and hydrated, and has spf so he keeps my skin protected. I also use it a a base for my makeup, it's an OG holy grail product for me."
Been using this brand since 1998. Gives a great glow and moisture your skin. Great scent and it's very light weight. This particular kind give you a youthful firmness.
My mom has been using this since the 90s and now it's one of my favorite moisturizers. It's a good balance of not being a runny consistency but also not too thick. It's a great morning moisturizer to put on a little bit before makeup
I love this renewal lotion from Olay! It's one of the only creams that make my skin feel hydrated and have a healthy glow to it. It's a little pricey but worth the buy! The only go to cream I keep getting.
"Such a classic product. I use this when I run out of my other fave lotion. It smells good, does the job, and contains spf which is always a plus! My olay back up bottle always comes in handy for the times I need it!"
Always a quality product I use and trust since I was eighteen. It has a pleasant clean fragrance and keeps my face and neck soft and young looking wirth the money
I really like this face lotion i use it every morning after i was my face then i let it dry for a little bit and then i apply my makeup. I think its such a good face lotion and the quality is great and the size is good for the price .
Love this product. Not only does it moisturize but it protects from UV rays. It's gentle on the skin and is not expensive. I have bought this numerous times and will buy again and again. Would definitely recommend this product.
I use this product daily and it's really really great. An affordable price for a nice brand. It's nicely hydrating with spf which I love. It's super important to protect your skin from the sun and this does that and more!
"This lotion is pretty average. It feels like stays on for a while and sometimes leaves a residue which I dont like, but it does leave my face feeling very moisturized in the end. i would suggest to others if no better products were around"
Inexpensive face lotion that is gentle and not too heavy. I use it twice a day and for the price it's a great value! I've been using it two years now .
"I remember my grandmother using Olay way back when and swore by it. I tried this and absolutely love it. This makes my skin smooth, not oily and can see a difference."
not oily and works very well with my skin type--reasonable price
love this lotion it makes my face feel young again.
This is a perfect base lotion for your face. Not too oily but totally moisturizing before makeup
I love this cream because it has a very light scent that isnt overpowering and disks right in to the skin without being greasy!
This product is wonderful! I use it in the mornings and at night. It has become one of my MUST HAVES! I Recommend it to everyone that I know.
I have used this in the past and dislike the way is smells. It's good for the prince it does leave my skins smooth and it packaged nicely.
I really liked this product! It is really light and has a great scent to it. It fees really smooth and left my skin really hydrated.
I use this as a basic daily face lotion. It��s light weight. The thing that I like the most is that it has some sunscreen in it.
I've been using this product for many years. I absolutely love it. It has a clean scent and doesn't leave your face greasy.
I really like this for everyday. I would give it 5 stars but not a fan of the smell. I have dry skin and it helps.
My all-time fave facial lotion. Price is great and it can easily be found everywhere. Better or equal to more expensive products.
It's a very light moisturizer so it's perfect for sensitive skin. Doesn't feel too heavy on my face but still gets the job done moisturizing.
Your basic renewal lotion with a good history - reminds me of what my grandma used. Easy to get out. The added sun protection was a bonus
It didn't work. It was a gross texture. It didn't do anything. It was watery and weird. I threw it away.
"This cream is decent, didn really work the best with my skin as for the moisturizing feature so I tend not to use it that often."
"I like this cause it has spf. Its Reasonably priced, and it works great. Keeps face moisturized and supple"
Nice cream with had spf 15 in it which is a bonus cream absorbed nicely didn't leave my face feeling oily or greasy
Just Lucian is the best friend you'll lotion with sunscreen it's protect my skin from the sun action you can use it you would love it like me
Have used for several years. Makes skin soft and protects well against sun damage. Will continue to use.
"Nice and does not feel like it leaves a residue, price is not terrible but it does feel like it leaves my face a tad greasy"
This lotion is a great moisturizer for any age group!! I love how it leaves the skin moisturized but does not leave an oily residue!
Love this olay product i use it all the time before I put my makeup on it doesn't leave no greasiness
"Daily use, for night and day, I have no preference just love the way my face feels after applying product."
Love this sunblock for everyday use. I use it on my tattoo everyday to keep it from the sun fading it.
I use this product on a day to day basis since I mostly dont wear makeup. It makes your face look refreshed and doesn't cause extreme breakouts.
I've have been using this for years and it's help keep my skin youthful. I'm 48. It's has SPF and is great all year long
Love this light moisturizer. Great for oily skin too. I would use this over & over again in my 20-30s
Kind of leaves my face a little greasy. But love the age defying pArt of it. Would probably try something a little different next time.
This smells amazing and is great to put on your skin every day. It has age defying properties in it. Helps with wrinkles and fine lines.
I have been using this for the past 10 years. Does amazing things for my skin. Only complaint is it has a funny smell.
I have been using this cream for use. I love it. It smells great and leaves me skin feeling smooth. Definitely recommend
im not a fan of the smell but i definitely see a positive difference in the look and feel of my skin. worth a try.
"Very moisturizing and refreshing to the skin, smooth application. Met expectations and would highly recommend to others"
"My first moisturizer and I still use it, it's not too heavy for my combination skin and doesn't make me break out."
I use this occasionally but it does have a light floral scent and it's not my favorite- but it has an SPF and isn't super greasy
Keeps my face mouisturized. Has a light feeling that's non greasy. In the winter my face gets dry and I use this to help my face feel smooth.
"This is a good product, it leaves my skin supple and gets tacky so that when I apply my primer it applies smoothly"
Keeps skin smooth and soft. Keeps skin hydrated all day. Great value for your money. Used it regularly
"I have a combination skin, and i use this as daily creamer. I can honestly said it works so good!... you need to try this!!!"
Makes your skin feel refresh smooth like baby skin i recommend it to any one all skin types this is my favorite by far
Moisturizing and smells Good! I've been using these products with my mom since I was little!!!!!!!!!!
loved this product its OFTEN my first age defying product to pick up off my shelf. I like that it didn't leave my dry skin with an oily feel.
I like that it has spf. Has a nice scent and it's not heavy or oily on my skin. I can't really tell if it really is age defying but I like it.
Simple and classic. It smells clean and makes my skin feel so soft. I like the way it never feels greasy when I apply it.
This literally is the best age defying facial moisturizer out there. It is reasonably priced and the effects are great. Just use it!
"I absolutely love this location, I normally wash my face and then apply in the morning because it also has sunscreen in it."
I use this every single day. It's an absolute staple item and I do not know what I would do without it in my makeup bag!
"I love this moisturizer! It has a subtle scent and it doesnt irritate my sensitive skin. This is such a nice moisturizer, I cant live without it!"
Love this wonderful product! Makes my day so much easier and makes me feel great. Nicely packaged too.
This was an odd product for me. It made my skin oily yet left it dry and flakey. I didn't finish the bottle and switched to something else.
I love this product. I have used Oil of Olay for many years and I wouldn't think of using anything else. It keeps my skin moisturizer and healthy and I think it keeps me looking young
I love this product. My skin is sensitive and I don't break out from this lotion. My main concern is Parabens. This lotion does NOT have it in it. I feel a bit safer.
"I like to use this renewal lotion with sunscreen. I think that it is gentle on my face, but this is a new product for me and I will have to see how I feel about it as I continue to use it. So far, it does meet my expectations. For now, I don't see where there is any room for improvement."
This moisturizer is very light in texture and moisture. I did not feel like the sunscreen clogged my pores. I didn't notice an intense difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. I used it up and it was fine but I do think there are better moisturizers out there.
"I love this product because it is oil-free, SPF, it exfoliates dry skin and oily dry sebum in acne prone skin and moisturizes! I hope they never remove this from the market and I think that they should promote it more. I tell everyone about it. I tell people with acne or dry skin about it. I works for anyone!"
"I have silver hair, and using Zinc Oxide rather than avobenzone keeps the moisturizer from staining my hair (and the collar of white clothes)! Sounds silly for a review, but it really is a big deal as its very hard to find products with zink oxide, as they are the only products that won't leave my hair orange - which is so unsightly. Thank you for the wise decision. I still miss my Olay from the 70's, but the Classic version is a step in right direction on how it feels on my face ."
"I love this product because it is oil-free, SPF, it exfoliates dry skin and oily dry sebum in acne prone skin and moisturizes! I hope they never remove this from the market and I think that they should promote it more. I tell everyone about it. I tell people with acne or dry skin about it. I works for anyone!"
"I depend on this, it's a miracle worker. It feels like your skin is getting soaked with moisture when you apply it. Helps fix aging skin too, the beta hydroxys do not irritate my super sensitive skin at all, and the spf is appreciated. Please do not phase this formula out because I don't know what I would do without it. (Looking epic at 50 thanks to Olay)"
"Facial skin feels soft & light without the heaviness of other moisturizers. I am pleased with the results of the Olay products since I was 21 years old, I am now 59. I upgrade to the next moisturizer within my age group, Olay has taken excellent care of my facial skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this since my childhood and this has been my personal favourite. Very nourishing.
Oil of Olay products are wonderful! I've been using oil of Olay since I was a teenager!
This is my day to day lotion! It's so great and light weight! And I love that it has SPF
"This lotion is very hydrating, it smells good and it has sunscreen so it protects from the sun too"
Not impressed. Nothing special. I've used better brands. Overall an okay product. :')
I enjoy using this product at night time before bed it really makes me feel hydrated in the morning
Love this product. I'm 18 and use it. You can never prevent aging to soon! Inexpensive and worth it
"By far the best sunscreen/moisturizer I've used, EVER!! Soaks in and feels soft and amazing. Not greasy at all!!"
"Olay Age Defying facial lotion has been in my morning routine for years! It's an affordable option that is exceptionally effective in keeping your skin healthy. It's been an important part of my daily routine, so I highly recommend it to anyone!"
"Love!! It's definitely my favorite moisturizer. Very light and airy, great for under makeup as well. Doesn't make me break out all all, even if I put it on before working out."
This stuff is amazing!! It feels great when it's going into your skin. It doesn't burn. And I have sensitive skin and it doesn't make me break out so I have continued to use it
I use this as my daily moisturizer. I have normal skin and I love that this doesn't leave me feeling oily. My makeup still goes on great and it's never left me feeling dry. It's affordable and smells fresh and clean.
"A like the feeling why I applied this product, but it tends to be too oily for my skin type I cannot use it for too many days in a role. It meets my expectations and protect my skin from the sun as well"
Love this product. Been using this brand and product for years and it works so well for my skin. So soft and smooth. Alittle bit oily but does smell great and can be found at almost any store and drug store.
Loved to use this before I put on my make up. It definitely exceeds my expectations and is good value for the price. Love the scent and the gentle feel of the cream. No need for improvement because you start seeing results.
Dont know about it age defying property as i used it in my mid 20s but yes this was also one of olay product which suit my skin and i used it for a good long time and i liked it
"I used to love Olay but I've been steering away for more natural products. I don't feel as though they do as much as they claim. After years of use, I don't notice the difference in my skin that it claims to have."
I use this under my primer for added moisture and it works wonders. I have super dry skin and choose to wear makeup everyday so this is a great hydrator.
"This product is part of my everyday routine, I think Olay have a really good formula, they are affordable and provide a range of products with different benefits for the skin, I like the firm and lift products especially."
I like putting this on before I apply my make up. It's not oily and I know my skin is getting the SPF it needs when I'm out and about. The price is good and it last a good while.
"I love this moisturizer! It is perfect for in the winter when my skin is dry and in need of moisture. It has spf so it protects me against harmful rays. It is a bit heavy for summer, which is why I knocked off a star."
"I have used this Classic Oil of Olay for 21 years! I love how my skin always looks great! People are always shocked at my age, because they think I'm 10 years younger than I am!"
My doctor recommended another product but my wife uses Olay and I tried it. This product worked wonders on my facial skin. It rejuvenated the skin. No more dry skin.
I've been using this product for over a decade and it works! Any time the topic of my age comes up people always say I look so much younger than I am. I'm 35 but am told I look like I'm in my late 20s. Love it and hope it never gets discontinued>
"Have used for two weeks now and I love it! This moisturizer is great for my skin type: it is light weight, quickly absorves; provides a matte finish; and helps control the shine! It looks great under my bareminerals make up too!! Thanks Olay!"
This has never failed my problematic skin. It is one of the only lotion/sunscreens that didn't break me out and seemed to improve my skin's appearance. I hope they never change the formulation or discontinue it!
I've been using this product for years. Has a very pleasant smell. Love it
Used for over 10 yrs and is a tried and true face lotion. Affordable as well.
I like using olay but this lotion really dry my skin.
I love the sunscreen in this protective renewal lotion! My face felt nice afterwards no greasy feeling!
"This is a nice, dependable product. It makes my skin soft, and does not irritate. It's great to have around."
"Gets the job done, simple and keeps my skin hydrated without feeling greasy. Very light moisturizer. Packaging is very simple and easy to use."
"I have sensitive skin, so I use this every other day. I can definitely tell when I dont use it because my skin feels so dry."
Love this product and use it as my go to. I apply it every day. The only thing I would change is a higher SPF.
Very moisturizing lotion to use after I get out of the shower. And I use it before I apply my primer when I do my makeup.
Love this product. Use only a small pinch for my whole face. Use it everday love it would not leave without it. !!!!
For the price it was ok but I didn't see the results that I was hoping for. Would use again though because it showed a small difference.
"I love it. Im a big fan of Olay , and have been for a while. This was by far the best ten dollars I ever spent. #contest"
My mother is 77 and been using this all her adult life faithfully and her face is smooth and beautiful.
Have used this for years. It is a lightweight lotion and doesn't leave my skin feeling over moisturized. I stock up whenever I see coupons.
I really enjoy using Olay but this lotion has dry my skin out. . So I will not be purchasing this again.
i find this to be pretty greasy on the skin. Olay isn't my favorite brand when it comes to skincare
I like Oil of Olay...but miss the Equate brand.
