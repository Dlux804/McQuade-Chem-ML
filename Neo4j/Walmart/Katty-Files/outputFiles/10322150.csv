I have tried many other products but Oil of Olay is the best. It is not oily or a heavy lotion & my skin looks & feels good.
Within a week i see the tiny wrinkles disapprearing from my face.
"THIS MOISTURIZER REALLY DOES WORK. MY SKIN FEELS LIKE ""SILK"" AFTER I HAVE APPLIED IT. I HAD NOT SEEN MY FRIEND FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS & WHEN SHE SAW ME, SHE SAID ""STEP BACK, I HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR FACE.. OK WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, YOUR FACE LOOKS FANTASTIC"" WELL THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED, I'M HOOKED NOW !!!! THANK YOU ""OLAY"" JUDY"
THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. MY SKIN IS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED! IT LIVES UP TO ITS PROMISES. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS I WISH IT HAD SPF ALREADY ADDED . i HAVE TO USE A SEPERATE PRODUCT WITH SUNBLOCK IN IT AS WELL. FOR THE PRICES OF THESE PRODUCTS AND THE WHOLE REGIMEN FOR THAT MATTER THERE SHOULD BE SOME SUNBLOCK ADDED . DONT GET ME WRONG THESE PRODUCTS ARE AWESOME!
It moisturizes well. I could see the difference within a couple of days. It is slightly heavy so I only use it a night.
I did not like the way it felt on my skin. I felt like I had on some sort of a skin mask. It may be OK for some people. But not for me. The moisturizer does have a creamy texture to it.
I bought it to nourish my dry skin. I live in an area where the winters are harsh and my face suffers dryness every year. After 2 weeks of using this product along with Olay Regenerating Serum I still have dry patches on my skin.
"I buy Olay Regenerist all the time from CVS and Rite Aid. This time around I purchased it from Wal Mart's online store, and when I received it, the formula was slightly different. The lotion smells like the cheaper products Olay makes. I am very disappointed and will not order from Walmart online again."
I used it for several days in a row and I felt like I was wearing a mask. And my skin felt unnatural and dry under it. My skin felt coated instead of hydrated. I will not purchased this product again.
I have been using this product daily for about a year now and it has totally changed the texture of my skin. I had a problem with large pores and had a bad wrinkle in my neck from years of sun exposure. The pores are almost gone and the discoloration and wrinkle in my neck is hard to even notice. I love this product and it's affordable. No one ever believes me when I say I'm almost 55. My skin hasn't been this nice in YEARS! I just wanted to say thanks and let others know you don't have to spend a fortune to look great.
"I rated the Olay Micro-Sculpting fragrance free a one because it did not absorb and made foundation glob. It peeled as i rubbed. This formula is much better for day use. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I does hydrate well, haven't seen all my wrinkles dissappear yet. :)"
"I started with the total effects and it worked wonders but as I got older I decided to try more intensive treatment. The Regenerist moisturizer is great. i have had people come up at work and say ""What kind of makeup if you do wear makeup do you use?"" I have been told without makeup that my skin is translucent. The scent is so fresh and the cream seems to even my skin out without foundation, If you can at all, buy this and see how long it lasts and how much good it does. I don't think you will be disappointed."
"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft, smooth and non-greasy. I like the dispenser as it puts the lotion in my palm without contaminating the unused product by touching it with my fingers. Have found that I do not need a full pump of the product because that is way too much for covering my face and neck. Anyone who has dry skin should not hesitate to give this a try."
"Very soft powdery feel. Absorbs nicely. I really like this product, it doesn't feel sticky or oily on my skin."
I have used this brand for over 15 years and I like the way it makes my skin feel and the price was fabulous compared to the price elsewhere
Just didn't have the moisture I am used too. Thought I would try this but will go back to Nutragena
Olay Total Effects Refreshing Citrus Scrub followed by the Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream Moisturizer has been my recipe for an acne-free face! Love these products and even have my teenagers on the same regimen!
"Although this product worked amazingly well, the fragrance gave me headaches and made my eyes water daily-Olay please make more fragrance-free products."
"I did not have skin this good since before high school. Although I am 69 and indeed do have wrinkles, most people comment on how young I look now that I have been using Regenerist for about 5 years."
"I have severe dry skin, especially on my forehead. This is the best hydrating cream, wrinkle reducer ever! And a very reasonable price. I've been using Olay products since for 20 years and this is the best one, yet. Thank you Oil of Olay!"
It feels great on your skin.
"My family is on a very tight budget, so spending $20 for facial cream was a big chunk out of my grocery $. But this is well worth it. My rapidly maturing skin is getting smoother. I still have my wrinkles, but they are not so pronounced. I will watch for sales & coupons, this is one product that I will keep using."
Really liked the bottle design with the push down dispensing allowing minimal or maximum amounts without any waste. The product works well.
"I've been using this product for a number of years now (I've lost count). People constantly tell me I look younger than I am, so I will continue to use it!"
"I hate to be picky, but who was responsible for the design of this product? ""Push down on top of the package to dispense product from center of package..."" Even the directions are awkward! The cream is yummy, the design I really hate!"
"It took me so long to find a moisturizer that worked well for me and I loved this product. However, this new formula has a smell that is too strong for me and feels very greasy once applied. Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this product and will have to search again for another moisturizer. Please Olay, bring back your old formula. It was so much better."
"Used to swear by this product as my daily moisturizer. I loved it because it felt thick and creamy and did a great job without being greasy or feeling heavy. However, just bought the first container of the new formula. It's terrible! It leaves a greasy feel that does not go away and makes it impossible to apply makeup, even 10 minutes after. Your skin just feels slimy to the touch, slippery. And the scent is way stronger. Please, OLAY, give us our old formula back!! I'll be purchasing something else."
"I have used expensive creams from Strivectin, Clinique, Lancome, etc. And only one worked out for me. Its the oil of Olay regengerist serum that I apply each night and every morning, follwoed by the oil of olay hydrating cream. It made my skin glow. I can feel my skin soaking up and drinking the Olay. I love the way my skin looks and how it feels! From now on, Regenterist is what i will be using."
"42 y/o! When I visit my best girlfriends (from way back...3rd grade!) I am always asked ""what are you doing for your skin? You don't have any wrinkles around your eyes?"" Proudly I say Oil of Olay Regenrist! I've used Chanel, for years and NO way did I experience any of the results as I do with OIL OF OLAY. I am now trying their PRO-X. So far, not seeing the results I am expecting. Maybe I'll stick with the one that works for me; REGENRIST."
"I slowly added products from the Oil of Olay Regenerist line to my daily regimen. My skin was dry from many years of sunbathing and the wrinkles were really showing. The Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream really softens and hydrates the skin. I did not get instant results but after consulting with Oil of Olay on-line chat, I was told to allow the product to work for about six weeks. I stayed with it and have found that this cream under my makeup creates a lovely finish. And for a fair price too!"
I'm a 56 year old female former smoker with a lot of wrinkles around my mouth and the corners of my eyes. I started using Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream years ago when I took a good look (instead of a glance) at myself for the first time in quite a while. After the first month I noticed a big difference in the appearance and texture of my face and a lot of the small wrinkles were gone. I was thrilled. I've tried other products but always go back to Olay. It works for me.
I have used this facial cream for years and nothing else I have tried even comes close to this one. Love it.
great moisturizer for day or night. I use this all the time. Highly recommend for problem skin or sensitive skin. I suffer from psoriasis and during stress outbreaks I have used this on those spots.
This product is the best ever.My skin feels so good.My skin's appearance is better.I know this is something I will definitely use every day.I also use the eye serum.Both are wonderful.Thank you Olay!
"I really like this product. I felt I should offer my two cents, because the previous review said they didn't like the container and would prefer a jar. I like that it is an airless pump, because it helps keep the ingredients stable. I wish Olay would use more airless packaging. If you want this in a jar, just use the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. It's the same product. I didn't give this 5 stars because I wish it was fragrance free. Still love how it feels though."
"This product just does not work for my combination skin. It felt great when I first put it on, but I noticed dry skin on my chin and cheeks after just a couple hours. It also made my forehead oily and shiny. For me, the micro-sculpting cream works much better."
"I can't believe how wonderful this product is. I have the driest skin in the world, nothing has really ever helped much. After one use my skin feels renewed, very silky and smooth, I feel like my face has been given a drink from the fountain of youth!!"
"I'm 45, my skin is sensitive and very dry. I use Olay Regenerist Hydration Moisturizer, the Eye repair, I use the Olay foaming face wash. I saw the difference in my skin in less than a week. I love all the products, including the body wash, and after body wash lotion. Great line of products and great prices. Thanks!"
Olay don't work for me I have overly dry skin. I haven't found anything to work on my skin. So I'm hoping to be able to find something that will work. But I'm affrid I won't be able to find anything to help my skin not be so dry. It gets so bad the I dig at my legs all the time.
"I've been using Oil of Olay since I was around 18 or 19 years old, I'm 63 now. I love all the products & I wouldn't use anything else. I have fantastic skin &, for my age, almost no wrinkles! Actually, no one ever comes close to guessing my age! I strongly recommend any and/or all the Oil of Olay products!"
"I just used this product for the first time and it is phenomenal! I have been combating dry, flaky skin due to topical acne medicine. I have been using another product that is also good - but it wasn't good enough. I read numerous reviews all over, and this came up repeatedly. I took the plunge and bought it - best decision I have made in a long time! I am enormously pleased!! Highly recommend to everyone. At $23-ish, that was a little steep for me, but it is well worth it."
I just started using this product. I am in my 50's - other products either don't agree w/my skin or aren't as hydrating. I love this - I use it in the morning and then at night I use the Olay Microsculpting Serum and Cream. I'm very happy with the Olay Regenerist line!!
My sissy gave me the product 3 yrs ago to try and am so lost with out it .i feel my skin apperence has become that of a 23-year-old. Women and i get many compliments on how young i look. 54 yrs old skin amazing and wrinkle free as far as i can see look and feel great..
"It works real good on my skin .It the best i have very oily skin and it's heard for me so i really love this.i will tell any and every one to try any of this.My mom,sister and everyone in my family love's it we been for years and we will always use it ."
Love the feel n results in one day. I did recomendable to my mom n we both use it daily. I also us under eye products and i am amazed on how effective it is. I shared this with my 18 year old son cause he has dark circles due to allergies. At first he thought it wouldnt work. To his suprise after a 72 hours woohooo it started working. I am very happy to be a loyal olay customer. Completely satisfied on my end. Thank you very much for asking.

You can wear without makeup or with. Make it a serious part of your cleaning routine.Fresh faced. Smooths application of makeup
I would recommend this product to those who don't have the money to spend on expensive lotions & daily facial products. As we all know older we get we start showing signs of our real age. Olay has products for your every day concerns and cares. I've used Olay products off & on for years.
"The touch, the feel, the amazing softness on my hard weathered skin. This is an Important part of keeping my beautiful, soft, radiant skin looking so fresh and young. There's nothing like a full body rub down after a hard day of pouring concrete and being beaten off by the sun all day. This is truly a most wonderful product I couldn't finish without it."
"Olay products is really great..it makes my skin supple and whitens for just 8 weeks..I was maintaining this product to make my skin more radiant and flawlessly to look..thank-you I found play,I love it.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love to use the deep hydration especially in the morning before applying my foundation. My skin stays moist all day long and I don't have to reapply the moisturizer or foundation all day. Love the Regenerist line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product, it works perfectly on my skin, and was smoother than a week. This product makes my skin feel young and fresh because it opens up my pores and allows my skin to breathe with some sort of comfort. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this both in the morning and at night. It is super creamy and disappears right into your skin, leaving it very soft. I apply my makeup right over it to ego the new day. I have been using this product since it was first introduced and feel that it has helped my skin age kindly. I recommend that you try it soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay products most of my adult life. I occasionally try other products but always come back to Olay. I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydration and the serum for the past five years depending on the season. Most of the year I use Deep Hydration. At almost 50 years old, people say I look like I am in my 30's. I beleive the Olay products play a big part in this. I will use Olay forever!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very dry skin and do to my age i have wrinkles. Regenerist deep hydration cream makes my face feel soft it also relaxes the deep wrinkles. I love this product I put it on at night and daytime under my makeup. I highly recommend this product.When you start using it and you see the results you will not purchase anything else. Your face will glow!!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is a really good product. It feels light on my skin & immediately feels like it's hydrating my skin. I recently turned 60, and many of the people I have told my age to insist that I look like I'm 45! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used these products for years. My skin looks great. Although I find that sometimes I get a white residue on my face. I do get compliments on like, "" you look 40, I can't believe you are 50!"" I believe in Olay products and its results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer. From the first time I tried it, I was impressed. Then after the 30 days of using Regenerist Regenerating cream in my daily routing the results kept getting better. The results are soft, glowing, and moisturized skin. I really like this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. It keeps my skin soft and seems to be lifting my skin a bit too. I noticed my container seemed to be going down quickly. I walked in on my husband using it secretly. He said he deserved to look younger too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"...until we traveled to Colorado. Living in a high humidity area, dryness isn't something we worry about too much. But when we went to visit friends where it's dry, I noticed fine lines. After I put on the deep hydration cream, they seemed to go away almost instantly! Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin feels soft and smooth since using. Hydration greatly improved. At 76 years old thats very important to me.i am on fluid restriction due to a medical condition so the Hydration provided by the cream is a god send. Will continue to use this product from now on.

"Even though the name has changed slightly, my mother who was born in 1917 used Olay products since it began. She always recommended to me which I began in my 20's and now at 67 never stopped using, even when other products have advertised being miracle product. This product has never stopped being my regular overall daily use. My mother (at 90) has no wrinkles. This is a product for all ethnicities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is the best I have ever purchased. It does the job of ma,ING wrinkles less visible and will make your face just glow. I would recommend this product to every lady over the age of 40 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always had skin on the dry side, but as I've gotten older, it's gotten worse. I've never tried a product like this Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream! I can feel the hydration creme bringing moisture deep into my skin. This is the best product I've found for extra dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using OLAY as my moisturizer for years and I like it really much. I love its texture, the way it feels on my face, non greasy, it has a reasonable price and I like the amount and presentation of the product. In general I feel very comfortable using this product. I use it everyday on my face and neck [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Keeps my skin soft and smooth and doesn't plug the pores and cause blackheads, easy to clean off when I renew the application. I love this cream it's good for those over 50 when we need moisture BIG TIME. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for years and even though you change the name in different products even my Dr. has said to me you haven't had a face lift as my skin is so soft and wrinkle free. I also think that genes, not smoking or being in the sun also helps your skin. However, you must have a product to smoothe over your skin before you apply make-up and that is why I am sold on all of the Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin looks and feels younger and definitely is more hydrated after each use. I just turned 50 years young and I get compliments on how young I look all the time. Thank you Olay for such a great product line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is great for your skin if you have dry skin, your skin feels so refresh and I feel so alive after I put this product on my face, it like new born skin, so soft and I feel protected for the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Regeneist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream. I had dry skin brought on by menopause on my face. Since using this product my skin is so soft and moisturized. It makes me look younger, which I really like. It is easy to use..I apply it after cleansing my face in the morning at at bedtime. It is that easy. It takes very little to do the job. I highly recommend this amazing product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for over 5 years. My skin is mostly dry, but slightly oily around the nose and forehead toward the end of the day. This cream is very hydrating without being greasy or oily. I use it morning and evening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this cream February and I can really tell a difference in my skin. The texture is smoother and softer. I use it morning and night and would recommend it to anyone looking for something for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am prone to dry skin; living in a desert, it's especially tough no matter how much water I drink. I have tried many moisturizers, and this is by far my favorite. It leaves my face a great texture for applying foundation & other makeup. I can't live without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has recently changed its formula. I have been using the old formula for years and probably prefer that formula over the new one but it is still too early to judge for certain. I definitely prefer the white dispenser top over the new black one since the residue looks very unappealing on a black surface. Does not look clean which is what you would want your facial products to represent. Overall I still like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this stuff! Goes on smooth, doesn't feel greasy. It comes in a small jar but a little goes a long way, you only one little dab for each eye. I have used it mainly around my eyes for last few years. Trying to combat the crows feet and I do feel it is working.....and I am being realistic about results, absolutely nothing is going to eradicate the normal aging process short of plastic surgery. Try it!! You will like it! Skin feels hydrated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Its creamy and has a nice fragrance as well! I recommend the use of this product to all my friends and family. This product will have ur skin looking nice and smooth. It tightens up ur skin and It evens ur skin tone as well!! Clears up dark circles around ur eyes!!!
This product smells amazing because It just smells good because I was worried to waste my money but now I see my money was use in a good cause my skin fill amazing now it's the best thing that happend to my skin and I love the price of the lotion it was not alot or less money it was just right thank you OLAY for what you did for me.
"This product is awesome, the spots that I had on my forehead, around my nose, and on my chin was so dry I had flakes of skin coming off. This product has rehydrated my skin I don't see or feel any dry patches anymore and my skin looks so healthy and feels soft. I love this product."
It's not greases and feels good on your skin. It also gives you a beautiful glow. I used it for about two weeks and saw a difference in in my complexion. I would recommend this product to everyone. I brought some for my sister she also loved it. Then she told her friend and now we all are using it and skin looks moor firm then ever
"Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy. Although it smells great I would have loved to have this formula in a fragrance-free option, my skin tends to be a little sensitive to fragrances, but I will give a final review in a couple of weeks"
I use this product all the time. My skin is always soft and feels great. It helps regenerate my skin so it always looks good and I get many complements on how I look because I use this cream. I love all the Olay products that I have used but like this particular one the best. I am very proud to be using such a wonderful product. I would recommend it to anyone.and be happy to do so.

"REgenerist moisturizer cream does amazing things for my skin! Instantly, it makes my skin smoother, brighter, and seems to ""melt away"" dull skin. It is amazing. I have very dry skin and the moisturizing aspect of the cream is top-notch! I do not have dry patches anywhere and it lasts all night long. Regenerist cream is my favorite product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of all the moisturizers I've used, Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream is the very best. It makes my face feel great as soon as I apply it.

"I've been using this product for several years. I have always had dry skin and as I've aged, my need for more moisturizing had increased. I used to have dry patches on my face, but not anymore! This cream does not leave my face greasy, disappears soon after application and is a great base for my make up. I'm completely satisfied with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"10 years ago I began using Regenerist because I wanted a softer and younger looks to my skin. I also had a large brown spot on the side of my face from sun damage. I bought the cream and used it everyday. Withing six to ten months the large brown spot disappeared, and I was very happy. I am an avid user of the Olay products.

"I have been using the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream for about 4-5 years now. It has kept my skin looking younger, firmer and seems to keep my minor wrinkles from worsening, and with no break-outs at all.. I use it before bed every night. I apply on my neck and work my way up. I'm hooked and will never switch my moisturizer. After all, I have been using Oil of Olay since I was 19 years old. Its a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My Mom used Oil of Olay when I was younger and her skin was always beautiful. But I thought it was just natural. Then I tried the Regenerist and in a WEEK my skin was visibly softer, smoother and actually supple!! I CANNOT BELIEVE I have a soft face. You have to try this because if it made this drastic change in my rough, dry, peeling skin it will work on ANYONE!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely dry skin and in the past very costly to maintain. This line of Oil of Olay has really made a beautiful difference in my overall skin health. I had dry sun damaged skin and just after a few days I could feel an improvement. The price is very reasonable compared to other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At 62 years of age I have tried a lot of different products, some cheaper some costing much more. I always go back to Olay. The cleansers leave my face feeling clean without drying. Night time creams are not greasy and easily absorbed. I love everything about Olay and will not waste any more money on inferior products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product easy to use its creamy texture blended into my skin and it quickly sunk in leaving my skin soft and smooth in the morning it was well worth money spent I would us this product forever [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I ran out of the deep hydration regenerating cream and tried some that I had tried before that was left over and the immediate difference was so noticeable.

"Every once in a while I am sucked in by a sale or offer on a different brand's product, but I always go back to Regenerist. When it comes to good skin care it's hard to beat this excellent hydrating cream (which by the way, is reasonably priced). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Goes on smooth, absorbs quickly. Makeup applies well over it & doesn't get greasy thru the day. When used at night it feels luxurious. The fragrance is a bit strong, but not overpowering. Would prefer unscented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have found that using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream on a daily basis truly keeps my face smooth. I use it with the Micro-Sculpting Serum for a refreshing and smoothing effect that stays with me throughout the day. I work out in the yard almost every day, an I find that using this combination offers the best of protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My overall opinion - it is a great cream if you do not have comedones or acne because one of the top ingredients is Dimethicone - a silicone based polymer. It is large molecule and may clog your pores, therefore the condition of your skin will get worse [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was recently given this product as a gift from my sister. I can't tell you enough how this cream was pure luxury.

"I wish that I used Olay Regenerist deep hydrating cream years ago before I spent a fortune on expensive brand creams that did not work effectively.

Most of the products i have tried are either too oily or they soak in without making a difference. Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream feels like exactly what my 53 year old skin needs.It soothes and diminishes dryness and fine lines without irritation or clogging my pores.

"I have been using Olay products for many years. When I was in my 20's I mainly used it for the moisturizing effects. Now that I'm in my 40's I very much appreciate the extra help with aging. Their were many times when I didn't have the extra cash and I tried something a little cheaper. Needless to say, I was never happy with the effects I received. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Thank you Olay, we will be together for many more years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I do not feel complete until I use my Olay everyday. It makes my skin feel great and softens my wrinkles (at 70 years old). I still have that need to look as young as I can and my mother used Olay products when it first came out and she will be 90 years old next month and looks about 60 sooooo I'm hoping it will do the same for me.

I live in Utah and the air is overly dry. I need a cream for day and night that can leave me feeling hydrated at the end of the day or by the time that I wake up in the morning. It has a nice scent but it's not strong. And I always prefer some scent as opposed to unscented products. I hope it's helping me to minimize aging due to dry skin and sun exposure.

At age 72 I wanted a cream that helped my skin looking healthier. I have more improved results than other products I have tried..I may feel my age sometimes but really don't appear it and most people seem surprised when I tell them I am 72.

I use it day and night; not only does it feel wonderful on the skin, it prompts compliments from others on the great condition of my skin. I wouldn't use any other cream on my face! Thank you for a foolproof product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feeling of my face after applying this cream. The cream makes my face feel soft and it also feels it has more elastic in it. I notice that after a week my lines seems to lessen and my completion is brighter and smoother. On many occasions I can now go without any foundation on because mt skin tone is much better now using this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this cream for years and years. One that doesn't irritate and I have very sensitive skin. I have tried others but always come back to my favorite. Don't want to ever not have it. Thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I especially like using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream in the winter because the once the furnace is on the heat really dries out my skin. I use this cream in the morning and before I go to bed and it does really help hydrate my face without feeling heavy or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried a lot of different moisturizers; I am prone to very dry skin and I haven't gone a day without something on my face for at least 20 years (I'm 40). I've always been a fan of Olay; I used to use their traditional lotion. But Regenerist cream is amazing...it actually changes the texture of my face. I can't say enough good things about this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so excited about this product. This moisturizer makes you feel like a cool breeze in the heat of the day. I was surprised how revived I felt when I put this on. I just wanted to lather it all over. It made me feel like I had just drank 2 cups of coffee. I love it and you will too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has been great for my skin. I have very dry skin and I am 70. I have been told I do not look 70 and I feel it has helped me to prevent having more wrinkles than I have now. Great moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about a year. I haven't experienced an outbreaks, it absorbs quickly and I have seen a visible improvement in the look of my skin. It appears brighter and more youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so disappointed! I have used this product for years because of it's soft smell and great results. The new formula feels greasy, smells awful and I don't feel like my skin looks as toned and wrinkle free anymore. This was a five star product for so many years...why change it? Please bring back the old formula."
"I used (and loved) this product for several years until they changed it. It used to moisturize my skin and left it feeling soft. Now, it sits on top of my skin and is never absorbed. It just leaves a slimy film on my skin. I will no longer purchase this product."
"I've been using this product for years and it was terrific. This ""improved"" formula is terrible. It doesn't have the hydrating power it had -- it's much thinner and stickier. Heaven help you if you get some on your lips - it tastes terrible! PLEASE dump this ""improved"" formula. Until then, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer... alas"
"I love the cleansers but this cream is a little too thick for me...I have trouble going to bed with it on...a bit greasy and has a lot of fragrance. I just purchased the micro sculping cream and I can't wait to try it tonight! One point though, this cream has lasted a very long time, though I don't use it every night becuase it's not my favorite."
"I've used Regenerist lotion for several years and loved it. As I've gotten older I've found I need a heavier moisturizer. I switched to the Regenerating Cream and it's fantastic. Just like home, but better. Absorbs well, leaves my skin feeling well moisturized and velvety smooth."
"I've tried many products including the over priced products claiming to work miracles. This product I like. It sinks into the skin and doesn't leave a shine. I would recommend it. I'll buy it again and since I like this product so much, I'm going to try some of their others in this line."
"Using this product for a long ""WONDERFUL"" time. I am 73yrs old and everyone always admires the ""fresh"" Look of my skin. Just amazes me how quickly this product improves the texture of my facial skin. It also has a silky and very light feeling when applying it everyday beneath my makeup."
"Have used for years and always ""my go to cream"" even though I give others a try. Only change I would ask for a different container, just a simple jar please. Appears that an unused amount is left with the push type lid."
"This is a wonderful moisturizer...and thats not the only thing Regenerist offers. It smooths age lines, crows feet, laugh lines and uneven skin tones."
I obsessed with OLAY products can never get enough been using OLAY products since I was 14 year's old and I will be 28 in August. Keep up the Great work OLAY company.

"I love this. Tried it once before and it left my face feeling smooth and not the usual dryness. However, before I could finish the jar, my daughter liked it so much, she took it home with her!! Need to try again!"
"Love the smell, and how supple my skin feels,I actually wakeup with less sleep wrinkles on my face from using thee night time moisture cream. I would use everything okay makes if I could afford to buy them."
At first I was scared to use a new lotion but then when I saw this lotion I had to try it and when I did and gave me some good results and I was happy about some of the results but I bet if you keep on trying it all of the results would be good
