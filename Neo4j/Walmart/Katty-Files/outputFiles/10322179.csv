"Love the results I have gotten from this product. It makes my skin feel softer - not dry and itchy as it has been a terribly cold winter. Even though I had been out of Total Effects for a few months, after just 10-12 days I could feel the difference. I didn't feel the tightness or dryness when I smiled or wrinkled my nose, or raised my eyebrows. I really feel the crowsfeet are fading. I love this! Do your skin a favor and try it."
This is a great everyday moisturizer to use before applying makeup. It is light and easily absorbed into the skin. I have been using this product for a couple of years now and it is the best moisturizer I have found.
"I'm really glad that I tried this product , I found that is absorbs very quickly and is not greasy which I like very much. I am a senior and probably need a product more geared to my age as I did not see any improvement in my skin. I would definitely recommend this product to my younger friends."
You can never beat this Moisturizer !!
I always use this face cream and the prices are great on Jet.com [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this moisturizer every day. I love the way it soaks in so fast and you can continue with makeup.
I don't know why i ever stray from Olay!!! Bought this product because of move from tropical environment to move back to mainland in winter. Saved my skin!
I have used it twice a day for years.
I use this product before I apply my makeup. It's very calming. It seems to help apply my makeup better.
It is excellent I have been using it for years every think I am in my early 60's or late 50's and I am 78 years old this is the greatest.
Good value skin product.
"I rank this product at five stars...it is great! I have tried the more expensive high end moisturizers, and Olay is as effective as the other brands I tried. Mature Skin Therapy should not really be categorized only for the mature woman. I find it to be suitable for any skin type with issues of dry skin.

I have been using this product for a long time and love the way it leaves my skin so soft and silky feeling. I feel I am giving my 80n year old skin the moisture treatment it requires. I treat myself to facials a couple of times a year and the facialists always compliment me on the texture and look of my skin which I attribute to Total Effects moisturizer and sun screen. I absolutely LOVE this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Used for years. Lightweight. Wears well under makeup.
"It's okay but for 15 bucks I expect creamier and better hydrating. If you have really dry skin, It won't be thick enough."
"I'm going to be 65 this month. I would not go without makeup because I felt my complexion was too aged to go with out.I just started my second bottle and I bought it because I did see a difference. For one month of using this my skin is calmer, clearer, and smoother. I put it on at night and wake up and it's still there.Maybe this is as good as it gets, but I will go to the store with out foundation on now. That's a plus for me."
"WOW what a pleasant surprise! Brighter skin, reduction in fine lines & age spot are almost invisible and at an affordable price! I have been using Total Effects for Mature Skin for a month and could not be happier with the results. I am so pleased I gave this product a try! I look forward as time allows to trying other products in this line. I also use Oil of Olay Total Effects Citrus Scrub cleanser."
"I'm blessed with great genes and at 61, and can still pass for my late 40s - but not without a little work. I've tried a lot of moisturizers for mature skin, and this remains my favorite. Creamy texture going on, feels good to the touch on my face, and softens the fine lines I do have. Note to Olay - please add sunscreen to this formula and it would be completely perfect.

"I love this stuff. I am 70 years old and this therapy treatment has helped my skin . so much, people actually comment on my face and skin, It is firm , the pores to me have tightened . I have tried the regenerist also, I used it for a while as a night mask.. your products are above and beyond great.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried everything out there and Total Effects for mature skin is awesome. I have cery sensitive skin and been damaged by the sun (skin cancer) and this moisturizer works great. My skin is smooth and the skin tone appears to be more even toned and i dont notice some of the fine wrinkles as much. I love all of Olays products❤️❤️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have rarely used moisturizers (don't know why). Have good skin and no wrinkles. Noticed dark spots on the left side of my face so I purchased this product. After a week I noticed a brightness to my skin and my face felt great. Two friends I haven't seen for months both told me how great my skin looked. I told them Olay Total Effects Mature Skin Therapy. It really works!
ONLY AFTER TWO WEEKS--I CAN START TO SEE AN IMPROVEMENT IN MY OLD SKIN (AGE 76) ----ALSO NOTE THAT I HAVEN'T USE ANY TYPE OF CREAM ON MY FACE IN OVER 25 YEARS---(???NO COMMENT ON WHY) GREAT PRODUCT!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Olay Total Effects Mature skin therapy is a great way to achieve a beautiful, glowing looking complexion in just one easy step! :) I am absolutely amazed, and pleased by its great visible results within days, and i love it! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer feels so good going on and is so light that it doesn't have a greasy feeling. I feel like it has really kept my skin younger looking and has even reduced my small lines and wrinkles with my regular use of it. It is easy to apply with my fingertips and it doesn't take a lot to cover my whole face and neck. My skin is much softer too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Total Effects Mature Skin Therapy glides over my skin like silk. It has a wonderful feel and a clean, fresh scent. I noticed a slight decrease in lines and less ruddiness on my cheeks. I will definitely be buying this again when I run out of moisturizer. This is the best moisturizer I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm 77 years old and my skin was getting dark spots. I could see results just after the first jar. My friends often tell me how clear and even my skin looks. I love this product. I will use it forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 60 years old and have been looking for a moisturizer that would 'plump up my skin"" without leaving behind a greasy feeling. TE Mature Skin Therapy worked amazingly well on my skin. I have been told that I look more ""refreshed"" since I started using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay products for over 25 years. Now that I'm over 50 I have started to used Total Effects Mature. I like the light weight of the moisturizer. I also use the total effects eye cream and use the face scrub(both scrub ^& moisturizing cream soap.. I just love Olay products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use Total Effect Mature Skin Therapy daily, especially in the evening.The seven benefits in one product seem to intensely moisturize skin, reduce wrinkles, enhance skin tone and color, minimize pores, and lift skin. This product is a must, so thankful when it came onto the market, I use in my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Living in a dry desert community is hard on aging skin. With Total Effects Mature Skin Therapy, my face is smooth, soft and glowing no matter how dry the air is. People comment on my skin and ask what my secret is. I give all the credit to Olay, whose products I have used since I was a young teen. With an SPF of 15 and its special blend of emollients, I face each day with confidence and keep on glowing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does amazing things to your skin. After just a few short weeks of continued use, your skin feels softer, firmer and more radiant, Fine lines appear diminished and the tone and texture are improved. You know that a product is great and doing it's job when people stop to ask you, ""what are you using on your skin?"" It looks fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I m been using this product for about three week and from day one I noticed the difference. I'm 55 and look much younger. My family thinks I'm wearing make up I am not going through menopause but suffer from other medication condition in which I have dry skin. This product is perfect for my face
"This is a great lotion for mature skin. Everything I was looking for in a moisturizer and than some. Light coverage, not greasy. A wonderful scent that I love! Soaks into my skin quickly which gives immediate results-a fresh, dewdrop like appearance. I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone out there looking for mature skin therapy"
"This product has a great creamy texture, like so many of Olays moisturizers and sinks in quickly. I alternate this with the Total Effects firming night cream. The only problem with this one for me is the fragrance; too heavy and cloying. In fact, I can still smell it on my face the next morning! Please Olay, introduce a fragrance-free version or at least switch it to something softer, like the TE firming night cream, which I actually like. Way too strong!!!!"
This lotion is so smooth and soaks right into your face. The fragrance is light and very nice. There is no greasy feeling or stickiness which is something I find in other products. I use it at night as there is no SPF in it. This works for me because I love to use Definity Color Recapture for the day. An excellent product and I will purchase it again!
As an Olay Customer for over 30 years this product is great for women who have mature skin. It truly reduces the fine lines of aging and smooths the skin. It is not greasy and blends easily into the skin. I use it on my neck as well and people comment on how young I look. I love the product.
"I absolutely love this product. It goes on creamy with no greasy feel, and leaves my skin well moisturized. Living in a high altitude with low humidity really takes its toll; having a product that keeps my skin from feeling dry and taut is really important. This product feels great at night, and is light enough for everyday use. I highly recommend it!"
"I have used other total effects products and really like them. I decided to try the Mature Skin Therapy, 7-in-1 Anti-Aging Moisturizer. Got it home and find THERE IS NO SPF! I used it and like it, but very disappointed I'll need to use an additional product on my face."
"It really is for mature skin. Creamy, light and quickly absorbed. Lovely scent that fades. Recommend for all 'M' ladies."
