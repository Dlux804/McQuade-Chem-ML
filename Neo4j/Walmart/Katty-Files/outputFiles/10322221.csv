"I had been using a night cream from Avon for decades, but since I use Olay for my day lotion, thought I would give their night cream a try. My skin looks and feels great, not greasy. I also like the smell of this cream - lightly scented but not overpowering. People think I'm at least 10 years younger than my age (I was actually carded at the liquor store last week!), so it must be working! :)"
I was a MK girl until I reached 40 and MK just wasn't cutting it anymore for me. Breakouts with signs of aging..ugh! But I didn't want to spend alot of money..so I tried olay products and fell in love. No more breakouts and my skin is smoother and brighter! I love this night cream. Just wish it wasn't sold out everytime I visit the 2 local Walmarts. Lately I have had to order it on line and I hate paying shipping as they don't offer ship to store on this product. It does arrive the very next day though.
"I love Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle night cream, it works really great for my skin type, which is dry and fair. The cream is not too heavy and not too oily, it's just perfect. I've been using it for a long time and NO other brands that I've tried in the passed worked as good as Olay. This cream has very little fragrance which is very pleasant to me."
I have been a fan of Olay products for years. This is a rich cream that goes a long way. Not much needed to cover the face. The price is great as well.
I have used many expensive night creams from major companies and big prices this one is just as good and does the job just as well. Very happy
Just started using this and the first morning after my skin felt so soft. It's not greasy and has a nice light scent. I use other Olay products and I'm sure this one will prove to be just as excellent.
"I love Oil of Olay. I use the day cream, moisturizers, serum and the night cream. Each product has its purpose and delivers. This product is low priced but don't be fooled, it's high quality. I enjoy the feel of this cream. It is refreshing and moisturizing. I have very dry mature skin and this cream gives me the look and feel I need. Definitely worth giving a try."
I don't know if it takes away the wrinkles but it leaves my skins feeling hydrated and soft.
I'm 63 and skin is dry. Rolls up on my face and a little too scented for me.
I love oil of Olay..the old fashioned name for it a young person told me she used it and i told her this was a product that had been around for years so i thought abut this and started to use it myself old name tell same it is obviously a trusted product i use all the products and have never once had any break out but this also depends on the person however but i love Olay and highly recommend it for anyone i myself am just on the far side of 70 years old
This are great
"I've used Olay's anti-wrinkle eye cream in the past and found that it works great. Though the eye cream (I think it's only .5oz) is the same price for this 2oz jar so I switched to this night cream and use for eye cream and for entire face and neck. I love it. It glides on very smoothly and gentle around eyes. There's a very slight fragrance that I don't mind. I have sensitive skin and feel this moisturizer works really well. Plus, it's to ward off wrinkles! It's a definite 2-in-1!!!"
i have been using this for about two weeks and i notice a huge difference in the crows feet. it looks like they are much thinner and i am hoping that they will look less than that.I have used olay products for years and they are quality products and you pay a fraction of the price than you would pay for in a department store. Olay products are the best all around.
I am 29 and purchased this a while back. I use it a couple times a week. It has lasted me quite a while as a little bit of product goes a long way. It is not oily. Not badly scented. I like how it feels on my skin. My main reason for this purchase in particular over others was price and ingredients. I've heard products with retinol and niacinimide are what works. This one had the ingredients so I purchased. I will continue to use this and other olay face products.
"This night cream is thick without being heavy or greasy. The scent is very light and pleasant. I have always had oily skin, but recently (as I assume is normal with aging) my skin has been drier and this product is working for all of my changing skincare needs. I even use this during the day in January and February when the air in Chicago is so cold and dry. I also love that the price is only about $11 a jar (and coupons are so easy to find) so I can use it liberally."
"All I can say is I've been using Oil of Olay for years and my skin looks great. Im sure I've been blessed with great genes but I used to smoke, I dont drink as much water as I should and I love getting suntanned. And yet my skin looks great. Im pretty certain Oil of Olay is helping."
"Buy this product because I saw that it had a good review. But I did not work, in the past I have used products of this brand and they have not worked for me. I do not insist anymore and I prefer the Loreal brand, it is the only one that works for me."
I have used this product for many years and have no complaints.
I feel this cream keeps my skin looking young.
makes my face feel and look years younger
"it feels good on my skin, not greasy feeling."
"Use this at night, smells clean and working good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Noticed a smoother feel after just a couple of nights use of this Olay product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Both products Olay I purchased at the same time are superior. Highly recommend. Walmarts prices are the best out there
"I DO LIKE THIS CREAM, OF COURSE IS DOESN'T TAKE 25 YEARS OFF. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING REALLY WILL. HOWEVER, IT DOES SOFTEN THE APPERANCE OF TIME IF USED DAILY. IT'S LIGHT AND APPLIES EASY. I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN WHEN NEEDED."
I love this product. my skin became so smooth after just one use. I am 33 and have never used an anti aging cream before. But I think I am gonna continue this. Thanks Olay!
"I'm a lady, 63yrs old. I had a problem with dry skin,and my face looking older than i am. After using this for a week,i can honestly tell a big difference. My skin is soft,and plumper looking. Ill continue to use"
"Nice face cream, but never really know if it is working since you use a different day cream."
This product keeps my skin soft & smooth. I'm 66 & my face has almost no wrinkles.
I bought this a month ago it a great product
Skin is hydrated. Wrinkles seem less deep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just started using and it is helping .
"Very thick, smells great, works well."
This is a good product for everyday use and make you feel comfortable using it.
"I have used Night of Olay upon retiring for over 20 years. Now that I am in my 60s , and starting to get wrinkles, I decided to try Olay Age Defying Anti-Wrinkle Night Facial Moisturizer Cream. I have to say, I am not impressed. I feel I got better results from Night of Olay, at half the cost."
"My skin feels very soft and smooth after using this product. However, the fragrance is a bit too strong for me, which is why I'm only rating it 4 stars. Otherwise, I feel it's a very good value."
"My whole life I have been lucky to have great skin, just dry. I am now 37 and pretty suddenly my skin aged. I noticed red spots and my complexion was uneven and my skin just looked tired. I tried it and now I love it! I noticed immediately after using it that my complexion evened out, the red spots looked much lighter. After a week my pores looked smaller and skin just looked better, clearer, not so dull. This product definitely works."
"I really like this product. I can tell from the minuet I put it on that it is tightening my skin. I use it at night (when I remember) and in the daytime under the Anti-Wrinkle day lotion with sunscreen. I try to use a family of products because they are formulated to work together. So, I wash with Olay, moisturize with Olay and sleep with Olay. You can't tell I'm 59 years young... 60 years young next month. I look 40 again!"
"I started to use this product daily at night along with Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid Lotion in the morning. They were both recommended to me while taking the Olay Online Questionnaire. Well, I love them both. I am 47 years old and my facial skin has been dry all my life. After 4 1/2 months(that's how long the jars lasted) my skin is no longer dry and my wrinkles have diminished or disappeared. I will continue to use these products on a permanent basis. Also, great value for the money!"
"I haven't left the house without one of Olay's SPF daytime moisturizers on my face or gone to bed without first using Olay night cream since the 1970s. Olay's Age-Defying products have kept my face and neck supple and clear as I approach my sixties. This is good, affordable stuff."
"This is the first time I have used Olay anti-wrinkle replenishing night cream. I am very pleased with the way it looks on my face. After only one night my skin was smoother and tighter, Each day I continue to see a big change. I am anxious to start using an olay day cream . I recommend this cream."
This product works so well that I have actually seen reduced wrinkles. Olay is the best.
"I love this product, its not greasy and has a light scent."
ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM OLAY & A GREAT PRICE AT WALMART
It was fast shipping and the rug works great for me
This is a must try product it left my skin feeling smooth an silky. Wish I had tried before and hadn't waited. If you want silk smooth skin it's a must try!! Would recommend this for everyone. Thanks olay for making such awesome products!!
I have tried many expensive creams and this cream out does them all. I am 48 years old and have thought about Botox until I found this. It's amazing when you finally find something that really works!!!
This is the only night cream I have ever used that doesn't make me break out. It's light and non-greasy and makes my skin feel wonderful. I am a new fan!
"I love, love this product. I use it as a day moisturizer & as a night cream. You can tell the minute you apply the. Product, that it is nourishing your skin."
"I have used Oil of Olay since my twenties! No at 57 I still use their products because they really pamper my skin. The age defying night cream is perfect especially when the weather is really hot and my skin needs extra moisture. They have creams for all seasons, all ages and the prices are great!"
"A little goes a LONG way. I feel like this little 2.0 oz jar will last me months, specially if I only use it at night. I've used it for about a week so far, my skin feels amazing every time I use it. Definitely moisturizes and makes my face feel like silk. Definitely going to pick up one of their day time creams."
"Ive always had oily skin and never made a habit of moisturizing my face. I was always trying to dry it out. Well, welcome to 42. My face looked lifeless and I hemmed and hawed over fancy stuff to buy for it. Finally at the grocery store one night I finally decided on this stuff. The price was right so why not? The next day a coworker commented on my face. Then the next day another one did! I Noticed my skin seemed brighter even under the awful bathroom lights at the office."
"The product that I bought does not say anti wrinkle, but is the closest to any product found at this site. It's called Olay age defying classic night cream 56 g (2.0 oz). I had high expectations, because I had used a similar product many years ago. It may work well, but the smell is so bad, that I could only stand to use it twice. It's going in the trash today. It smells like mothballs. An unscented product would be much better."
I have used this product for years. I've been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years. But the Age Defying night cram is different. Not only is the smell different but it's has a MUCH thinner consistency. It's definitely not the same. It even feels different on my face and my skin feels dryer after applying. I'm so disappointed. Why change what works? When this jar is gone I will be changing brands.
I loved this cream. It was the only one I would use and am very disappointed that the formula must have changed. The new formula has a smell I can't tolerate. The old formula had a wonderful fragrance and I see I am not the only one that has noticed the change. Please change it back! I find it impossible to find night creams that work and I like the fragrance of. I thought I finally found my go to.. to be disappointed that I will have start my search over.
I loved it. It was wonderful. The joyful scent of this product was surprising. Not too loud and not so soft that you can't smell it. I loved this product. The feel of silk across my skin was heavenly. I have recommended this product to all my friends and family members
"I love the age defying anti-wrinkle night cream. The scent is very light and the texture of the cream is calming, prefect for a night cream. I feel my skin being nourished during the night with this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has helped keep my skin looking youthful and also helped with my adult acne. My face hasn't been so clear in so long. I want to try the regenerist but right now cost is playing a bit of a factor, so this has been working with my budget. I also use the day cream sick my face likes to dry out all year long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the night cream off and on since I was a teenager. I look really young for my age. People don't believe I am a grandma when I tell them. I believe Oil of Olay products have helped keep my skin in good condition. I will always use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream smells nice and light, feels lightweight, and is just the right amount of moisture for nightly treatment. The anti-wrinkle properties are evident and effective. I've been using it for years and wouldn't dream of switching, at least not until I need something more serious like the Regenerist line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream now for 3 days and I absolutely love it. I'm in my 30's and need a night cream to refresh my face and look...this cream smells good and feels good. It makes my skin so soft. I'm happy with the results. Great news, It doesn't irritate my skin nor break me out. Thanks Oil of Olay!"
Wonderful product I have been using for years. It works!
I feel like this line has worked in the past. But now that I am 35 I feel I may need something stronger.
"Takes very little to put on face and neck and does the job beautifully, makes your skin so smooth and no oily residue left after you put it on. Goes into the skin quickly for baby smooth skin."
"Never had this problem before, but causes my face to be real tight. Should I be applying a thicker layer? After I clean my face in the morning, feels back to normal."
Hearty night cream that absorbs into skin and feels weightless. Great smell and moisturizes very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love Oil of Olay products been using it for over 10yrs. I always make sure I use a night cream and then a day cream to keep my skin looking beautiful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't say enough about this product. The fragrance is heavenly and it makes my skin feel incredible. It's so light and smooth and never greasy. I look forward to bedtime so I can use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use it during the day and night in winter and it doesn't make me break out or get shiny, which is a rare phenomenon. a great value. I wish Olay could really commit to an unscented product. this is less fragrant than the classic, so I prefer it."
nothing will make be look 25 again but Olay keeps skin soft and moisturized and doesn't leave very sensitive skin red the way most OTC night creams do
I love love love this night cream! I'm on my third jar and I will never stop using this. I use it at night and in the morning. It has helped clear my skin of breakouts and made it so soft. My skin has never looked better.
I am only giving this 2 stars because I just bought this night cream yesterday so I haven't had it long enough to know if it works or not. I seen it got good reviews so I thought I would buy it. I am in my late 30's so I figured I better get started on a rutine. I have laugh lines around my mouth area now and they are very visable and it is driving me nuts seeing them. So I bought this cream in hope that it helps to get ride of them. I will be buying other Olay product's to use along with this night cream.
I would not go to bed without this.
Feels good on the skin leaves my skin feeling fresh in the morning and tight ♡♡♡♡
Makes my face feel moist and smooth. It has helped with some wrinkles.
Like pro-retinol and alpha-hydroxy combo for lines.
I have used Olay products for the last 4 years and I am totally satisfied with the results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
great inexpensive non-greasy moisturizer. Great for harsh winter conditions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love how my face looks and feels each day using the nite cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Only have to use a small amount to hydrate your face during the night. Pleasant smell and I feel it keeps my skin feeling softer and more supple.
I jus started this cream few nights ago so I have yet to see results... The consistency is really thick to my preference.. It has a really good scent. Hopefully it works like I am hoping to lol
Love this product works like a charm
"Amazing face cream. Soft, creamy and moisturize, love it!!!"
I am 29 years old. I have no wrinkle in my face. Can I use this product?
Ah I finally found the perfect night cream and it's affordable! What could be better. #contest
Olay creams are great value. Goes on nice and moisturizers even in the dry winter
It seems to be working for dry facial skin even in the cold winter
Works well
Works great
ITS A CLASSIC FOR YOUR FACE AT NIGHT. THIS BRAND REMEMBERS ME MY GRANDMA AND LOVE ALL THE PRODUCTS
This product makes my skin feel very smooth and moist. I will continue to use it!
"I just started using this product, not sure if its working or not. Don't see any different so far."
