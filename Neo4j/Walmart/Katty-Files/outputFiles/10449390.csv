"It's lightweight, effective and just because it is inexpensive does not mean it is not a quality product. I think it has done wonders for my 60plus skin"
"I have spent so much money on high-priced creams,all saying that they are the perfect one that I have been searching so long for!Well,after too many years to mention and money wasted as well,Oil of Olay is honestly a tried and true Winner!I love the texture and it stays on at night,whereas the others rubbed of on my pillow!All in all I am very pleased with this night cream and already see a difference in my fine lines!"
"This cream really works. I see the difference in my skin when I use it and when I don't. I have tried other Olay night creams, as well as other night creams from other lines and none work as good as Night of Olay. It gives my skin a smoother, clearer, more youthfull look. When folks try to guess my age, they always guess that I am younger than I really am and I attribute it to this cream. IT REALLY WORKS."
"Beauty products should never be a burden on any one's budget- that is unnecessary stress! This product has rejuvenating effects- brings a youthful effect by balancing and hydrating the skin, as well as firming."
This is a great product . It soaks in right away and leaves your skin feeling very moisturized and soft; not heavy and greasy like a lot of other products. :)
I've been using this cream for a week and I only use it at night. When I first spread it on my face it looks somewhat dry but after 5 minutes or so it blends into my skin perfectly. I know it's a firming cream but I hate that in the morning my face seems fat and maybe it's just plump from the cream but I already have a fat face lol so I only use it occasionally now because it does make my face soft and who wouldn't love a soft face?
"This product was low cost, and it makes your skin feel soft. I enjoy putting it on my face at night, it makes me feel pampered. I used to avoid Oil of Olay because it makes me think of a cream my mother would use, but it's a good starter cream and I am now the perfect age to use it."
"The cream goes on easily and feels good after evening cleansing. It is too soon to see if it is firming, but it does provide nice softness and moisture. This is really what I want."
"For the price this Olay product goes for, it does what is promised. It works well as a firming cream and for small lines and wrinkles. Don't expect it to work miracles for deep wrinkles, but if you are on a budget it's the best facial firming moisturizer in it's class. I will suggest using this at night only and using a deep moisturizer during the day. This night cream can be a bit drying if you use it day and night due to it's ""firming"" qualities. Otherwise, try it out. It works."
"This is a great night cream. Has a nice, soft scent, moisturizes nicely. I use this every night and I can see a difference in my skin."
"Great night cream for the price. A little goes a long way. Cream goes on smoothly and is not sticky. Use on my face a down my neck after cleansing nightly. Skin feel moisturized. Happy I found it again since another site closed, difficult to find in stores. This is a keeper!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin. Can't beat the price
I have been usIng Olay products since my high school yrs. Never disappointed.
It's creamy and has a lovely smell. Soaks into skin immediately and doesnt leave an oily residue.
I have been using this product for 6 years. Absolutely love it!
It's a good producct I regularly use!
I love this moisturizer because it is not oily or greasy. Your skin just absorbs it and it is lightly scented.
"I've been using this product for years, I love it. Although it's a night cream, I put it on after I shower in the am, and wear it all day."
I have not used a cream on my face for 25 years. Although I just turned 72 my skin has very very few wrinkles and I want to keep it that way. I have used the night firming cream for one week. Immediately I felt and saw a difference. It got so much softer. The fragrance is light and lovely. I plan to continue to use this great product...the price is very good too.
Love it ! Works wonders
My face looks so much better in the morning...
I tried so many products it did not work. Olay night cream works best on my face. I've been using this for over a year now.
I love this product as it help me with anti aging and doesn't coast me and arm an a leg. It is good on my skin type. I recommend it highly
I've loved Oil of Olay products for a very long time. Now that there are so many different skincare products to choose from I always come back to these products.
I like how this cream absorbs on my skin when I apply it after I was my face before going to bed! I like the subtle scent and its consistency. It makes my skin feel soft and firmer so I am planning to keep using it.
I am amazed how fast my order came to my home. The products are excellent. Just what I needed. I will continue to order from Jet.com. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received order quickly and been using for about 2 weeks. Don't see anything difference but will continue to use and hopefully it will start to show some firming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Bought a new jar of the anti aging night firming cream. Eager to try it. BUT I can't remove the white cover off the jar. Not the black lid but the lid covering the cream. Help!
"I have been using night of olay firming cream for years. I not only use this in the evening after cleansing my face before going to sleep, it is also my under makeup moisturizer I use during the day. This is a fabulous product, very gentle, non greasy and very effective. You cannot beat the value for the money. Why spend more?"
"I've only been using this product for a week every night and already my skin has never been better. It's soft, hydrated, and looks healthy. Not only does it leave my skin looking healthy but this moisturizer leave your skin moisturize until the next morning so applying a day moisturizer was unnecessary. I absolutely love this product and will definitely buy it again in the future."
"I am 27 and brand new to moisturizing twice a day. I started using this cream about two days ago. I love it. Normally lotions have a greasy feel afterwards and this doesn't. I love how it's light and smooth feeling. The smell is amazing, it's soft and subtle. It smells just like the pink baby lotion from Johnson and Johnson! Amazing, I am very pleased with the product especially how soft my skin feels."
This is the best night time facial moisturizer. when I get up in the morning my face is so soft. people always tell me I don't look my age. I've used Olay since it came out on the market when I was a young woman and have tried several products but nothing compares
ok product but noting special.
"This product will help restore moisture, however to me it smelled like baby powder and I could see no changes in any other way. Have moved on....."
Works excellent! Firms with a supple flawless look. Better than some of the expensive brands I've bought. Love Olay products
This night moisturizer is great. You don't need to apply very much. It's smooth and spreads very well over the skin. I took a star off because the jar is small for the price!
I'm always looking around for the best price for this item. Wal-Mart.com had it so I bought 2. You know you can never go wrong with Oil of Olay. Thanks Wal-Mart.com
"I have used nightly for one week. I cannot believe how well it works. My jawline is noticably more defined, not saggy anymore. Skin is softer and smoother. Thank you Olay! Oh, did I mention I am in my sixties?"
I wanted something to hydrate & moisturize during the night but not heavy. This is perfect & since I have been using it approximately one year I have noticed improvement in my skin.
"Definitely think this is more of a preventive aging cream, then a moisturizer with collagen that plumps and smooths. Good for women 25-40. Women 40+ May need a more intense moisturizer."
Really love the way this product is making my face look and feel. I would recommend this to anyone.
Love this product. The light aroma is very pleasing. It's the scent of Olay from the past.
Love the moisturiser. Makes the skin feel very soft
Fast delivery item looks good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great transaction sweepstakes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
good price for face care and olay product I like all Oil of Olay items .
I've used this product for years. I have sensitive skin and this works perfectly. Very light.
"Make my skin feel so soft, and I like it very much."
Your service was excellent
I have been using this for years and it does a good job
"if you like the olay original beauty fluid scent, you will enjoy this cream as it's a more hydrating version of that fluid in my opinion. i found the scent too over-powering, i do love the olay age defying night cream however, very clean soft scent :)"
"I have always loved Oil of Olay products. While this seems to be a terrific moisturizer I haven't felt it has much anti-aging properties. The moisture lasts all night, not greasy, readily absorbed, but I don't see alot of improvement in the wrinkle areas."
"I've been using this product for 23 years. I began using this or it's equivalent ( I think it was called something else back then) since I was 11. My skin has retained it's elasticity and youthful appearance when friends and relatives have begun to ""look their age"". I've extremely happy with this product and will continue to use it as long as it's on the market."
"I like the night of olay creme. It can be used on the skin and when you get up in the morning your skin feels good. I have a slight skin issue and it is great to use this overnight being a male. I also reccomend ""Night of Olay"" as a creme as well in addition to ""Age Defying"" creme. The two work great together."
"At 1/5th price of olay regenerator face cream, i hv not tried to scientifically measure benefits, but I use mixed with jojoba oil"
Made my skin soft but wouldn't reccomend if you have sensitive skin. Made me all red for days!
ONE REALLY CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH OLAY THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR THE NIGHT AND A GREAT PRICE FROMF WALMART
"great product , purchased online see packaging , yes, just one small cream in that huge box . well, shipping was FREE ...................."
I love that this cream is very affordable and effective. I love how my skin feels and the glow in my face.
The Oil of Olay cream gave my skin a smooth feel and helped the wrinkles. I would recommend to a friend.
im happy bout this item also would buy more i love on line shopping at walmart my item alsays on time thank you walmart a fan!!!
"I like the way it feels on my skin and the smell is very pleasant, but I haven't used it long enough to say if it does any ""firming"""
"Smells amazing, goes on easily, not greasy, or heavy feeling on my skin. Great value compared to other night creams that offer the same benefits."
It goes on smooth and makes your skin look smooth. I've used all the Olay products for years and people are always asking what do I use on my skin.
I've used Oil of Olay products since I was 19 yrs old. It moisturizes your face without making it oily. The scent is not overwhelming. I use it in the morning & at night. The price can't be beat .
just what I expected
great product
"I see complaints about the smell; no complaints from me- this cream has a light rosy scent. It does not ""stink"" as others have mentioned. By far this cream helps my skin the most. I have oily skin and was afraid to use a night moisturizer. This cream does not cause break outs or clog my pores. My skin is soft and looks better with less sagging. I also use it on my neck, decolletage, and hands. Love it. Please never discontinue this."
I have extremely dry skin. I actually use this night cream for both day and night. Lotions do not last long enough on my skin. The texture of this cream is soft and silky. It isn't heavy enough that it feels like it would clog pores but it's enough that your skin will be hydrated for a long time. It has a soft smell that isn't overwhelming and doesn't last long.
I found this jar in my mom's medicine cabinet and grabbed it. I have been plagued with red marks and unevenness when I wake up. My skin is also known to have patchy dry spots and flakes. I started using it this past few weeks and my skin has really improved. My skin is much fresher looking in the morning. It's a bit on the thick side so you don't need a lot. I'm not in love with the smell but it works. It's really a great value. Guess mother knows best.
"I remember as a small kid my grandma using olay products! Now as an adult myself I've used olay for many years, some people don't like the smell but I absolutely love it, brings back memories of grandma every night as I use it. It makes my skin so soft, and it's not greasy at all. Very light feeling. I will continue to use for this years to come."
I purchased this product on a budget about 2 months ago hoping to smooth my frown lines especially the stubborn one right in between my eyebrows. Keep in mind it's been there for about 2 years.. I'm 26. N e who after the first 2 weeks I noticed it going away! It's almost completely gone now and even the little line around my eyes are smoother and not as creased. I love this product and will continue buy and use!
I have been using this product for almost 10 years...with the exception of a recent stint where I was trying to support a friend selling some really expensive beauty products which turned out to be a really bad decision...my skin never looked worse! I am happy to report that after only days back on my Olay regimen my skin is looking amazing! My breakouts have cleared up and my skin looks so soft and smooth! I will never buy another moisturizer again! It is literally perfect.
"I have been using this product for about a month now. I am pleased with the results. My skin is much softer. The product is not heavy feeling and it has not aggravated my ""adult"" acne. It does have a fragrance, which is not too bad, although, if I apply it too close to my eyes it will make them water. For the price, I think it is an excellent choice."
THE BEST!! Usually when I wake up - night creams I applied the night before have vanished and my skin feels like sandpaper - as if I put nothing on my face. This lasts and when I wake up - I can still feel it and my face is still soft in the morning.
My mother uses this and looks 10 years younger than her actual age. I also use it. Nothing hydrates my face better without causing break outs. You can also feel it working. I absolutely love this product and will not use any thing else for a night cream - and you cannot be the price for what you get.
"I watched my grandmother use Oil of Olay products for as long as I can remember. Night of Olay is awesome! I still look like I'm in my 20's based off compliments. I use it @ night after washing my face, and in the morning I simply rinse or wash my face again, and the greasiness is gone. I've always read that skin absorbs the most moisture while asleep, and that it's ok to slather it on, so I do!"
"This is a great product and you can't beat the price. It soaks in right away and leaves your skin feeling very moisturized and soft; not heavy and greasy like a lot of other products. I've used this for 1 week and notice a huge difference. My face & neck are firmer, more lifted and pores are smaller. I don't get much sleep but this product hides it well! I noticed some negative comments about the smell. I don't find it to be offensive at all; just a light clean fragrance. I highly recommend this cream."
"I've used this product for a week now and i must say it really works, it firms, smooths and hydrates the skin. I use this product every night after i wash my face. Since i have acne prone skin, i was very weary about using it at first since i have oily skin and i thought it would just make me break out more and it doesnt at all if anything it helps my skin appear healthier. you'll see results in the first day you have my word."
"I am 19 years old and have just purchased this along with Olay Active Hydrating Cream. This has worked wonders for me already! 1 use and I am hooked. My skin is now hydrated, soft, supple, smooth, more evenly toned, and my pores have even decreased in size. I believe that it's never too early to start keeping your skin looking young and healthy and this has actually worked for me. I think this cream would be best for the younger customers because of it's simplicity."
"I love the smell, it is clean, fresh, and heavenly. I love the subtle firming I feel after I put it on. Not too overpowering, it just does what it does very nicely. My skin takes a week or so to get used to new products so I expected breakouts because I get em with every new facial product I use. I barely got a pimple though, just some slight oiliness, but I'm sure my skin will adjust. I love this though, it is fantastic, and I have a good feeling this will be on my bathroom counter for a while. : )"
Great cream with very light fragrant.
not expensive bu good quality
You get what you pay for!
I tried this many times and found out that it really worked on me. Good deal for the price.
"The first thing I noticed was the smell, not pleasant at all. My mom said it smell like baby poop. However, my skin did look better in the morning."
this product had good reviews but it didn't make my skin any softer or tighter and broke me out a lot. had to throw out
"my eyelids are kind of droopy so I decided to try a firming cream, but I haven't noticed any difference since using this stuff. It's just a thick face cream....I say, save your money."
I just love the way my face feels after I wash it and put the cream on. It feels so smooth and it smells good and I wish someone had told me about this years ago.
"Doesn't work been using it for almost a month now. It has done nothing for me. Face looks exactly the same, lines and wrinkles still very visible. Waste of money it doesn't work. Going to try another product to se if they work and I'll share with you guys. Remember please don't buy it's as effective as Vaseline, if not less, doesn't work at all. And I put it on at night every day."
"I bought this night cream thinking it'd help my oily skin and be used at night. Yes it did mattify my skin, but it dries it out so much... It also smells AWFUL! Like some old expired cream... I get sick just opening the bottle. I would not recommend this product."
I am very disappointed in the performance of the night of olay firming creme. I have been using it in combination with the mosturizing daytime cream for over a month and have seen no improvement in my skin. My mother was a diehard olay user many years ago and I had hoped I would be as satisfied with the products as she was. I was not.
"The scent of this night cream is terrible. It's a true “old lady” smell. I didn't even want to put it on but I tried it anyways - it is light and non-greasy which is nice but the smell was so awful, I had to wash it off. It's nothing like my last Olay night cream which had a very pleasant scent. Waste of money, I do not recommend it."
"I have always loved this creme and how it makes my skin feel. However, I just recently opened a new jar and this is definitely not the same scent that I have loved for years. It has an acrid undertone now, where before it was a clean, nostalgic, and happy scent. Please offer this crepe in the old scent as I hate to have to find a new product to use."
"I have used this cream for years and as a result my skin is soft and smooth. I have looked forward to using it because of its soft smooth texture and lovely scent. Recently the scent seems to have changed and I don't care for the new scent. While I love the product, I will look for a new moisturizer with a scent that appeals to me as much as the original scent. My ratings are for the original aroma."
"I bought this because I was trying to get myself into a skin care regime, and this did the trick! Leaves my skin feeling (and looking) amazing and I love the way it smells (even though it seems many people don't.) And I love the fact that you don't have to use a ton at once, a little bit actually goes a long way!"
"I tried this product after the ""Olay Complete Night Fortifying Cream"" was discontinued... this product is much heavier and has a stronger smell that irritates my sensitive skin. If the older product was brought back, I would be thrilled to give this brand a try again. Until then, do not think this is a similar product to the previous night cream."
"I use a CPAP at night & everything I tried to use on my face would interfer withy CPAP mask. I used oil of Olay for years (my mom turned me on to it). So I figured I couldn't do any worse with night of Olay, since it did wonders for my mom. It has been working great so far. Now to test it around my nose & upper lip where the mask sits. I can feel & see the difference around my eyes."
"I've used the high-end department store moisturizers and they can't compare to Night of Olay. I've seen such a marked improvement in my skin since I switched. The improvement is amazing! Since getting older and my skin has gone from oily to dry, I use Night of Olay sparingly in the morning before putting on my makeup. It works beautifully!"
My mom swears by olay. She looks great for 50 so I started using it when I was 20. I started using Night of Olay each night and I love the way my skin feels the next day. My skin is moisturized and smooth. I love the smell of it too. I'm just shocked at how well it works for the price.
"When every my skin starts to feel out of whack, there's nothing like a generous application of Night of Olay to bring it back in line. My husband loves the smell of it too - and he usually hates anything with a fragrance. I've been using this since it was in the black jar - years ago!!!"
"I don't know what product all the nay-sayers are using, but this product is wonderful! The smell is classic Oil of Olay. I have used this now for 3 days and I'm already seeing a difference in my skin! It is firmer, and some of the wrinkles are disappearing. Thank you Olay for your products."
I was using the Olay Age Defying Night Creme a couple of years ago but then started using another brand. I thought I'd try it again but bought the Night of Olay by mistake. The smell is not very pleasant! It seems to work okay but I won't buy it again. I'm trying to use it up as quickly as possible by also using it as a hand cream. It absorbs really well and doesn't feel greasy!
"I just started using this because Olay discontinued the fragrance -free moisturizer that I normally use. I must admit, this cream works really well. I just wish there were a frangrance-free one. I cannot stand the smell of perfume--it makes me want to throw up. Please develop a frangrance-free firming cream, Olay."
"Very good product,"
Cannot beat this price & OLAY has always been a quality product & still is.
It makes the skin soft and fresh over night
I been using it for a couple days and so far i have no complains. My skin feels silky smooth. I do love how it feels and looks refreshing.
"The fragrance of this product is so strong it makes my eyes water. It is horrible. My husband can't stand to sleep in bed next to me when I put it on. I also haven't seen any firming, just extra pimples! Eww!"
"I have used and loved this product for years. Have always recommended Night of Olay Skin Firming, but now I have to add a warning about the smell. It used to smell amazing, it does not anymore."
"I have been using this night cream for a month and love the way it's leaving my face, works great! It smells little funny need to be improve but its okay! Yes, I recommend this product!"
I really really like the night of olay firming cream. It feels good on the skin and has nice scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this night cream it gives my face a soft smooth feel. It does not feel greasy or leave spots on my pillow. I will not use anything else! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for quite a while and I love it. I remember the first time I tried, I could feel the firmness right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that my face does not feel oily and since I started using this and other olay products my face in no longer dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this night cream for at least 18 years now.. I firmly believe it has made me look so much younger. It's not oily or greasy - just the perfect night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive been using this for many years. Ive used many different brands but keep coming back to this. No more oily skin. No more dry patches. Keeps my skin soft and smooth.
I absolutely love this product! It works wonderfully and smells great and is not greasy. I will definitely be using it from now on! Best product of it's type I have ever tried!
"I have been using Olay Night of Olay Firming Cream for over 20 years. It is my go to night cream. I like the way it goes on, fragrance and results. For the price you can't go wrong."
I AM AN OLAY FAN. IT REALLY WORKS WONDER ON MY FACE. It diminished the wrinkles and deep lines on my face specially around the mouth area and forehead. The price is very affordable too.
"This is probably one of the best products I have ever used. The first time I woke up after having put it on the night before, my skin was GLOWING and radiant. I love this product. NEVER GOING BACK TO ANYTHING ELSE!"
"This product really does firm (for me anyway). I can see and feel the difference. I use it not only at night, but for special nights out too. I hope Olay never discontinues this classic. The fragrance is a little strong, but you get used to it. :)"
I bought this cream for the first time. I always use the serum but bought this for a night moisturizer. I used it for the first time and loved how it made my skin feel. I put in on right before bed but had to wash it off after 5 minutes because of the terrible fragrance. It smells very strong (old lady perfume). I normally love the light frangrance in your products. Awful.
I like it it mosturizes my face. I just feel like it smells weird?
I have used it twice seems fine...
Excellent product. Love how my skin feels now. Not greasy.
"Goes on smooth, not greasy."
"This is a good product and works well, a bit expensive for such a little jar but definitely a good product"
All this product did was to make my skin very oily and break my skin out. I have had such a bad experience with olay products.
"This product worked wonders on my skin. Softer feel, bags under my eyes diminished by 50%. Smoother outer appearance."
"I can't use any other facial moisturizer! This stuff is great! The smell doesn't really bother me, but it's kinda stinky"
"Please don't ever discontinue this night cream. It absorbs right into my skin with no residue. In fact, I use it as a daily moisturizer, too!"
"I have been using this night cream for a week and love the way it's leaving my face, works great! It smells so good too!"
This is a great night cream.It goes on nice.It is not heavy or greasy. It has a clean fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is gentle on my skin and moisturizes it. Not too greasy, absorbs fast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sleeping is a wonderful thing , especially when are skin is being pampered. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Beware if gifting this to any male in your life... It comes in a pink box!! Overall great product though.
And I'm -28- now. I get told I don't look anywhere near that. So...It works I suppose! http://imgur.com/OiIvDUA
I've been using Oil of Olay products for over 20 years. I get many compliments on my complexion even at 80 plus years.
"Used nightly for long period of time, no firming here and I'm not that old."
It is a great night cream that is not too light or too heavy to sleep in.
This night cream makes my face so smooth and it feels great in the morning! #contest
Great proce works better than higher priced products!
This produact is not new to me. It is light and not greasy. I will continue to order it.
"Tightened my face, no more Crowfeet around my eye and mouth."
The cream is fantastic and the price is cherry on the cake
Best product for the money.
"I just started using this product, not sure if its working or not. Don't see any different so far."
I have used this product for 2 weeks. The results are amazing.
Great moisturiser. Gentle fragrance. Non-greasy. Love it!
no breakouts for my oily acne prne skin! but moisturizes! love it! love it!
Great product
I could not use this cream it made my face fill like it was on fire and yes i did use the other olay products with it.
I purchased this product cuz my face has been drying out and this night cream has helped moisturize my face.
Goes on smpothly
Had to return item. Put a small dab on & perfume was so strong it gave me a headache.
The Oil of Olay night creme is very nice. It softens the skin ovenight
