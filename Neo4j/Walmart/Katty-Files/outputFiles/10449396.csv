"I am very careful when it comes to skincare. Finding this product has been a blessing because I have been looking for an Olay moisturizer for sensitive skin that had a higher SPF Defense and found this..it's perfect. More people need to use sunblock instead of tanning. My Father is currently terminally ill with Cancer, Melanoma. All those years tanning in the California sun. So, I highly recommend this product. Take care of yourself. It's just one small step that can make a huge difference in your life."
This is the only sunblock that doesn't give me a rash. It has a great texture so I don't feel greasy with it on. I have been wearing this daily for several years now.
"I have been on the hunt for a mineral based spf that compliments my naturally olive tan skin. This spf has zinc oxide and some chemical filters, which I don't mind. There is no dreaded white cast after massaging into the skin, and I love the oil free formula for my shiny t-zone! This is so affordable compared to others and please never stop making this!"
I have used this skin lotion for years and I am very happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the feel of this moisturizer, very light. I think it makes my skin look really good and offers sunscreen protection."
"Not available in UK so I have to stock up whilst visiting. Great product. Walmart excellent on line experience, early delivery. Amazing"
"This is the best moisturizing SPF 30 I have yet to find. My skin is very sensitive and it feels so creamy, protects well, and my face always feels well hydrated throughout the day. I just wish it did not contain any polymers and petroleum."
"I really like this lotion. I wanted the higher SPF but not the heavy feeling. This is a light feeling lotion and sinks into my skin very quickly, I wear it alone or under my foundation."
"The product serves the purpose (mostly) of being a moisturizer with sunscreen. That being said, after a few hours my skin tends to feel dry. Maybe the moisture part is not rich enough. That or it needs to be reapplied frequently. I'm still in search of the perfect day moisturizer with sun screen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I purchased this for the SPF content and wanted to use it for my face. I tried it twice and found it would just leave my face too oily and I didn't like the feeling it gave. The search continues...
This is a good moisturizer for the summer. High enough spf for sun protection and not greasy or heavy for the warmer weather. Recommend for those with sensative skin looking for a basic moisturizer for the summer.
"I was looking for a new facial moisturizer that really hydrates my skin and is not greasy at the same time. I also needed spf in it. This one is perfect! I love that it has no harsh ingredients and it does not burn my skin like other spf. For reference, I have normal to combination skin. Please never discontinue this! I will be repurchasing forever!"
"I have really acne prone skin and really large pores that tend to be picky about what goes pn them. I tried almost every ""lightweight"" moisturizer i could get my hands on and they would still be too thick and clog my pores. This stuff was great! At first i thought it was gonna be too thick but as soon as i rubbed it into my skin ot absorbed so nice and didn't clog! Im so happy"
"I love how light this moisturizer plus sunscreen is. I put it all over face, neck, chest and shoulders. Finish up the arms, legs, and hands with a heavier sunscreen with higher SPF. I will continue to use this product. I am 69 but have good skin."
"I am ordering my 3rd. I bought this because of the good reviews, the SPF is 30 and most of all, is a few dollars cheaper then most Olay products. I like it because it absorbs quickly without an oily residue and gives a nice glow to my skin. I found it works just as well as the Olay products that cost about $20."
"This moisturizer with SPF 30 is my go to for spring and summer. I like that it is fragrance free and good for my 51 year old sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly and doesn't feel heavy on the skin, but feels moisturizing. This is the ONLY moisturizer with SPF 30 that my seems to tolerate, and I have tried everything from the department stores and the drugstores. The price is good also!"
"Just tried this product last week for the first time and was very impressed. I was looking for a sensitive skin moisturizer with at least a 30 SPF that also is oil-free. This product leaves my skin soft and protected. It offers just the right amount of moisture (not too greasy or not too light) for my post-menopausal skin. I feel I can use a liberal amount of product without fear of plugging my pores. Also, it did not sting or burn my face at all."
"Perfect for my dry senior skin. Not heavy. Not greasy. Gently moisturizes. Very comfortable. Disappears after applying. I can easily wear makeup over it if I want. I usually don't. I feel I'm protected from the sun. I can comfortably apply more if my skin feels extra dry. Skin feels soft all day, even when I sweat, which is often."
"I have pretty sensitive skin, and typically stick to Neutrogena products, but even their daily moisturizer + SPF 30 irritated and burned my skin. I'm glad I did the research because this is amazing, I gave it a try just because of the low cost and I was not disappointed! Goes on easy, absolutely no irritation and it's got a high SPF. If you've had trouble with irritating SPF moisturizers I would definitely suggest giving this a shot."
"It felt thick like a sunscreen, not like a moisturizer with sunscreen."
"Fragrance free with excellent SPF 30 sun protection at a very reasonable price! The included goodies like Niacinamide, Green tea and Vitamin E is great, but would love to have more antioxidants! Love the ability to lock the pump dispenser!"
"I love this but even though for sensitive skin, it does still clog my pores some but most sunscreens do. But it's light, and dries down and I don't look white."
Great moisturizer and sunscreen feels good on your face.
Great it's my go to daily moisturizer. Love that it's spf 30
"wonderful product, I even got some friends using it."
"On the recommendation of my dermatologist I've used this product on my face and neck for over 15 years, faithfully. Good protection from the sun. Reasonably priced, no need to take out a mortgage to use this product! Although I may not see it, I get compliments on how nice my skin looks...just wish I could see myself through their eyes:)"
"this is the best my doctor advised me to use spf 30 for sun protection,"
"Great moisturizer, works very well under fondation, Makes your skin look more healthy and luminescent."
I have tried many sunscreen lotions but this is the o e I have been waiting for really like this lotion happy with my purchase.
I have been using the Olay face cream since I was 16. Now that I am older I still getting from women I am looking so young. Thanks for your product!
This has been my only moisturizer/sunscreen for many years. I order it as needed and love ordering from Walmart because of the two-day shipping of my household items.
Love okay complete lotion moisturizer. Have used it forever
I love this formula!! I only wish it came in a tube!!! PLEASE consider selling in a tube!!
So easy for daily use. Great daily moisturizer with sun protection. Light on the face.
I like that it doesn't feel so heavy like most of the facial sunscreens.
"I've lived all over the country and no matter if it's Seattle or Texas, I need SPF. How convenient that this moisturizer has SPF 30 in it! Love the creaminess that isn't greasy."
"I was getting low on my complete spf 15 sensitive skin lotion and I decided to try this instead due to the wonderful reviews it got. I could not be happier. I was hesitant at first because I typically like an oil-free moisturizer and I thought the extra sunscreen would make this greasy, but it goes on so smooth and absorbs so quickly. Please keep this product on the shelves. I pair this with the sensitive face wash and sensitive dry/wet clothes at night and I just love all of these products, could not be happier! Thanks Olay"
"I don't know why Olay eliminated the Regular SPF 30 in lieu of this Sensitive Skin SPF 30. Wouldn't it be possible to keep both on the market? I don't have sensitive skin, but i DO need and prefer a higher SPF. The Sensitive Skin version is pasty, thick and does not absorb well. It is not well suited or well made for darker skin people and looks like I have kabuki make up on. Definitely a poor product evolution. I will sadly no longer be using Olay for my daily moisturizer needs."
"Great sun screen with SPF 30, not greasy at all. I use it everyday. Will buy again."
Great for sensitive skin/rosacea. Let's your face breathe. I tried other brands but love this one.
This protects and keeps my skin soft and clear from age spots. Love this!!!
"It is quickly absorbed so skin doesn't stay looking white, leaves facial skin soft all day"
"I previously was using daily moisturizer/sunscreens that cost between $40-$50! I tried this on a whim -- and I love it! This product feels better when it's put on and dries fast so you can move on to the rest of your makeup. I am wondering, however, if this is safe for pregnancy. If an Olay rep is ready, can you please let me know?"
"I live in FL, where the sun is a constant battle. I enjoy being tan, but I do not want the wrinkles that go along with a tan. I've use Olay daily moisturizer every day and people consistently card me, or think I'm younger than what I look like- I just turned 35yrs old. I think my young look is definitely attributed to the daily use of Olay face moisturizer. I highly recommend that all girls and ladies use this product."
"I've been looking for a new daily moisturizer with SPF and little to no fragrance. This does nothing at all to moisturize my skin. I'm in my 50s with somewhat dry skin, and when I put this on in the mornings, my face becomes instantly so dry that I can't even put cream blush on without dragging it over my dry skin. My face feels as though I haven't moisturized it at all. Won't buy again."
"If you are fair-skinned with dry skin like myself, this product is for you. It is an excellent moisturizer with the added protection of sunscreen. I have been using it for years and my daughter always tells me that I hardly have any wrinkles at 55! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has features that meet all of my needs and concerns. I feel protected when out in the sun because of the SPF 30 sunscreen protection plus all the benefits of all day moisturizer. Great to apply under makeup. I love that it is oil free with vitamin E and aloe and made for sensitive skin. Thank you Olay !!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I will continue to use your Olay products; especially with the SPF-30. I have used Olay products since I was 25 years old. I am 68 and am told I look much much younger. I tell them it is thanks to years of Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It doesn't sting your eyes, goes on nice and smooth, spf30 protection. People also say I look like I have glowing very healthy skin but it's really due to this moisturizer and its sun protecting agents that make my skin glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for some time now, and at age 69 find it to be a winner. No greasy, oily feeling. Just a nice clean feel. It is part of my A.M. regiment. I count on Olay to keep my face looking young. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always used this cream, for as long as I can remember anyway. Used the regular until the sensitive one came out. I like the sensitive one sooo much better for my face. I have oily skin so this really helps. It's nice & light and I love that it protects my face as well as I can't put anything on my face without it causing a breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer was recommended by my dermatologist years ago, and I have used maybe only one other brand of moisturizer with sunscreen, but I keep coming back to this one. I am fair skinned and wear a face full of makeup, so I find that this moisturizer works well with my primer and has great absorbency without leaving a chalky, white mess. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay for years, and very pleased with the results. Over the years I have received nice comments about my skin. I always tell the person what brand of moisturizers I use. My Daughter is a user of Olay as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this moisturizer complete with SPF 15 FOR OVER 10 YRS NOW, I LOVE IT N I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE. IT'S GOT VITAMINS E B3 & C IN IT N I LOVE TO USE IT ON MY FACE N NECK. THANKS OLAY MY FACE LOOKS SO YOUNG BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME ABOUT HOW YOUNG I LOOK N I'M 58 NOW. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK U R DOING ! THANKS !"
Olay Daily Defense All Day Moisturizer with SPF 30 for sensitive skin is my favorite everyday moisturizer because: - My skin feels soft but not oily or greasy - It has a broad spectrum SPF30 sunscreen - It is unscented (the sensitive skin version) - It goes well under any of my makeup - I have sensitive skin and this doesn't cause any irritation I get complements on my skin and would recommend this product.
"Applying the All Day Moisturizer for sensitive skin every Morning, before the make up My skin is Hydrated, feels refreshed also knowing that if I will be put in the elements I am covered from the sun. At night after washing my face, I apply the All Day Moisturizer once again and also apply to the neck line my face feels rejuvenated after a long day work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this sunscreen for about 7 years. I am glad to see that it is labeled broad spectrum. It moisturizes and protects my skin from the sun. I wear it daily. I have a sensitivity to some cosmetics, but Olay has been my go to product since 1999. Absolutely recommend Olay to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I golf at least 4 days a week and apply lotion and sunscreen. With this product I only need to apply the lotion that contains sunscreen. Saves time and works very well preventing sunburn and sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Product has a non greasy feeling. Love the way it stays on your skin all day, hydrating, till you wash it off. Does not flake off like some other creams or lotions. A very good price, reasonable in comparison to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay products since ""Oil of Olay"" was pink! I also use Olay moisturizer with Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB protection every day, no matter what the weather or season. The sensitive skin version with SPF 30 is my favorite. I put about a dime size on my face. It goes on smooth and is not oily; however, at first it has a whitish cast to it, but once absorbed and dry, it looks fine. I also use it on my neck, shoulders, and chest area. Olay products are the best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This SPF30 facial moisturizer is definitely my go-to daytime moisturizer. I have been using this for several years and love it. It's mostly physical sunblock ingredienst that protect my skin from the UV rays. It does not leave a white cast. This one is my favorite physical sunblock, and I prefer not to use chemical sunblock, so this one is perfect!! Highly recommended. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Complete Moisturizer with sunscreen for sensitive skin is my product of choice now, But when I was in my 20s, a good friend had such beautiful skin I asked her what she used. She said, Oil of Olay! So I started using it and have never looked back. Now people ask ME what I use to make my skin look so good. I say, Olay Complete! Every day without fail. Try it, you won't regret it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My husband and I both have sensitive, light complected skin. He doesn't always remember to put on sunscreen so I purchased this product to use everyday. It not only moisturizes his skin, but protects him as well. His dermatologist said this was a good routine for him. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Always apply under my makeup and neck, cleavage areas. Absorbs quickly and does not feel heavy. It has made a difference in the appearance of my skin. I have been using it for a couple of years and I haven't found anything else that comes close. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Since using this product, my skin feels so much better and looks much healthier. People think I am in my early 40's when I am in my mid 50's! I would recommend this to any woman in her 50's and 60's who have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love having SPF-30 protection right in my favorite moisturizer. It leaves my face feeling soft, clean, and renewed.I have used this product for many years and appreciate how it helps keep my face looking its best even as I age.

"I love this product. I buy it all the time. I was living in a hot desert climate & my skin would just dry out and was getting dark or sunburned. I started to buy & use the Olay SPF 30-Sensitive skin Complete moisturizer. It kept my skin from getting really dark & damaged. Now that I live in Georgia, I still use it. I try to reverse the damage that I have done to my skin in the past, & I think that this product is helping me to do that. I get compliments on my skin all the time.

"I have always felt I needed sunscreen, but couldn't find anything that gave me the quality skin care I needed. When I tried complete all day moisturizer with spf 30 I felt I had found what I had been looking for all my life! It gives me all the great skin care I want with the protection I need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you have sensitive skin, this moisturizer works reallywell. I have Rosacea and have to be selective in the products I apply to my face. This moisturizer is gentle and has the added bonus of sunscreen so I don't need to apply another product on top of the moisturizer. The price is great too and it is located conveniently at drugstores and other national stores, which is a plus for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i have been using olay moisturizer for over 40 years and would not trade it for anything else. my skin is sensitive and breaks out in the heat, So this product with the SPF 30 and sensitive skin protects my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. Hydrating, yet light and non greasy. It absorbs well and leaves a matte finish. It is not irritating to my skin at all (combination/oily) I hope Olay sticks with this formula and continues to sell this wonderful product. Interesting that even though I checked yes on recommend, it defaults to no. I recommend!"
"I was pleased with the feel of my skin after using the Olay Complete with SPF 15. It has a nice scent, and it is barely noticeable (feeling) on my skin after I apply it. I use topical medication on my face 20 minutes prior to applying Olay Complete, and the Olay Complete does not aggravate my skin or counteract the medication. I am so pleased to have the SPF already in the product because I have had sun damage over the years."
"I hated all face sunscreen because I would always get terrible blocked pores and acne (even cystic). I finally found the one. The sensitive skin one I use is very light weight and doesn&#39;t cause me any problems. It doesn&#39;t feel like sunscreen is on, with that mask-like feeling. You may need to reapply if you&#39;re sunbathing or sweating. Oh yeah, it doesn&#39;t really burn the eyes like so many do. I was happy to find my miracle!"
"I started using Olay Complete SPF 30 for sensitive skin at least 15 years ago. It is the one consistent, high-quality moisturizer that I ALWAYS come back to. I have strayed and tried other moisturizers only to go back to this one. I have never had a breakout or bad reaction from using this product. I recommend it to anyone anywhere (even those without sensitive skin) and I promise you will not be disappointed. I don't know what I'd ever do if Olay discontinued it. As close to perfect as any moisturizer on the market today."
"I live in south Florida, you have to be very diligent regarding sunscreen. I use this every day with out fail when I get out of the shower. I use liberally on my face under make up and my décolletage. This stuff is my secret weapon and I get compliments daily because I'm very freckly and fair. Please do not ever discontinue this. It is so vital."
"I used Olay as a teen but then switched to more expensive brands. My skin has changed and became extremely sensitive with age. I now use this product in Sensitive. It is great! Lightweight but seriously moisturizing. The SPF will be tested during the summer months, but I have faith it will hold up to the test.(Most with SPF's break me out with the first use, but not this one.)"
"I have sensitive skin. I returned from a Caribbean cruise and desparately needed something to rejuvenate my face after too many days in the sun. I had a sample of this product, tried it on a small area, and was instantly sold! I use it every day, and after seeing the improvement on my skin, my sister started using it as well."
"I have combination skin, so it can be tricky to find the right facial moisturizer. I finally found the perfect one when I used this. Its not too thick and heavy for my skin to break out and its not too light where my skin can dry up. This product gives my skin a perfect balance of what it needs. It also has a wonderful SPF to protect my fair skin. I would recommend this to anyone. This product not only improved my skin in so many ways, but has helped maintain a very young and healthy appearence. I LOVE this product!!!"
this product i thought was expensive & a little hard to find. but when i found the only one at walmart i was like YES!!! i use it only once a day after i was my face with Olay blemish control lathering cleanser & it moisturizes my skin very well. it seems a lil too thick but you dont even feel like you have it on. i like how it has a pump that you can lock (good for traveling) and it lasts a long time. for the price it is a good buy.
"I love this product and have used it for years. It's light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly and allows you to apply make-up over it with out smudging or smearing. I firmly believe using this product on a daily basis has kept my skin fresh and youthful looking. I am a lawyer and often get asked my age by clients, because they think I look too young to be a lawyer."
"not greasy, protects from sun damage. And Walmart delivers FAST!"
I don't use anything else. It gives my skin the protection it needs and moisturizes it too. Over the past 15 years I have tried other products but I haven't found anything else that works as good for me as this does.
"This sunscreen is everything I have been looking for - a great fragrance-free moisturizer that's not heavy or shiny for having spf 30! Love Olay, and this new try was not at all disappointing! It soaks right into your skin, no white residue."
OLAY COMPLETE SENSITIVE SPF30 IS GREAT I USE IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER WASHING MY FACE AND IT FEELS SO SMOOTH AND LIGHT. I HAVE HAD GREAT RESULTS WITH THE SPF30 DOING ITS JOB. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.
I!ve been using Olay Complete for many years now. Can't beat it especially for the price. I stopped wearing makeup almost two years ago and don't feel the need. Complete makes my skin look & feel great!

I've been using Oil of Olay for many years. How come it says spf30 in the advertisement but in the bottle is only spf15? I don't know which one is right? I like and preferred the higher spf and hoping you will make higher spf
This product is amazing. When I first started using it I had. Serious lines forming on a very dry face. Now my face is soft again and the lines not so prominent.
I have used this product for years. I was very happy when the sensitive skin formula added SPF to it several years ago. It makes my face feel smooth without feeling greasy.
I have used Olay for many years and would not give it up for anything. I am almost 51 but still have to try and convince people that I am not as young as they think I am.
It's really the best moisturizer to use. It's not greasy and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I've been using it for as long as I can remember and do not plan to switch to any other kind!
"I started using it as I need a moisturizer with high SPF. My skin is sensitive to sun, get tan very easily. After applying this I feel my skin is not moisturized enough, just feel as coating of sunscreen. It makes skin like oily skin, so have to use powder on top of it. It doesn't gives the feeling of smoothly absorbing into the skin as I feel with the olay original beauty fluid."
"This product has a list of chemical sunscreens, which as anyone with sensitive skin knows, is not for us."
Love this product the only moisturizer I can use.. I got very dry sensitive skin and this product doesn't give me any break outs. :)
I have used this for years and have never found anything better. I never write reviews but this product deserves high praise.
I've been using this product for years. I was doubly pleased when SPF 30 became available. Now I can't find it at any local store.
I have been using Olay products for many years. Started using this one about 10 years ago and will use no other. Great product to wear under make-up.
I wear Olay moisturizer everyday under my makeup. I prefer the daily sensitive skin with SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like this product not just because it smells good but make me look young [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Good moisterizer but doesn't feel heavy on your face. Keeps my face from being too dry and protectsfrom sun while feeling like I'm wearing nothing.
I have used this for several years and I like it. I have no idea why it is no longer available on the shelf and has to be ordered. Why would anyone not want to use spf30 on their face rather than spf 15 if it were available?
"Light, non-greasy, great for sensitive skin. I highly recommend this."
