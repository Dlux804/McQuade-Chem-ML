"For everyone out there frustrated with the packaging, I find that storing the product upside down on its head works wonders and I am yet to have any problems. I've gone through maybe 10 of these, had problems the first time but ever since I started storing it upside down, it's been great."
"I ran out and already I have spots on my hands. I use this to keep skin imperfections from forming on face and aging spots. I put a little on my hands each day as well. However, it takes a little getting used to. When I tried it a few years ago, I was going to return it. The bottle starts out chalky. After the first rocky few days, the product works great, better than ones that start out working and then fade. Give it a week if you try it. It'll be worth it."
I thought my old moisturizer was doing a good job. But after just the first day I realized this product was so much better! It is very thick like other mentioned but it absorbed well and after a few minutes I could layer other products over it without any trouble. I also did not notice the white cast that others complained about. It made my skin so soft and smooth! The one negative is the bottle. It took more than 50 pumps to get the product out the first time. I can't already see a lot of product will eventually be wasted.
"This product is great but I've wasted so much money on it because the pump stops working with at least half the product still in the container and no way to use it. The first time I bought it the pump didn't work and I returned it to the store for a replacement. Now, twice, after using it for a week or so, the pump just stops so now I have product but can't get it out of the dispenser."
I was not able to use this product because of the poor packaging. The lotion fills the bottle to about 1 inch from the top. The pump is not able to create enough suction to pull the lotion up to the top. I have turned it upside down hoping the lotion would flow to the top of the bottle but it's too thick. I have pumped repeatedly (more than 50 times) and nothing works. I can't get any lotion out of the bottle. A total waste of money!
"This is a fabulous product...if only I could get it out. It is too thick to be pumped! I did not see a tube connected to the pump top. I tried inserting a thin straw to work as a tube to pump, but no luck. Why would you make a product this thick and even think that it could be pumped out? Please fix these problems as I think that you have a winner here in terms of serums. I could feel it tingling on my skin and I love that it has sun screen in it."
I love the cream and have been using it for a while. I am disappointed though because the last two bottles I have bought the pump does not work. I've tried pumping it 20-30 times and have turned the bottle over and the pump still doesn't work. I have to put a Q-tip in the bottle to get the cream out.
"After buying another bottle because the tube was missing inside of the first bottle, I found this to be the same way on the 2nd bottle?????? Is there supposed to be a tube inside to pump out product or was this just poor product quality control???? I've seen other reviews about the same question"
Love the cream but your pump is junk!! Cream came out for a few days then stopped! Tapped bottle on bottom to release air bubbles in pump with no luck! Had to try to get what cream I could out of the junk bottle before throwing away! Sad container for the product for the high price! Put it in a tube and try again!
"I really like the product - great sunblock for sensitive skin (most non-mineral sunblocks make me break out) with a smooth, non-greasy finish. However, the dispenser bottle/pump cannot adequately pump the product. The product is very thick, and even storing the bottle upside down and tapping on it does not effectively allow the product to be dispensed. I would buy again in different packaging (flexible tube, for instance) but probably will not purchase again in current packaging."
"This product is terrible. It does not absorb into the skin. It sits on my skin and feels like granulars and flakes throughout the day, and that is with no makeup over it. It doesn't spread easily. I would not recommend this product and will never buy again."
"I opened my new package, & there it wouldn't dispense. After pumping about 10-15 times, nothing. I opened the lid, & no straw. I tried shaking it to the opening, but that didn't produce enough, as it was thick & dry. Had my husband take it back, & the helpful employees checked ALL the bottles. No straws. The manager spent almost FIVE MINUTES pumping it before something came out. I'm giving it 3 stars, as I love CeraVe products, so here's hoping it doesn't let me down, now that I have a â€˜new' bottle to try."
I really like this product. I have seen a consistent improvement with my skin tone and texture using this product. It really all I need on my skin during the day. Not only does it treat and protect but the finish is comparable to a good primer.
If it just had a little tint to offset the pale cast it would be perfect!
"I love this product and use it every day. But, the bottle design is awful. The pump stops working long before the product is used up. CeraVe, please redesign your bottles! I'm tired of throwing away a third of the product simply because I can't get anymore out."
"I really love this stuff. I recently found out that my skin type does not work well with oils, so I was on the hunt for something non-comedogenic. This stuff works great. Leaves my skin moisturized, and I don't have to worry about getting a sun burn when outside. Lasts all day long."
I bought 2 of these & the pump dispenser only worked 1x now I have to unscrew the cap & stick a lip pencil in it if I want to use the product & both of them have the same stupid pump that does not work would have been so much better in a tube you can use..will never buy again...
"This product works amazing for my skin. I only wish it can have a good smell. This is the only reason I don't give it a 5 star review. Other than that I LOVE THE FACT that moisturizes, protect from the sun and has retinol. I can see my skin changed thanks to it."
It is a fast absorbing cream; provides a coverage that makes the skin feel comfortably cushioned and moisturized. I go back to the dermatologist this week and I am anxious to let them know how it works on me. They had prescribed the SA Cream which I also bought and like very much.
"This sunscreen has what I wanted, SPF protection and a mild vitamin A that would help me meet my skin. It's moisturizing and makes for a decent primer under make up, it does not have a strong scent and is not overly white cast when applying to the skin. To avoid ""pilling"" I allow about ten minutes for my other products to soak in before applying this. It stops the effect."
I love your products ! I was so happy to see a daycream with SPF 30 and retinol. . .I got home and could not get the product to pump out of the tube. After a month the top broke off. I had to transfer the product into my CeraVe night lotion bottle. The night lotion came in plastic bottle with the automatic close top. You should put your day cream in a bottle similar to the night lotion
"It has only been a week, and I have already seen amazing results. I love this product! I have very oily skin and I have been breaking out lately. I'm able to use this product underneath my makeup without any primer and it completely controls my oil production. I experience less shine than I've ever had, and my breakouts have subsided. I totally recommend this product if you have oily skin."
"I use a lot of Cerave products, but was very disappointed with the Cerave Skin Renewing Day Cream. It initially goes on smooth, but then starts to peal and leaves an unpleasant residue on the skin. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this product."
"I love this product! I'm approaching my 60s and I frequently look for anti-aging products. This product takes care of it all in one cream... with anti-aging issues, face moisturizing, and spf protection. A little bit goes a long way. I use only 2-3 pumps on my entire face in the morning."
I feel my skin is hydrated!!! Didn't need to use my oils or 2nd cream!
"As we're trying to go as plastic free as we can in our personal life, wish you would too. Glass or aluminum would be a better packaging choice. I'm switching to a Neutrogena product I don't like quite as much since it is a glass bottle. Really do like the product. Also do wish it came in a version with a higher retinol - like the otc max allowed that Roc has."
The two times I was able use the product once I bought it I like it. The pump broke so there isn't really another was to get the thick cream out. So turned out to be a waste of money.
I love the average body cream and was anxious to try this new day cream but after two uses the pump stopped working. It was impossible to get the cream out. Finally in frustration I took hammer and pliers to breakbbthe hard plastic bottle apart.
"I have tried the tapping to get out air bubbles, pumping hundreds of times and finally resorted to digging it out with an orangewood stick. First time trying this product and even if I find I love it, won't buy because of the hassle."
"I have skin that could be mistaken for an oil slick. All the anti-aging products out there seemed to be focused on moisturizing and we're too heavy for my skin. I literally had stinging eyes due to increased oil on my face and I had to wash my face by 3pm. This stuff from. Cerave is great. Not irritating, has sunscreen and retinol. Not only that, but it moisturizes without making my skin greasy. Holy Grail status."
"My first bottle I had to return because it could not pump any out at all. The product is good and the exact mix of skin protection and other good stuff I was looking for, but the bottle is a total fail and pump is terrible. Please put this in a squeezable tube."
"I like the product but HATE the packaging it is in. Pump stopped working after using it twice. I like the cream a lot, but won't buy it again until you change the packaging"
I like it but after a week the pump dispenser stopped working so I can't get it out of the bottle.
"Great moisturizer, I use this every morning. No definite smell and goes on very well"
First of all I love the product. I'm only giving two stars as the dispensing system is aweful. I couldn't pump anything after it was about half used. I now have to use a q-tip to dig it out. I don't think it's worth the trouble.
Let me know when you decide to use a real pump for this product ... having to pump it 30 times to get anything is a pain . I got tired of trying to get some out with a q-tip so I threw it out.
"This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn't make my skin crawl. It soaks in immediately and doesn't leave an oily feeling like most sunscreens do. I have used it multiple times, in full sun, and have not gotten burnt once. I like this enough that every time I see it in the store I have to stop myself from buying another bottle and hoarding it."
The consistency is awful and leaves my skin white and not at all moisturized.
The pump is horrible and you have to make the bottle upside down for any product to come out. On top of that the silver coating on the packaging peels off and gets everywhere like glitter.
Pills and flakes. Doesn't add any moisture. Not sure how this product is still on the market or how it gets any positive reviews.
I don't feel moisturizing qualities in this product . The zinc oxide provides good sunscreen . Not sure about the retinol effects yet.
