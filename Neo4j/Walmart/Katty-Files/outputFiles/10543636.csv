I have been using revitalift radiant skin cleanser and the face and neck skin cream and I think it's wonderful it's the best I've ever used before! My face use to always break out with pimples since I started using this my face stays clear.
"I love this brand and all of its products! They do what they say they are going to do, but it helps if the user also works to take care of their own skin. Miracle worker...could be. My skin has definitely benefited. I am 53, and my skin has been ""extremely dry"" before this wash and exfoliator; after 16 days, it's cleaner, clearer, and more even-toned. My adult acne is better controlled, and the scaring has faded. Mornings and evenings, and then I moisurize."
"I havent used this long enough to determine the claimed tesults from the use of this product, but if it works as well anywhere near the way it feels nothing could beat it. It is so soft and silky it almost makes me not want to rinse it off. I am now wanting to try the rest of the products in this catagory. I love this!"
I'm using this face wash since 3 years and love it. It makes my skin fresh and glowing. Plus I also use other loreal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Be sure to use only a very small amount of this as it really makes a lot of foam and it is easy to get way too much. It's very gentle and my skin is sensitive so I'm very pleased.
"I love this facial cleanser. My skin gets deep clean, never dry yet it has the clean feel of soap. Love it and it lasts a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If you like taking your make up in the shower but don't want to use the harsh soap - this product is the best! It takes a make up off right away! Very creamy and a little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for over a year now. Works best when used twice a day because it does not completely remove makeup with one wash. In the last year they have changed their packaging, and it now feels cheap and more breakable plastic-like. Most annoying is the cap is now VERY hard to open (which is frustrating when you are in a hurry/ opens after much force and stuff splashes everywhere) and cracks/breaks easily. Not sure why they changed their packaging and may try another product at this rate"
"Its thick and creamy so you don't need to use much and it foams up nicely, and doesn't have an over-powering scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried alot of products in the past. Some left my face dry. Some had left my face to oily...I have searched and searched and finally I found the best facial cleanser in the world..This is very true. Try this product and I promise you will never go to anything else...Did I mention it leaves your face feeling clean, refreshed and also very soft..."
"I needed to upgrade my face wash routine from my teen years - I was finding what I had been using for years was becoming too harsh on my skin. Drying me out, messing with my complexion. I switched over to the Revitalift cleanser because I had tried the cream... Much better! My face is cleansed without stripping or drying out my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RevitaLiff by L'Oreal is amazing. I have been using this now for three weeks it is great. My face is smoother and the pores on my face have decreased to almost nothing now. It feel silky smooth once wet and foaming. My daughter uses it now too. Still use our Cerva to remove our eyemakeup and our face wipes for mascara but for overall face cleanser this stuff is perfect. Great job L'Oreal, a winner in my book."
"While this product felt soft while washing my face and also felt clean afterwards, no significant revitalizing differences were noticed. The whole tube was used as directed. However, the wash is all that was used and not followed up with the other products."
"I've tried many facial cleansers ranging from high end to low end products. I must say that this one is my favorite. I like the fact that it doesn't dry out my skin. I have pretty oil skin that tends to be dry every now and again, and surprisingly, this cleanser does everything that I desire. It leaves my skin smooth and super clean. I would recommend this product to anyone of any age. I have been using it religiously."
"So many cleansers, even creams, send me running for moisturizer. Or they leave my skin feeling unclean. I use this every morning and night with a soft ""manual"" facial brush. My skin is looking so much better already. I am using other L'Oreal products including the RevitaLift face cream for day and night, as well as the eye cream."
"I am so happy I got a chance to even consider buying some of this. I was offered complimentary some other Revitalift products, and I wanted to have a cleanser to start my routine with, so i bought some on sale, awesome price. And OH EM GEE!! This is the creamiest cleanser ever!! A little definitely goes a long way. I have to bottles and I am so happy I got them both! They will outlast my other Loreal products, but I plan on buying again. I love the system, I see results in just the first 2 weeks!"
WOW!! This cream cleanser is gentle and leaves your skin soft and supple! It is calming and it is great for sensitive skin! Combine this with the triple power moisturizer and win win win for youthful skin! I have only been using this for a short time and have seen dramatic results already! Thanks Loreal for a truly great advanced age skincare that helps with the mistakes of the past!
"I brought The product in drugs stores because my skin after my pregnancy esa very dry. After one year, tris product trasform my skin in other for better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Bought this item because I ran out of my regular cleaner and bought this by mistake. What a great cleanser. I have been using this for many months now and love how it cleans my face and how soft it makes my skin feel.
With my oily skin I like to use this at lease once a week after using my oil controlling cleanser just to keep the moisture and skin care benefits this product offers. Leaves my skin very soft.
"This is a nice face wash. It makes my skin feel clean and pretty soft after using it, but that's about it. There isnt much else about this that stands out for me personally, but it is still a very good face wash. Very good for dry skin though too."
The product is a good cleanser for my combination/dry skin. It's rich and creamy. My only complaint is the packaging. I purchased this product several times and each time the tube leaks cleanser all over the sink. Please consider changing to a pump.
"I've been using this face wash for about a month and I love it! I love the creamy cleanser it rubs on smoothly. Leaves my skin soft, best cleanser ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product several years. It leaves my skin clean and smooth,"
"I started using this cleanser when they disoncinuted the “Go Clean”exfoliater I'd been using for years (it was amazing! I was consistently told my skin looks waaaay younger than I am). This product is good, but suffers by comparison. You don't need to use much and it foams up nicely, and doesn't have an over-powering scent. However, my skin is nowhere near as fresh looking as with Go Clean, and feels tighter and more dried out. I don think I'll finish this tube, and will look for a new product."
I really like this cream cleanser. For removing heavy makeup this works great. Just a tiny amount foams up and cleans your whole face. It leaves my skin lightly moisturized and smells good. I'm very upset that stores seem to be discontinuing this item and it is hard to find.
"Revitalift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser is great! It leaves my skin feeling clean but soft. However, whoever does the packaging should be fired. The lid will not stay on the cleanser. When I go to open the flip-top to dispense product, the whole lid pops off and product spills out onto the shower floor. I've had this problem several times before. I love the product inside, but WILL NOT PURCHASE it again until the packaging is improved."
This cleanser is great. Takes off make-up even mascara. It leaves skin soft. You just have to use small amount. Love it.
second time i purchased this cleanser the top would not stayed closed and it ran all over my counter top. had to stand the tube up in a glass to prevent a daily mess.
i like the product but am concerned about the container.
I've been looking for a facial cleansing product that would exfoliate dry skin cells in a gentle manner. RevitaLift Cream Cleanser works well for me. It leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving it tight and dry.
I like it
"Since I do not wear make up, I use it 3 times per week just as a exfoliator. It works very well, to prepare the skin for other treatments and moisturizers. I am satisfied with the product in terms of price and the fact that it lasts for a long time."
"Saw this on sale and wanted to try it so picked it up on a whim. It is a nice and creamy cleanser, smells decent and not over bearing like some cleansers I have used in the past. I love that this really does give your face a nice clean. I dislike cleansers that don't give me that clean feeling or help taking any left over make up off etc but this removes dirt and any left over make up I have on my face and gives me a good clean. Will definately repurchase!"
"I find this product does wonders for a youthful appearance. Having lived on the desert 50+ years, I find this product valuable to my soft smooth supple skin. My youthful appearance is commented on frequently. I attribute most of this was done with the use of this product."
"I bought the Revitalift cream cleanser, Revitalift night cream and day cream 3 weeks ago. This wash stings my cheeks. At first I thought maybe I used too much It is smooth and creamy and feels quite good on my skin. I decided to not use it any more. I am a 31 year old black female and this is my first time ever using any of these products. Loreal I am not sure what is in this product that causes this reaction, but for me it is not safe, and/or too harsh."
"I am African American and have very oily skin. I have used this product for about a week. I found that my skin is more 'gunky' now that I have used it. It does not clean my skin of oil or exfoliate, nor is my skin softer. I am unhappy with this product."
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!!! I think I've been using this cleanser for a year now and will NOT use anything else to clean my face! I've noticed how much brighter and clearer my skin is. I also like how creamy it goes on my face. I highly recommend this cleanser!!!
"This product did exactly what it said it would do. My skin was smooth but not tight. Rinsed off nicely, no oily or greasy feeling. I love the smell, didn't make me sneeze! Gentle enough to use as eye makeup remover. I have used the RevitaLift products for many years, and have always had nice complements about my skin."
"I noticed the product when it first launched and not that long ago. I wanted a cleanser that I could trust with my sensitive/dry skin while keeping it younger looking. I use this product every morning and night, and yes I use other Revita-Lift products. I get compliments on my skin and that it's pretty skin. I love it! The product smells nice and clean and feels soft to the touch. It's packaged very nicely - I think it's color coded easier to use the line. Being 47 is memorable now."
I use this in the shower and it makes my skin - face and neck feel clean and smothe
"Been using for almost two weeks now, it foams up well and really get into my pores."
Love it will very and buy it again and again again yes
My brother in law swears by this cleanser . It's his favorite
Nice Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser for my face.
I use this product daily. I feel like it is improving my skin firmness
I love this cleanser removes all make up everytime I use it I can see it works. Its also very smooth and creamy. I use it as well to clean my beauty blender. Leaves really clean and smells great.
"I was really happy with this product because my skin needed a cleanser to target different things and my skin looks and feels so much better, I highly recommend to others."
I bought this at our local grocery store. Mostly because I had started to use other L'Oreal products. It is thick and messy. I only keep using it because I paid for it. But I won't buy again.
"L'oreal RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser is awesome! I use this cleanser in the morning and night and it leaves my skin radiant, smooth, makeup"
I use this cleanser daily and sometimes more when I wear make up. This evens out the oily and dry areas so that my face feels perfect. I will definitely by more when I run out!
I use this product every single morning after cleansing with oatmeal soap. My skin feels so silky-smooth and SO clean. I make sure to rinse 20 times (no kidding!) after cleansing. Please don't ever stop making this cream cleanser!!!
I always wear a lot of makeup and I needed something good that will clean my skin deeply and I found it.this cream cleaner cleans my makeup off to the pore.it leaves my fase clean and soft.just love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Greatly reduces blemishes if used nightly! Must use only once a day to prevent dry skin. DO this and it will NOT dry out your skin. Makes skin very clean, removes ALL makeup and old skin cells!! WILL make skin YOUNGER looking. But MUST wear sunscreen next day! Great for men too."
I love the rich moister this cleanser gives. I have combination skin but prefer the extra moister on my face that this product gives. I have purchased it several times and never had an issue with it leaking or anything to tha nature. My only product to clean my face everyday!
I really like this cream cleanser. For removing heavy makeup this works great. Just a tiny amount foams up and cleans your whole face. It leaves my skin lightly moisturized and smells good. I'm very upset that stores seem to be discontinuing this item and it is hard to find.
"This will clean your face and it will feel good. I am not sure what you are looking for, in a cleanser, but I felt clean and my face was not tight feeling. It the job, but there probably are many more out there that will do the same job. As for as a rave and recommending this to a friend, I cannot see how it will actually ever come up, since there is not dramatic difference in this product."
"I like the product, but the container is horrible! The lid will not stay on and no matter how I try to keep it stored or closed, cream always leaks out from the top and down the side of the container. It causes a mess every time I use it! I would consider buying this again if it came in a different type of container. As it is, I won't use what I have and I will never purchase this again. It's extremely messy and I've wasted a lot of the product due to oozing out at the top."
"I LOVED the Age Perfect Rich Restorative Cream Cleanser product. I absolutely hate that it has been replaced with this Revitalift Cream Cleanser. The Revitalift cleanser is too foamy and bubbly and is just a mess, where the Age Perfect cleanser was thicker, exfoliated better, and stayed in place until you washed it off. Please bring back the Age Perfect cleanser for those of your loyal customers who enjoy it as a product. I keep two tubes of it working at all times in my bathroom."
The quality of the cream cleanser is fine. What I don't like is the squeeze tube it is placed in. I find that the tiny hole frequently gets clogged and if you try to squeeze it out it squirts out all over. I took the cream cleanser and put it in an small empty pump bottle. It works just fine. Loreal Paris are you listening? Put your cream cleanser in a pump bottle. It works just fine. I would not buy it again if they keep it in the same squeeze bottle container.
"I love the cleanser. My skin feels soft, looks better and no more breakouts. And you only need a tiny bit. However, the one thing that I am disappointed/mad about is the cap. It broke when the tube was about 1/2 thru and it leaked everywhere. You need to stand it up STRAIGHT leaning against something to prevent leakage. This created a problem when I was on holiday and wanted to take the product with me."
i purchase revitalift cream cleanser on a regular basis. the past 3 purchases the flip-top lid to stand it up in shower also breaks . i have to lay it on its side with it firmly against tub side to avoid leakage.why is this for products that are so costly?
this product makes my face feel clean without drying or the burning associated with some cleansers
"not only does this cleanser clean my skin,but it also makes my skin feel fresh and soft. I feel like my skin can breath all night as I sleep"
I love this cleanser. It gets my face clean without drying or irritating my skin. My skin has never felt this good before!
"I've used the L'Oréal products for a long time now. I like them but WalMart has stopped carrying this regular cleansing cream, they are now carrying their new cleansers that exfoliate, etc. So, I had to order it as “Site to Store""."
I have tried lots of make up remover but this one is the best. After having my skin ID done i used all the products recommended and I must say it's amazing how my skin looks at my age..
My 80yr old mother truly enjoys the companion cleanser that goes with her moisterizer.
"Just what I have been looking for, feels so good, not drying."
it works great and leaves my skin smooth. a bottle goes a long way . price is great too
I LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT REALY REMOVES ALL MAKE UP AND OVER SHORT TIME YOUR SKIN FEELS
Its very very very good i like it a lot. hihihihihihihih [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Best kept secret! Used to be under $6.00 but just raised :(- . Love this product- just as good as products much, much more expensive."
This face wash feels so creamy and yet it foams up a lot! Which I love a little goes a long way and price is unbeatable
Since using Revitalift Cream Cleanser I have a lot fewer blemishes. My skin feels so clean and fresh after washing.
"I think L'Oreal should move forward and rid themselves of the use of cheap dangerous preservatives. The amounts of parabens in all their skincare products is scary. Ladies, you should be reading these ingredient labels."
Skin feels clean and smooth even after just one use !
This is so gentle and my face loves it. It does the job well and it never feelks dry.
"I bought two and both leaked from the lid, which lost a lot of product."
"Creamy and hydrating! Can't find in store anymore, so I buy online."
how gentle it is on my face and how well it cleans
I bought this from target and its a really good cleanser. i have sensitive skin.
This is a great cleanser for the winter months when my face gets really dry.
Cleans skin beautifully. Leaves it feeling fresh and tightened
It is too thick for my preference.
I have been using Loreal cleanser for about 6 - 7 years and like results I get with it.
"Have used for years, great cleanser and helps keep skin smooth."
It really makes your face smooth
Works great
