My favorite day cream.it make my skin look and feel so soft Smith and firmer.at 62 I feel happy that I found a day cream that will make my skin rejuvenated. Love love love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Silky smooth to the touch. It is not sticky and heavy. Goes on skin very easy. I think this is the best product of its kind I have ever used. I am very pleased with it and would say to at least give it a try.
"I purchase this about a month go and have been using it everyday under my makeup. It moisturizes my face really good, especially during the cold winter months. It is lightweight and doesn't feel to greasy. I love it!"
"I love these products, so light and actually see a difference! Won't change brands ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was running out of a expense skin care product that I have been using for close to twenty years. So I ran into my local big box store to get something to hold me until my product arrived. I saw that they had the revitalift day and night bundled in one box for an excellent price so I bought it. I've been using it now for 6 months and have not gone back to my expense skin care. I have also bought the face wash and that product is so creamy, just love it."
i try these product frist time and love it . it smell good and my skin feel soft after using it.
"I Love this day face cream. I've been using this face cream for years. It maintains my skin moist, my pores invisible and serves as an excellent base cream for my make-up! And the price is excellent! None better."
"I have been using L'oreal for years, but I used the Perfect Age anti wrinkle. I decided to try this because it had good reviews, it was less expensive AND it says Retinol A. When I opened the package, it says Ingredients: sunscreen Use: sunscreen. That is all it says until you get to inactive ingredients & then it lists about 20 things. I am wondering if L'oreal got called on the fact that is is NOT an anti aging cream, but only a sunscreen. I will not buy this again because of that."
"The texture of this cream is fantastic, tons of moisture and it doesn't pill under makeup. Love the SPF although I wish cosmetics companies would offer SPF 30 or higher for day creams. However, the perfumes in this make it unusable, the smell simply does not fade as I wear it. Why was the heavy fragrance necessary? I don't think I'll take a chance on L'Oreal again."
"I was looking for a good, daytime moisturizer with sunscreen. This one is better than expensive moisturizers I have tried. I highly recommend. Goes on smoothly and smells very fresh."
I began using this product over a year ago..It really does work. My skin is firmer and softer and has diminished fine lines on my face.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This works super well and I've bought it a few times! I would recommend it to anyone and give it 11/10 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started a daily routine of the Revitalift daycream and nightcream about a month ago. I never had used moisturizers regularily and my face was dry from exposure to the sun and elements. I noticed a great improvement in only a few days and can now both feel and see a difference.
I just bought this and looking forward to the outcome. I really like that it is not heavy on the skin and doesn't have the sunscreen scent to it. I workout during the day and usually with other moisturizers my face will be sticky and accumulate a lot of grease right after. This is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very pleased with the product. I could definetly tell a difference within a couple of weeks. Very easy to apply and does not appear greasy or oily at all.
This was the face cream I bought by LOreal . It was also the one that Sunscreen in it that didn't melt off my skin in the Texas heat. Thank God it even works in Florida.
"I have actually never used this product (but I'm planning to) but, My 30-40 year old aunt did and all I know is that her skin looks amazing, wrinkle free, and fabulous all the time! I love how it looks and it seems like a great buy!"
"This was a very nice moisturizer. This kept my face very well hydrated during the day. I like that it has an SPF in it too, because that is always what I look for in a day cream. Made my skin look and feel healthy."
"Bought this 2 month's ago and I apply every morning. No difference at all. I have a few fine lines on my forehead , mouth and my neck. No difference at all."
Is this product supposed to have a gritty texture? When I rub it on my skin it feels like an exfoliant but it is supposed to be a moisturizer. It hydrates just fine but I'm worried that maybe I have a defective batch?
I bought this a while back and i have been in love ever since.
I have been using this cream as my morning routine for more than 15 years and my skin is firm and soft with additional benefits of sunscreen.
I have been using this about two weeks now and i can tell a difference in the apperance of my wrinkles.
I bought this for my 80yr old mother and she absolutely loves the effect it has had on her skin. She wishes that she had began using long ago.
I love the Loreal Anti Wrinkle firming day cream I have been using it for 3 weeks see visible results.
I love this thick moisturizing cream. And the fact that it is 25 spf is such a bonus. My skin is soft and smooth. I am a fan
"amazing product I have purchased my second one already, makes my skin look younger and protects from the sun living in south Florida that is definitely a plus!!"
"I used this and it actually helped do what I was wanting it to do. Softened, [most products do that] it lightened brown sun spots on my arms and made a difference in the texture of my skin. Using it on my arms was sort of a test. I think you will notice a difference if used daily."
Just started using. I didn't buy for the Anti wrinkle benefit ... I have another cream for that. I just wanted a light SPF that didn't break me out. I gradually work up to 3 hours on my face but after 1 hour I didn't break out. Fingers crossed I can use this for the winter during the 10-2 peak UVA/UVB time.
I have been using this since 2004 and definitely will recommend it. It applies smoothly and absorbs very easily into the skin. It has helped remove dark spots off my face and keeps my fine lines at bay. I use this every single day and get compliments on my skin all the time. When worn under make up it does not feel caked and works as a primer too. Only drawback is it stings when it gets in the eyes so pay special attention not to get it too close tho the corner and you will be fine lol.
I just started using this wrinkle cream and finally I found one that shows results.
Perfect Anti Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 25. nice for you face
great formula. perfect balance between moisture firming factor. that's why the product stays on shelves.
I have used this and other L'OREAL products for many years and will continue to do so. Always great products!
Been happy with this product and the spf protection I get since I live in Florida. Just added the night version to the routine and eager to see my results.
"I used L'Oreal Revitalift™ Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Day Cream for four weeks and saw change almost immediately. Even my Dad said my skin looked brighter, and people tell me I look younger all the time. In fact, just today, I went out without makeup and was fine. Before I'd never do that because I felt self-conscious about my under-eye bags and always applied atleast concealer. Really happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream smells great, and I have used it now for two days for my wrinkles under the eyes. It says that in 4 weeks I should see significant improvement in terms of less wrinkled skin. For now, I am very happy with my purchase. The price is great and so is the quality. I use this cream for the day. For the nigh I have a different anti-wrinkle cream. Once I used this one up, I will purchase again the night cream from Walmart.com from L'Oreal brand."
"I used this for years and loved the feel on my skin and the results I got. Unfortunately, the cream is not the same anymore. It's a thinner consistency, smells like alcohol and irritates my skin. I'm really disappointed as this was such an awesome product before. Won't buy again."
I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 now for a couple of weeks. I am very impressed with how it has tightened my skin up! The fact that is has an SPF 18 is an added bonus. I will continue to use this now that i know that it works on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 40 years old and i realize that i have to do more to take care of my skin. I was looking for a product that I could continue to use that would work. I have normal skin but i am starting to notice wrinkles and sagging. After a week of using this product, I noticed more softer soother skin. after 2 weeks i noticed a reduction in the fine wrinkles on my forehead and eye area. Great product I will continue to use and purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Revitalift Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 Is an incredible product. Not only is it firming, it keeps my dry skin moisturized. Added sunscreen really helps. We need to wear sunscreen everyday to protect our skin from the elements. I never leave home without wearing sunscreen. So glad this product firms my face and neck and keeps me protected from the elements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this is an excellent product to shorten your morning routine as it already includes sunscreen. It does seem a little heavier than the other daytime cream but it is still light compared to other creams. Goes on smooth not oily and has a pleasant slightly stronger scent. Packaging is up to L'Oreal standards - done very nice. Easily stored in your medicine cabinet or tucked in your bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream has been fantastic on working on my wrinkles. My husband noticed and commented in how he saw a noticibable difference. The scent is clean and it dosent clog my pores. Im hooked for life [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this face cream! The lotion is light, non sticky and great that it comes with sun protection. The cream also makes a good primer. I prefer to use a night moisturizer and gave the rest of the jar to my friend. She also enjoyed the soft lotion, light scent, and sunscreen. I believe the cream is comparable to many higher costing facial creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming with spf18, feels great on the skin. It's very creamy and not oily at all. My skin is usually oily so that's a plus. Waiting to see if it does firm my skin. May have to reapply for sunny days, since it doesn't feel to hold up in the sun for very long. Although it is only spf 18 which isn't much protection for direct sunlight, it is better than not wearing any sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed this day cream and really appreciated that there is SPF in it. It makes one less step I have to take in the morning. It feels nice on my skin and isn't too greasy. My skin gets greasy on its own and this definitely didn't add to it. I would recommend this to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The cream goes on with a thick feel but absorbs quickly. It left no greasy feel and my makeup applied nicely over it. The smell is light and dissipates fairly fast. The product makes my skin feel very hydrated while on but after washing my skin is still very dry so I didn't get any ongoing moisturizing from it. After using the product for several weeks I have not noticed a change in the firmness of my face and no one has mentioned seeing a difference in my. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product every morning for the last 3 weeks. I think that it does go on easily, but does make your skin feel a little bit greasy. So far I have not noticed any results from the product, it might be too soon to tell. I have sensitive skin and the day cream has caused a few break-outs. I am not sure if I would try this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oréal revitalift anti wrinkle firming facial day cream spf 18 is a great moisturizer. I put it everyday u derneath my make up and it blends I. Perfect too. Makes my skin softer and younger looking, this product is definetly a 5 star and Hands up. A great campaign [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have really enjoyed using this day cream. It covers great while adding elasticity to my skin and I do not need to use a large amount. It is smooth and easy to apply with a light fragrance and a decent amount of spf. My skin feels soft and refreshed and it meshes well with my makeup and other products. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the firming facial day cream daily under my makeup for a couple of weeks now and I absolutely love the subtle difference I've noticed. My skin is smoother and brighter. I will be purchasing more of this at some point. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Day Cream was very light and a little goes a long way. After using the Day cream for just 2 weeks, my husband commented that my skin looked like it had a brightness to it or a 'glow' in his words. That comment alone was enough to make me want to continue with this product!! The cream has a nice fresh fragrance and really blends in to the skin with no greasy feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I honestly had my doubts about this cream because I've tried other firming creams with no results. I'm only 32 and have a few wrinkles on my forehead already. I've only used this for a few weeks and the wrinkles have diminished very well. I like the scent as well. It's very light and pleasing. It also didn't leave my face feeling greasy. It left my face very smooth and soft. I think I'm going to replace my existing moisturizer with this one for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product a lot! My skin is usually dry and somewhat flakey in certain areas. This product really moisturized in all the right areas without feeling greasy. My skin tends to also be extra sensitive and usually when i put anything on my face, i end up with cligged pires and pimples. I didnt get either with this product. I cannot honestly attest that my skin was firmer because I didnt notice any change. I would definitely buy this product for its moisturizing benefits though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product everyday for 2 weeks and have noticed a change in my skin. My suffer from acne and was suprised that this has seemed to help. My skin is clearer, softer and have noticed some fine lines habe diminished. Will definitely buy in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'oreal Paris RevitaLift AntiWrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18....that's a mouthful. In spite of the complicated name, I really like this cream. I love the fact that it has built in sun protection because who wants to spend time having to apply multiple products? Not me...I feel like I am indulging in something luxurious whenever I use this. It is creamy without feeling greasy and I definitely like that. It moisturizes and I have to say that my skin appears smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Face cream overall was a pretty decent product. Didn't make my face excessively oily, but did moisturize really well. I don't know that I would buy this product during summer months, but I will be trying it out all winter during the months when skin gets chapped and dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this cream was very hydrating. I apply it under my makeup and have no use for my primer anymore. My skin feels so baby soft all day after I apply. My husband has even commented that whatever I'm using on my face is working. It absorbs within a minute. It's also very cool when you apply. It ""wakes up"" my face in the morning. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using this day cream for several weeks now... I really like how light this cream feel going on... It keeps my skin nice and hydrated during the day under my makeup.. would definitely recommend to other women... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I must admit that I was a little skeptical when first trying this out. I thought I may be a little young for any anti wrinkle creams, but I definitely noticed a difference after using this. My skin appeared smoother after using this and I could see a more youthful look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After one week I could tell a difference in my skin. It was smoother and softer. It does have a light fragrance but it's not over powering at all. The longer I've used it the better my skin looks. It makes your skin feel silky smooth after you apply it. I also like the fact that it doesn't feel greasy on your skin. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very happy with this day cream. The added benefit of SPF is always desired no matter where you live because it's everywhere. Only thing I do have to say about the whole line is that the labeling is lacking a bit and I almost mixed the day and night creams up a lot and the labels are very easily removed (expecially if you have children). Other than that I love the whole line and would recommend for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoy this face cream! I love the way it makes My face feel so Soft! Ive noticed that my face does look a little more put together and tighter but not a whole lot, i also have only been using it for a couple weeks and i feel like im getting good results so far! I love that it has spf in it so i can make sure i dont burn and dont have to worry about putting sunscreen on top of the face cream! Overall i really enjoy the product!0 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the fact that this day cream already has SPF in it so I don't need to worry about putting on more sunscreen. I have been using this product for about a week now, and haven't seen the effects yet, but I don't think results happen that quickly. The cream itself goes on nice and disappears without leaving a film or having it feel weird on my face. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'oreal's Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF18 has a nice rich texture as well as a pleasant scent. I used this every morning after getting out of the shower and it went on smoothly. A little cream goes a long way which is a plus when I go to purchase this again when my jar is empty. My skin is definitely smoother and I want to believe it's firmer also. This product is something I would expect from L'Oreal and it performs well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't usually use beauty products because they're usually a hassle, but I love this product and will definitely continue to use it. I can't tell you how much it improved the look and feel of my skin and do it justice. Go get it yourself and see how amazing it is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this as a daily moisturizer routine. I don't wear make up so I love this cream since it moisturizers and yet is still light. Not greasy or heavy on the face. Perfect with the bit of SPF too, since I have fair skin and need that daily bit of protection to prevent damage. I will continue to use this cream, very nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical at first and then read how easy it is to apply and gave it a shot. My face is firmer. It has spf in it which makes it excellent for using out and about running errands and I never felt greasy! I am so pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it! Thanks L'Oreal!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been looking for a day cream for a while and was excited to try the L'Oreal cream. I'm a fan. I have used the cream for a week and am very happy. The cream goes on nicely and my skin feels softer. Other creams I've used have left my skin greasy but I've not had any issues with the L'Oreal cream. The cream also has a pleasant smell.

"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I definitely see a difference. The lines around my mouth, lip area are noticeably decreasing. I will continue to use this for the foreseeable future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is awesome! It is soft and goes on smooth and absorbs quickly which is a big plus if you want to put make-up on right away. It definitely helped with the fine lines and wrinkles and I will buy it again. I am over 50 and it makes my skin look great! I was starting to get those creases around the mouth and they are now gone. I am thrilled and will be buying this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the feel, smell and how light and creamy it is. It absorbs well with no greasy feeling. I am able to put on my make-up immediately after use. My skin does feel firmer but I seen no difference in wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this daily, and my skin felt so soft and smooth. Now I realize how dry and lifeless my skin was before using it! I guess it is possible to ""feel"" young again, whether I look it or not! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. It's important to me that my day moisturizer has SPF in it, as I live at a higher altitude and am pretty sensitive to the sun. This is a great product that went on smoothly and protected my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well, been using the spf sunscreen day cream moisturizer for a few weeks now. I love the fact that when I was out in the cold elements at work. My face did get overly dry and windburn feeling like it normally would with my other facial moisturizer. Also the lines by my mouth are slowly fading as my face gets firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this for a few weeks I've noticed a difference in the firmness of my facial skin. I don't have wrinkles, so can't comment on that, but otherwise, I think it works. It's nice to have a sunscreen and cream in one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't have alot of wrinkles as I'm only 34 but I could definitely feel a tightening effect. It feels nice while on and I think it would make a drastic difference if I had more to work with. Either way I like the way it feels. I don't know that I would buy it right now but I'll definitely use the rest of this tub and when I do have more wrinkles this is the brand I'll first consider [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Revitalift day cream for the past couple of weeks and let me just say how awesome my face looks !!! This cream goes on light and smooth and is great to put make up over. There is no oily residue like some other creams and at the end of the day it doesn't feel dry. Easy to wash off before bed I am one happy lady!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is a good moisturizer. I didn't get to use it for the recommended 4 weeks to see if it reduced wrinkles but I also don't have many wrinkles. Therefore I can't judge its wrinkle reducing capabilities but I can tell you it moisturizes well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a decent moisturizer with the added benefit of some protection from the sun. I love the smell.It kept my skin moisturized. My only complaint is it didn't make my skin feel any firmer. My wrinkles look the same. No more no less than usual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this daily, and honestly do not see much difference in how my face looks and feels. The scent is great. No crazy scents, just a subtle clean scent. The texture is smooth and creamy. It is not thick, but the perfect consistency. A little goes a long way. I just wish I saw a difference in how my face looks and feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good day cream that does not leave my face feeling greasy. I have not used anti-wrinkle/firming products before this on a consistent basis, so I want to give it more time to see how this does. It does have a fragrance to it which could deter customers with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using it for a couple of weeks. My skin is so soft.my skin doesn't feel greasy. I'm noticing a huge difference on my forehead frown lines. A little goes a long way. I wash my face in the morning. Then I apply the cream. I let it sink into the skin for about 5 minutes. Then I put on my foundation. You must try it. You won't regret it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Day cream is a nice moisturizer for under your make-up since it soaks into your skin and does not have a heavy-greasy feel to it. It also has a pleasant fragrance. My skin feels more supple but I am unable to tell as of yet if it is reducing my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am happy with this product. I like the amount of spf that it contains. I feel that it has been making my skin smoother. I do have to say though that a little goes a long way. If you use too much I feel that is when the product starts to make your skin oily and greasy. The scent of this product is soft so its not irritating. It has a scent I can't describe. Harsh scents make my skin crawl and this product does not do that to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ok so I've been trying this out for three weeks and I couldn't be happier. I use the day and night cream. Eye cream was not giving the results I needed and quite honestly it is the same cream as the day one; so I stopped using it. However the day and the night creams are the bomb! Face is hydrated and wrinkles are slowly erasing away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a great product. I wasn't 100% sold at first, the first week I wasn't feeling it but once I got to the second week I could see a difference. I mean I'm only in my early 30 and I only have a few trouble spots but on the second week those spots were pretty much gone. I'm always looking for a good day cream with spf. You're never to young to start preventing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't wear foundation so it's important for me to have a moisturizer that makes my skin look and feel great. I can't believe how smooth my face feels and it's not too heavy for our crazy humid Texas weather. The sunscreen is a huge plus for times when I'm outside not thinking about how much sun I'm getting. I will definitely continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for about a week and didn't really see any changes. I continued for about 2 more weeks and am seeing great results now. The cream feels good going on and smells pretty too. I will recommend it all my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a pretty decent product. It was easy to apply, smells good and isn't oily after application. I don't really see a decrease in fine lines yet, but it's only been about 3 weeks. My skin definitely feels and looks better, though. You don't really need to know anything before trying this product. I have pretty sensitive skin and I didn't have any problems.

I have been using the L'Oréal Anti Wrinkle Cream/ Firming Faceial Day Cream for almost 2 weeks now and have been very pleased with the results. I like how the cream goes on so smooth and it is very easy to massage into my skin. It doesn't leave my face greasy at all. I would say I started to notice a difference on Day 4 or 5! I still have wrinkles but they are far less visible than before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I always appreciate beauty products that includes sunscreen and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 fits the bill. My only wish is that it's a physical blocker instead of a chemical one. I love having the convenience of a firming cream and sunscreen so I don't have to apply twice the products.

"I've been using the L'Oréal Recitalist Anti-wrinkle and Firming day cream for a few weeks now. I really enjoy how smooth my skin appears. My skin hasn't reacted to this, which is huge. I usually break out or have hives. No noticeable fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Anti wrinkle and Firming Facial day Creme for a few weeks now. I can definitely tell a difference in my skin it is much firmer. I also love that the cream absorbs into your skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for few weeks now and I'm really liking it. The consistency is not too thick and sinks into my skin fairly quickly. My skin looks more refreshed and smoother after using it. This cream is perfect for it and while it has not totally changed, I have noticed an improvement. I will definitely continue using it. The sunscreen is a plus like having a all in 1 face cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle+Firming cream works wonders on my tired looking eyes! I use it morning and night. It's helped reduce the puffiness and keeps skin moisturized all day. Works well under makeup as well. A little goes a long way, no need to use much of it to fully cover the eye area. The scent is very pleasant and feels amazing on skin!

I have been using loreal anti aging day cream for a couple of weeks now and I can already notice a different. My fine lines are getting smaller and my skin I'm looking younger and healthier. It does have a small scent but I like it. The only negative thing is that it does make your skin feel a bit greasy and I wouldnt recommend wearing it under makeup. But I do like it and will repurchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This day cream worked great! It absorbs very quickly and it does not leave my skin feeling greasy. It has a nice clean scent. After using it a few weeks I have noticed firmer skin & less fine lines. This is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It seems hard for me to find a moisturizer with SPF that doesn't feel greasy all day after I've applied it. Even harder to find one that doesn't make applying makeup a challenge. I've been using RevitaLift daily and my face isn't shiny, and my skin doesn't feel heavy like other lotions with sunscreen. This ones a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this lotion is perfect if you're looking for a conditioning lotion that also has sunscreen in it for daily use. I tried using this together with the face and neck lotion as suggested but it was just too much. My face felt greasy and heavy and I broke out in a few spots. I definitely recommend this cream but for me not with the two creams together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Revitalift Anti-wrinkle + forming day cream is a great moisturizer! It goes on a little think but has a smooth feel to it. Once it dries it feels weightless on skin. It has kept my skin moisturized during these cold, dry months. Overall it feels and looks great and works wonderful. My wrinkles around my eyes and forehead are less noticeable and skin appears AND feels firmer.! Yay for 'day' moisturizer!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Eye cream was a perfectly generated formula. Night Cream has an oily consistency first thing in the morning. Otherwise the products formulation is great. Great affordable product put on the shelves. I will be sure to refer the products to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This yummy product was the bomb! Light, silky-clean scent too! A little went a long way and that's great for the budget. What was great for my face though were the results. Soft, dewy, wrinkles diminished- exactly what I hoped for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a very good cream it helps keep your skin stay soft and smooth all day. I have very dry skin so it keeps it from looking flakey on my nose. It has helped my skin feel a little firmer and I feel with continued use it will improve. I plan to use it to find out. Overall I believe the product would be worth the price to find out.

"I started my morning out this morning by applying the Revitalift anti wrinkle firming facial day cream . It went on very smooth, and felt good as it was being applied. Throughout the day I could feel it doing its job. I felt much younger. Perhaps it was my imagination but it just made me feel good! Also, i'm pleased it has an SPF of 18 because my face is very fair skinned and sensitive to the sun! What a wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loving how soft this cream makes my soft feel. I have oily skin and sometimes cream clog my pores and make me break out. This cream is light and makes my skin feel so soft. Doesn't clog my pores and has sun screen protection which mean I don't have to apply yet another product on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although, I want a thick rich moisture cream at night, I really do like my skin to breathe during the day and this product is ideal for that. Unlike many moisturizers with sunscreen, this cream feels very light, almost like a lotion, not sticky or heavy. Like the night time cream it has a very subtle fragrance that you barely notice. Since I rarely wear makeup during the daytime, it gives me the ideal combination of moisture and protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried a thousand different products in my life,excited each time only to be disappointed . Well I really feel that this product works and I can look and see that there is a visible difference in my skin. That feels awesome. Is it plastic surgery difference? No , but i can see a difference and my skin looks great that to me is a winner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, it's too greasy day cream for my combination skin. It's a good product for winter. For me it's a least favorite cream from L'Oreal. I'd like to have a light day cream with SPF. I use all 4 products and my skin looks fresher and soft. And I really appreciate an opportunity to try this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was amazing. It contains sunscreen, but does not have a greasy feeling like so many other products. It went on smoothly and I could feel it moisturizing my face. Since sunscreen is so important to keep your face from aging I highly recommend this product just for that purpose. One of the best products I've used containing sunscreen.

"Does this product really work? Well, seeing is believing. After using this product for two weeks, a young woman sitting beside me at a luncheon kept looking at me and finally said, ""You have the most beautiful skin"". I'm almost 69 years old and that conversation took place several days ago. I'm still smiling, lol. P.S. I did tell her my secret. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
We were getting ready for a long day of hiking. I decided to try the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream with an SPF of 18. I knew I was going to be in the sun most of the day and wanted to see how well it would work. It worked like magic. My face was hydrated and thanks to the SPF I did not burn. But my husband forgot to wear any SPF and he got a sunburn on his face. All the products in this group are so amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Refreshing, firming, & sunscreen all rolled into one with L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18!!! It's so nice to finally have all these qualities in one product!!! I have sensitive skin and a perticular issue with scent when it comes to most skin care products but this product has saved me from any discomfort and has been quite pleasant experience!!!

"I have sensitive skin so please keep that in mind when reading this review. I was excited to get started using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream but after 3 days of applying it, I found that my skin was breaking out. My makeup didnt5seem to agree with the crexam either as it just sat on top of my skin and rubbed off way too easily. I will most likely not continue using this on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I spent the better part of three weeks trying the anti wrinkle and firming facial daily cream. I feel that it is very greasy, but to be honest, I have extremely sensitive facial skin. This caused me to break out, and no matter what I did, my face would be oily all day long, until I washed my face in the evening. Overall, I did not see any difference on the firmness of my skin nor any anti wrinkle difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a very satisfactory product. Does not have an overwhelming fragrance that some creams have. My skin absorbs this very nicely. I have very dry skin in the winter months and it has helped tremendously! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for 3 weeks and my skin feels fantastic! I put it on every morning and do not have to wait long to put my makeup on. My skin is not greasy at all either. After three weeks, my skin feels more elastic and looks more vibrant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face has always been extra oily, so I have to be careful what products I use. I used the Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Day Cream and it's too thick. I applied liberally and it was just too much. It's very greasy and made my face very oily feeling. The only good thing is that it smells very nice. I was hoping for a little less greasy and thick moisturizer. Also, was hoping for a higher SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This day cream is exactly what I was looking for! I've been looking for a cream that isn't too thick or oily and the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 fits the bill exactly! My skin feels sooooo much better when using this and I'd recommend it to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my favorite of the four products I sampled. Cream went on smoothly, did not leave a greasy feeling. Only had to use a small amount to get the feeling I desired. Cream left face feeling hydrated all day and had a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 was actually really awesome! I applied the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 about 30 min before my makeup. It wasn't oily and didn't feel caked on and my face stayed hidrated throughout the day without feeling gross. I highly recommend the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like using the day cream. It is a lighter cream and not to heavy. It's perfect because you can still wear your makeup with it. It won't smear off or look funny. The day cream isn't greasy either. I really like that it has spf so I'm protected from the sun. The whole line has instructions on the box to so you know what to use and when. This is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far so PERFECT! I'm on week 2 and I definitely feel a big difference from when I started. I was using a generic brand before I started this new product and boyfriend can you tell the difference! You definitely get what you pay for. For the small amount that I use it can't believe how awesome and firm my face is feeling! I can't wait to continue to use this and continue to spread the word!!

"I've been using this product for some time now. I have a problem with very dry skin in the fall and winter months. I also swim every morning so my skin really needs a moisturizer. This product has worked very well for me. It goes on well and seems to absorb rapidly. It's not necessary to use very much at a time. It does have a slight ""make-up"" odor to it but that seems to dissipate quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found this works great on days I go for a no makeup makeup look. It seems to leave my skin feeling very supple and hydrated. It also works as a great base for my mineral power foundation on light makeup days. Using this along with the night cream has really left my skin with a wonderful PLUMP feeling !!

"I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for a little over 2 weeks now. The cream is firm in the jar, but it glides on your face very easily. I was afraid that using a night cream might cause my skin to be oily, but it hasn't. I think that my skin is in better condition than it has been in quite a while. I like how quickly the firming night cream is absorbed. The cream does have a fragrance, but I don't find it too strong or unpleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My new favorite day time cream ! I Have been using it for two weeks now, and have seen great results. My skin stays hydrated throughout the day , feels soft and firmer already. Absorbs easy and fast. Great product that I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great face cream with sunscreen.I live in Texas,and use face creams without sunscreen a lot,most of them burn my eyes.The L'Oréal facial cream did not do this,it also did not have a over powering scent.I would suggest if your going to the beach use this and put a sweat proof sunscreen along with it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. It smells good and is not sticky. A little bit goes a long way. I put this on every morning in place of moisturizer by Benefit that I usually use. My face did not fill dry at all. This is the time of year that my face gets really dry because of the cold weather and I always have a hard time keeping it moisturized. This moisturizer lasted all day. I also noticed a glow to skin after using this on a daily basis for the past two weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using my L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Farming Facial Day Cream for a week now. I can definitely see a difference in my skin already. I love how soft my skin feels when I put it on. It even helps my makeup look better. I would definitely recommend it in a heart beat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this day cream alot. It wears good under my make up. I like that it has sun protection, although it's not high some protection is better than non. My skin feels hydrated but not oily and it looks smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Good product that applies easily and doesn't leave me feeling too overly greasy. I tried this in the fall, so I'm not really able to speak for it's SPF 18 feature but I can imagine it would help with protecting my skin on sunny days without leaving me pasty white. The facial cream smells good and while I haven't seen any outlandish visual improvements, it makes me feel better about myself that I'm taking care of my skin and keeping it healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 feels great on my skin. I've used it daily and it appears to have helped my skin feel smooth. I liked that there isn't a strong fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how it's SPF 18 rather than the usual products that comes at SPF 15. It moisturize well on my face especially during the fall/winter time. It goes on well and absorb rapidly. I like how there is also no odor on this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the fact that Revitalift Day Cream is anti wrinkle but even better is the sunscreen SPF 18. I need to wear sunscreen and this felt nice going on and didn't make my skin feel greasy a few hours later which some creams do. That makes all the difference as to whether I will or won't use it. This has very little scent, if any, and will stay in my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this goes on so light and smooth. It doesn't feel like a chore and it slightly works as a primer. I really hate having to do so many steps in the morning and have since removed my primer step. L'Oreal is a lifesaver at a reasonable price point. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only had this product for a couple weeks so I didn't want to write a review yet because the product box say 4 weeks to see improvement in skin but I can already see and feel a difference. It doesn't feel greasy or heavy on my skin. Excited to see more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 is thicker than the day creams I am used to. I'm not sure if I'd personally like that in the summer, but in the winter I definitely appreciate it. My skin definitely feels more hydrated. I would prefer a higher level of SPF protection than 18 so I don't have to follow with a SPF 30 sunscreen to feel protected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that it's easily absorbed, not greasy. I haven't really used much of it, but so far so good. I have sensitive skin, and I'm glad that every single L'Oreal cream that I have tried never causes any skin irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Loreal RevitaLift Day cream mositurizer is great for days without make-up with SPF 18 to protect your face from the sun. I have seen some difference in the appearance of my skin with finer wrinkle lines around my mouth. I didn't give it 5 stars because I did experience difficulties when I applied my foundation on top of it. It was a little sticky and didn't blend well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the firming Facial day cream with spf 18. I do not wear a ton of makeup so this works great for me giving me spf protection when I put it on. It also helps with reducing my wrinkles! I feel great using this and cant wait for more improvements! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was just ok for me. It was good as a moisturizer but there didn't seem to be anything spectacular about it to me. I will continue to use it to see if any anti-wrinkle effects take place but I would probably not re-purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"when I received this product I was excited to try it, it has some pros and cons. Pros - it does moisturize, and gave my skin a glowing look with my everyday powder. Love that it gave me that JLo glow with out using so many products. Cons- takes too long for your skin to adsorb, will start sweating immediatley after applying. A little to thick for my skin, I have a very light form of rosacea and it did not irritate it. But I did break out a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream felt great on nice and light. But it smelled a bit to much like sunscreen to me. If you are sensitive to smells you might not like this cream. It did go on smooth and didn't leave me feeling greasy. The SPF in Florida is an essential for me and my pale skin. i would purchase this cream again as the coverage worked well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of the cream. It is not heavy, not greasy. Just light and smooth. Prior to starting this, I used a primer before my foundation, but that is no longer necessary. My skin feels soft all day. It smells good too - not too strong, but pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The best part of his facial cream is that you get a two for one on the application! You only have to moisturize and you are putting sunblock on! It doesn't leave you feeling greasy either like most sunscreens do! I love how soft my skin feels and once again the smell is pleasant. I would recommend this cream to help keep skin looking loved and young! Even in my picture there wasn't a high shine from using the cream! Awesome! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love the Revitalift Day cream. Using it has solved a major problem for me. I really need to use a sunscreen everyday but never knew when to put it on. Before my moisturizer or after. This product answers that question for me besides the benefit of anti wrinkle and firming cream. My make-up goes on smoothly and stays smooth all day. I love that this product does it all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this cream was amazing!!! Didn't felt greasy, sticky, or uncomfortable to apply! I love the texture I felt it didn't wear off if i sweat! I say this because ive tried other face cream and I feel I sweat it off if I dont wear any makeup! I also felt my skin elasticity change for the better and fine lines smoothing away!!! I would definitly recommend this and will keep buying more product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many different anti wrinkle and firming creams and this one did not stand out. There has not been any noticeable difference. My skin is not any firmer nor have the few wrinkles I have look any different. I will say that my skin is much smoother and feels better hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a great daytime moisturizer for my sensitive skin. It wasn't to heavy and went well under my make up. After about 2 weeks of using it I could tell my skin was much smoother looking, and had a very soft texture. My wrinkles on my forehead area definitely softened up as well. A little goes a long way. One tub will last about 2 months minimum. I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal RevitaLift for just over one week so I can't say it did a huge difference on reducing wrinkles or firming my skin yet but I do feel my skin smoother and hydrated. Also it's very easy to apply, fast absorbing, definitely not greasy, has a pleasant scent and it does contain SPF 18! So far, it's an effective moisturizing for daily wear and I'm going to continue to use it and see what happens since it says it takes 4 weeks to show any real results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel I didn't have enough time to actually see a difference. Directions say if use for 4 weeks but I've only used for about two. It isn't too greasy & does help moisturize as I have dry skin. It also didn't irritate my skin. I felt better using it & then putting on my make up. Since I haven't used it very long didn't notice a difference with wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it does work great but not best for my skin type. I have to put such a small amount or else it feels heavy. It doesn't break me out but I don't think the day cream is for me. Just felt good much and made my mineral makeup come on a bit sticky even an hour later. I love the night stuff but I'm weird about too much during the day. I think it's a great product but not something for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works beautifully with the eye cream and neck cream. It has a thick, luxurious feel and a subtle appealing fragrance. Not sure any of my lines or wrinkles disappeared, but my skin was much softer after 10 days and looked great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After only 1 week of using this face cream, I had noticeably smoother and softer skin. It feels more tight, now. My fiance who has known me for 9 years, asked how I kept my skin so soft. I like the light feeling it leaves on my face. Some day creams feel heavy under makeup. This was like silk and I felt a little less heavy than my normal day cream. I used to get sweaty and feel like my pores were completely clogged, but with the Revitalift I didn't feel like that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for two weeks and I'm very satisfied with the look of my skin.I put the cream in the morning over my face and neck and fallowing with my make up.Its hydrated my skin all day long and gives me the everything that I was looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am giving this product 3 stars as it seems to be a good product (pleasant smell and not greasy-feeling), but unfortunately I was unable to continue use after a few days as this was not a good fit for my ultra-sensitive skin. As someone that suffers from cystic acne, this cream caused me to break out in several areas on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this lotion is amazing. It makes my skin feel hydrated, soft and clean. My husband has also been using it and said a couple of people that he works with has recently complimented him on his nice skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not too sure about trying L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 but I love it! I seen a difference within just a couple of days. The product is not greasy, has a good scent, and makes my skin feel moisturized. I noticed the wrinkles were getting less visible after just a week of use. I have definitely found my new moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this cream. While I haven't had it long enough to see results (I don't have a lot of wrinkles to notice a difference) I can say that it keeps my skin moisturized all day. I did notice that my skin was more oily than normal which would be the only negative. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 is ok. I've only been using it for a little over a week. I suppose if you look closely the tiny lines in my forehead are a little less noticeable. Perhaps it takes longer than a week for good results. Thank you for letting me try this product.

"This day cream is probably great for women with dry skin but it didn't work well with my combination oily skin. I had some breakouts on my nose and forehead. Also, I live in Florida and it's still pretty warm here in the afternoon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is going to really work For me. It will take more than just one week though. I received my L'ORÉAL Revitalift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Face Cream one week ago. I've been using it every morning after cleaning my face, along with the eye cream. The cream is lovely. It feels good on my skin. There is no greasy nor tacky feel. It absorbs nicely. I love L'ORÉAL products anyway and being able to try these products have been so nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oréal's RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Cream, it's unlike any other face Cream I have ever used. It goes on so smooth and isn't greasy. The skin absorbs it pretty quickly, but leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I can already notice the difference in the wrinkles around my eyes, and laugh lines. My skin looks fresh and vibrant. I have found my new facial skin regime! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for 10 days.It is smooth and creamy and feels good when applying. It goes very well under my make-up. At the end of the day my makeup still feels fresh. It makes my skin hydrated and smoother. I will continue to use this day cream for further improvements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the way it smoothes onto your skin, but the best was the smoothing of small lines, more smile wrinkles, not the deep ones. Didn't do much for my forehead deep wrinkles but the tiny ones seemed smaller and not so deep! It will burn a little if it gets into your eyes, but nothing out of the ordinary! I recommend trying this for hiding new small wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I've used this product for the past 2 weeks, and have seen some modest improvements. There has been a slight tightening of my skin, particularly on my cheeks where I have rather large pores. Of course it would require using the product for a longer period before seeing any kind of drastic change, but the small changes observed over a short period of time were encouraging.

"I really liked all of the cream. It felt nice on my face, the scent was decent. I have used it for about 2 weeks. I can see a little difference in the lines in my face..hoping to see more the more I use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This seems to be working i have used it only a couple of times. I am not allergic to it so thats a plus! I know it takes 4 weeks to see a difference but i think i am seeing one i know my face doesnt feel dry so thats good especially in winter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Having acne prone skin I have always been careful about face moisturizers. Just like I suspected I had a few breakouts but continue to use because of the other benifits I see in my skin. It is softer and more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been trying each of these products for just over 2 weeks and I am impressed with the way my skin feels smoother and softer. It looks firmer and the wrinkles are not so noticeable.

"I have super dry, flakey skin. It has gotten so much worse since the weather is changing. I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Cream for about two weeks now and I can see a huge improvement. My face is smooth which also helps with my makeup not looing so clumpy. I would definitely recommend for other like me with similar skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very dry skin in the winter months and I absolutely love this. It made my skin feel soft and hydrated and it has a nice smell as well. It takes a very little amount to cover my whole face. I will definitely be buying this when it runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a smooth light consistency that goes on easily and absorbs quickly. There is a slight smell but it is not overpowering. I use this in the AM before putting on my makeup. It absorbs into the skin so there isn't any buildup of makeup in my fine lines and creases. I would suggest this as a product for everyday use ro keep your skin looking healthy and moisturized.

"Unfortunately, this was sent to me pretty late in the campaign so I haven't been given the opportunity to use if for 30 days. I will say that I like that it is unscented, or at least lightly scented, and lightweight. My face is softer, but doesn't not seem to be as oily either, and I have not experienced any break outs switching to this cream. So far, I am very impressed and am looking forward to continuing to use it and see what benefits may come from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love love love this product. It has a very nice light fragrance and the results I'm seeing aftwr 2 weeks of steady use are amazing. Just today I was told my skin is flawless! I have noticed a smoother texture and the lightening of a dark spot I have had on my cheek for years. Great product. Very light and not oily at all.

"i really love this product, goes on light and really reduces the wrinkles. I will definitely buy this product from now on. It doesnt feel greasy, it goes on smooth. it doesnt have a bad odor.

"If you want a cream that keep your face protected from the sun, you should try The Loreal,SPF18 Revitalift. This cream is the best I ever try, is no sticky, dry fast and I wear it with my makeup. You will feel comfortable when you use this cream plus you can see the difference in your skin right away you use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how the day cream feels! It smells great and goes on really well! I am very fair skinned and would really like an option of a stronger SPF other than 18. I think it firmed my skin since I have been wearing it! My skin can get oily but does not shine with this day cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am really enjoying this product after using it for a number of weeks. I don't wear make-up every day and this is nice to just apply, massage in and no need to worry about a different/separate sunscreen. I thought it might be a bit too heavy (being a cream rather than lotion), but it is perfect this time of year as the weather has been quite dry in my area and will just get drier into the cold weather season.

"This is a good moisurizer. I didn't have a chance to use it long enough to notice any firming, but I did notice it moisturizer my skin. I am not crazy about the smell, but I am pregnant and have super sensitive smell. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have a tendency to have a shiny face by the end of the day. After using this face cream I was shocked that my face seemed less oily. I have heard that if you use a cream like this that this can happen but I was skeptical. I really like that it seems that you can use a very small amount and it will cover your whole face. I didn't have any problem putting make up over it which was my fear. Overall I really liked the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the day cream and love it! It doesn't make my face feel oily and it dries quickly. My face is soft afterwards. I have seen a slight difference in the wrinkles and firmness of my skin just in the last few days. I will definitely continue to use it and recommend it to other people.

I really like how my face feels after I apply the L'OREAL anti-wrinckle day cream. My face is showing less signs of aging and I seem to have less dark spots and less wrinkles!!

L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 was the best product out of the ones I tried. I absolutely loved it. It has a great smell and light smothered feel. It seems to be help with the light wrinkles on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a really great face cream for days I don't feel like wearing foundation. It's very moisturizing and absorbed quickly. I saw some improvement in my complexion after 2 weeks of using this product. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sunscreen/day cream absorb very fast on my face. It moisture the skin but not heavy. It is good for a daily sunscreen, especially for fall/spring weathers. It is a little bit thick for me in summer though compare with the regular day cream in this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Revitalift anti wrinkle and firming facial day cream has a nice fragrance and a thick texture of cream. It gives you smoother and firmer skin in 4 weeks. I like that it has UVA/UVB SPF 18 in the moisturizer and you can put it on everyday and feel protected from the sun. It really does hydrate your skin and my skin feels so much better. Thanks L'Oreal for letting me try it for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks now. I can see a huge difference in my skin. My face is so soft. This goes on very smoothly and only takes a small amount to do your entire face. This container will last me a few months. It is a bit heavier than the other product ts in this line but I l believe that is do to the added benefit of having the SPF 18 in this one.

Best product that I have used so far and there has been alot. Anti wrinkle cream for face and neck leaves skin very soft and smooth. Within 2 weeks I saw the winkles around eyes and mouth starting to disappear. Within 3 weeks I could tell that my skin on neck and face firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream from L'Oreal is amazing. It easily absorbs by the skin, not greasy or sticky and has a great smell. My skin feel so smooth and tighten my skin as well. Been using it for two weeks now and I can see it lighten my skin tone. I'll keep using it for a month and see what else it can offer. This product is dermatologist tested and approved.

I have been using the day cream and I am happy with the results. Not only does it leave my skin feeling hydrated but it also leaves it feeling baby soft in the process! You don't need to use a lot of product for overall coverage of the face either which is great. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy or sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this facial day cream for 2 weeks now and I use it right out the of shower. I use it just under my foundation. I find that it is not greasy as it absorbs into my skin and leaves great skin underneath as a prep before makeup application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love L'Oreal's RevitaLift line of creams! They all have a wonderful light scent. The Day Cream rejuvenated my skin and helped soften the skin and smooth out lines, leaving the skin with a dewy feel. I love the fact that the cream has enough substance yet is non-comedogenic. With the SPF 18 protection, it is a very useful base for the skin. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream really hydrates your skin all day long without making your skin oily. I love that it has SPF 18. My complexion is both dry and oil. This cream works great for both of these skin types. After only using this product for two weeks, I see a notable difference on some of my newer, smaller wrinkles. This product absorbs quickly and has a nice scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I love the fresh clean smell of it and how it is not greasy.Since using I have noticed my face becoming softer and firmer. The other thing I have noticed is that the brown spots on my face from the sun have started to fade away. I am really happy with this product so far and I can't wait to see what the next 2 weeks brings me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for the last 2 weeks. I have noticed that it does not leave any smell and is pleasant on the skin. I was hoping to get some added moisture and firming on my face. I have yet to see this. I have found that I have more breakouts and my face has not been happy since using this product. Im not sure if it's clogging my pores or its my personal hormones that are breaking me out. I have not seen much of a benefit for this product for myself.

"I've been using the Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Day Cream SPF 18 for almost two weeks and I'm liking it so far. My face feels softer, smoother and brighter. The only thing that concerns me is that even when I'm using a little amount, my face keeps getting more oily and shiny than normal. The good news is that has not caused me any breakouts. Overall, is a good moisturizer with sunscreen protection (win-win) that's making my skin look younger and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin looks great since I started using this cream. Goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and last long. Has a clean refreshing smell, not greasy feeling and great moisturizer. Noticed that since using this cream a big difference in the appearance of my wrinkles . Wrinkles are disappearing and my skin is firmer looking. Highly recommend this cream to anyone looking to obtain smoother, firmer healthy looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am really surprised by this product. More so because of how soft it has made my otherwise super dry skin feel. I also tend to break out when i use anything on my face. So the fact that I haven't gotten one pimple from it excites me even more, lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I have been using this product for two weeks now and I love it. It's not as heavy as other moisturizers. It melts right into the skin and doesn't break me out. It is also working well as a makeup primer for me. My makeup looks amazing and holds all day which is a plus. My skin looks a lot firmer and it feels super soft and I can definitely see a difference in my wrinkles. I am loving this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this cream is great. I've been using it for 1 week and My facial skin feels firmer already. The deep wrinkles around my mouth seem to be a little smoother. I'm excited to see what my face will look like by the end of the month. I like the way this product goes on. It is not to heavy and goes on smoothly. The scent is good and not too heavy. I think I would buy this product after I have used it for a longer period of time to see its full effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Make you skin very soft and healthy looking. Easy to apply. Nice aroma. Looking forward to another campaign. Product would be better if in stand up squeeze tubes instead of glass jars. Great experance for my first campaign. Would recommend this product to all women [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is going to be a great product to use during Spring and Summer. It feels soft when going on my skin, but during fall and winter you do not have alot of sun, so I feel It would better serve me during the spring and summer. With an SPF 18 it should protect your face great! #L'Oreal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle Cream Facial Day Cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Day Cream with SPF for two weeks now. The fragrance is mild but pleasant. I apply this cream right out of the shower and feel like it really locks moisture in! I have not yet noticed any adjustment to my wrinkles yet but am happy with the cream over all. The jar is large and should go a long ways. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I don't have any wrinkles , this product I find is a great product for skin moisturizing. I like the jar it comes in and the smell. I like that you can apply it to your face as a moisturizer. I also think the price is a reasonable and affordable price . This product also have SPF 18 Sunscreen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Liked the way it goes on and also the scent. The thing with this product i would have to use it for quite a while to see, if any, improvement to my skin. At my age do not know if anything would work on my skin to make it look better. Might buy it in the future may not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have continued to use the products by L'Oreal. The face creams make my skin feel smoother and brighter. The smell is pleasant and has no lingering after use odor. I would recommend this product highly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for a little over a week now and all I can say is WOW! I'm 66, so definitely needed a good firming, wrinkle reducing cream. I'm already seeing results and I've tried many products in the past. Loreal's firming creams are really working! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a good product. It is a thicker cream then some others. It soaks in quickly & is not greasy. It leaves my skin extra soft & smooth. I've been using it for about 2 weeks & can definitely feel a difference in my skin. It also improves the way my makeup goes on. No streaking at all. The SPF is a little low ( 18 ), but most other make-up has its own SPF. I really like this product & will definitely buy it , and continuing to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I put the facial cream on each morning, it makes my face feel soft and smooth. There is a slight scent that reminds me of suntan lotion so I feel like I'm at the beach :) Will definitely continue to use this product after my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the face and eye cream for these last few weeks it definitely has made my skin feel softer. Specifically using the eye cream it doesn't soak into my skin as well as I thought that it might. Also I don't think I have noticed any difference regarding the wrinkles under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was not a huge fan of the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream. First off, I found it didn't absorb into my skin, even if I sparsely applied it. That made putting makeup on a problem. I also didn't care for the smell and found it too strong. It's all I could smell all day long. My skin does seem softer but could be from one of the other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin really feels tighter and the fine lines appear to have softened. Sagging of neck tissue was less. There was no greasy feel to the cream. Smell was pleasant. No reaction or rash. Will definitely continue to use and buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have many allergies, particularly regarding scent. I have found that this L'Oreal product has no discernible scent. The cream is thick in the sense that it is not watery, but the perfect thickness. It is creamy, but not greasy. It smooths on the skin easily and absorbs quickly. My skin feels amazing. The fine lines - and even the not so fine lines are definitely diminished. There is a smooth and supple feeling I have not experienced in years. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this daily. One thing I noticed was that it left my face feeling slightly greasy for several hours afterwards, which I did not appreciate. The texture of the cream itself is nice, and there is very little smell. The biggest thing I noticed was my face did feel slightly firmer, and my pores looked a little smaller. I can't say that I would make this a habit, simply because I have naturally oily skin, but I would suggest it for those with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not enjoy using this day cream at all. It was quite sticky, it never really sunk into my skin and had a heavy feel all day. I'm not a huge fan of SPF in my moisturizer and this one made it feel quite tacky. My makeup went on OK after I applied it, however, I felt it on my face all day which I did not like. The scent was also a bit strong, I would have preferred an unscented day cream instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using the day and night creams for 4 days. In that time, I have seen a drastic improvement in my complexion. I like the texture of the day cream. I also like that it has sun protection in it. The only down side is my face does seem to be a little more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is great. It goes on very smoothly and doesn't leave your hands or face feeling oily at all. You don't need to use very much to cover your face so that definitely helps in making the product last longer before having to purchase again. I haven't had the cream long but in the short week or two I have been using it I can already start to see a difference in my face looking smoother. I will definitely continue using this product for a long time to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
its been almost a week since i tried loreal anti wrinkle+firming facial day cream with the spf 18 but i see a lot of different and great result my skin felt a little firmer and i cant deny that i like it has spf 18 protected my face from the sun i like it get absorbing so fast into my skin and my face look healthier and looks fresh really love the result so far and will continue use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I have enjoyed using this product, I am undecided at this point as to whether I would continue to purchase it or not. I like the eye cream, but the face cream to me seems to be a little to greasy on my skin. I will continue to use it for a couple weeks to see if my opinion changes. I like the fact that it has sun protection in the lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is love! Smooth, not greasy, feels great and smells natural. Not a fan of creams that smell at all. I will definitely continue using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle day cream. I am very picky about creams or moisturizers for my face. This one feels right. This one is most definitely a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried the Firming Facial Day Cream and so far I really like it...I like all the creams and pairing them together makes my face feel amazing...I can see the wrinkles fading a little each day...Don't get me wrong I still see some but not as obvious as before...I have been wanting to try this product for a while but didn't want to spend the money...I would ""walk on by"" but no more...The cream has even helped with the dry feeling on my face... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal RevitaLift for just over one week so I can't say it did a huge difference on reducing wrinkles or firming my skin yet but I do feel my skin smoother and hydrated. Also it's very easy to apply, fast absorbing, definitely not greasy, has a pleasant scent and it does contain SPF 18! So far, it's an effective moisturizing for daily wear and I'm going to continue to use it and see what happens since it says it takes 4 weeks to show any real results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited when I open the box seeing how much product you guys sent me to try. The first time I tried, I loved the way it made my face feel, so soft it felt like baby powder. I took a picture of the day that I started trying it and 8 days later I took another picture. I'm very impressed on how my face looks just after 8 days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the smell it didn't smell like most anti wrinkle creams I have used. I did however find it greasy. I really did notice any difference. I also started to break out from this. i did not care for this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I can't say I've seen a wrinkle reduction, I can say that my face has become accustomed to the product and I can feel a difference. I was feeling under the weather the other day and did not do my morning face routine and about mid-day my face felt much drier than normal. It was practically asking for the moisturizer!! My skin IS softer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the anti wrinkle face moisturizer for about 2 weeks now, I honestly have mixed feelings about this product. I feel like when its on i can still feel it, i did appl very little. My face does feel very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this face cream for a couple of weeks and I'm loving it so far. I've noticed my skin is brighter and seems to be a little firmer. The wrinkles aren't as noticeable either. I love that it's non-greasy and light on my skin. I live in Arizona, and the sun is always a factor, so I look ge that I don't have to worry about protecting my face since there's an SPF added. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am noticing a difference in only a few days! My skin is softer, smoother and has a glow. It went on smooth, not thick and heavy like I thought it would be. It sure doesn't hurt that it is SPF 18 either. Added score! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this is the best firming day cream out there after 2 days of using this product i was shocked it really helped my face so much it made it tight and it was no longer sagging plus it made my skin feel so soft and refreshed i had a glow to my face that i have'nt had for a few years now i feel so beautiful now i recommend this product for all women it's a great product .

"I always have a hard time switching products especially when it comes to sunscreen day lotion. This product smells so good and it goes on so lightweight. I have only used it once but my face enjoys it alot, I have really sensitive skin so I am excited to keep using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 cream is easy to apply. It left my skin feeling soft and fresh. This product went well with my other products making my morning routine very pleasurable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Smells really good, however this Firming facial day cream is a tad bit too heavy for me. My skin is very soft and I found that wearing my regular foundation caused my skin to feel like I had a mud pack on. I think this product would be better served for someone who may have some issues with retaining moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is the only cream that I will ever buy. Every morning I put it on before my makeup and I think my makeup stays on better with the cream. I have never used a lotion with SPF in it so that makes it all the better. All the products make a GREAT routine that I plan on continuing. If anyone tries this I believe they will love it and make it their only lotions to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Day Cream feels so nice on my face. Did not feel heavy or greasy. I was confident that it was protecting my skin during the day with the SPF 18 protection while also doing wonders for my skin with the high quality ingredients. I am really starting to notice a difference in my skin with a more even, firm and younger looking appearance. Would highly recommended this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream isn't greasy. It's not too thick. It moisturizes my skin all day but leaves it a little tacky feeling for the first minute or two. I can't put makeup on right away. It doesn't soak in quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have never tried L'Oreal Facial Day Cream before but I am starting to like it. So cream and smooth, and so far seems to be doing a great job on my face. Feels great and makes my face feel soft and moist. Just a small amount goes a long way. I love the creamy feel. Does wear off during the day. And the SPF 18 Sunscreen, which I wish I had earlier in my life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was amazing. I liked the lightness and ease of use. I wore it under my foundation and never knew I had it on. I could see a bit of firming on the first day, and was very excited. I highly recomend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product because it want heavy like so many are. It did tend to be a little bit oily for my skin, but I just blotted it a bit and it was ok. I would reccomend this product, especially if you have extremely dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I don't really think I have too many wrinkles (I'm only 32), so I can't say how effective this is on diminishing them but it definitely helps with firming my skin. I think that in some areas my cheeks droop and this cream has helped with that. I love that it also has SPF in it so I don't need to apply that on top of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the anti wrinkle firming cream. I noticed a difference in my skin in about a week. I am not sure if i would go out and buy it though. It would depend on the price. Im not much into creams and makeup but loved this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ok I have been using this for about a week and a half and I started breaking out in pimples yesterday. I never ever get pimples. Kinda frustrating because I originally liked the product and it made my face feel silky smooth and I liked the smell of it as well. All in all I think I'm going to quit using this for a few days and see if I can get my face cleared up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Definitely found a long time customer in me with this product. The smell is great and it feels really nice. I have a hard time finding moisturizers that don't leave my face feeling really oily but this one did the trick! This has been added to my morning regimen for sure! I'm so excited that I found this before Winter hits. That's when my face starts drying out really bad and I think this will be perfect to fight that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I expected a bit tighter skin. I didn't see any difference other then the moisture level. My face seems less dry. I like there is not a foul smell. I don't really think this is a product I would continue to use. I do like that there is a sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I typically have a hard time remembering to moisturize my face. Thanks to the small jars I was able to keep them on my bedside table. They did not take up much space at all. Having it near my bed was a reminder to put it on. My skin feels so much smoother, and tighter. I do not know how they made such a fantastic product, but I am glad they did.

"I've tried lots of anti-aging products trying to turn back the hands of time. This day cream has exceeded my expectations. After a week and a half, I am noticing my face feels firmer and some of my fine lines are not as noticeable. My skin feels softer to the touch. I am very pleased and will continue using daily.

I used L'Oréal revitalize lift anti wrinkle + firming day cream w spf 18 for the first time a week and a half ago every day and I really liked the fact that it had an spf that worked. I walk outside every day for an hour and usually come back with some sun but this cream was able to protect my skin while keeping it moisturized from the cooler weather outside. I loved the scent it had which was a light flowery scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is great for the price point. I've been using this for 2 weeks now and it is now that I am noticing results from the regimen. The day cream smells great, goes on smoothly, doesn't feel greasy and keeps my face moisturized all day long. I would definitely recommend this product, even as a stand alone daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't really like this moisturizer. My face feels dry & it's starting to break out. I've gotten several blemishes, since I started using it. Not even small ones. Deep painful ones. I haven't noticed any firming either. So, unfortunately, I can't recommend it at all. I'm glad I received this to try, for free & didn't spend my own money on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 is so creamy and rich, plus the smell is so light and fresh. Another winner to use all year since it has an SPF it has that little extra bonus to keep from further damaging while correcting previous damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As much as I liked the rest of the products in this line, I'm disappointed with the day cream. The cream itself is thin and feels greasy on my face. I never seem to know if I've used enough, but due to that greasy feeling, I tend to use less. It's just not worth it for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first glance the product was thick and creamy. It also has a nice smell kind of a manly smell but not too off putting. I have been using this product for about a week and I have noticed a reduction in my pores and wrinkles. I will have to keep using it to see if it gets better but so far it seems to be working [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer with spf is not greasy and smooths skin in preparation for any other products one might use. It doesnt have a strong smell. in the 2 weeks that i have been using this moisturizer I have been very pleased with the results. smooth skin that isnt greasy or shiny and sun protection are things I look for in a moisturizer. I hope during the winter months when the weather is in the teens that it continues to hydrate my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am loving Loreal Paris RevitaLift AntiWrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream. This product smells wonderful, is gentle even on my very sensitive skin and includes a much needed SPF 18 so I am never without some sun protection coverage. Do I notice less wrinkles? Not quite yet, but at this early stage, I am more than willing to keep it up. No negative effects here. I recommend giving it a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to like the L'Oreal RevitaLift Day Cream but I just don't. It is so heavy and thick that it feels like cheap hand lotion. The smell is not very pleasant and it leaves my skin feeling heavy. My skin does feel a bit softer after using it but I have not noticed any long term effects. Unfortunately I won't be continuing to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have not really used this product much as of yet because it seems to be the same as the face/neck cream. I assume the difference is only the addition of SPF. I may use it more often when I plan to be outside the majority of the day and replace the face/neck cream. However, I believe I will like it just as much as the face/neck cream when I want the SPF in as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 for 7 days. Overall, I believe the product is a great moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and did not leave my skin feeling greasy. I wore this moisturizer under my make up and it did not feel heavy or give me a shine. I did notice a slight reduction in the size of my pores. However, I did not see any difference in the firming of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal Revitalift anti wrinkle firming day cream is amazing. Its creamy to the touch and goes on so smooth. It leaves my face soft, smelling great and with a glow that lasts all day. You can really feel it after you apply. Its a cooling sensation that feels amazing. Its my first time trying and i would recommended a hundred times! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think Loreal has made a break through. I haven't been using the Revitalift day cream for long but I sure notice the difference in the smoothness of my skin. On top of that it smells really good also. A little bit goes a long way when using this product. It is a definite must try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVE this product. I actually love this whole line!!! Just after one use I could tell a world of a difference. My skin was softer and continues to get softer with every use. I will definitely be recommending this product to my friends and family. The only down fall to the product is the way it feels when it is first applied. Its very oily at first. But once my skin soaks it up it feels great!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This produce was absolutely amazing! I found it to be exceptional in the application (non-greasy) and stability (able to withstand my foundation). The results after 3- weeks were astounding! I will be purchasing this for myself and abandon other ffrming and anti-wrinkle creams. I can already see the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a thicker facial cream so you don't need much, a little goes a long way. It goes on smoothly but is slightly sticky once it dries. I don't care for the smell but isn't that bad, can learn to live with it. I've been using for approx 14 days but have not seen any results in the firming or anti-wrinkle agents in it. I will continue to use, probably takes additional time to see any type of difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First let me say i was so ezcited to recieve 4 fullsized samples. Ive only been using the day and night cream for a few day. Not enough to see results. So far Im loving the way its making my skin feel. Im even making my boyfriend try it. So ill be posting an update soon. Stay tune.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this for 5 days in a row! Wow! My face is so smooth! I'm not breaking out like I have with so many other face creams! My forehead is tighter with the wrinkles disappearing! It only takes a few minutes in the morning to apply! So simple! I am most definitely telling my friends about this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Love the RevitaLift-Anti-Wrinkle + firiming cream is amazing I put it on at night before I went to bed an it made my skin so soft I love this L'Oreal Revitalift-Anti Wrinkle +Firming Cream, I got up this morning an my skin felt firmer t This product is amazing after just 7 days uses.

"I have been applying the Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day cream every morning for a week now. I have found it to be non greasy, not heavy, and very ""breathable"". I have noticed my skin is smoother and to me it looks like the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. I love the ease of applying (literally takes less than 30 seconds). I feel like the SPF of 18 is just enough for me as an every day face cream. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I decided to try this whole set of creams for a few reasons. First, I am 44 years old and I know my face will start to sag and wrinkle eventually. Second, I am in the process of losing weight, and the first place I lose it is in my face. That being said, I LOVE this cream! It is a little on the thick side, but goes on very well, specially under my make up. I use it after I shower in the morning. The smell is ok, not my favorite, but it's not horrible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am super impressed by the quality of this day cream! I am in my early thirties and trying to develop a skincare routine, I had tried multiple day creams and this one is the nicest so far! My skin feels tighter yet softer. I have been using every morning before applying my makeup and will continue to do so. The scent is a bit stronger than I would prefer, but it is a pleasant clean scent. I will definitely purchase this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using all of the oil of Olay products for years and I have to admit this face cream is wonderful its not greasy and dries almost immediately and my sister liked how my skin looked and asked about the product I let her try mine but wouldn't part with it. she wrote down the name of it and all other products you sent me to use. I will continue to use this product for years to come.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like how this product feels when I wear it! This is my day time product. It isn't super heavy and feels great! I noticed a difference on my forehead. This is a large container and isn't as thick as the night cream so its easy to grab too much each time. Since I also used with with the contouring I started using a little less so it wasn't as thick on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have been using for about two weeks love how it leaves my skin feeling and the fact that it has uv protection. I have very sensitive skin and it is not at all irritating. It has a light feel and improves skin texture. Will be part of my daily skin care. Hopefully it can stand up to the drying winter weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! It is thick, but it is not greasy and absorbs well. It serves multiple purposes as a moisturizer, anti-aging product, and sunscreen in one. Feels good under my makeup. I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"SO, I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Revital Lift AntiWrinkle line and it seems to be working. I have an ugly wrinkle that runs across the bridge of my nose that seems less pronounced.

"I love these products. They keep my skin moist and diminish fine lines I used the firming eye cream, and the Firming Facial Day Cream.

"I have combination skin. It's basically oily on the T zone and normal everywhere else. I like the product but it feels a bit too thick. It definitely feels like you're putting on sun lotion, because of the way it sits on your skin. I wish it was lighter and absorbed quicker. It smells really nice. If your skin is dry it might be just what you need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am loving all the L'Oreal Paris RivitaLift products. I look forward to my evening regimen. I love the feel of the creams and the aroma of the creams is very pleasing. I took a ""before"" picture of my face / eyes and am looking forward to taking the ""after"" picture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this product two weeks ago and have already experienced a big difference in my skin. I have very dry skin and this product is just what I have been looking for. My skin now feels moisturized and soft. I no longer have that uncomfortable feeling of dry skin. I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is really light, but rich at the same time. It smooths on very easily and does not sit heavy on my skin. There is no greasiness or overwhelming smell that I notice. I wake up in the morning, put it on, and completely forget that I did. It has an SPF of 18, so you have a little bit of protection from the sun for your regular daily routine without thinking about it too much. I will continue using this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for 2 weeks. So far I've noticed that the wrinkles by my lips, caused by smiling/frowning are diminishing. The product smells wonderful, isn't greasy, and moisturizers! I'm noticing results and will probably continue to use it through the years. The price is right, not too expensive but affordable. I would recommend this to my friends and family!

I think L'Oréal is an amazing company. I have never purchased any facial creams from them but I am happy that I got a chance to try these products. The facial day cream was great. I could see a difference in my skin and how soft and firm it felt. I wore this cream every day and every day it felt like I had nothing on. I love how the cream smells it is a real refreshing scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is such a nice and effective cream. I felt that it made my skin feel firmer and my ""worry wrinkle"" otherwise known as the ""11"" on our forehead seemed to appear less pronounced too. One thing that is so important to me also is how a product smells. I loved this one! I looked forward to putting it on my skin everyday! I will definetly buy it again!

In the past I have tried many facial day creams and discontinued using them after a few times because I couldn't stand the greasy feeling on my face all day long. I have finally found a facial day cream that I can use everyday that I am comfortable wearing. This product moisturizes my skin and I love that it has SPF18 protection since I have a fair complexion. I have definitely noticed smoother and firmer skin since I began using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how this felt on my face. It is thick on your fingers but light on my face. It has a fragrant smell also, but that was fine with me. I noticed that the wrinkles didn't disappear, but softened and I didn't notice the fine lines as much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! It doesn't break my face out and my makeup looks great over it. I've been using it for a week and I can definitely see a difference in my skin's texture. The dry spots I had are gone. I will be purchasing this when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that this product has SPF! A little of the cream goes a long way which is really nice considering the retail cost. My wrinkles are diminishing and my skin is firmer than before I used it. I love this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just started using this cream and really like it. It is thick and goes on smoothly. I also like that it absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy feel. It leaves my face feeling smooth and silky. On thing I do not care for is the scent- kinda soapy smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only used this product for a week and have noticed my skin feels smoother. The cream is thicker than the daily moisturizer I use, so I don't have to use as much. I can't wait to see the final results in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product made by L'Oreal is very good. I have been using it for about a week and have already noticed some improvement of the wrinkles around my eyes and neck. I am really glad that I got the chance to try these products from L'Oreal and will probably be purchasing another jar when this one is gone. The jar is a good size and will probably last me for at least a month which makes it a very good value. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't believe how much smoother my face feels! I've been using the anti wrinkle and firming face cream for 2 weeks now and every morning I go to wash my face and its a major improvement! You can completely tell a difference on how firm and smooth the skin feels and I can't wait to keep using and see how it keeps working its magic ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i loved the feel of it and there was not a strong medicinal smell like you get with some of the facial creams. I have not noticed a lot of difference yet , but i just started using it, I love it and i am sure if will use up the whole bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoy this product so far. It's lightweight and doesn't clog my pores considering I'm 35 and struggling with adult acne. I love the smell of it and it keeps my skin soft without making it look greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally wear firming facial every day so I can compare this to another similar product. I was very pleased with the results of wearing this firming facial cream. I liked the way the cream smelled, the ease of applying to my face and how much my skin has improved since using this product. I would buy this even though it would cost more than what I normally use. This product would last longer and end up costing the same or less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoy using this product. It has a very nice smell and is not too strong. I have been using it for almost a week now and I can notice less wrinkles on my face and the plus side it also has some sun protection in it also [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing it gives the skin a glow which I'm loving and it makes your skin feels so soft; the cream is wonderful since it's not greasy & it absorbs quickly. That is a truly good anti-wrinkle cream, works over time to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, eliminate fine lines, keep skin young, and help keep new wrinkles from forming [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for about 10 days. It does seem to help reduce wrinkles and fine lines but feels heavy and greasy all day. I don't know whether that is due to the SPF 18 or not but I did not like this product because of that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have enjoyed trying this product. It's nice and creamy and goes on smooth. It leaves a great feeling, not greasy at all. I always use sunscreen, but it's nice to use a product that has other things the protect my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to say right off the bat that my skin is VERY sensitive to most skin products. I have now been using the L'Oreal Paris Anti-Wrinkle cream for about 2 weeks and have not had one breakout! Not to mention that my skin feels so moist. The icing on the cake is the fact that it has a sunscreen protection. I am very pleased with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found in the two weeks that I have been using that my wrinkles have actually softened. The lines around my mouth and my smile lines have almost disappeared. They say to give it four weeks which is why I have not given it a 5 star, but if it continues as well as it has in just two weeks I would give it a 5. I will buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to give this product a good try. I have been using it for a week now and have noticed my skin feels hydrated and supple. It applies easily and is not at all greasy. It makes my makeup appear more smooth as well. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This day cream is thick but sinks in and spreads well. It is not sticky and you don't have to wait to start putting on your make up. I do not like chemical sunscreen so I was reluctant to try this but I did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the whole Revitalift set, and loved it! I felt results immediately, and saw them about 3 days into use. The face and neck cream left my skin feeling tight and slightly tingly. It was awesome! The eye cream made the skin under my eyes so smooth, and really lightened it up. These products will be used again, in my house!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this moisturizer feels lovely and does a good job hydrating my fairly dry skin. It's fragrance does remind me of my mom or grandma just a bit...but not in an altogether unpleasant way! My usual moisturizers are fairly unscented and this just reminds me of something they have used! I do prefer a one step system for moisturizer so this multi-step system is a bit intensive for me but if you're looking for targeted products I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very light weight, couldn't tell I had any on, noticed immediately how soft muy skin was it literally was smooth like a baby's bottom. Haven't used it a whole month yet but I have noticed my skin is smoother, brighter and firmer. Would def use this full time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have found my new daily face cream it's terrific. I really like how well this product works. The added spf is a great feature. The product is easy to apply, moisturizes very well and it's not greasy which I really enjoy. The container is easy to use and I like that it's made out of glass. There is hardly any scent which makes this product perfect for everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how smooth my face feels after using this cream. I have only used it for a short time, so I'm not sure if I can tell if there is any visual changes. I'm not a fan of the scent. I do love the consistency of the cream and how it feels going on my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely, amazing difference in my skin after only a few days. The cream immediately targeted the dryness of the recent addition of the cool weather and need to turn on the heat. Love how it makes my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product. It has a nice smell, it doesn't leave your skin oily and with only using it for a few weeks I'm starting to see fewer wrinkles & firmer skin. The fact that it has a touch of sunblock is a bonus. I recommend you to try this if you think your face could use a pick me up. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream was smooth and easy to apply, it settled in and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. I have used some of the most expensive creams on the market, and this is hands down my absolute favorite. My skin has never looked clearer or felt softer. It's rich and creamy without being too heavy. I loved the added SPF 18. This, combined with the revitalift day cream has done wonders. The face oil is a great addition, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift day cream is okay. Can't say I've really noticed a difference in a week of using it, though they do tell you it can take 4 weeks to notice. I'm not overly fond of the smell of it. As a daily thing, I think just about any face lotion with sunscreen would accomplish the same thing. Most problems with excessive wrinkling, in my opinion, are due to skin being to dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 is the best firming cream I've ever used. It makes your neck and face so soft and you can see a difference the first time you use it. I would recommend the entire collection of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift to anyone that wants a product that really works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is nice and thick. I was excited to use it. It isn't too bad for sensitive skin, it burns a little bit but I still use it. My face feels more tight and smooth. The only issue I have with it is it makes my face feel oily all day. But the moisturizing effect is great with the SPF being a great plus!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am not sure how effective this product will be but as far as thickness and feel of the product i love it. I love the fact that it does not irritate my skin because normally my skin will break out with many products. I think because it feels thick and it makes me feel like i'm fully covered. I plan on using the entire product and hopefully its look and feel is not deceiving. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is a great product. It has a nice smooth texture that absorbs into you skin easily with having to rub it in too much. It keeps your skin moisturized well throughout the day. I like that it has spf in it. I wish the spf was a little higher. It seemed to help smooth out the texture of my skin. I can't tell if it has helped with fine lines because I have only been using it for about two weeks. But a good daytime moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used firming facial day cream SPF18, It gave me peace of mind that it had this SPF protection. I feel of the cream was light and not grease and it when right in. My skin is smooth. I have not had it 4 weeks. It may about 2 1/2 weeks I did use it with the L'Oreal night cream and face and neck cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I started to use this, I have already started to see a difference in my skin, my forehead wrinkles are not as deep, and I barely have the crows feet anymore, another good thing about this, is it is not greasy so does not break out my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just received this skin cream and I have used it for a week and I am loving it. My skin is noticeably firmer and so soft. I love to put it on every morning and it gives me the moisture I need all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using for a week but I swear this morning I could tell a difference. I have always used sunscreen and some sort of face lotion, always, every day. Not sure what is different about this one but when I got to work today I had someone tell me I look like a little girl! I'll take it! Thank you so much for picking me for this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the product a little over 2 weeks, and already seeing great results! The biggest things I notice are smoother skin, and less bags under my eyes! The smell is great, and refreshing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel it leaves my more oily than usual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found that the product did not work for my skin in fact in made it feel oily and dirty. I am not sure why but that is what I experienced and I did not enjoy the product at all. It did not show any results at all either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product for about a week. I love the feel of it on my skin. I already see a difference in the firmness of the skin on my neck. The cream is rich and smooth and feels oh so good. A little goes a long way so it's economical too. It firms and brightens like no other product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This went on smooth. Even with my oily skin it looks good under my make up. It does have a smell to it. It reminds me of old perfumed lotion. I noticed some difference after about a week. If you can get past the smell it's a good lotion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love,love this cream infact i love them all. I can all ready see a difference in my face and neck area.cant wait to see what happens in the next week or so.like the fact it is not greasy .disappear into skin fast and drys very well.i would say every one shoul buy this loreal face and neck cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The face cream is totally thick and creamy, but I felt it was a little hard to rub in. Also, I'm a big stickler for smell, and this was not my favorite scent for face cream, but it doesn't seem to stick around for too long after application. Other than that, I like the moisturized feeling of my skin after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Facial Day Cream. It makes my face smooth and it makes me feel good. I love it is not oily. It is easy to apply, doesn't make a mess when I apply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this cream! I normally use Ponds and it does not have SPF and it disappears after a while. This new L'Oreal Paris Reviatlift cream is so thick but not greasy and feels fresh all day. I do not have a good track record of washing my face at night but I found in the morning my face feels less greasy than normal with this cream. I also love the smell! It's a nice fresh smell. I have found some creams to smell a little bit like an old lady. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm on day 3 of using this product and so far it is great! My skin feels so soft. I haven't been wearing any face makeup since using it and it doesn't seem to be a bad thing! The only thing that I don't love is the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was afraid this was going to have that stinky sunscreen smell, thankfully it is not that bad. The smell is there, but its not overwhelming. Application was super easy, formula is not too thick. I immediately felt firmer, not sure about the wrinkles, as I don't have any. Makeup was easy to apply on top of it. It did not leave a greasy or slimy feeling behind. Blends in very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have only been using it for two weeks so far and have not seen any difference in my face at all but still have two weeks to go so will update you then. I love the smell of the cream and it is a very nice creamy texture and easily spreads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the other products in the line and would use it because i know it will work with the other products. That said, it is just a good basic moisturizer with sunscreen. Maybe because I am using the other products i did not find it great (the other products have made me switch to L'Oreal). Still. if I was limited to one product in the line -- this is what i would choose for the built in sun screen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the L'Oreal Day Cream. It had a nice consistency. The cream went on smooth. It had a wonderful smell. When I put it on my face it felt tingly. I thought that meant it was working. I think it is smoothing out my wrinkles already. I like that it has a SPF of 18 to protect me from the sun. I will definitely buy more L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think these products are amazing. My skin has never looked or felt better. My fiance noticed a difference 2 days after I started using it. My skin is smoother and feels more firm. I am now hooked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about two weeks now and can already see in improvement in the wrinkles on my four head and around my eyes it leaves a clean, fresh feeling that is not greasy at all. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this product. The scent is very nice and pleasant. It is easy to use and doesn't leave your skin greasy. I love that it provides sunscreen while helping diminish fine lines and wrinkles. Overall, a very nice facial day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the day cream was a perfect moisturizer. My sensitive skin feels like it is perfectly protected. I love that there is an spf in the cream, so I don't have to worry about putting on a seperate product. The scent was faint and perfect, the creaminess was great. Love the texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this cream for many reasons. it is super moisturizing and rich, and not greasy. The downside for me is that after a few days I started to break out in acne, which is not a problem I have with the other moisturizing cream that I regularly use. I had to unfortunately discontinue use of the product. Overall, this is a really nice day cream, but just did not work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is pleasantly scented and has a nice smooth creamy feel to it. I haven't used it long enough to say it definitely does what it claims to do but I do know that my face feels smoother. And smells good too! This doesn't make my skin feel like I slathered on a bunch of grease. I am going to continue using this and see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The cream is super light and easy to apply. I do not like the smell of it so much, but it is not a strong smell and it doesn't linger once applied. I love the fact that this cream has SPF and is fighting wrinkles too. I have to admit, I don't have very many wrinkles but I like to prevent anthis cream has all the ingredients to correct and prevent future wrinkles.

Loving this facial cream! I've been using it for about 2 weeks and have already noticed smoother skin. Also like being able to look at the label and tell that it has ingredients that will make a difference. Loving this stuff and will be adding this as my new go-to for facial creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is incredibly softer. I didn't think I really needed any tightening in my face, but have noticed firmer skin. The eye cream is gentle. It didn't irritate or over tighten the eye area like other products I've tried. I almost skipped this step, but am so please that I changed my mind. My only issue is that the day cream and face and neck cream jars look so similar. Not enough of an issue to lose a star, but it would be nice to have a quick visual aide. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Not only does this cream fight wrinkles but it has sunscreen to prevent wrinkles! I'm using all of these creams together so I'm not sure if it's one or all of them but I do notice a difference in the tiny lines on my face. I guess I'll keep using them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think L'Oréal knocked it out of the park with this day cream. It has an spf, is non greasy, lightly scented and makes your skin feel super soft. After putting it on fave I just want to touch my soft supple skin. I have only been using it about a week but I really love it. The only downside is the spf is on the lower end which may not be enough if you are going to be in the sun for an extended period. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When putting the cream on, it feels great. I can see and feel a difference in using this cream over the brand I used to use. That one left my face feeling dry and sometimes it would burn. I thought it was because of the spf, but this cream doesn't burn and has more spf in it then the other. My face is feeling very moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product. It seemed a little oily when I first dipped into it. I have oily skin so that is a concern. However, I'd did soak in well and left my skin feeling moisturized. I have not noticed any positive affects but I have not had an increase in breakouts so I think that's pretty good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is amazing! After about 2 weeks I started noticing a significant change. Now I'm only 32, but I literally could see the elasticity back in my skin. Great stuff, I can't wait to see what it looks like after 4 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always am enthusiastic about L'Oreal products because of their reputation.But I usually end up disappointed. I don't know if product reduces wrinkles because to me it is too greasy, I didn't like the way it made my skin feel. I know i have 65 year old skin and I wanted it to look and feel younger but with that much grease I may as well be a teenager again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am really surprised how light the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream SPF 18 felt going on. Some of the other day creams with SPF feel thick and sticky. This one absorbed quickly and felt really light on my face. I also like that the SPF is 18 not 10 like a lot of other creams. I have been using this daily for about 2 weeks and already feel that my skin is smoother & softer. This is a product that i think i will actually remember to use daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this everyday for a week now and my skin is so soft. I love this because I have really sensitive skin and it does not cause me to break out. I will be getting this again when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is really really good. Blends in smoothly and quickly. I don't feel a residue being left at all. I love knowing that I am applying daily sun protection to my skin which is important at any age but especially in me as I am now middle aged. There is no smell. I wouldn't classify this product as a wrinkle reducer but more like a wrinkle preventer due to the SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product goes on smoothly and although I have combination skin, it does not make my skin feel greasy at all. It does feel very creamy and my skin feels very hydrated. I has just been over a week so I will report more as most of these products say I will notice a difference in 2 to 4 weeks. So far my skin is definitely more hydrated and I am looking more ""refreshed"" lately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not see any dramatic difference in using this product. I was hoping for better efficacy. It is light going on, and has a pleasant smell, however it is not something I would consider purchasing in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this day cream with spf in it for about a week now. My face used to be really dry since I live in such a humid state (South Carolina). Once I apply this in the morning after I shower, this is not the case. My face feels soooo soft and moisturized! I absolutely love it! It seems to help a little so far w/ some wrinkles on my face. Very happy with this cream! Can't wait to see more long term effects! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I can already see the improvement. My whole face just seems to glow from the whole set of RevitaLift Creams. It only takes a few minutes in the a.m. and p.m. and you get great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a fantastic product. I have normal/oily skin and most moisturizers can leave me very greasy. Not this one, although it is thick, it does not add extra oil. I also noticed that my foundation looks more flawless with the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream. I will continue to purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not too heavy, this moisturizer feels great on the skin. Ever since starting to use, our weather has been overcast; so, I can't yet evaluate the sunscreen protection. I do like the moisturizer itself and have noticed a tightening in facial skin since using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Knowing before you buy is always a helpful thing. I wish i would of found this skin regimen a few years ago its awesome. Although I haven't had the products a month. My skin has done some smoothing and brightening. I have more moisture in my face. It only takes about 10 minutes and it works it magic. I am totally in love with this regimen! Loreal has put keepers on the market. Way to go! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I am going to stop using the product on my face. I have started to break out with painful pimples and being in my 50's that is something I haven't had in along time. Also I am sensitive to scents and I am having a difficult time with the scent, even though light and creamy the scent is still like a perfume and wish the product had no scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this has to be one of the best day creams i have have ever tried. it is nice and cooling on the face. The scent is not to strong or over powering. I love the way it left my skin feeling so soft and hydrated not greasy or oily. I love that it has spf in it. only thing is i wish the spf was higher than 18. i do not have a ton of wrinkles but the ones that i do have i want off of my face and this cream has helped with that they are not as pronounced and visable i feel.

"This product had a non-greasy texture but was very heavy and thick. I saw immediate results as far as firming and moisturizing my skin. I also broke out within a day of using this product, and had to stop using after 3 applications. Not good for those with acne-prone skin. Disappointing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had previously discussed this product with a friend who convinced me that it was not made for African American women. She couldn't have been more wrong! After just 2 days, my skin looked more radiant, felt more smoother, and overall healthy and hydrated!! I look very forward to my first purchase! #BzzAgent #LorealRevitalift # GotItFree #FreeSamples [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is going to be a great product in just a few days use I could tell a difference in how my face felt and my skin even looked younger. There was no oily after feeling when applied. In a week it does seem some fine lines are fading. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that this product has SPF in it. I find myself wanting to reach for it every morning for that protection. I am not a fan of the fragrant scent though. It does also tend to make my face feel greasy throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is amazing. I noticed my fine lies and wrinkles were diminished after using this product for a week. This product was east to use and I love that it has SPF in it. This product works, you have to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product would be great for someone older than I who may have more sun exposure. I don't really have wrinkles, but I could tell a difference as far as the firmness of my skin. My current problem is acne and this doesn't really help with that. I love that the day cream is unscented and contains and SPF. That's definitely a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is very different from any moisturizer I've used. It's non-greasy and absorbs well, but the big difference is the finish. While you don't feel anything on your skin, the finish is a smooth, pore-free texture that reminds me of DHC Velvet SkinCoat, my favorite primer/filler and the closest thing to makeup I use. Foundation goes on smooth like you used a primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only used the night cream but I gave the other products to my mom and she loved them! She thought the wrinkle cream really did a wonderful job. She's loved that their is spf on the cream too so she didn't need to use normal sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like feel of it on my face. Very creamy, but not greasy. I have had issues with greasy creams as I have very oily skin so I'm glad it doesn't clog my pores or feel heavy on my face. Easy to use with attractive packaging and clear instructions. My skin does not feel dry after using which is also sometimes an issue. I'm surprised a cleanser wasn't included, I plan to go buy a Loreal one as I like the rest of the products so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very oily skin and so I never buy an spf face cream. I actually stopped using face cream during the day because it would clog my pores. Once I tried the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle+Firming Facial Day Cream Spf 18 I loved the way if felt. It wasn't too heavy and I like knowing I have some extra protection during the day.

"I work outdoors, so I was excited to try a Moisturizing Day Cream with sunscreen. This product exceeded my expectations. It has a nice scent, not over powering at all. It is so soft and smooth. It blends well into your skin, and leaves it feeling completely moisturized. It is definitely a cream I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a good product. It is heavier that what I usually use. The consistency is very creamy and sticky, do not use too much or it feels really heavy. Its nice that the SPF is in there so you do not have to use another product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that it's fantastic that there is a product that moisturizes your face and has SPF in it. It is so important and so many people forget that as long as you remember to moisturize your face then you already have on SPF too! Really excited about using this product during the summer months.

"Started using the Facial Day cream for about a week now. Skin was dry and I started getting fine wrinkles, that drove me nuts. I tried tons of creams and nothing was working. Until I started using this amazing cream. It absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly. Nice clean refreshing smell. Since using this , my skin looks great, and wrinkles are disappearing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love. I have been worrying about taking care of my skin since I am now in my mid-thirties (yikes!) I love that there is a generous portion size with this product and the price is really competitive as well. I was worried about trying something new since my skin can kind of be sensitive at times. This didn't irritate my skin at all! I felt like my skin was more firm and better hydrated after just a few uses. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the way my face and skin feel after using the L'Oréal Moisturising Anti Wrinkle Day Cream. My face always feels so fresh and clean...like when I was a teenager, before age, life, and stress took over!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical about this product before starting to use it. I have previously tried several different products and was dissatisfied. I have been using this product for over a week. I love that the product is not scented. It is easy to apply. It soaks completely into the skin without leaving a residue. I am completely satisfied with the product so far. I find myself rubbing my face as it feels so much smoother than before I started using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you must buy something at the store, then RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day by L'Oreal is it. It has just the right amount of moisture so your skun does not feel greasy. It also is the perfect moisturizer that you xan even wear your makeup over. It absorbs quickly. I can wait to see the final results on the firming part. Lord knows i need that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Facial Day Cream for the past week. I truly think that it has made my skin feel softer and smoother and love the fact that it has SPF 18 to protect my skin from UV damage every day. I will definitely continue to use this product as I feel that is has reduced some of the lines on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product everyday for the past week straight I have noticed how much more firmer my skin looks and wrinkles are hardly even noticeable any more, I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see real results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the revitalift creams on my mom. She loved the way these creams are not oily. They all have a delightful soft fragrance that is not too over powering. She has been using these products for 1 week and is happy with the results so far. Her favorite cream in the regiment is the revitalift eye cream. I think this is a great product for anyone how is looking to firm their face and soften wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the day cream for 2.5 weeks now and I can tell an improvement with my neck. I like the way it feels and how quickly it absorbs. I like that I can get it just about any where. Will try again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think...that it seems like a great product all though a little greasy after application. It has a very strong perfume smell to it that I do not like at all. very overwhelming. but it is very light and goes on easy. I don't think that I wpuld buy this product simply because of the strong perfume smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a great product. It has a nice smell, no over powering scent. It is so soft and smooth. It blends well into your skin. I love how well it has been working on My face and neck. It is definitely a cream I will continue to use in the years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just received my trial jar of L'Oreal paris RevitalLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream and have been using it for about 5 days. I love how it feels and smells. It's non greasy and love that it has an SPF of 18. Am not expecting to see any visible changes in my skin after such a short period of time but am optimistically looking forward to some improvements! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that it has a high SPF in addition to all the other great benefits of this day cream. Living in Florida its important to apply a daily SPF protector and with this product I no longer have to apply one under my usual daily moisturizer. It is great to use under makeup and doesn't cause my makeup to gum up or flake. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was just telling my husband the other day how dry and cracked my face was, because of washing my face with soap and water. Now thanks to Loreal Revitalift 4 step process my face is more smoother, softer, and firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product overall! The SPF 18 in it makes it well worth the cost. I am always forgetting to apply my sunscreen, so the L'Oreal Revitalift with sunscreen works great for me. It goes on easy and is not overly oily, which is great for my combination skin, and does not make my makeup appear clumpy! I would definitely recommend this to any beauty regimen for this wanting to curb the effects of aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The RevitaIift day cream was definitely moisturizing, but left me a little greasy & had a scent that reminds me of cold cream. If you have dry skin it may be perfect for you, but it was just too greasy for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was concerned the face cream would make my skin oily, as my face tends to be a tad on the oily side. That was not the case. The cream is light and not oily at all. Left my face feeling smooth and soft all day. The SPF is also necessary for my lifestyle. Checked off all my requirements for a facial product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smells wonderful and goes on very smoothly with no heavy or oily feeling. However I think I may personally benefit from using the day lotion instead of the cream as I have gotten a few blemishes since beginning to use it. It may just be a bit too rich for my skin but for those with dry skin, I think it would be a really wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've only used the product for a week and really can see a difference in my skin! Having used L'Oreal products in the past, I can also wear it confidently, knowing that I am getting the SPF protection that I need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has a strong smell that some may find unpleasant. I liked that it has SPF protection but I have a feeling the SPF is what made the product hard for me to use. It never fully absorbs into my skin so all day I just felt greasy and coated like it was just sitting on top. I tried it for a little over a week hoping that I would start seeing results but then the acne started. This product is just too thick and clogs my pores....my face needs to breathe.

"I love love love this cream!! It makes my skin look and feel beautiful. My face is moisturized without the greasy feeling, which is exactly what I look for in a facial moisturizer. My skin is super hydrated and rejuvenated!! A great product indeed!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First off I really do like this moisturizer because it is very light with a fresh smell and it isn't oily. It doesn't feel heavy and constricting like other moisturizers or sun screens. But it is sticky. It isn't horrible just takes about 20 minutes to dry before you can put on your make up. Definitely better than other ones! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this day cream not only has SPF 18; but is is anti-wrinkle and firming. It is pleasant smelling as well. Not too think or too thin. I am a fan of multi purpose products like this. It has something called stimuplex and Pro-Retinol A, non-greasy, dermatologist tested and non-comedogenic. It is recommended that you apply 15 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every 2 hours. Product is not water resistant. 90% of women noticed firmer skin after 4 wks. I'm in! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer does what it says, and in an az dry climate and hard water, I need a moisturizer that works. Even with spf protection, I didnt get that yucky greasy feeling, of most sunscreens. The only downside for me was the scent, I dont care for it. It smells very grandma-ish (for lack of a better descriptor). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the product for over a week now , I can say that the texture, fragrance and ease of use makes it a product that will be telling friends and family about. I really think it has made my skin smoother! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can't say enough positive things about Revival lift anti-wrinkle day cream. After using this product for 3 days I saw a difference and my face looked a lot firmer. I most definitely happy using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I applied the anti-wrinkle, firming facial cream and it went on silky smooth. My skin was glowing and I am so glad to know that it has SPF 18 to protect my skin as I face a new day! Three hours later and my skin still feels soft and hydrated. I am excited to see what changes happen in my skin as the days progress. The photo shows me day 1 before using Revitalift. Next week I will post my progress. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Revitalift Day Cream is a good product from L'Oréal that is affordable to use unlike some other moisturizers that cost much, much more. It has a nice scent and absorbs easily and quickly into my skin. No oily or sticky feel on my face. I love that it has SPF 18...helps to protect my skin from the sun. At age 57, I am always looking for something to keep my skin in healthier condition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Revitalift products are definitely not for oily skin. I also ended up with three zits after using this line for only two days. However, it works very well for normal to dry skin because my mom has been using it, and it works great for her. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used it for four consecutive days and although I do not yet see reduction of fine lines I love the feel of the cream. It's not heavy or greasy feeling like some others I've tried. It absorbs very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the day cream and I do like the clean not greasy feeling! I really needed a cream during the day but had not found the right one until now. I don't care for a fragrance but this doesn't last long.perhaps, L'Oréal will make one that doesn't have a scent. I like the packaging it caught my attention in the store high-end but easy to figure out. I will continue to use it and will report my results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got the firming lotion and was a little sceptical. When I put it on the first time I was pleasantly surprised that it was greasy. It felt nice on my skin. I feel like it is keeping my skin firmer also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I felt like a child on Christmas morning eager to open the box containing all the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift products. I was equally excited to try out the products. Unfortunately, my experience with the product was short-lived because I had an allergic reaction. Hives all over my face...what a bummer! At least I can review the packaging! The red marquees highlighting the L'Oreal name is eye catching while the white contrast of the box makes it inviting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have not been good about using a day cream. I have had a hard time finding a cream I liked. This L'oreal day cream is fantastic. I love the light weight cream. It is not heavy or greasy. It has a pleasant smell. After putting it on my face it feels hydrated. I feel like my face tells me thank you every morning. I will continue to use this product. Love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just started using the day cream and so far, I love it. It goes on smoothly, is lightweight, and provides a good amount of sun screen. I am anxious to see how well it performs. It has a light, pleasant fragrance that is not overwhelming. Out of curiosity, I checked the shelves of my local retailer, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was available, even in my small town. I will definitely keep using it and report back with my thoughts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have never used a anti wrinkle day cream before, but I am turning 50 in 3 weeks and decided it was time. I have been using revitalift cream for a week and my face feels soft and fresh. The cream itself is nice and thick and does not feel too oily. I also noticed how even my foundation looks, I was afraid it was going to look blotchy, but it was great. I have nothing to compare it too because I've never another product, so as a first time user I give it the thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a 52 year old woman who is searching for that fountain of youth to keep my skin looking as young as possible and this day cream works great! I've noticed a reduction of fine lines on my face and my skin definitely looks firmer and more youthful. It has a light pleasant scent, which I like and the texture is not too heavy. I'm loving this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product the first time while attending my childrens football games last week. I was concerned about it feeling greasy as some sun screens and lotions tend to. But when I put it on, I did not feel that it left a greasy residue or made my skin feel gross, My face was very soft even at the end of the day after being outside all afternoon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is just awesome! It's an anti-wrinkle and firming daily moisturizer complete with an SPF 18 sunscreen! It's so creamy and has a light smell to it. Took about a couple of days to see it going to work. Definitely moisturizes my skin without making it look layered with grease. One of the best products I've tried! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I picked up this product in hopes of making my skin look smoother around my jaw and neck area..this product did not let me down! It did take a couple of weeks using morning/night to start seeing a difference but I'm glad I tried this! Get out there and try it out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am just so impressed with how luxurious the day cream is. So rich! Great for my dry skin. Also tried the night cream (which smells define) loved it to. I have very sensitive skin which everything usually burns but this doesn't. So impressed. I would have never thought I could use anti aging cream. Looking forward to less wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First I was surprised to see I received a full size sample for testing and review. The day cream was light and did not leave me feeling greasy, the fragrance also was light which I prefer as I have problems with heavy fragrances. Reviewed the daily routine on the package which was clear and straight forward, daily routine is quick and takes less than 5 minutes. Looking forward to seeing how this works over the 4 weeks.

"First of all, you have a SPF of 18. That's an important number to me as a senior citizen. Thank you for that. Now, the cream....nice and smooth and silky. Not the least bit sticky or tacky. Haven't used it for the required time to see any results but I will. Thanks so much for this. I'm really enjoying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this L'Oreal face cream. It had a great scent, not to overpowering. My skin felt so soft after using. I have had issues with other moisturizers leaving my face greasy or causing me to break out. I had neither issue with this product. I also love the price point. I think it is just as good if not better than the more pricey brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was great. It wasn't too heavy for daily use and provided great sun protection. I was also able to use it instead of a separate face primer! Will definitely be buying this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off I was truly impressed by this Bzz kit. Full size. 4 products. Very nice. I read the recommended regimen before starting and followed the steps. I loved the smell upon opening the jar. The texture and look of these creams is very luxurious. It felt indulgent. It went in nicely and absorbed fast. No greasy feel. Face felt nice and hydrated and taken care of. Hoping for some excellent results, but very impressed so far. Good job L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the L'Oreal Paris Anti-Wrinkle and firming cream for the face and neck and it felt amazing. The cream is not oily and it smells great. It was easy to apply and did not make a mess. I loved the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am pleased that the anti-wrinkle and firming cream has pro retinal A in it. But it seems to have a bit of a medicinal smell. And it is somewhat sticky on my face. I am quite happy that it has SPF 18 sunscreen. I think that's the most important aspect of a day cream moisturizer. I received my product late so I really can't see a difference yet since it's so soon in the process. I like the packaging and the jar. They make the product seem more luxurious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only used this product for a few days so of course I haven't had any results yet but I'm a fan so far. This cream goes on nicely and has no greasy or oily residue. It absorbs into my skin fairly quickly too. I'm excited to see what my face looks and feels like in just a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Well first I was a little offended that my very campaign as a bzzagent came on my 30th birthday and it was anti wrinkle cream LOL. I am so pleased with the product though. It has a very light and pleasant smell. I was surprised at how instantly soft my skin felt. I actually have never used any kind of firming or anti wrinkle cream before, and I have to say that I am sold. A+ job L'Oreal! Can't wait to see the results in the coming weeks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product deserves more than 5 stars. I had almost given up on any facial creams to help me fade away a dark blemish (due to health reasons) off my cheek on my face. I noticed that it's almost all gone. This non oily great smell Day cream has proven to me that anything is possible. This is my new daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love L'oreal products and this Revital line is wonderful. the anti-wrinkle+firming facial day cream has SPF in so that you can easily protect your skin year round just by applying your day cream. The cream is rich and thick. I feel confident my skin will fantastic the longer I use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like to use a daily cream or lotion to blend with my liquid foundation because for me it helps even out the tone of the foundation so it looks more natural. The Loreal Revitalift Daily Cream is working great for this. It doesn't feel heavy or oily, and after two days some of the puffiness underneath my eyes has dissipated. I'm loving this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far the day cream has been a great addition to my daily routine. I was worried about adding so layers to my face. It seems like I am always fighting oily skin, but this gave no extra shine! I have to say so far I am very happy. It's early on, so I'm not really seeing the firming or help with the few wrinkles I have, but I love how my face feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was actually surprised by the L'Oreal Day Cream, first it really smelled pleasant and not too over powering. I like that it gets easily absorbed into my skin (I have mixed oily/dry skin). It doesn't leave a greasy film on your skin and I feel refreshed when I gently massage it into my face. So far it is a really good budget friendly daily cream that gives me a feeling of an expensive face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually have oily skin but when I started using the daily moisturizing cream my skin was not greasy and it also kept my face moisturized all day. I even got my mom to go buy some and she loves it!!! I will be going to get me some more when I run out. If you have oily skin like I do this cream is the best for it.

When I first started using the l'oreal revitalift anti wrinkle and firming cream I had very really oily and dry skin. Since I have started using it it leaves my skin very smooth and all day long. I normally have to apple lotion throughout the day bc my face would end up drying out even more. Now I only have to apply this product first thing in the morning and then do my makeup and my skin looks so much better. I will be buying more of this when I run out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The revitalift eye , day, face and neck,night creams are just simply amazing. They have left my skin feeling so soft. I feel amazing after using this products.

If u are looking to have smooth firmer skin then this is the product for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far this facial day cream has been a wonderful addition to my day to day face/makeup routine. It absorbed quickly and left no greasy residue. I have no extra shine from an oily face. Really happy with this day cream and love the added bonus of the SPF 18 in it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that this has an SPF. I'm always on the look out for a moisturizer that does. The fragrance is not too bad. I don't usually like very smelly stuff. While it is thick, I don't believe it has clogged my pores. Only used it for 2 days, but no breakouts. That's huge plus for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this cream . I applied daily after I cleansed my face . It made my skin feel silky smooth but not oily and did not affect my makeup when applied after.

I ttied this L'Oréal product and it makes my skin look and feel amazing! It isn't greasy and absorbs quickly into skin leaving it moisturized and visibly healthier skin.

It works better than anything I've ever tried and it worked fast! This will be my skin care routine forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The product is very moisturizing and left my skin feeling very smooth. It's not to heavy and not to light. I didn't use a primer before applying makeup and my makeup applied just as well when using a primer. My only complaint is it has a fragrance smell that I didn't really like, however the smell dissolved after about 30 minutes. So I give this product really a 4.5!

I was hesitant to try this product because I was afraid it would leave my skin oily. I was pleasantly surprised that it absorbed into my skin quickly and worked well under my regular makeup routine.

"This is a great facial cream! And with the SPF 18 it makes it a great cream. It is perfect for after washing your face. It helps to tighten the skin, and really just feel great, like a perfect little jar of pamper!! It really does feel great on the skin. I pretend I don't have likes on my face at all, and this tightened up the skin and made them less..and easier to pretend they aren't there! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I decided I needed the cream with SPF 18 because I live in Florida. It comes in a glass jar so it seems like it is a really expensive cream. When I first put it on it was a little thick but smoothed it out. It took a couple minutes to soak into this dry faced woman. If it continues to help wrinkles and dry skin, then this will be a winner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the glass container that this cream comes in. It does feel like it's working however it is a little greasy one putting on until it dries into your skin. Takes a few minutes to dry. It does have a strong sent to me it smells like a baby powder.

Firstly I love the smell. I have oily skin so I was a little concerned it would be too thick but it wasn't. It had a velvety feeling on my skin and was a great and smooth base for makeup. I actually only put on bronzer on my cheeks as it felt so smooth. It also has SPF 18 which is very important [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I never really keep up with a facial regimine until now! I love how the cream goes on my face and the light scent. Its not over powering. It's absolutely worth the price because of the results. My skin feels and looks better already! I will definitely keep up with these products! Also it has spf 18 so no need to worry about the sun! I am so glad i found this now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love it!! It feels and looks great. After using for almost a week I can already notice a little difference. My skin looks great and my fine lines look less noticeable. It also helps my foundation go on smoothly and evenly. I really like the way my skin looks and feels. I am definitely hooked on this cream and love that it has an SPF of 18, I like to be outdoors and now I know I always have some sun protection! I would highly recommend this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great product. I like the fact that it is non-greasy and has a pleasant smell. Most day creams like this make your face oily part way through the day but not this one and I have been using it a week and have already noticed a reduction in fine lines. Seems to plump up my face and make it smoother. Can't wait to see what it does more long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't tried this product for long enough to give it a full review but I can tell you this, it smells amazing and goes on very nice and smooth. Some products have a harsh smell that is hard to get used to and this smells very light and clean. The jar is a pretty decent size as well so you would feel as though you're getting your money's worth. I would recommend this product and I'm hoping in the next month I can really see a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and I am in love with it. It has a very light fragrance that is not at all overwhelming and it works well with combination skin. I have noticed a reduction in the crows feet by my eyes. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i think the Revitalift day cream moisturizer is great i have used it now for about 5 days i hadnt seen my daughter in a few days and she ask me what was i using on my face that it looked so soft and smooth just think after 4 weeks how it will look [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It has made my skin so soft. My skin has a glow and it feels so smooth. I will recommend this product to my mother. We both have the same sensitive skin and we are always afraid to try new creams but this cream is a winner. I would definately continue to buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just opened up my jar of day cream, what a pleasant scent! I dabbed my finger into the creamy cream and dabbed it onto my face. It went on so smoothly, it was quickly absorbed into my skin. It is so light, you only need to use a little, it goes a long way. What a wonderful feeling, my skin no longer felt dry, can't wait to use the other Loreal products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far im really liking this product. The daycream moisturizer does not feel sticky or greasy and leaves the skin feeling soft. It also has a great smell to it. All you need is a little bit when applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the full morning routine this morning- eye cream, face/neck sculpter, and day cream. I was worried at first about using all 3 since I'm not usually a big lotions/potions person and was worried it would feel heavy. It did not! The products were light, smooth and my skin feels great. Excited to keep up the routine and see if I see changes in my skin in a few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love L'Oreal products. I don't get skin irritation and dark spots because of it. Other products moisturize for only a few minutes but don't do anything. With L'Oreal I use it and my skin feels great now. I can't wait to try other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Just received the products today...started with the Revitalift anti wrinkle firming cream. It has already made skin feel really soft and smooth. I'm curious to see what 4 weeks will do. The fragrance reminds me of another brand's cold cream. And wow!! Full size products!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First I was concerned that it would be too thick on my face and not absorbed quickly enough since I tend to have that problem with cream. But with L'Oreal revitalized I found that that was not the case I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly absorbed and how light felt on my face. I have been using it for two days and haven't noticed any firming or anti-wrinkle benefits But I feel hopeful I will within due time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product a few times I have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin feels much softer and has a nice glow to it. This facial cream smells nice and fresh. It does not have a strong perfume smell, which is good. I also like the fact that there is sun screen in it too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is great! I recently got the chance to try it through BzzAgent and it actually works! You can feel the cream working on your skin to make it more firm and there is a noticeable difference in the appearance of my wrinkles! All this and only been using it a short period of time. You should try it too! #GotItFree #BzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so excited to try this Revitalift product from Loreal! I believe I am really needing a change to my skincare regimen and this campaign couldn't have happened at a better time. With the changing seasons I need to focus on my beauty routine on a full time basis. Thank you BzzAgent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product four weeks ago and love the hydration my skin has after. The consistency is perfect and my face doesn't feel sticky or oily after either. It helps my makeup go on smoother as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this product. I used it along with the night cream and I was able to see improvements with my dark spots left over from my acne breakouts after a week of application. It's a thick pudding like cream and a little goes a long way. This is competitively priced and is relatively easy to find and it smells like a bouquet of fresh spring flowers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this moisturizer. It's creamy yet light at the same time. It hydrates my dry areas and doesn't exacerbate my oily areas. It definitely makes my skin smoother and firmer looking. If it weren't for the fragrance I would have no complaints, although the fragrance does dissipate quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The formula is creamy and a little thick but absorbs quickly, doesn't feel heavy or greasy and works well under makuep. This will be one of my go-to daytime SPF moisturizers in the colder months as it provides all day hydration my dry skin needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the feel of the cream on my face. It did not seem to make my skin oily. The fragrance was light and enjoyable, not overpowering. I love that there was a built-in sunscreen. I feel like the product did a great job of moisturizing my skin; however, I did not notice a visible difference in the crows feet lines around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given an opportunity to try this product and I think it's a great. light-weight moisturizer for a variety of skin types. I love the addition of Pro-Retinol A and Sunscreen! My skin felt smoother, more hydrated and looked so much more radiant and ""plump"" when I used this moisturizer! This was the perfect base for my makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the soft scent of this moisturizer. It's non greasy and it does a great job moisturizing my skin and it's easy to apply makeup over it. I'm definitely seeing results after using it for 4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I adore this day cream, it has a great texture and moisturizes so well without leaving my face feeling greasy. After using this regimen (with the night and eye creams) for a couple of weeks, my skin was noticeably smoother, brighter and younger looking. I love that it has SPF 18 as a lot of great day creams don't contain SPF! It has a nice light scent that makes it feel very high end. It's a great deal for the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This wasn't for me. I have oily/acne prone skin and this only seemed to make it worse. I think this would be good for normal to dry skin. After a few days I started to break out. I stopped using it for a few days and then tried again, same break out issue. It felt nice going on and smells nice, but this wasn't made for acne prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was just a bit too heavy for me to use in the August heat (since I have combination skin that tends towards breakouts). The consistency is nice though and the fragrance is very mild. I can see using this in the winter time when my skin requires something a bit more moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a subtle fragrance and absorbs quickly. It was gently on my skin and did not cause any break outs. It was mild enough to use twice a day. I could really tell a difference in how soft my skin was when I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product and plan on buying more! Ive noticed and felt a difference in my skin in a short period of time. This product is easy to apply on my skin and made my skin feel really soft. I highly recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this worked very well as a moisturizer but after using it for a month I did not notice any difference in mt fine lines around my mouth. It was very thick which would probably be great in the winter but since this trial was during the summer I found it to heavy for daytime use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I cannot say enough positive things about this product. It's non free, doesn't breakout my skin, and goes on smoothly without being sticky. Made a huge difference with the light crows feet by my eyes, seems to plump and brighten skin as well. This will DEFINITELY be a part of my regular beauty regimen, and I cannot wait to purchase the rest of the line. Give it a try you will not be disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a really nice, thick day-cream that works well for my skin. It hydrates and smoothens well, and I love that it has SPF (although I do prefer at least a 30 SPF normally) with only a very light, fresh scent that is not overpowering. The only downside for me is the packaging. I really do not like using creams that are in jars. I just feel like it's a bit unsanitary and messy. Overall, though, this is a good and effective product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While this moisturizer was too rich for my combo oily skin in Aug, it will be great in the winter. I did use it for 3 weeks, I broke out a few days into using it but still continued to use it. My skin was very soft and looked healthy and firm. My make up went on much easier and seemed to stay on longer as well. I look forward to using the rest of this once the weather cools off. Could do without the added fragrance, don't see it being necessary at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the fragrance and thickness of this cream. A little bit goes a long way. We've had a lot of rainy weather considering we live in the ""sunshine state"" but the one day I was out and forgot sunblock, my face didn't get burned and I think that's due to the SPF. As for the anti-wrinkle/firming...I don't know if it did much, but overall my skin feels more moisturized and that is a good thing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got to try this for free through Shespeaks. Unfortunately, I don't like a lot of fragrance in my facial products--since they're right near my nose, it can be overwhelming--and this moisturizer has a pretty heavy floral scent to me. The moisturizer itself works well and I imagine that it would, over time, produce results, but I can't get over the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is so sensitive so even though the results were not drastic, I appreciated having a product that didn't make my face break out or turn bright red! My skin is softer and my lines are a bit lighter but i'm hopeful that over more time I will see even more improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream has a clean refreshing scent and is not too heavy, which I was skeptical of it being and was pleasantly surprised. It absorbed quickly into my skin, but didn't feel like I had anything on at all. The SPF works well. Definitely a fan!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! I love how smooth and creamy the texture is, not too thin and not to thick and actually smells very refreshing. I have used other similar products that were a little irritating on my sensitive skin but this is just perfect and I believe made just for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream is silky and rich, also fairly thick, so it would not be my first choice to use in the summer, particularly with a relatively low SPF factor. It does however hydrate well and it seems to have softened some of the fine wrinkles. I found it too thick to use under make-up, but it worked very well on the days I was home and did not apply any kind of foundation. I would not mind using this one in the winter for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for almost a month and find that my skin feels smoother and more hydrated. I didn't really notice any significant difference in fine lines but would recommend it nonetheless. I found that a small amount was all that was needed for full facial coverage so I expect the product to last for a good amount of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved using this product. I have dry skin so I found the consistency just right. It left my skin feeling incredibly soft. It also has a pleasant scent. I liked that it has an SPF 18 sunscreen. I did find that it seemed to reduce my fine wrinkles. However, I didn't see much difference in ""larger"" wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this Revitalift product because it was not heavy or oily feeling on my skin. I like to use a product that has SPF protection as I am frequently in the sun living in Texas and this product did give me the protection. It made my skin feel smooth and soft. My skin felt hydrated and looked better overall with a brighter complexion and less dryness. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried the day cream spf 18 revitalift. I honestly am not too wild about this product. i still do have my prominent nasolabial fold that still looks same as day one. Even the very fine wrinkles around eye are still visible. Product does do well as a moisturizer though hence 3 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream works very well. It feels so silky and is nice and thick. Fine lines and wrinkles were less noticeable just a few days after I began using it. I would absolutely buy again and recommend to all of my friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is an effective part of my beauty routine. I feel that my face looks better when I use the product. I look fresher and younger. I don't know that I had a long-term improvement, but when used regularly, I just look healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product worked well as a moisturizer, although was a little thick to use with cc cream. I didn't notice much difference in regards to my fine lines, but the spf kept my face protected throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the texture of the cream, it melted into my skin. Didn't give 5 stars because I didn't really like the scent which turned me off from using it daily. So, I am not sure my results were the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is smoother, moisturized and all out gorgeous! It's been 4 weeks now and my skin looks and feels great. I find myself going out with no make on more often than I was before. I will be 43 next month and this will continue to be a part of my skincare routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 is a good moisturizer. I am using it in the morning only because the cream is irritating my eyes. My skin feels very smooth and well hydrated after I apply the cream. I don't see much difference on my wrinkles but I still have half of the jar to go trough. Before I got this free sample I bought Loreal Youth code cream and use it at night so hopefully with these two products combined I will see some results. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product and it really helped my dry skin. I like heavy moisturizers, so I liked the texture of this product. I do not think it helped with wrinkles or lines. I think a product like this needs to be used for more than four weeks, so I plan on trying it for longer. I have very sensitive skin and this product was great on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product did not work for me. I used it once a day during the trial period and found that it totally changed the texture of my skin in a negative way. My skin became bumpy and did not feel soft and smooth. I would neither buy nor recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have oily skin, and I also have very fair skin that is super sensitive to the sun (ie I normally break out in hives). I wear a LOT of sunscreen and have had lots of experience with different brands. I really liked this product. It is thicker, yes, but absorbed very quickly and didn't leave a shine. I like the smell (its a bit perfume-like) too. I didn't see much of a difference in lines, but from the other qualities, I will keep this as a great option next time I need to buy more face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 is a great moisturizer. I only used it morning/night and not every 2hrs as the directions suggest. My skin felt smoother and looked brighter and more even [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product daily, and I feel that the deep lines on my forehead have somewhat lessened, although they are still there. I did not like the scent of this product, but it disappeared quickly, so that was not an issue. This is a thick formula, but it absorbed quickly and seemed to provide immediate yet temporary firming power. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 everyday since I received it. It has provided hydration and firmness to my face. It is a thick cream, however, you only need a little and it will spread all over and not feel heavy. It has a pleasant light scent. Best of all it provides protection from the sun. The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 is a great addition to my daily facial routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product! Great smell. Love that it has an spf of 18. Best of all, I noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles starting to appear on my neck were not as prominent after using the product for a few weeks. This is something I will continue to use on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the scent and it feels nice on my skin. I honestly have not noticed a difference in the texture of my skin since using it though. I wish it had a stronger SPF as I live in a tropical climate. I will continue to use it and see if I start to notice any improvement in my skin, but so far no changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin at all. I live in Wisconsin and I think this will be great to use during the winter months when my skin gets so dry. This product has worked very well for me. It goes on well and seems to absorb rapidly. It's not necessary to use very much at a time. It does have a slight ""make-up"" odor to it but that seems to dissipate quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. It is very thick, but is easy to smooth on. I also like that it is thicker because I can use it sparingly and it will last longer. My skin immediately looks and feels smoother and helps hide fine lines. However, it is a temporary fix, and I am not sure that I would want to use it long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using Loreal Revitalift SPF 18 Anti-wrinkle Daycream for about 20 days, I noticed a vast improvement on the skin on my face. Deep wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes were softened and less visible. My skin tone was tighter and my skin was noticeable softer. Loreal Revitalift Daycream worked wonders for my facial appearance and made my skin look firmer and younger. I will definitely add Loreal Revitalift Daycream to my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 since I received it in the mail. I love the texture. My skin tends to be dry so I loved the amount of moisture it provided and the SPF 18 was such a plus. My skin feels firmer so I will definitely continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this lotion! My boyfriend says that my face has been looking younger. I think the lotion is having something to do with it. I love the smell of it too! And it is not too heavy or oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was able to receive this sample to review. After just a week's use, I fell in love with it. The soft scent is great. The consistency is perfect for the summer underneath makeup or to use before running out the door. Definitely my new favorite day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been trying to find a cream that could firm up my skin and add sun protection but not feel heavy on my skin. This product fit the bill perfectly. I noticed a difference after about a week of use. It didn't make my skin break out. It didn't have an overpowering scent like some others on the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the cream and it absorbs into my skin well. It has a pleasant scent and feels nice. I have not noticed any improvement with my fine lines but I will continue to use this and see if I just need more time. I also wish it had a higher SPf and u a/uvb protection. The jury is still out on this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really wanted to like this....but it just didn't seem to be effective for me. I was only able to use it once a day as I found it too heavy/rich to wear under makeup during the day. So I used it only at night and did like the texture of it for overnight. But I didn't see any results. :-( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am torn on my review for this product. On the one hand, my skin nice and I have enjoyed using this product. On the other hand, I would not buy it and choose to use it for two reasons: (1) it doesn't have a good UVA protection ingredient, and (2) the open jar packaging will lead to rapid breakdown of the product by exposing it to air.

"I have been using this for about 2 weeks straight now and although I do not yet see any lessening of wrinkles or fine lines, my skin is baby soft. Hopefully, I will see improvement as I continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Revitalift Cream for about a month now and I see a slight difference in my fine lines around my mouth. It is a little on the thick side, but I do like how well hydrated my face does feel. I use it morning and night and I do like the added SPF. When the temperature and humidity is on the high side I do find the cream a little too heavy, so it may be best during the cooler months. The scent does not bother me at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited to try out this product as I had been eyeing it in the store for a while. It worked well as a moisturizer, but was a bit heavy for summer. I bet it would feel heavenly in the winter on my dry skin. I did not really notice any changes in my fine lines, but I appreciated the SPF factor. One thing I did not like was the fragrance. I do not like my moisturizer to smell so strongly and the smell lingered all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am kind of torn with this product...I loved that it was SUPER hydrating so I had high hopes that it would diminish the fine lines that have started popping up on my forehead but after 4 weeks, I am sad to say, I cannot see a difference. Maybe it takes longer?? I still have some left so I am going to continue in hopes this will work. If not, it's off to another product in hopes of getting rid of these blasted lines!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This face lotion was a lot thicker than I normally use on my face. I think it would be better in the winter. The smell was a little strong for face lotion too. It seemed to work ok but I found myself washing my face since it made my face greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Honestly, I was not a fan of this cream. It was too thick for me. I used it twice a day. I did not notice any of my ""wrinkles"" fading or anything after 2 weeks of daily use. I did appreciate the SPF factor in the cream because I'm in the sun a lot during the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did like the Loreal Revitalift. I did notice that my skin was firmer, and some of my deep forehead wrinkles were softened. I did like the extra sun protection that it provided. The scent was noticeable when I first put it on, but then faded some, but my husband could still smell it on my face after work. I did notice an overall more youthful appearance to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product as directed and felt that it was to thick for summer time use. I think during winter it would be much better to use as it is a heavy moisturizer and people don't use sunblock during winter months. Also, I didn't care for the scent. As I used the product I did not notice any major change in my fine lines, wrinkles or skin's firmness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Overall I enjoyed this product and since it is Loreal, you know it is quality. My face felt very hydrated while using it. It's a rather thick cream, so felt a bit heavy for summer. I think I will enjoy it more once winter arrives and plan to keep it a part of my beauty regiment. I was using it once a day and hope when it's collet, with twice a day treatments I'll notice more change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Liked it- nice and thick for dry skin. Wish it had higher level of SPF (usually wear 50 on face during summer months.) Didn't notice any diminishment of fine lines, although I don't expect much from a day cream. Scent was a little too perfumey for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the cream a couple weeks ago. I only used it once a day because I just didn't have time or forgot to apply it again. I like the scent of the cream it was light and not perfumee. I agree with some of the other reviews that my face did seem more greasy. With that being said I did see a slight difference in the firmness of my face and the wrinkles around my eyes. I would recommend it and will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It sounds crazy, but I noticed results IMMEDIATELY. Loved this product ! No strong scent (unscented completely), not too thick / not too thin, absorbed completely, non greasy/ tacky, and really smoothed my fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this cream! It has a pleasant fragrance, thick yet it smoother over my skin so easily - no mess, and not greasy. My skin feels very hydrated (I use in morning and at night) - and I feel good. Great product, this is a must for daily routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this product. It was non greasy, non smelly and seemed to work well. I applied mornings to a clean face, it absorbed well, then applied my make up. With the Loreal name behind it, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not care for this product. It was too thick for my skin. I am in my 50's now but people tell me all the time I look younger. I was eager to try this on some of the wrinkles I do have but after the first use, it was just too thick and greasy feeling for my skin. I love L'Oreal products and think the quality is fantastic, but this particular one was just NOT the right one for me. Possibly in the winter when the weather is colder and drier it might be better, just too heavy right now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My concern was that this would be too greasy, a problem for me in the summer. It wasn't bad, but it was kind of thick to put on. I liked that it had sunscreen but you have to re apply. Again, that meant applying a thick cream several times a day. I didn't feel much of a firming difference after several applications. I think with some tweaking, this would be great. For now, I can only say it is good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the fact that sunscreen was in the product. However, I would have preferred a higher SPF, especially for the face. The product smelled nice, but was a little thick. I did not notice any difference in fine lines or wrinkles. I would not recommend the product since it contains methylparaben, a preservative. I would prefer a paraben free product, especially for the face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream though moisturizing did not live up to its ""lift"" or ""firm,"" I have other creams that do a better job. I do like that it had an SPF for daytime wear. This would be an ideal cream for the fall/winter, its a little thick for the summer. Do not apply it if your pores are open after a warm shower or a heavy workout, it stings a little. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very excited to try this new product! I have used it daily since the day it arrived. I was happy to see a daytime antiwrinkle cream that had SPF in it. I felt the product definitely moisturized but I did not care for the fact that it smelled like sunblock. I would definitely purchase this product and recommend to others if the fragrance formula was changed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this moisturizer because it absorbed well and had some SPF in it. It was enough for brief sun exposure but not enough coverage for more than that. It did improve my skin's texture and appearance but was a little too greasy for the summer - I'm looking forward to seeing how it'll do in the dryer winter months.

"I have always used Oil of Olay. I received this brand free for a trial. After a week, I started to see results and people asked me what have I been doing different. It has helped me look younger. I will continue to use this product as I am very pleased with the results and like how it feels. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to see results. It is not a miracle cream, but worked for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product daily for 4 weeks and I did notice a small improvement, especially on my neck where the loose skin is a problem. It absorbs quickly and has a nice scent. I will continue to use to see if it can make a more dramatic result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually love L'oreal products. This one is a let down. The cream is so thick and left a shine on my face. So much so that I felt like I needed to wear makeup just to help tone down the shine. I did not notice any firmness to my skin after using it daily for the 4 weeks. I did however notice that my face broke out more than usual, in spots that it normally doesn't. The only difference was the cream so I have to believe it was the cause. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I love Loreal products, I found this one to be a little heavy for me. I am a big sweater, and I do not like a heavy product on my face, even if it is a night product. It just causes me to sweat more and the product sweats off and I not only get no benefit of the product, but then, I am a sweaty mess. I would recommend if you do not having any such issues, however. Loreal has some wonderful products I trust and use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream religiously and can definitely tell the difference. My skin feels softer and more hydrated. I love the subtle fragrance and really appreciated the extra built-in sunscreen. It does leave a shine when worn alone, but I usually wear foundation so that is not an issue for me. Also, you can't beat the price; Amazon has a two-pack for around $25. This lotion easily competes with much higher end products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for review purposes all opinions shared in this review are entirely my own. I did like the cream. It goes on well and smooths easily into my skin. It also has a seemingly brightening effect. I noticed a difference in my skin within a few days of using it as my skin tends to be very dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the Product free to review it. The cream is rich . Gives me lots of Moisture ,makes my skin soft ,smooth ,glowing. There are no harsh chemicals in it so no irritation on my ski. The fines wrinkles and lines are reduced. Over all Im very pleased with the Product. I like that it Protects with broad spectrum UVA/UVB SPF 18 sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Started using the product (moisturizer) as soon as I received. After approx. 7/10 days noticed a subtle change in my skin. My face seems to be more radiant and glowing. Love the sunscreen in product. Use every day from now on. thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the Revitalift Anti-wrinkle Firming Day Cream for about 3 weeks. I like that it has an 18SPF sunscreen, but I thought the cream was a little thick for use under makeup. It's fine though if you just use a moisturizer. I'm 52, and I do have fine lines and wrinkles, but have not noticed any firming or reduction of them yet. I will keep using this cream though, it may just take more time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I try the product for a few weeks and already could see some results. My skin looks younger, my wrinkles are smoother and my sking has less brown spots. I would be my favorite product to use for my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was great...luxurious texture and I felt like I was giving my face a wake up call each day as I applied it! Not sure if it really did anything for fine lines but it certainly made me look fresh! It is a little heavy for a face moisturizer but I loved it. It also did not irritate my sensitive skin. I would definitely buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The only reason I am giving this a 4 and not a 5 is because the directions state to re-apply every 2 hours. That is not practical for most working people. Otherwise the cream was fantastic. I loved the thickness of it, has spf, doesn't leave any greasy feel afterwards, and didn't clog my pores. I recommend it for anyone looking for a reasonably priced cream with wrinkle protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how this product protects my skin with a great SPF 18. I love how it didn't aggravate my acne and how it felt going on. My face felt richer and softer with this product. I didn't notice it make my skin any firmer, tho. L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming cream was what I expected from a middle of the road drug-store product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very pleased with this product,I have definitely noticed an improvement in the firmness of my skin,I love that L'oreal Revitalift has a very light pleasant scent,the cream itself is very thick but when applied it does not feel heavy on your skin,I plan on continuing to use as a daily moisturizer,I would definitely recommend this to my friends... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was at first a bit skeptical about this product after reading the instructions. it indicated you needed to reapply every few hours and as a busy career woman that is simply not possible. I have been using the product for two weeks once every morning and it is a great moisturizer. I have not noticed any change to my skin's firmness or fine lines. So as a moisturizer I give it two thumbs up. But that's it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination skin and am used to using an oil-control moisturizer. This cream felt heavy on my skin and somewhat cakey under my foundation. I noticed a slight reduction in the wrinkles on my face and neck though and liked that it had SPF18 sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 to try out. Previously, I had been using an expensive moisturizer from Sephora. I have to admit, The L'Oreal product was surprisingly awesome. I'm in my mid-30s, but I hadn't been worried about wrinkles. However, after seeing the difference in my skin after using this product, I'm planning to finish up this jar and also maybe check out the rest of the product line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this day cream! It absorbed quickly into my skin. It was not greasy. It felt good on my skin, and did not feel heavy. This product did not interfere with my makeup application. My skin felt moisturized all day. My skin looked more useful the longer I used it. I did notice some tightening of my skin, my face looked more contoured. The condition of my skin has greatly improved since using this product. I will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always appreciate a face lotion with a notable SPF, but this one fell short in a few other ways. I didn't like the scent of the lotion and it had a slightly harsh feel to it. I didn't notice any improvement in skin firmness, but I don't suffer too badly from wrinkles. It did leave my skin feeling very silky smooth which was nice, but I wouldn't buy it just for that [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that it has sunscreen in it but having to apply every two hours?!? If I am at the beach yea but indoors. I did like the feel and how it absorbed into my face and neck. I did not like the smell. I thought it made my nose and forehead look shiny. No compliments from family or friends during the weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free for an honest review. Check out my U tube channel ravercat4 for the video version. I liked it. It made my skin soft and did help with wrinkles. It's really thick so I'm going to use it more in the fall/winter to help fight the cold dry weather we have here in Nebraska. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found the cream to be a bit like night cream - very thick and it came in a jar. I usually buy lotion that is in a pump because it is just easier. I love that it is spf 18 but I definitely won't be reapplying it every 2 hours. So does the sunscreen really work or maybe just for a little while. I didn't notice any difference in wrinkles during my use so not an instant fix but then what really is that quick. I will continue to use the cream until it is gone but probably wouldn't buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is fabulous!! I've finally found the perfect moisturizer. It doesn't sting, it is weightless, absorbs and completely moisturizes, and leaves my skin looking soft, fresh, and healthy. Does not get ""tacky"" like so many other lotions. Amazing stuff. Thank you!!! I'm crazy about this stuff..I just wish it was a bit cheaper so I can be more liberal and apply more to my chest area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far this product is working well. It is not a miracle item though and doesn't instantly help reduce wrinkles. I love how my skin feels though and will continue to use and hopefully see more lasting results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first I was a little skeptical of a cream for day use -I was worried it would be too ""heavy"". But I found a little goes a long way and it does not feel heavy at all. I love the clean, fresh scent it has! It's helped keep my dry patches under control and has really helped smooth my chin. I will definitely keep using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love it! It I was fortunate to receive a sample of Loreal Daytime moisturizer with spf 18. It made my skin feel moist and supple. It made my fine lines less visible. The spf 18 was a bonus in the moisturizer. Just fabulous and I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this day cream. It has a nice texture and absorbs completely when applied. I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin's firmness and there was a slight reduction of wrinkles. I will continue to buy and use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Have only had L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream for two weeks but I CANNOT believe the difference already! My skin is much softer and the fine lines seem to be fading. Hubby asked if I was doing something different. "" Not sure what you're doing but it looks great!"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product. The cream felt thick and luxurious, it went on nicely.It did not have perfume-y smell, it was lightly scented. I put it on under my makeup in the morning. My skin felt smoother and my fine wrinkles looked a bit smaller. I really liked that it was S.P.F. 18 and I did not have to put on extra sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really made my skin feel hydrated, but didn't have the firming properties I was hoping for. Perfect for everyday because of the SPF factor. All in all, I liked it, but still looking for that special cream that really helps firm and hide wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cream, A little goes a long way. Easy To Access Jar,Easy To Use.I like the texture and how it blends into my skin. Silky smooth to the touch. It is not sticky and heavy.Goes on skin very easy looks like I have firmer skin my wrinkles seems to be softer lighter or reduced. and a great price yes I would tell my friends family to try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow! Pleasantly surprised by Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream! After using it for 3 weeks I believe some of the little lines are starting to disappear! and my face does feel firmer than before! I would hope to have a higher spf # thanks! ml [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the cream. It was a good way to moitureize. I also liked the fact that it had sunscreen. That said, I didn't like how it said to reapply every two hours. Seriously, when I get up in the morning and put on make-up, I don't want to redo my entire face every two hours for effective sun protection. Over all, it was a good moisturizer and that was about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using this product for 2 weeks now and I am completely satisfied with it as moisturizure . I would have to say that it might be too early to review it as a firming cream . I spend lots of money on brand name creams and after trying L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Cream I will save some money and switch. This product feels great on my face, it hydrates well . I am very satisfied with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a good candidate for this product since I only use a sunblock/moisturizer in my daily routine...no serums, no makeup. I also have sensitive skin. This cream was very rich and thick which I like. It kept my face moist throughout the day. As I expected, the SPF was great and protected my skin during a Texas summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw a difference in my skin both in texture and firmness. After 2 weeks it was soft and now after 4 weeks it was firmer less wrinkles. I just need something that can help me with bags under my eyes. I would recommend this to my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very pleased with the Loreal Paris Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream! It improved the appearance and feel of my skin with each use. My skin is smoother and brighter looking. It has a nice texture and scent. It seems like a good value because you only need a little for each use and the jar is a large size. Thanks so much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought my skin definitely looked brighter. I loved how soft and moisturized it felt. I would definitely purchase this product, though i still have a good amount left after using it every day good size container [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved using this cream! I liked how it went on so smooth, and the scent is nice and light, not too strong. My face felt nourished all day long and after just a couple of weeks, I could feel that my face was a bit firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about 4 weeks now. While I haven't noticed any significant reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, it is a good moisturizing product. It glides on and doesn't feel heavy or greasy. It does have nice scent and I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have really enjoyed this cream! I have used it every morning for about 4 weeks and definitely noticed an improvement in the overall quality of my skin. It feels wonderful and there is a luminosity that wasn't there before. The cream absorbs into the skin right away but leaves it feeling moisturized all day. Love that it has spf in it. It does have a slight scent but it doesn't linger. I definitely recommended this and will continue to repurchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive skin, so I was scared that this product would break me out. It did not, It was a very gentle cream. My skin has developed a brightness/glow to it. I would definitely recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the product for a few weeks. I don't find that it does much for my skin. I do not see any difference from before using it. It has a pleasant fragrance to it. It goes on very smoothly. I am not sure if I use it more than what I have already if it will make any difference in my skin or not. Time will tell or until the bottle is used up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like how this goes on nice and light. The scent is pleasant. I did not really notice any difference to my wrinkles and lines. If it was not so expensive I would consider switching to this face cream, but feel the price is too high for the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 for one month I did notice a slight improvement in some of the lines on my face. I do tend to break out from products with SPF and this was no different. Aside from the break out, I did find the cream to be very moisturizing but not greasy. I am very happy about the reduction of the fine lines on my face. I would recommend this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was pleasantly surprised. My other moisturizers usually feel oily or make my face break out, not this product. not only did my crows feet diminish my skin looked fresher my pores smaller and my breakouts became less. I love the fact that it has an spf was handy on the days in the sun. Overall I really like this and will continue to use it after the trial period. My niece is getting married in less than a month and I will look great in the pictures! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried Revitalift anti wrinkle firming. I thought the product did great. It moisturized my face all day long. My face felt smooth and soft. It did have a firming effect to it. It tightened my skin . And for wrinkles I really didn't see any change as of yet. But maybe with continued usage, it might work. The scent of the product to me was fine. I liked it it was a light scent and not heavy at all. It also wasn't greasy at all. All in all I liked the product and I would buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream L'Oreal Paris is a great product it absorbs quickly and makes your face feel and look great. I am really happy with the L'Oreal revitalift my face looks so much better and I will continue to use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received L'Oreal RevitaLift moisturizer to try. I've been using this product for almost a month. I like the SPF 18, and that it went on light and creamy, yet not greasy. It worked well as a moisturizer on my combination skin. Unfortunately, I did not notice a difference in my fine lines and small wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this cream, because of the name brand and because it has SPF. I started using the cream on the first day of the trial up to now and am still trying it out. The cream is thick and goes on smoothly. I did NOT like the fragrance, it's very strong and smelled like something an old woman would use. I also did not notice a change in my appearance. I'll finish the jar and see if there's a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was a change for me using something with an SPF in it in my face. I liked how it went on and soaked right in! It also saved me from a nasty burn on my face! Can't say that about my shoulders and chest where I didn't apply anything. Wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to use this product because of the built-in SPF. However, I found that it was way too heavy to use as a day cream. It made me look greasy and made my face sweat twice as much as usual. It did hydrate well, so I used it at night, but that made the added SPF pointless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found this product too heavy to use in the morning but used it each night. I think it may work for day time use in colder months when my skin tends to be drier. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I quite liked this day cream. It smoothed onto my skin easily, did not feel greasy, had a pleasant, light scent and absorbed quickly. It also did a fine job of protecting my fair skin from the sun as i wore it all day (6 hours or so) in bright, sunny conditions and I did not burn-I did not even need to reapply. I did not notice any difference in my skin so far as wrinkle/fine line reduction but perhaps with continued use, I would. Thanks for allowing me to try and rate this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the way this product moisturizes and almost makes skin more luminous. Unfortunately it makes me break out in certain areas like the chin so I can't use it all over my face but for someone who doesn't have this problem this is a great product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The scent is very nice. It applied very smooth and not very greasy. One day I forgot to add extra sunscreen when I went to thye beach and I actually did not burn. It has great coverage! I noticed some fine line around my eyes go away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am glad the product contained SPF especially while reviewing the product in summer. The product is non greasy. I am allergic to many different moisturizers, creams and make-ups but did not have any issues with this. I will buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this product and can say I haven't noticed any difference. When I put it on, I could feel it on my skin all day. As far as firming and reducing wrinkles, I noticed no difference at all. I didn't like the smell of the cream, unscented products would be better. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this product. However it is not something I would purchase.

I noticed a difference in my skin after 3 days of using this product.I have hypothyroidism and my skin tends to get extremely dry. Ever since i have been using this product my skin is no longer flaky and dry. My skin is smoother and firmer!!! I would highly recommend this product for dry skin and its firming effect.I will no longer buy the face cream i was using and will be buying this instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this face cream. It's not greasy or heavy. After one month I really haven't noticed a huge difference in filling in the fine lines but my skin feels firmer and wearing it in the summer months hasn't been a problem. The sun protection that is built into the formula is a great advantage. I love that I can skip applying sun protection. My make up looks smoother when applied over revitalift. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given the chance to test L'Oreal Paris revitalift and I'm convinced it works. My eyes lids are firmer along with my cheeks. The smell is pleasant and it goes on my skin nicely with being greasy. The bonus is that it has SPF in it. I will now buy my next jar! Thank you She Speaks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream is light and smooth, and easy to apply. It absorbs very nicely, so it's not greasy and I can go right to bed afterwards without waiting for it to dry. I noticed the fine lines around my mouth and eye were noticeably smoother, but the deep wrinkle in my forehead doesn't look like it changed much. My face felt firmer, and my makeup application seemed smoother. I really enjoyed using this product and would buy it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm slightly obsessed with skin care products and this one did not disappoint! From its high end packaging to its thick texture to its subtle fragrance, my L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 was luxury all the way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I TRIED THE LOREAL PARIS REVITALIFT ANT-WRINKLE PLUS FIRMI SPF 18 CREAM . I LOVED IT . IT MADE MY WRINKLES AND CROWS FEET GO AWAY AND MADE ME LOOK YEARS YOUNGER. I USED IT TWICE A DAY. WOULD RECOMMENDED IT TO ANYONE. THANKS THANKS [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product absorbs quickly and easily, leaving my skin moist but not greasy. Skin was plumped a bit from the moisture (not irritating at all) making small lines seem a bit less noticeable. After being admonished by my dermatologist about not using enough sunscreen, I was happy about using a moisturizer with a spf of 18! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. The fragrance is lovely and the product is creamy and is quickly absorbed right into the skin. I noticed a huge difference in my skins appearance and how it feels for the better. A little goes a long way but the container is huge so it will last awhile. I will definitely tell my friends and recommend for part of any woman's skin care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a full size sample to review. I absolutely loved the fragrance! It was sweet smelling but not overpowering. The consistency of this cream was quite thick but it spread well. I have combination skin and had to NOT apply it to my t-zone as it caused me to break out. Overall, I enjoyed the product but did not see a huge difference after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first couple applications of this product gave my skin a slight burning feeling but after a few days I no longer felt that sensation upon application. I love the spf factor especially during these summer months. I didn't particularly notice a decrease in wrinkles or increase in skin firmness but I like that it is not heavy feeling, nor greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and have been happy with the results so far. It was lightweight and not greasy. It made my skin feel softer and tightened. I also like that it has spf in it to protect my skin during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After testing this product, I found it to be absorbed into the skin completely and not greasy at all. Like that it has SPF in it. It has a subtle scent. I didn't notice the fine lines on my forehead changed at all, but did notice that the skin under my chin and neck appears firmer so I'm happy about that! I have also been using it on the back of my hands. Overall, I think this is a really great product and will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product every day for a month and i find that it has made my skin more smooth and has reduced some fine lines. I love how easily it is applied and it absorbs very quickly. I am a big fan of L'oreal products and this one is no exception. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received my free full sample of Revitalift Anti-wrinkle spf lotion. I used it daily since I got it and do notice firmer skin. I did think it made my face shiny but I began using less and that helped .The spf is only 18, I do wish it was a higher spf to use it throughout the year. I live in Texas and the sun is a killer here. Over all I do like the product and would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It definitely made my skin feel smoother. I didn't really notice any firming or lessening of wrinkles. It was lightweight and did not feel heavy on my face.

I have been using L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 for about a month. It has a creamy consistency and a light scent. I don't believe that it has firmed or soften my fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed using the L'Oreal Revitalift Anti-wrinkle and firming cream. I though the texture of the cream was great. It felt so good on my skin. It left my skin feeling moisturized but not at all greasy. Also I liked that the fragrance was not strong at all. I did not notice a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes however which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. But I would continue to use this product and I would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Initially, I really disliked this product because it gave my skin a shiny look. Eventually, I used much less of the product and that helped with the shininess. I used the product faithfully every day. I can't say that I noticed a firming effect or fewer wrinkles. I do plan on continuing usage - maybe it just needs a little longer to work?? I assume that its sun protection factor works just fine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely look forward to putting L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream SPF 18 on every morning.

I would highly recommend everyone to give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this product is smooth without feeling too heavy, and that it has a SPF 18. I go feels good under my makeup or even wearing alone. However I haven't noticed a significient change in the fine lines around my eyes, this product is still a great choice. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try it.

It really moisturizes my face very well and happy with that. As far as wrinkle reducing I really do not see any changes after using daily for 2 weeks or so. I would for sure recommend this as a facial moisturfer but that would be all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an ok moisturizer for normal to dry skin. Although my skin felt tighter on immediate contact, this moisturizer did nothing for my deeper lines. The jar packaging of this cream means that it's beneficial ingredients deteriorate upon opening. This type of packaging allows for bacteria to be introduced. I also prefer a higher SPF in products for day use. In my opinion the negative aspects outweigh the positive in this face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I am without many wrinkles (good genes sun avoider), it did wonders for my puffy eyes! The cream wasn't too heavy like others I have tried in the past and the fragrance was pleasant without being overbearing. I am a believer and will be purchasing in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the results. I my face is smoother and my skin looks a bit younger. I didn't live the greasy feel it left when first applied. At first I used in morning, but then I used at bedtime because it took a while to absorb into skin. One improvement I would make us to improve the scent. Unless your intent was to avoid using perfumes in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really enjoyed using Loreal Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming cream. It's one of the creamiest face lotions I've ever used, but doesn't feel too heavy - just makes my skin soft. The fragrance is nice, too - not too strong. I do think it performs as advertised too, giving me a solid foundation for my makeup, protecting my skin and not clogging my pores in the process.

"I was excited to get picked to review this, but I was not very impressed. I didn't see any difference in my skin, I didn't like the smell at all and I felt like it caused my skin to break out more than normal. All in all it just wasn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After receiving I was a bit skeptical, however after using for only two weeks my wrinkles are less visible! My skin feels not only tighter but smoother.

You have a new customer in me PS: And my mom :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was provided a sample of this product to try and really enjoyed it. Thought it absorbed well and did aid in wrinkle reduction and firmness. Just as good as any anti aging products on the market. I would definitely purchase this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had the opportunity of testing this product and it has worked well. It is not greasy feeling- has spf in it to protect from the sun and makes my skin feel smooth. I didn't notice much decrease of wrinkle lines but it does have a firming / tightening aspect to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the revitalist day cream almost every day for a few weeks now. I put it on under my mineral powder makeup. It is a great moisturizer and has sunscreen which is important to me since I have a fair complexion. I've noticed some fine lines around my eyes and smile lessen and the creases in my forehead seem to have diminished some as well. My skin feels firmer than before. I would definitely recommend this to any woman in her 30s. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like how well this absorbs in my skin and does not feel greasy. It seems to do a good job of protecting my skin from rays and I feel my skin has become softer looking over time. It seems to smooth out exisiting lines and I do not seem to notice any new ones either. Great simple scent as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given the opportunity to try L'oreal Paris Revitalift anti aging cream and I love it. I noticed that my lines are not as defined and my skin is softer and smother. The fragrance is a bit strong. Thank you to SheSpeaks for the free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the product a lot. I have dry skin and have a hard time finding product that makes me feel like my face is moisturized for more than an hour. The product has a creamy texture. The only thing that I didn't care for is the scent. It's a pleasant smell, but a little strong for what I want to put on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great product. I like the way it makes my face feel after applying it. It's not too heavy on my face. It doesn't have a bad fragrance to it. My face feels better than it did before using this product.. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who might be interested. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great moisturizer. It smells great and is very easy to spread. My skin felt moisturized and soft, but not tight. As for my fine lines, I really can't say I see much of a difference. Perhaps I need to use it longer. I would like to keep using it and will purchase some when this jar is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the texture and scent of the product. I really loved that there was SPF already in this product too. However,I didn't really see any significant changes in the lines around my eyes which was what I was really hoping for.Maybe with continued use,I will have more noticeable effects. I was very excited to have the opportunity to try this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved the texture and smell of Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle firming day cream. I think my skin definitely showed some improvement, and I liked the SPF protection. I also liked the texture, I like a thicker cream as I don't really wear foundation. I would definitely recommend it to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually enjoyed this product. It is one of the smoothest moisturizers I have tried and it truly does feel silky. It absorbed quickly and allowed me to then easily apply my makeup. The SPF factor is what I really liked in this product. I am always trying to protect my face skin from damaging rays. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because LOreal tests on animals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am really enjoying this product so far. It absorbs into my skin easily and fine lines are disappearing. The best part is the SPF coverage and that it DOESN'T pill up when I apply my makeup like so many other SPF products. Thank you SheSpeaks for letting me try this product. I will purchase this again!

I haven't noticed any major changes, but I've not used it for very long. The only thing I'm not particularly excited about is the smell. It reminds me of when my mom used to get a perm.

"I have been using the Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Day Cream for about 10 days now. I have definitely noticed a change in the elasticity of my skin - it feels and seems firmer. It goes on a little heavier than I am used to, but quickly absorbs and doesn't leave my skin with a greasy feeling. I also like the fact that it has a SPF in it because I am olive complected and tend to forget that I need sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I have been using it for four days now. My skin feels wonderful, so smooth and softer. My skin feels better than it has in years. I will write more later when I have used it for a longer period of time. I just wanted to let everyone know how great this is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I first put the cream on I felt a slight burning feeling. It started to feel uncomfortable so I washed it off and put on my normal moisturizer. The burning stopped but I did get an irritated itchy/ burning spot for a day. I think something in the ingredients did not agree with my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I started using this 3 weeks ago. I noticed how much smoother my skin is I use it along with the night cream and i do see a difference in the tone, feel, and overall radiance of my skin. I will keep using it for atleast another 6 months and see if my fine lines diminishes any."
"When I first purchased this, I used it for a few days and gave up on it, thinking it didn't work. However, I began using it again when I noticed how visible my acne scars were. To my surprise, I woke up this morning and was so shocked at how amazing my face looks now. It's been at least 2 weeks and the embarrassing acne scars have already faded dramatically. I wish I hadn't doubt this product before and will continue to use this product!"
"I am very picky about my face cream. Have tried many products, both high end and mid range. The Advanced Revita Lift Complete goes on easily, doesn't have a strong odor and does not leave a creasy residue. I have seen a difference in the small lines around my eyes improve and it makes the makeup go on easier. I would highly recommend this product."
"I have been useing this and Revitalift Night cream since 2009 while deployed to Afghanistan, I am currently deployed again and I actually have less wrinkles around my eyes now then I did before I started useing these products. I am always guessed to be in my 30's but I am 51."
"For a long time I used an expensive department store brand. I recently switched to Revitalift day and Revitalift night creams because I was noticing more fine lines and wrinkles that the expensive creams were just not addressing. After just a few short days, my skin showed a remarkable improvement. My skin is smoother, softer and appears to be tighter, fine lines and wrinkles seem to be less. I am amazed. I love these products. I love the texture, the fragrance, everything. Thanks L'Oreal"
"I had started using this product 3 years ago. In an effort to mix up my beauty routine, I tried a few other products, some much more expensive. Looking through some older pictures, I noticed how great my skin looked. I started thinking about what I was using at the time the photos were taken. Revitalift!! I ran to the store directly and puchased the eye creme and the Revitalift Complete. I noticed a difference immediately. It just works. And well."
"I bought this cream on vacation because I ran out of my other brand. The perfumey smell put me off and when I used it on my face, my face broke out! Too bad for me that I had thrown out the packaging and receipt before I realized it. Now I cannot recover my money back and I have a product I cannot use. What a waste of money!"
"This cream works wonders for my skin. Being of that certain age, I needed a little firming and this cream did it for me.I noticed a visible difference within 2 weeks of first using it. My skin looks healthier and younger. And, the SPF 18 is a bonus and works wonderfully!"
