"I received this product in BzzAgent and I reallly impressed. This product is really good. I felt my face healthy, shine. The only thing is I not see change in the lines in my face, but anyway I saw change in my face. I really recommend."
For the price this realy works. I can see the lift under my chin.
"This cream really does plump up my skin and reduce fine lines. It makes a visible difference. I buy very expensive creams at high end day spas, but I always keep this on hand (as well as the age defying night cream that comes in the red bottle by L'Oreal) because it really makes a difference on my skin."
Very good really helps
"First time using the product; I liked the pleasant smell; didn't make my face itch; didn't like the fact that you had to place fingers ""exactly"" right to get product out of both tubes....frustrating!"
"Puchased this online, price was less expensive than in store. This is the second wrinkle product I have tried, and so far the best. I have used for about 3 weeks, have have noticed some reduction, though not significant. My skin is definelty clearer and healthier looking- I put this on, then an additional moisturizer. It does not sting or burn, and seems to soak in pretty quickly. I will purchase this again."
I have been using this for quite a few years. Once in awhile I get one that the red runs out quickly. This time both sides ran out quick. Within a week. This has never ever happened before. I cannot afford this happening. If this happens again I will find another product.
"I purchased this product along with the scrub according to the reviews I've read. Well, I have very sensitive skin and was a bit skeptical. I started using it right away, day and night. I'm 57 years and have no wrinkles but started noticing dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. The good news for me is that I did not have any allergic reaction, but the bad news is, it did absolutely nothing. I used the entire bottle hoping for something and nothing. I do like the scrub, but the double lifting did not work at all for."
"I can't review this product because the bottle was broken when it arrived. It was not shipped in a box to protect the product and we all know how packages are thrown about on conveyor belts, etc. I returned it to the store for a refund. May try again BUT I will purchase it at the store and be sure the bottle is intact."
"This is a great product and it really works. I have seen the difference in lines and wrinkles in my face and neck area and I use it faithfully, never miss a day. Just try it for a month and you see what I'm talking about. It leaves your skin very soft and firm."
"I love this product and have been using it for 5 years, and each year there seems to be a bit less product in the bottle, and the dispensing pump seems to get clogged more often. I had to throw away a few bottles shortly after the purchase. Also, sometimes either the red gel or the white lotion runs out before the other one does. I love RevitaLift and the fact that it's the only drugstore product that works like a department store brand. So PLEASE improve the dispensing pump and keep the amount of the product consistent."
"I have been using this product for about two weeks. The best results come from using it every day. Use it following facial cleansing in the morning, and then apply to areas needed at night. Within a few days you should see some marked improvement in skin tone and fine lines."
"I used to spend big $ at Sephora for my moisturizers. I didn't have time to get there one day, so I decided to try this product. I find this to deliver as well, if not better as the products I was buying at s much higher price point. Additionally, this has a much better scent than the other had."
"The product is great! Works as stated. The only thing is that I wish you would just mix the two products together to be dispensed as one. I mix the two together on my finger before applying. The red product almost always has a hard ball from being left in the end of the pump applicator, which I have to pick out before applying the mixture. It's annoying! Just mix the two products together to make a pretty pink lotion. I think the problem of the hardened product would not be an issue then."
I am only on my 2nd day of using this product but I can already tell a difference! My neck is not sagging like it normally does and I don't see the wrinkles near as much on it or my face! No burning or redness yet like some people have complained about but I will put an update on here in a couple of weeks to say how it's going. So far I love it!
"I LOVE RefitaLift Double Lifting! I have been using it for years and my skin looks much younger than my age. I like that the cream and gel come out together, it makes it fast and easy to use. I also usually run out of the pink gel before the cream, but now I just finish up the cream before I start a new bottle. Love it!"
First time I used this product I saw great results in tightening and a glow of my skin with in days.Red did run out to fast. Im on second bottle and the results are not as noticeable or maybe its maintaining the skin. Im going to incorperate the other Revitalift products for brown spots and deep smile lines.
"I have been using this for about two weeks now. I do notice a difference in the firmness especially around my neck. What I do not like and made me mad is that when I first got it, the red side would come out until about the 5th time of me using the white side. I had to waste the white side to even get to the red side."
"This is the worst product I've ever purchased from L'Oreal and I'm extremely disappointed. This is a cheap bottle of I don't know what, but it smells like alcohol and there's no moisture to it. I will never buy this again"
I love this product but it does seem to run out rather quickly. Some times the red side does run out first but overall excellent results
"I like this product, but every time I go to use it the red product is hard at the tip of the dispenser. My guess is that I'll run out of the red before the white because of this. I can't use the hard product on my face."
I tried all L'oreal prodects and all work but this one works the best for me. I use it am and pm. My husband has even seen the difference in my skin since I have been using this lotion. I love it. pat
"I love this product, but the red side doesn't work at all on my latest bottle. I agree with others too that the red side always runs out many pumps before the white cream. I contacted the company to see if they will make it right."
I noticed with the first used that this worked great on my neck but it left my skin feeling very sticky. The dispenser does not work well and there are hard pieces in the red side.
"I have tried every drugstore brand, and also some high end. I purchased Revitalift eye, serums, day and night creams. I literally noticed a change over night! Been using 5 days, and my 44 year old skin is transformed! I used to wear full coverage foundation on entire face and in just days I'm only using foundation to cover a little on my cheeks from melasma. Very very pleased with this line!"
A week later and no noticible difference
"I love this Product! I love the convenience of the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Moisturizer because it comes with moisturizer AND serum in one. It goes on smoothly and does not ball up on your skin like most moisturizers. It has a light, fresh fragrance to it that's not overwhelming like other moisturizers. I can already tell a huge difference in my skin after only a week. This is my new go to moisturizer and serum!"
I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem with this product. I have bought this twice and both times I run out of the red lotion and just have the white left. I don't know what I can do to fix this problem. It seems like I am wasting my money.
I luv this product and have used L'Oreal for years. I use it because it keeps my skin looking younger and people notice. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed....The dispenser just doesn't work right. First tje red gel quit coming out and now neither side works. Was very disappooined. I use all of the cleansing products and I use the double lifting eye cream too.
I love this product but arrived at this site looking to complain that the pink gel runs out long before the cream. I thought the dispenser maybe was clogged but this is the second purchase and the same thing happened again. Since I see everyone seems to be making the same complaint I am wondering why this problem is not being addressed by the company.
I've had this product for approx. 3 weeks. I've notice some improve in the fine lines & deep wrinkles. I will continue to use this product.
"I have seen mixed reviews on this product, but I personally love this. It does a great job making my skin feel tighter and just overall better."
This s the best product I have tried it took 10 years off . I have all my friends using and loving this product
"The product works great but the red side runs out way to soon, leaving you with only the white cream"
I agree with others that the pink side runs out before the white side of the Revitalift Double Lifting.
smelled so strong and perfumy like a cheap fake smell was greasy unlike their other products bad product
"Always been my favorite lifting serum. Really works, I use it for my sagging upper eyes."
Good job for price
"I like this product and have gotten it several times. However, the reason I am disappointed in it is that the under eye cream doesn't last nearly as long as the upper eye lift. I kept thinking it was something I did but I no longer feel that way. I don't think the cream gets filled to the top and how would I know because of the way it is designed. I have decided to try other products."
"I bought this 1 week ago and have used it 4 or 5 times. It is very moisturizing, but thats all I can say. I went to use it this morning and the red side will not come out. I noticed yesterday that there were hard chunks that came out of that side and now nothing comes out."
this product was great for the first couple months ( I noticed a visible difference under my eyes) but after a while I stopped seeing results (probably because the product wasn't as fresh). I wouldn't recommend keeping this product past 6 or 7 months.
"I really liked the product. Not oily feeling, absorbs quickly and feels smooth. The pump on the red side (the pink gel) does not work. I had to break off the top of the bottle to get to the product. I also noticed that there is a lot more of the cream than the gel. I would not buy this product again simply because of the hassel over the bottle."
"I really like the way this combo makes my skin feel with use, but have a problem with the gel running out before the cream. The first time I thought it might have been that package but it continues to happen. There is at least a weeks worth of cream after the gel runs out."
"I LOVE the Revitalift Double Lifting. I look younger and my skin feels great. The product comes in two tubes and mixes as you pump. This system never works well. One side runs out before the other, or one side just stops working. Product GREAT . Packaging NO GREAT."
Bought this product over a month ago & saw or noticed no improvement!
I have been using the RevitaLift Double Lifting for approximately a month and have grown very fond of this product. I would definitely buy this product and recommend it to all of my friends.
"Been using this since it came out. I use it on days when there is no sun or i dont leave the house ans before i go out dancing. it works great! im 34 years old right now,no sign of wrinkles at all!"
I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I love the way my skin looks and feels so far!!! Will definately continue!! I have had excellent results with ALL Loreal products!!!
"I bought this today and was looking forward to trying it. When I went to use it, only the white moisturizer dispensed. The lifting gel wouldn't come out. I'll be returning it tomorrow and looking for something else."
"I didn't really notice any difference in the ""lift."" The texture of the white portion is nice. I tried to press on the center of the container so that both creams would dispense at the same time, but the red/pink cream ran out first. Maybe that is the ""lift"" serum and is more expensive to produce so less is put in the container?? I won't purchase this again. The product is not worth the cost."
"Disappointed, I have purchased Double Lifting twice and not too sure if I am going to continue purchasing and using it. The red gel has ran out before the cream with both bottles I have bought. After using for about 7 weeks now, I have seen a little results but not enough to continue using when product runs out."
with the very first use I could tell it was working. I saw a difference after 2 weeks use and am going to continue to use it and hope the results just keep getting better. I am happy to have seen the Dr. Oz show that listed this product and couldn't be happier with my experience with it.
"I tried RevitaLift Double Lifting once, over a year ago, to complete the RevitaLift skincare regimen. I used it for a few days to find it was a little too much product for me before makeup application. This was also before the new serum was available. I liked the cream, but I didn't much care for the gel formula and tint even though my makeup would cover. It could be that my skin wasn't ready for this type of preparation and it was too much for my skin type. I gave it to one of my sisters."
"I am using Revitalift double lifting for 10 already and I like the results.Seen visible tightening under my eyes and the sides of my nose.My face looks smooth,the pores smaller...hope to continue and see more big results. My friends commented re my skin,not sure yet if it is because of the cream but told them I am using a new cream on my face."
"I'm only 25 and purchased this product in hopes to remedy the early signs of fine lines on my forehead. The lines are not only worse, but developing elsewhere, such as under my eyes. I take good care of my skin - I don't smoke or spend time in the sun, etc. The only redeeming factor for this product is its nice scent..."
"I have this product--basically the same concept of dual creams--and i love it however, I cannot get the pump on this version to deliver the pink gel cream. I came on this website looking for a 1-800 number as I lost the receipt of Walgreens store that I bought the product in. I really like the concept and DO want to use it! :)"
I was happy until the gel ran out way before the lotion
I like the product but twice I run out of the red cream. This time the red is not dispensing. Very bad packaging. Fix it please.
I can really tell the difference after using my 1st can of the double lifting. I highly recommend this product.
"I recently seen this product on Dr. Oz, so I purchased it and I saw instant results..........It really amazing!!"
I love this product and use it daily under my makeup. I've been using this for over a year and have great results (age - mid 50s)
Tried this product but did not see any different. Was really hoping it would work. I always use L'oreal products like shampoo
WONDERFUL SERVICE AND VERY EASY TO ORDER. IT TOOK 2 MINUTES FOR SOMEONE TO COME TO THE AREA WHERE YOU PICK UP YOUR THINGS AND HAD IT IN MY HANDS. LOVE IT !
This product is amazing and really works. I have used it for quite a while now and the results are excellent. I am a 66+ senior and appreciate this product very much. The price is also very affordable.
I LOVE THESE REVITA LIFT PRODUCTS! CAME OFF OF THEM FOR AWHILE BECAUSE I HAD HEARD OF A NEW PRODUCT AND I AM GOING BACK TO L OREAL REVITA LIFT!!!!!!! IT REALLY WORKS AND I GET COMPLIMENTS ON MY SKIN....I LOOK AND FEEL YOUNGER....
"I finally bought myself this product as a treat. So far, I'm loving the Revitalift line (I also purchased the 'Deep Set Wrinkle - Night' product along with the Double Lifting)."
I have been using this product about 2 months . The best result come from using it every day and night . Using in the morning with the day cream and night with the night cream . I have notice some improve in the line and deep wrinkles . That's for sure I will continue to use this product . As well leaves your skin very soft and firm . Just love it !!!
I use Revitalift face/neck twice a day. I like the texture and smell of the cream but at night I find it a bit sticky. I have not used this product very long so maybe I just need to get use to the feel of the cream. I will wait to see how much tightening it gives to my skin. I really need to give it more time.
"Love it! Really makes a difference when I am using it! Dimenishes my ""crepe neck"""
I have been using this for over a year now and I really like how it moisturizes my face and neck areas. A good product.
I have been using this product for a month and see no change at all. It leaves my skin feeling sticky.
Absolutely great. Great eye cream and a gel to bring down puffiness. Great for those of that are in our 50d and beyond. Great product
I love this product but haven't used it in a while. I never got a sample to try as it suggested in teh email but it is a good product to use.
Does help with wrinkles and some firmness is obtained. But don't expect miracles!
"This product is just a moisturizer, and it's claims are a bit misleading."
"Easy to use, I can feel it refreshing my skin. All of my friends use it. thanks L'Oreal!"
"Beautiful cream, great consistancy."
I like it
