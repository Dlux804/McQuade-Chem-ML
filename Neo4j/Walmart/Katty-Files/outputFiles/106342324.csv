I use a combination or the the rose cleanser and mask. I have not noticed any irritation but the mask does burn initially when I put it on.
I put it on and it immediately burns so I washed it off and my skin flared up and turned red. My skin is not that sensitive and it did this
"I was really liking this for the first few days but eventually I too started experiencing a burning sensation when applying. I also experienced the exact same thing around my eyes—dry, scaly and red circles started to form. I have combo skin with some v sensitive dry patches and this made them worse. Maybe alright for ppl with normal skin but def not for “sensitive skin” as advertised."
"i initially liked the moisturiser upon buying it, and i love the brand. but after a couple of uses, it started to cause burning about my cheeks and left them red. then i noticed this morning it's left red patches around the corners of my eyes. the patches don't burn, itch or hurt and i think the look kinda neat but it's not what i wanted. wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin whatsoever."
"Much like Beccah I was liking this product, but probably for 1-2 months before I started experiencing dryness around my eyes, forehead, cheeks, and has line. NOW, after some crazy weather, I have small red, minor itchy, dry patches on my left brow bone. Reading the negative reviews has led me to believe it is this product. (Shine due to light and Pacifica oil applied.)"
"I bought this because my skin is sensitive, hoping to find a new staple face cream. Sadly, it burned my skin when I tried it. I tried giving it to my mother and my daughter, apparently they can't use it either. So now it's sitting in the bathroom and I don't know what to do with it."
"I have used this in the past and recently picked it up. I don't know if the formula changed, but it smells different. It also caused irritation around my eyes and cheeks. My skin is red and rough."
Well my whole face looks sunburned and feels both burned and hot to the touch so- definitely not for me. I figured I was safe with it being free of all the less healthy ingredients and labeled for sensitive skin but- apparently not!
"Although this product says it is for sensitive skin, it has a strong almost minty fragrance that does not dissipate. Also the minty feel does not work well with sensitive skin because after washing my face then putting the moisturizer on it felt uncomfortable. Do not recommend for sensitive skin"
"I bought this for my fiancé who has sensitive skin. He told me it burned his skin, and gave it to me to use as my skin is not sensitive to anything. I put it on my face after cleaning my face with soap and water and patting it dry. Instantly my face was prickly and red, and raised welts appeared all around my nose, eyes and cheeks. I definitely would not recommend this be sold as a sensitive skin care product."
"All the peace rose products are wonderful but this moisturizer is absolutely the best (for me) I have ever used. I love it! Unfortunately, it has not been available for quite a while and I can't get an answer as to when/if it will ever be available again. I've wasted a lot of money with other products and companies trying to find something I like as well and haven't found it. Same for the peace rose face wash..it's the best but, sadly, not available anymore."
"I have very sensitive skin, I break out within minutes of using a product that reacted badly. A lot of people are saying they had a bad reaction and it's most likely to the tea tree oil in the lotion. Even if it is a small amount, it can cause the skin to react badly. I've ran into in the past with other tea tree products but with this product makes my skin red but it goes away in about 30 seconds, I haven't experienced any break out's in the past year I've been using it. So just be aware that there is tea tree oil in the lotion."
"Smells good, but dries out your skin so much that it feels and looks like a terrible sunburn. It stung right after I put it on after purchase and after 2 days of use my skin was blotchy, red, incredibly dry, and burning like crazy. This product may work for others with tougher skin, but for those with sensitive skin do not get this product. It is a mistake to say this is marketed for sensitive skin types. Pain pain pain on sensitive skin."
"I have sensitive skin and am picky about creams applied to my face. The first time I applied it and my face burned a little. I read it contains tree oil so it makes sense. After a while, the burning went away. It smells good and it does keep my skin soft and moisturized. It's the second day i have used it and I am used to the initial burning"
"I came across this moisturizer at a local TJ maxx. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I knew I was looking for something with recognizable ingredients. For instance, fragrance free. After using it for 6 months- my skin looked great! That is until I began running low and began to slowly have breakouts. It's odd but it worked. I recommend it"
I love the subtle Rose scent. who's to say that people with sensitive skin can't have a nice smelling moisturizer? I definitely feel like it softens my skin.
"This did have a burn when first applied, but it went away quickly. A lot of moisturizer make me breakout but this left my skin clearer than it's ever been. Compared to now after being out of it for a while, since I haven't found in stores lately."
"I love this stuff, it has cleared up my skin and I have sensitive skin. I wish I could be part of the shea company because honestly, I love all the products!!!!"
"I have very sensitive skin and battle extremely dry chapped skin in winter. This is the ONLY product I've found that works! It doesn't irritate my skin and it hydrates it so no chapped skin! Love, love, love this product!"
This is the BEST. Not greasy and your face feels SO soft. I never used moisturizer in the past because my skin is oily and other moisturizers make it feel greasy. This makes it feel soft and balanced and it has such a beautiful finish!! My skin GLOWS!!! I would recommend this to anyone.
"After running out of my usual moisturizer, I found the Peace Rose Sensitive Skin Facial Moisturizer in the store. I decided to try it as the company seems to use all natural products, which I look for in skin care products. I have had to stop using the moisturizer after one week because it has burned my skin and left painful red patches all around my eyes and cheeks. I'm not sure what ingredient in the moisturizer is causing this, but it is has left a noticeable redness and painful burning on my face."
"At first I loved the product and would apply it after washing my face, but then it would burn?? I can only apply the product to my cheek area because I love how soft it leaves my skin, but everywhere else it burns. Would not recommend for sensitive skin."
It's so interesting to me that other acne sufferers are praising this line. I also CANNOT SAY ENOUGH WONDERFUL THINGS about this product!! My skin looks SO NICE and feels so great after I use this moisturizer. My acne is going away as well as redness. It's truly amazing. I do t know what I would do if this product ever got discontinued. I'm very excited to try the other products in this line!!
"I felt it burning slightly right when I applied it but it didnt stop, so I ended up removing it. I was surprised because I don't typically have this response and come to trust the brand. Definitely will not be using again and will research better to buy more selectively from this brand."
"Unfortunately this product did not work for my skin. I normally do not react this badly, but my face immediately started turning red, burning, and stinging. I really wanted to like this, too. I am a big fan of other SM products but this is not one of them."
"Product works very well on my sensitive skin, no greasiness or residue. Love that the product has more natural ingredients than additives. I did not experience any side effects. Only negative would be that I smell like a rose for most of the day. This is a product for sensitive skin, fragrance could be eliminated."
"The smell is great, the consistency is amazing. However, every time I use anything from this line it burns like crazy immediately when I put it on until it dries then I break out with a rash all over my body. I am highly disappointed in all the money I put into trying the products in this line!"
I reciently switched to cruelty free cosmetics and after some online research I decided to try SheaMoisture. I bought the lip gloss set that features 7 full size lip gloss colors. I love this lip gloss it goes on easily and melts into your lips with out that sticky feeling. The colors selections are great and they each have a nice pigment. Definitely will be buying more products from this company!
"We love this product for our skin. It's luxurious but not heavy,"
"nourishing and moisturizing. One of the best facial creams I have ever used! Sorry to hear some people experienced reactions, and do not find it suitable for sensitive skin. I have experienced the opposite, and find it soothing for my skin."
I love thos product in the winter. It provides moisture during the winter months when the midwest cold temps want to dry my skin out. And bonus it smells fantastic! I don't use it in the summer b/c it makes my skin too greasy. I was bummed to know they stopped selling it in the stores.
I would suggest knowing how your skin reacts to various weather patterns (in general) before trying this product.
I keep reading about people having issues with their skin burning but i have extremely sensitive skin and i havnt had any trouble. Im not accusing those people of anything because obviously something doesnt agree with their skin but i would advise reading the ingredients. I hate rose scented anything but i tough it our becuase of how amazing this makes my skin feel. I deal with adult acne and i used to have super oily skin and a ton of clogged pores but this cream has helped me soooooo much.
"I love a lot of Shea Moisture products, but this moisturizer has got to be my favorite one ever! I do not have sensitive skin, so I don't know how well it works for those who do. But I love how it feels on my skin! It is very soothing and healing and leaves the perfect amount of moisture on my face; not too oily or dried out. And smelling like roses is always a plus too! :)"
"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one with burning skin. It burns immediately while applying, I thought how can that be since its for sensitive skin. I too like a previous reviewer got a rash on my cheeks from this. I won't be using this any more, my poor skin feels like sand paper after only two uses."
"I'm not one to post reviews but I feel this one is needed . I brought the whole product line . Oil toner and facial cream . The oil I used was fine so far but the toner and facial cream burned my skin , like rubbing alcohol. I was shocked for the fact that the products are supposed to be for people with sensitive skin . My skin was even dry the next morning . Y'all are too much to be burning and drying out my skin ."
"Love this product! I was super sketched out about trying it because I saw a lot of YouTube reviews where some users broke out into a rash. I have SUPER sensitive skin and have to be careful using certain products. The mask ""stings"" a little when first applied but that feeling doesn't last more than 10-20 seconds. I don't use the mask every day. Maybe once every week or two and it really softens my skin and makes the pores look smaller. Don't rub it in your skin, just smooth it out on the skin and let it dry."
The products smell good and are worth the money. There perfect for people with sensitive combination skin
"The image looks like the color is pink-ish, but when I got it, I was sad to see that it is very golden orange-ish. I have a wheat skin tone and this color doesn't look good on me at all. I will not be able to wear this gloss."
Smells great but burns like rubbing alcohol. Do not put this on your face if u have sensitive skin but it's fine for my hands or feet. I'm not letting my money go to waste.
"I Love this moisturizer, I love that it's not oily and it really does moisturize, but every time I apply it, I get this tingly feeling and it's unbearable at time because it feels like my face is burning. Maybe my skin is just way too sensitive."
"Love this moisturizer! Please don't discontinue this formula, it's worked wonders on my skin. Pores are smaller, skin is smoother and my skin tone has improved immensely! All with no break-outs!"
"At last, a cruelty-free, organic moisturizer that is affordable! The fact that Shea Moisture doesn't test on animals is very important to me. The moisturizer is fantastic. My skin feels soft all day."
"I don't know why this only has 3 stars. I'm in LOVE with this moisturizer. It's so light and the scent is so calming. Using Shea moisture products has worked wonders on my skin. I've never had acne so I switched to light, organic products and I stopped using harsh chemicals on my skin."
"I bought this because I have used a lot of other Shea Moisture products and really liked them-I thought ""Peace Rose Oil"" and ""for Sensitive Skin"" sounded perfect-but as others said, it is heavy on Tea Tree Oil which is the last thing I would recommend for sensitive skin-it burns!! I'm ver disappointed and will attempt to return this where I purchased it. I feel the naming and packaging on this one is totally deceptive and misleading."
"I never mind the smell of natural products but this one is different, it smells like moldy water something of that sort. I really don't like it. Then when I put this on my face I immediately felt a slight burning. So bad smell, and burning. I will not use it again and will return it."
"I used to get this all the time and it worked great. Then I had trouble finding it in the stores for a bit and was happy to discover it again recently. I don't know if something has changed in the formula, but it burns when I put it on and my face is red and disgusting."
"I usually don't write reviews, but this lotion has helped me so much, it'd be wrong not to. Initially, it felt tingly and my skin got red but I kept using it and about 3 days later my skin has been looking the best it's ever had. Nothing has ever helped, but using an organic, completely natural face wash, this lotion, and including lots of fruits and veggies everyday has INCREDIBLY made acne a thing of the past."
"I have oily skin and recent problems with my skin. I have tried all types of different moisturizers but all of them left my skin feeling sticky and greasy. This product hydrates my skin, smells amazing, but doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or look shiny. It is now my go-to product! So happy I found an organic product that works perfectly for my skin! Amazing product that I hope stays for years to come."
This facial moisturizer makes my skin feel awesome. I have seen improvement with the hydration and wrinkles. I really recommend it.
I was excited to buy this because I figured it's not so cheap & it claimed to be for sensitive skin.. As soon as I applied it my skin burned & got red. Worst $11 spent.
it BURNS and smells acidic and minty??? Then after a while it ITCHES. I can't stand this stuff!!!
"For this to be for ""sensitive"" skin...it burns like h-e double hockey sticks (since i can't use ""profanity""). It does keep me moisturized though. The end."
"I love this product but I'm not sure how I feel about the buring sensation, and redness when it's on I have read other reviews and they say the same I honestly don't know if I should keep it or Not use it anymore"
Lightweight and smooth. Does not make my skin feel oily or heavy and it leaves my skin with a light glow. I love it. I have sensitive skin and this is the ONLY moisturizer I've used that is perfect. No complaints!
This is a great moisturizer if you have sensitive skin. It feels good on my skin and it moisturizes better than any sensitive skin moisturizer I've ever used. Great Product.
"I purchased this “sensitive skin” face cream because it claims to be made specifically for sensitive skin. I used it for about a week, and it turned my cheeks red, dry, scaly, & swollen. I can smell the tea tree oil in the product, and I am certain that is what is causing the reaction on my skin. Since it is a great skin cream, I now use it elsewhere on my body so it will not be wasted."
"This is my go to moisturizer. I've went through about 5 jars and just picked up another one. My skin type used to be oily, but once I started drinking only water ( a gallon a day) I've became rather dry. This is the only facial moisturizer I can use that doesn't leave me greasy, and also eases my cheeks from being to tight."
I have very sensitive skin because of rosesea acne. This is my first time trying this line & so far it feels wonderful.
"I thought I was good until about a week into using it. This caused a burning sensation, followed by sore cracked skin around my eyes. Severe swelling is now occurring below the irrated skin. I will no longer take any chance with this product line."
I always have extra jars in waiting and buy multiples so I never run out. Love this face cream. This keeps my skin glowing and reduces the monthly hormonal acne I get. Love it! The only cosmetic item I use habitually.
Finally! A moisturier that makes me feel hydrated! I'm an oily skin type and acne prone. This makes my pores smaller too !I will buy this over and over again.
"This facial cream completes my nighttime skincare regimen.The smell is to die for, I have stocked up on the whole line including the amazing shampoo and companion conditioner. Bottom line, I love this line and will continue using the products (especially the facial cream and masque.)"
"I cannot understand why everybody says this moisturizer smells so good. To me it smells like tea tree oil, I was expecting it to smell like the Peace Rose hair products. It did not make my skin burn but it did not smell good to me. I passed it on to my boyfriend and he didn't mind the tea tree oil scent."
I bought the clay mask from the same line and it broke me out!! I used the moisturizer after so it would soothe my skin since it was advertised for “sensitive skin”. Boy I made the wrong decision!! It burned my skin where I have dry spots! Do not recommend and I also will be returning this product.
if you love rose scent. works well as far as moisture retention and fine line softening but kind of burns. i guess my skin is too sensitive for this particular product but i use and love a lot of products from this line as they are typically less toxic than most on the market. (check out the thinkdirty app for iphone)
"Please never discontinue this. My skin loves it so much and it smells so nice. It's really moisturizing and a little goes a long way. I had dry, flaky, sensitive skin and this product saved my face."
(An added plus is that I can reuse the glass bottle after I'm done with the product!!!!)
"I really love the smell and texture of this product, and I was happy the first couple of times I used it, but now I can no longer use it. My skin burns after application, and now the skin around my eye area is red, burning and peeling. I'm so disappointed because I was excited about this product because I really need something to moisturize my skin without causing breakouts. Perhaps I am allergic to something in the product."
I literally LOVE this moisturizer!! I have sensitive skin and this is sooo perfect! I use it after every wash and I wear it in the morning under my makeup! It's the first moisturizer I've found that doesn't make my skin look oily so I don't have to worry about going to the bathroom to control any shine! I've been through so many different brands and I'm so happy I've found one I love! And it smells amazing too! Absolutely would recommend!
"I was very excited to find a product using rose oil. I love everything about the peace rose face moisturizer it compliments the peace rose comllec face oil wash very well. I have very dry skin and it gets worse in the winter. This has been a very comfortable calming experience using this product. I notice a dramatic change in my skin's softness, smoothness, elasticity, and tone. I love this product so much."
"I love this moisturizer. I use this on days that are super hot and/or humid (I live in Texas) because it seems to help keep the oil slick at bay even well into the day. There is a sort of...warming effect that is rather soothing when you first apply it, and I love the smell. Overall, super light moisturizer, however if it's a really dry or cold day, I do have to supplement because it doesn't keep my skin from flaking around the dryest parts of my face."
"This moisturizer is the perfect, light consistency, actually moisturizes, and my face feels great the morning after using it. The only issue I had was it kind of made my face feel tingly and red when I first put it on last night but the feeling went away quickly. No redness or breakouts this morning. Very thankful for this because it's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you Shea Moisture for making beautiful natural products!"
"It burns when you put it on, definitely not for sensitive skin. :("
Keeps my skin supple and is not greasy. I use it on my décolletage. The skin there is very sensitive as I got older. Works very well
I bought this because it said it's for sensitive skin. It smells absolutely wonderful but my face turns so red after putting on?
I'm a huge fan of shea moisture and all of their products. Just bought this to try and it burned my face. I tried it a second time to be sure and it happened again.
This product terribly burned my skin and left painful red patches all around eyes and cheeks. I had to treat my skin with hydrocortisone cream. I have never had any allergy before.
The smell and texture is amazing. I don't like the burning sensation. My face turns slightly red with light red bumps which usually go away after a few minutes however I will not be buying this or any other of this brand products.
"I have used other Shea Moisture products in the past but this one burned my face, leaving under my eyes and cheeks swelled, red and dry after the 2nd use. It's awful!"
"This is supposed to be for sensitive skin, but after using it for 2 months, my skin has become rough, dry, and more sensitive to soaps and makeup. Each night I put this on and over time, I have noticed a burning sensation all over my face. This week has been the worst with this product because now my face is visibly red all day long because of this pungent moisturizer. It is damaging to your skin and a waste of your money!!!"
"I have sensitive/ combo skin and I thought that this would be great since it claims to be for sensitive skin, but i was wrong. I only used it for a few days bc it burned every single time I used it. I even had to wash it back off my skin. It also left my skin rough and dry. I would not recommend this for anyone with sensitive skin at all."
This is soo good for dry skin. Smells amazing and it's now the only moisturizer I'll ever use on my face!
It smells like toilet cleaner. Burns every time I apply it. Definitely NOT for sensitive skin.
My first time using was today and my face feels like a baby I'm so pleased
