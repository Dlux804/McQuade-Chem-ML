I tried a sample I got I got and I really liked how this oil made my skin look. I recommend this to everyone who loves in a dry area or has dry skin. It's fantastic to use in combination with our moisturizer and serums. The smell is very nice too. I've seen my skin going from good to better.
"This product is so nice for dry skin and the price here on jet is a deal!!! Shipping was so fast, I was amazed. I'm definitely purchasing from jet again."
"Love the smell and skin noticeably softer. I've only used this for a week, but I managed a Clarins counter 27 years ago and know what a fantastic skincare line they have!"
"I love this!! I have dry skin, this helps to moisturize it and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy!"
