I am a long time use of Aveeno products and trust them as skin care professionals. I love the way this product feels and smells. However after just 2 uses my cheeks become bright red and have a burning sensation. My skin has clearly had a reaction to something in this product and my skin is welped.
I would like to be contacted by the company.
"This lotion-mask is very hydrating. If your skin is on the oilier side, I would avoid the T-Zone area. It smells wonderful (it smells like blackberry smoothies) but if you have allergies to scent it might not be for you since it's a bit overpowering. I like that it has SPF which is super important. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this product. It went on light and smelled delicious. I used as a two-in-one moisturizer and sunscreen.

I received the Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Leave-on Day Mask Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 30 from Home Tester Club a few days ago and have used it every day. This is a great product and I'm sure the SPF 30 will help protect my face from getting sunburned when I use it in the warmer months when I'm outside a lot. I love the sweet scent but it's not too strong of a scent that it clashes with my perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way it smooths on my face and the smell. I have only used it 3 times so far but I think my skin looks fresher and more youthful. I am a fan of Aveeno to begin with and like that they use natural ingredient in their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this Aveeno I am really glad I was picked to try this product. It made my face feel so soft and it really helps the fine lines and wrinkles so they don't show so much. So many products will break my face out even though I'm 61 but this didn't. I would definely would recommend this product. Thanks again for picking me.

"The Aveeno absolutely ageless is by far the best face leave-on mask lotion I have tried. After a week of using I see a difference on my face its a lot smoother, softer the fine lines are hardly noticeable. The mask lotion smells great and it's not greasy at all. I use the Aveeno mask just like a primer, let it dry and then I use my foundation. This way I don't have to use a primer. A little goes a long way. I recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product applies easily and has a pleasant fragrance. I like the coverage and the fact that it absorbs easily and quickly, leaving my skin feeling smooth with no tackiness. Right now it's winter and the weather is dry and cold, so I would not wear it without another moisturizer, but I think that in summer it would do the job all on its own. I really do like it and think it's a fine daytime sunscreen/moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a light fresh smell, isn't greasy and soaks in quickly. It helped diminish small wrinkles plus it's has a sunscreen so you don't have to apply additional product. The pump is mess free and easy to use. Would recommend to my friends and will try other products in this brand plus it's a well known brand that addresses sensitive skin and has natural ingrediants.

Averno Absolutely Ageless leave on mask lotion went on my skin very smoothly. It is light and has a nice light scent. My skin felt very smooth and I love that it has sunscreen in it because I spend a lot of time outside in the sun. I do not think it did anything for my fine lines and wrinkles though which is why I gave it a four star review instead of a five star rating. Otherwise the product worked very well.
