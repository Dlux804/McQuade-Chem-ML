"Love Image products! My normally very dry skin is hydrated and so soft, and I have noticed some reduction in fine lines. I use several of their products and love them all!"
I am ashamed to say I have purchased this at a spa for a few years. Finding it at Walmart for 1/3 the price was wonderful. My older skin loves this product. Not heavy or oily.
I like this moisturizer: it is keep my skin look fresher and younger.
I've been using it for over a year. It's the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It feels great and takes care of my skin.
I like the fact its reasonably priced and its one of the best skin care products I have used it makes my skin feel youthful
"I love the product and have been using Image products for some time. However when i opened my new bottle today,the pump is dysfunctional It does not dispense any moisturizer"
Luv this product! So glad I found it on here. Saving lots of money.
"A nice, gentle, hydrating moisturizer for your face, that smoothes lines and wrinkles and doesn't break the bank. I also like the pump container, that prevents putting fingers in the jar and contaminating the moisturizer."
I have been using Image C for 2 or 3 years and highly recommend it to individuals that require more moisture but not the heaviness that some leave on your face. Two out of three re-orders of the Image C moisturizer have given me dis-functioning pumps where I have to pump 5 or 6 times to get enough product to use. But the product... it is sublime.
I love this moisturizer but when my order arrived the pump did not work so I wasn't able to access the moisturizer. Very disappointed! I need a refund!
This is the best moisturizer. It was used on me during a spa facial and I've used it ever since. It's light and has a nice citrus fragrance.
Love this product beautiful light cream with wonderful smell Great price
"Great daily moisturizer, have been using it for years."
