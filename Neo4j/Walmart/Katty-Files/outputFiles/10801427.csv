"THIS IS MY 3RD ORDER FOR THIS MOISTURIZER. I AM 72 YEARS OLD WITH VERY DRY SKIN. THIS IS WONDERFUL, IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SILKY SMOOTH AND HIDES AWAY SOME OF THE WRINKLES AROUND MY EYES. BE CAREFUL THOUGH NOT TO GET IT """"IN"""" YOUR EYES BECAUSE IT DOES BURN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AVEENO."
I've been using aveeno for years...and I always get compliments on my skin. It keeps my face moisturized all day...(not too creamy ...it's just right). It gives your skin a slight glow.
"I bought this about a month and a half ago because I wanted something affordable to even my skin tone and also have spf. Since I've been using this I noticed my skin has been evening out a little and it gives me a fresh glow. Today I was looking in the mirror of my car and saw little sparkles on my face, I believe it is from this moisturizer because I haven't worn makeup for a week so what else could it be. If so it makes me love it even more !"
"My husband & I have been using this lotion for years, it's one of the best."
It takes only a very small amount. If you put to much on it can look greasy. I like it because it does take such a small amount and it seems to do what it says it will do.
"I have used Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for years and love it. I will not be without this moisturizer. I have aging skin and the sun protection and moisturizing is essential. Love, Love, Love this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I heard Aveeno had a product that helps even out skin tone...I knew I needed to try it. I put this moisturizer on at night (don't use it for the SPF 15 factor) and at first my face is a little red and then after about one minute it really does make my skin tone look more calmed down. When I wake up the next morning my skin looks better than the day before. I love this product! I would have given it all 5 stars but you must be cautious not to get it too close to your eye area.
"After using this for two days, my face and neck are covered with tiny blisters. I do have sensitive skin which is why I wanted an spf moisturizer. Iâm afraid to try any product like this again."
Before this came out I used the slimmer positively radiant face cream and had no issues with it. For some reason this broke me out and was not good for my skin. Only recently found out that this is different from the slimmer one. There should have been something to alert buyers that the products are different as I thought it was the same formula in a different packaging.
Improves skin appearance for a younger look.
"This product was recommended to me by my phlebotomist, who has the most radiant, beautiful skin I've seen since the movie stars of the 1940s. (She's over 40 and looks mid-20s.) In fact, she recommended the entire Aveeno Positively Radiant line of skin care products. The face lotion wonderfully hydrates your skin for hours, without feeling greasy or clogging your pores. I recommend this product and it's sister products even over Aveeno's ""aging skin"" line."
"I have many allergies. I was a big fan of the Positively Radiant CC Cream and used it for many years. Unfortunately, it was discontinued, so I opted to go without a tint and try the Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. I am sorry that I did. My eyes began stinging soon after using it. I immediately washed my face and my eyes are still stinging :( Hopefully, that is all that I will have to deal with."
Epic fail for a brand I used to rely on for being safe!
"I have been using Aveeno Postively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for about 5 years. The pump style is convenient and clean. The lotion itself is smooth and has a pleasant smell. The SPF keeps my face protected while in the sun and in conjunction with the daily wash, has kept my skin tone even, my face smooth, and acne free.I love this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Aveeno products for years. Not a day goes by that I'm not complimented on my skin. i take pride in taking care of my skin and it's so easy when using Aveeno products. My grandchildren have eczema and I use all Aveeno baby products on them and it helps to keep their skin in control.
"They discontinued Aveeno Smart Essentials Moisturizer SPF 30. I was looking for something similar that provided protection, didn't irritate my eyes and didn't have the white pasty look. This one didn't go on as smooth and it made me look pasty. I used it 3 times and threw it away. Wish they'd bring back the smart essentials formula!"
The moisturizer leaves my skin nice. I wear it daily. Doesn't irritate my skin. My face feels refreshed when I apply it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how my skin looks and feels after I use this product. The SPF protection is great as well, as I need that protection [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a huge fan of Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Brightening Scrub, but I tried this moisturizer and numerous tiny little bumps appeared all over my face, from the top of my cheeks to the bottom of my chin. I tried this for 1 week and stopped to let my face go back to normal and the tiny bumps disappear (roughly 4 months). I tried it again for another week, hoping that I was just crazy, but the tiny bumps came back. Now it will take at least 4 months for them to go away. The bumps are definitely not acne."
"I have been using this product for about 4 or 5 years. I am 81 and I can't believe how many compliments I receive about my skin and how young I look. Then I tell them it must be the moisturizer that I use every day. I only use your positively radiant moisturizer, a little rouge and lipstick - no other cosmetics!"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now, and I always go back to it...any time I don't use it, my skin feels just off. I don't necessarily notice it improving tone or texture, but it doesn't break me out or make my combination skin too oily. I really like this product and will continue to repurchase!"
"This is the best facial moisturizer i have tried so far! I have acne prone skin and this moisturizer leaves my face feeling soft and fresh and not gresy. Jadeisa said she didn't like the way it smelled, but that is one of my favorite features. It sort of smells like coconut sunscreen, which i love. It doesn't clog my pores or cause me to break out and it does what it says it does. It evens out the tone and texture of my skin to give me a healthy glow! and it has spf 15! I would definitely reccommend this product."
I just bought this product 4 days ago and every time I use it my allergy and asthma triggers due to the strong smell. I was hoping I will get use to the smell but my nose and lungs can't handle it and I have to use my rescue inhaler every time I use it in order for me to breath and feel better. I really like this moisturizer it makes my face smooth but can't stand the foul odor. Do you have a fragrance free version of this product?
"I have really sensitive skin so I don't try new products very often. I am a fair skinned redhead with freckles everywhere. I have been using this for about a month now and my skin tone has evened and my freckles are fading. By mid-July every summer I am a total freckle face, but not this year. It has also gotten rid of my two red patches on my cheeks. My skin is smooth and soft, no acne and not greasy at all! Love it."
This is be far the best moisturizer I've ever used. I've been using this product for more than 2 years and it never fails. It fades out dark spots from acne within a week and makes my skin visibly brighter. I use it every day and night. It works so much better than Aveeno clear complextion. I started getting acne using that. I have skin that gets dry in the winter but oily in the summer. I'm acne free whenever I use this product.
Love this product! I've been using it for years. The texture and tone of my face has changed so much since I started using it! I love Aveeno products like this because they don't feel greasy or oily. This lotion is very silky and soothing on my face. I'd recommend it to anyone!!
"Love thd product, my skin is softer, no more dry skin and the spots are now disappearing. I will continuing using it until the darkspots on my face all disappear. But I am really happy with the results. I am recommending this product, but all I can say is that be patient to get the maximum results."
"I am 43 and have a lot of spots from the sun so I'm always on the lookout for a moderately-priced moisturizer with a sunscreen. This one fit the bill AND is definitely making a difference with my skin tone. It is more even and, dare I say it, the spots are fading! I'm seriously impressed."
"This product makes my skin feel like satin. I used to buy the 10.3 oz. bottles of the soy complex and loved it. I have not been able to buy the big bottle in a long time. Why not?? It is my absolute favorite, have not found anything that compares. Can i buy the large bottle anywhere???? I am very disappointed about this. Please help !!!!!"
"I used Daily Moisturizer SPF 15, like most I read the reviews. Since the store I went to did not have the calming night cream I decided to use the moisturizer since my tone isn't the greatest and needed a new one (works good for my girlfriends). I was pretty excited, after a week of use my face felt smoother but I started to notice red spots under my bottom lip and nose...it itches... definitely a first. I am a little hesitant but still curious about the Ultra calming nourishing night cream....hmm"
"I was leery to try it at first because I have really sensitive/oily skin, but I was needing something effective and cheap. After the first week, I noticed my skin looked clearer and my coworkers asked me why I was so ""glowy"". This product actually works better than my hg by Clinique and had now has become my new hg!"
"Needed a budget friendly moisturizer. Having three kids, it can get a little tight. Tried this, LOVE it. If I don't have time for foundation, I don't mind anymore. I feel comfortable in my own skin. I tend to have oily skin and my skin doesn't get shiny after a few hours of wear. My new go-to moisturizer, can't wait to try the other products!!!"
"It's a great moisturizer. I haven't seen any change in dark spots as yet, but I've just been using it about 2 weeks. And no I haven't awakened to find myself looking like Jen Aniston. Darn! Overall it's helping my parched winter skin to feel softer and smoother."
"With such dry sensitive, eczema prone skin, many products just don't work for me. Over time I have used most of your products but, I am especially pleased with your Positively Radiant products. Often I recommend them to other people I know. It seems the sensitive skin has been passed on to the next two generations as my great-grandchildren also have the problem. When the topic comes up, I tell their moms to start using Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy and other Aveeno Baby products."
"I have very sensitive and dry skin, especially in harsh winter months. I used to use a moisturizer that was in an acne line of products, but it would only keep my face moisturized briefly. Since using Aveeno, which has been about 2 years now, I have noticed that I have a more even skin tone, and the texture and look of my skin is more vibrant,smooth, and soft. It gives me the right amount of moisture, without making my face too greasy. I would most certainly recommend this product for use throughout the year."
"This is an EXCELLENT product! I had numerous discolorations on my face (cheeks especially) and wanted something to even out my skin tone. No joke... I saw results in one week! I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone. I have oily skin and I'm one of those people who have tried everything over the counter, including prescription medications for acne. When I find something that works (which is rare) I stick to it. Give it a shot and see what it can do for you :)"
"I've been using the full line for a few days and I can say for sure that the product does make a difference in the way my face looks. This moisturizer is gentle yet ads a brightening effect. Even at night, after wearing it all day, my face still feels soft but not greasy. Very happy so far:)"
I did notice my pigmentations post acne faded somehow and did improve my overall complexion. It is super gentle and not at all greasy. I like the fresh smell of soy ;D. The only reason why it's not 5 stars is because it is not moisturizing enough. This product would be perfect in the summer but you kinda needs more moisture in the winter.
"I rate Positively Radiant 6 stars, because it went beyond my expectations! Started using it 3 months ago and my face is even, no more dark circles and my skin looks brighter. I began using it on my elbows and scars and its working on those areas too! Satisfied customers."
I religiously use Aveeno for my daily cleanser and foundation regimen. I love Positively Radiant because it makes my skin look and feel 10 years younger. As a PE teacher I appreciate products that are light-weight and non-greasy feeling. I also pair this with the Absolutely Ageless eye cream and Positively Radiant CC Cream.
"I have been using this product for years and have been very happy with it, EXCEPT for the packaging. I use it every day, so it doesn't sit in the mechanism for long, but each time when I pump out a portion a little plug of half-dried moisturizer is in it. A cap for the bottle might prevent this, but none is provided. Please fix this annoying problem, Aveeno!"
"If you have sensitive skin this is not the one for you. After use, my face was burning and then my face was all red. Disappointed because I like the night cream. This was has sunscreen in it. I think that is what breaks my face out. Not good ingredients in this product."
I love this product and I also have the tinted moisturizer. Both are amazing and have done wonders for my skin but the second I put it on my eyes burn and water like theres no tomorrow and it drives me nuts because I want to use these constantly but my eyes burns and tear like crazy. I have no allergies and not really even sensitive skin so i don't know what it could be. I still use the products just not as much as I'd like.
"I bought this moisturizer over a week ago. I did a lot of research on it and I was very excited to try it out. It was fine on my skin for the first couple of days. But two days ago I began to break out around my eyes, nose and neck. I have lots and lots of very tiny itchy red bumps that are very noticeable. I know it is the moisturizer because I have had the same face care routine for the past couple of years and I have never had this problem until I started using this product."
I love this daily moisturizer! It has made a skin flawless and more radiant in just a few weeks. Everyday my skin seems to get more even toned and dark spots from sun damage are completely erased! It's also super light and non-greasy so it's ideal for use during the day and it has SPF so it also keeps you protected from the sun. It's literally the product that does it all. It's a permanent part of my skin care routine.
"I am totally loving this moisterizer! been using this for two weeks and use this along with the clarifying foam cleanser. My skin is seeming to improve, looks brighter smoother and I am noticing some dark marks fading out.. Smell doesn't bother me and feels ok on my skin. Rarely get any breakouts and my skin is very sensitive. Think I found my new favorite facial product brand!! Lets see how much more improvement I will have."
"I have dry, sensitive skin prone to mild break outs. All the moisturizers I tried before either did not moisturize enough or where oily. This moisturizes your skin without being heavy and makes my skin visibly brighter! For the first time I can honestly say that I love my complexion."
"I am a huge fan of Aveeno products. I have tried all of the Aveeno moisturizers, and this one is my favorite. I have been using this moisturizer for years now and it is the best moisturizer in my opinion. It is creamy and does not irritate my sensitive skin at all. It does even out my skin tone through the long run and I greatly appreciate it."
"I had bought this product just looking for a regular face moisturizer, and now this is my favorite product. My face has become brighter and I definatly realize my skin has become more even. I have continually been getting compliments on how good my skin looks. LOVE THIS PRODUCT (I just ran out and desperately need to get more)!"
"I bought this with the Positively Radiant Cleanser since I ran out of my favorite sunscreen. Once I got home I tried it on to test it and all and at first it was fine, the texture was nice and it wasn't too greasy and it blended in well but as I was spending the rest of the day I was often distracted by the smell of the moisturizer. The smell was too strong for me so I haven't used it since."
I have been using aveeno products for 15 years. I have tried other brands but aveeno facial products are my favorite. I use both face washes and the lotions. My face feels smooth and clean. I am able to place my makeup right over it without any problems. The spf keeps my face protected and my skin stays clear and refreshed. I LOVE AVEENO products and highly recommend them
"I bought this because I was having trouble with dryness and sunspots and I have used Aveeno's body lotion for years. I've never had trouble with acne in the past besides the occasional blemish, but after using this I have a new pimple almost every day. I told my coworker and she said she had the same problem when she tried it. I still love the body lotion but I will be using the money-back guarantee for this product!"
"I purchased the daily tinted facial moisturizer when I ran out of my MK tinted moisturizer. It is great and I don't have to order it and wait for it to be delivered. I've been using it about a year now. It's just enough color for me, light weight and moisturizes great. I've even gotten my grandmother using it as well."
I love Aveeno especially the moisturizer! It really helps my skin glow and maintain a youthful appearance. I live in a very cold climate and this really helps as I wear it under makeup and after washing my face. It really does make me positively radiant!
My face looks remarkable after investing in myself wth the purchase of Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer with SPF 15. Goes on smooth and my skin thanks me with a beautiful glow. I know I can always trust the Aveeno line of products. So glad I found them!
I bought this a few days ago and I could immediately tell a difference in the way my skin not only looked but felt it is the first moisturizer I've ever used that made my skin feel soft and smooth without being real oily and to me that is definitely a plus I loved this moisturizer and will definitely be continuing to us it on a daily basis
"My sisters always had what she calls problematic skin. She easily breaks out even in her 40's, her skins also easily irritated. I bought this for her to try after a friend told me they love it. Now my sisters made this her everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is amazing. I was using hydroquinone for marks and I needed a sun screen/moisturizer to put on top. This goes on so seemlessly and smooth. It applies so nicely, it's blends in seconds with no white cast that other sun screens leave. It also helps the appearance of dark marks. It's worth the money. You get what you pay for."
My dermatologist first recommended Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer to me year ago. I tried it then and have been using it ever since.
It makes your skin smooth but is not heavy so does not clog the pores. It is one of the very few products that includes sunscreen but does not irritate my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After reading lots of positive reviews I decided to purchase! First of all I don't know why it's called positively radiant because it did nothing positive for my skin... if you have dry skin like me, do not buy this, it seemed like it dried my skin out even more and was not hydrating at all! Also if u have a soy allergy do not buy this after using for a week I noticed around my eyes was becoming more and more irritated so now I'm thinking I have a soy allergy because of it!"
"I love this product and use it all the time. However I will not be ordering from here again. This item took 2 weeks to arrive. The packaging was very good. So if you are not in a hurry I would recommend. But if you need this item, choose another retailer."
Love the lotion on my face. Looking forward to the end results.
This is my first time with this product and I like the creamy smooth feel and the absorption on my skin
Love this moisturizer. Feels lite on my skin and it keeps it safe with the SPF! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Nice moisturizer, a little thick because of the sunscreen, but absorbs nicely into skin. Would reccomend for normal-dry skin types"
This is a good skin daily moisturizer.It is non greasy and has sunscreen built in.It is a little expensive for a small 4 oz bottle.
This is great stuff I feel it works really well and has a light pleasant smell with an SPF 30 protection. Walmart has about the best price.
"I have normal skin but breakout sometimes. best face moisturizer I've ever used. after a week Inoticed my face was more of a even tone, and soft. choose to perfection as you can get"
I started using this product 2 weeks ago and I have never had such a oil-slicked face in my life. I look like a wet towel everyday. I am so disappointed that I spent so much money on this moisturizer!
I tried this product by chance. The next day my face looked glowing. Not greasy or oily. I see a difference and am happy. I was worried about the light scent...but my skin never acted up. lol. I have dry skin and this has kept it soft.
"This is my favorite face lotion ever. I have combination skin, that can get a bit dried out, but also will overproduce oil. This product is kind to my sensitive skin."
"I accidentally put it on my hands and now I LOVE IT!! for the hands (and I'm a hand cream/lotion junkie). It makes your skin feel like baby skin, not sticky or tacky either. It's really good"
Aveeno moisturizers are the worst . I would apply the moisturizer and it would flake right off my skin. It doesn't absorb into my skin and leaves tiny white residue all over my face. L'Oreal active moisturizer is the best.
"Iv'e been using this for 4+ years now and along with my other skin regimen, my skin looks and feels amazing. It moisturizes great and i don't know what i would do without it."
I had such high hopes for this moisterizer. I really wanted it to help with my hyper pigmentation an acne scaring but all it did was give me a rash!!! And it says radiant but it has dried my face out completely :(
i have psoriasis and an oily face and it was hard finding a lotion that would help hydrate the areas where my psoriasis and dry areas were while not leaving other parts of my face oily. I love this product and would recommend it to everyone!!!
"AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15 just makes my face smoother, & nourishes my skin. I just hope they could make this SPF higher, like 30!"
I got this product from my mother her got from me as a gift and all I have to say is that its fantastic! People actually see the difference in my skin. My darkspots are gone and it's light on the skin with a fresh scent. i recommend this to anyone
I HIGHLY recommend this product. It is very light on the skin. Evens out blemishes and is a great mosturizer for it balances out the skin perfectly. I really enjoy the scent as well. For the price you can't go wrong for a little goes a long way.
"This lotion feels AMAZING on my face! It's not greasy at all, and it's very soft! I have very, very dry, flaky skin (especially around my nose,) and this works great to relieve that!"
This product evened out my skin tone after about 3 weeks of use. I have dark freckles under my eyes and on my cheek bones and they are almost gone! It works great with my sensitive skin as well. This is my new favorite face moisturizer!
"I came on the website solely yo write a review. I have been using this moisturizer for years and it absolutely the best. I've bought neutrogena and cetaphil moisturizers before, but I am always drawn back to Aveeno. Cannot recommend more!"
"I've tried quite a few day creams. I love Aveeno products, & this is my go-to basic daytime lotion, for both summer & winter...no need to change for the seasons. It's the perfect texture & I love the light scent."
"I have sensitive type of skin and have used this product for over six months. There are no any negative reactions on my face. Btw, it really helps even in winter."
"I have acne prone dry skin. I have been using this for years and have come back to it wondering why I ever change my moisturizer. It smells amazing, so hydrating and feels good on your skin, not oily sticky at all. MUST BUY!"
I love this product. Its light but does the job. A lot of products feel too greasy but not this. This leaves my face feeling moisturized and radiant all day but not greasy. I use it every day!
This moisturizer is absolutely amazing! I use it every single day. It leaves my face so soft and smooth and I've noticed a huge difference in the dark spots on my cheeks. I definitely recommend this!
"After just two weeks my skin is much softer, radiant, and less acne prone. I have really bad acne and most moisturizers make me break out, but this one gave me noticeable results. My acne has cleared up dramatically."
"My co-worker consistently tells me that I shine. I told him that it's because of the Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer that I use religiously. It is a great product, and I hope Aveeno continues to make it. Just an awesome product!"
Please don't ever stop making this product. Iv'e used it everyday for 5 years and won't stop. My skin looks amazing and I'm complemented daily on how great my skin looks and glows!
I love this moisturizer so much! I only use this in the morning during the summer months when I know I will be out in the sun. It is great at preventing sunburn and smells amazing! I definitely recommend this to anyone with acne prone skin.
I have been using this on my face for a few years. I love the feel on my face - not greasy or oily. It does not feel like a lot of SPF products feel or smell. This is my everyday lotion on my face.
My husband loves this product! He uses it to shave every morning instead of shaving gel. It is nourishing and keeps his face looking young. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
using products for years and am fully satisfied. started using products because of natural features [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Aveeno daily moisturizer is great. It goes on smooth, makes my skin feel radiant and has the extra broad spectrum SPF 15 that all skin needs, but especially for those of us that live in the south! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Aveeno for over 10 years and I absolutely love their products, specifically this one --- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a woman of color with acne in her adult hood this product does a great nob with my complexion! I use it all the time and my face always looks so fresh! Im Glad I tried this now im hooked! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My favorite face lotion. Great consistency and a little goes a long way. Goes on light and absorbs well without leaving any residue. Scent is perfect and not over powering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always been a fan of Aveeno products because they are so good for sensitive skin, so when I bought this moisturizer I took it for granted. I just checked the ingredients (after I started using it) and discovered it contains several parabens and titanium dioxide, which would explain why my skin has been burning and sensitive the last couple days. This is the first Aveeno product I've found these ingredients in so I didn't check before I bought. Mistake on my part."
"I tried AVEENO POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 15 for the first time. When I applied, it caused burning sensation. Also, caused redness. I thought its because I'm new to this product but when applied 2 more times, its still the same. I won't recommend this product."
I started using the daily cleanser and the moisturizer about 2 weeks ago and I've already seen a huge difference in my skin. It's literaly glowing! My skin is really smooth and soft and the products smell amazing. They're really natural and not perfumey. I've loved adding this to my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had an allergic reaction to it. My face developed a rash reaction to it. I do have a sensitivity to soy products, when I eat any. Apparently it goes for the external as well as the internal part of me. I liked the fact, that it felt nice on my face. Absorbed well, didn't leave me feeling greasy."
"I have weird combination skin where parts are super acne prone and other parts become super dry and flaky. This moisturizer has solved both of those problems. I had searched for years until finding this one and I'm so glad I switched. My skin is soft, glowing, and the formula doesn't leave your skin oily or greasy. The SPF is a huge plus!"
"It feels nice on the skin... they add in shimmer which makes you look ""radiant..."" and it smells SO SO SO strong of sunscreen..... I shop online all the time, and really this isn't worth the money. I hate putting sunscreen on at all because it's terribly for your liver, and whenever I use this it just smells way too strongly of sunblock... with that said, though, it did make my skin feel really nice once it absorbed... so I'm trying to put up with it for now..."
Quick delivery / extremely well-packaged
Wish I would've found this first. It would've saved me a lot of money
Love this product. Smells good and makes skin feel baby soft.
"This cream is odorless, greaseless and does a great job"
"Great that it has SPF 15. Smooth, not greasy."
"I am a person who really needs the best in moisture because managing my acne drys out my skin. But keeping my skin hydrated and not oily is no problem for this product! It really evens out skin like it says, and never causes me to break out. Thank you for this wonderful gift and glowing skin!"
"I really like this product the first day, it felt good and smelled good, then on second day it started itching, third day burning and burn marks. Need to make a product with no alcohol in it. To bad I really liked it too, had to take it back and get money back. Now I need to find a different product for face and body. Why oh why couldn't this product work for me."
I put it on twice a day. After a shower and before I go to bed. I love the way it moistens my skin and keeps it hydrated!! I've been using it for 5 years now and it's the only lotion that keeps my face hydrated and not oily. This is my favorite Aveeno product!
"I have been using this moisturizer for over 5 yrs (24-29)and my skin just gets better! I love that I can wash my face and put this on, add concealer/a little powder, mascara, gloss and just go. I get compliments on my skin for having such a healthy glow. This is the only moisturizer i will ever use! It's great for combination skin."
"I have ""combination"" skin and this moisturizer is very good for the price - not too heavy or greasy, and actually does what it claims to do. I stopped using this product for about 2 months last summer (I started using Aveeno's ""Clear Complexion"" version) and noticed a huge difference - some dark spots started to appear - and I immediately switched back to the Positively Radiant moisturizer. The SPF is critical!"
I'm a member of the crowdtap avenno rewards program and avenno sent me samples of its positively radiant daily moisturizer broad spectrum spf 30 I think this product is great. It is so light weight aND leaves my family feeling great and smells good also.
"This product Works Beautifully! I have been using this moisturizer and i have definitely noticed the tone and texture in my skin it is more of an even tone and my skin is just super luminous. I love that it has natural ingredients and oil free. It helped me tone and reduce the dullness and brown spots. As a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. However my opinions are 100% real and my own."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” I can't believe how smooth and soft my skin feels after only a few days. What a wonderful product."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I really like this moisturizer. It applies really smooth and my skin very well moisturized. I can smell the SPF in it, but it's not that bad."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I absolutely loved the way it made my skin feel, I would highly recommend you try this out."
"I have been using this moisturizer for about 8 weeks now. I've used many (much more expensive) moisturizers and none of those I've tried have had the visible results that this product has on my skin. My skin is softer, more supple, and yes, more radiant so much so that several family and friends have remarked on it and asked me if I'm using anything new. I am also using it in combination with the Brightening Cleanser and I think the two products together make an unbeatable combination."
"I've been using this moisturizer for the last 10years! It doesn't clog my pores, & I still feel clean after putting it on. My face feels soft & the sunscreen protection is a plus! All of my face products are Aveeno. I even have my sister using it now & she loves it!"
I've been using this moisturizer every day for years and couldn't imagine ever switching. It's so light and effective and always makes my skin feel soft. I also love that it's not scented as I wear it on my face and don't want a heavy scent that lingers. I would and have recommended this product to friends and family! Simply amazing!
Aveeno's Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizing Cream delivers! This is a very rich and luxgeriant moisturizing cream. It sborbs beautifully and leaves no greasy residue. It makes my skin feel fabulous and beautiful. The scent is awesome and I feel like ive been to a salon after applying it! It gets 5 stars in my book!
"I've tried a lot of moisturizers, branded, drugstore, high end, but nothing compares to Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisturizer, you will positively see the difference in a couple of weeks, my discoloration evened out, my skin became smooth and supple, it's not dull anymore but it's not oily either. Just perfect, and im positive about that. :)"
"I never go without my AVEENO active naurrals Positively rafient moisturizer. I use to use a ""High End"" moisturizer but started using AVEENO 2 years ago. My skin feels soft and it glows! I also never go without AVEENO's body wash and daily moisturizer...I absolutelt love them!"
"I have been using Positively Radiant for about 4-5 years now, and I can tell when I'm slacking on taking care of my skin. I had a facial last year and they said I had great skin (at the time I was an avid moisturizer and such). I've recommended it to my sister and she enjoys it too!!!"
Good for sun protection
i have sensitive skin so this is a great way to keep me feeling good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far so good, I have combination skin and it felt nice but at the end of the day I was just a tiny bit shiny"
"Great moisturizer with SPF15 not heavy or oily, but if you have oily skin dont put to much on. Will help even out skin tone with constant use."
I have used Aveno face products for over 5 years.... Helps even skin tone with remarkable results...Thanks Aveno*
The moisturizing facial lotion has been the best. I have tried some of those expensive lotins but I keep coming back
i was really looking foward for my skin to even out but now my face is extremely itchy with a whole bunch of bumps
I've been using this product for 3months my skin looks brighter but it has not gotten rid of my brown spots. I'm a little disappointed!
Definitely love this stuff. I received free samples via Crowdtap mission and am really glad I could try it before I buy. Which I will be doing.
I use this product daily..I absolutely love it and have no reactions. I have very sensitive skin & rosacea
FOR YEARS I HAVE USED THE ABOVE -- NOW ALL I CAN FIND IS THE TINY LITTLE 2.5 OZ. SIZE. IN THE SAME SIZE BOX. THIS IS WAY BEYOND ANNOYING.
I've used this product everyday for 3 years now. I cannot do without it! Love the packing and the fact that a little goes a long way!
Love to use this moisturizer in the morning.Not harsh and no strong smelling fragrances. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i buy this monthy. great product, reasonably priced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this daily love it since it has sunscreen as well :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this on my really dry skin. It helped give is some luster and moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love how soft and supple this made my skin feel. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This daily moisturizer leaves face supple and hydrated, not greasy or oily like other moisturizers. The only flaw I find perhaps due to my sensitive nose is the fragrance. Maybe Aveno could make the same moisturizer without fragrance."
"I had been using the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF30 for several weeks when I noticed patchy light spots around my nose, mouth and on the chin area. I would not recommend this product for women of color."
I love the way this product makes my face look and feel. Either under makeup or alone in the summer. Provides moisture and sun protection without being heavy or greasy.
"I really love this product. It is very light, and it does not feel like it clogs your pores. I felt like my face lit up when I applied the product, especially when I would have to wake up early and my face still looked like sleep."
I am 48 and have been using this for years. I recently tried a new product for a few months and my skin looked dreadful. I am back to this and am glowing and soft again. Everything about my skin is better with this. It's perfect for me.
I tried aveeno positively radiant spf 30 was my first but really hate spf 30 because it made my face so greasy and heavily felt. I was skeptical about spf 15 wow! my face is so soft like silk and skin so radiant! I prefer spf 15 better than spf 30!
"Put this moisturizer on everyday after my shower. Love how it evens out my skin tone, protects from the sun and does not irritate my skin or clog my pores."
I love all of my Aveeno products including this moisturizer! It smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I know my skin is protected and hat the longer i use this moisturizer the better my skin will look and feel! Thanks Aveeno!
"This is the most important of all my products. It makes my skin feel like silk. I could not praise it more, I truly love it. I would recommend it to anyone women or men. Thank you guys.......Love your products♡♡♡♡♡"
This is a great product with the sun screen but takes up way too much space in my cosmetic purse. The under 3 oz gets it on the plane but a slender tube would work better. How about a 1 or 1 1/2 oz tube? Thanks.
Favorite moisturizer.
Hhhhh
"I have been using this product now for approximately 2 weeks. I bought the daily cleanser and moisturizer and have been having horrific breakouts ever since! Of course, these aren't even normal zits, they are the big painful ones that last for days. So disappointed in this product, wasted my money."
This moisturizer is amazing. It has a beautiufl scent and a nice consistency. Once i put it on my face i suddenly notice a difference. In direct sunlight my skin looks healthy and radiant. I believe over time this product actually helps to even out the skintone.
"After a lot of research on this product, I decided it was the one for me. As an oily/normal skin person, I thought it would work. Not at all, left my skin dry, patchy with red rash on face. Not even after a week use. Wishing I could get my money back, not worth it."
"I was excited to try this product for brown spots. After two days, however, I developed a terrible red, itchy, burning rash. I have never gotten a rash from using a product before. It has been days now and it has not gone away completely yet. I even had to take medication to stop the itch. Never will use these products again."
"Such a wonderful moisturizer! I have decently dry skin, and this stuff is like magic. I put it on every morning under my foundation and use it nightly before going to bed. My skin feels soft and moisturized. A little goes a long way and i'm not left feeling slippery or greasy. I love this moisturizer and I will continue to repurchase!! Go get you some!"
"I was never brand loyal, but I really love this product. It leaves my skin feeling well hydrated even in Polar Vortex winters! My skin is smooth, soft, and I have been able to use less makeup since I started using this product 2 years ago. Thank you for the reliability and quality of this product."
"I'm very happy with this moisturizer. I use it every morning and my foundation goes on very smoothly over it. My skin doesn't feel dry all day and I think that my brown spots are slowly fading. I have sensitive skin so I love that its hypoallergenic, it doesn't irritate me at all. I wouldn't use anything else!"
"Im a teenager and have a hyper pigmentation from acne so I thought this would be a good moisturiser to even out the dark spots but it doesn't really. In addition to that it makes my skin feel very oily and like there is a thick layer sitting on top of it, clogging my pores. Its a shame because the moisturiser makes my skin feel soft and smells nice, but I would not recommend this moisturiser at all for people with oily skin or acne prone skin."
"This moisturizer made my skin nice and soft and didn't irritate it at all. It leaves your face nice and glowy. It's a little too glowy to wear by itself, but great under makeup. The spf is an added bonus. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"My skin is very sensitive and dry, with that said, I have the hardest time finding something that won't break me out and that also at the same time keeps me moisturized all day. Not only did this lotion work out for me its also made my face feel sooo smooth. I would absolutely recommend this product, especially if you suffer from sensitive/dry skin. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"After just a couple of days of using this product, I can already see a difference. It goes on light and non greasy, rubs in quickly. I've been asked by a few people what I am doing differently cause my skin looks amazing. I have sensitive skin and haven't had a single issue with his product...it may be my new go to!! i'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” I love the way this moisturizer absorbs so quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth, moisturized and protected. It gives my skin a glow that leaves me confident and happy. My skin is glowing and feels great. You don't even feel the product on your skin.....not sticky or gooey, just soft beautiful skin."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” I was actually a little surprised by the results. It does leave your skin feeling soft and smooth and the SPF is another added bonus. I will be purchasing more in the future."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 I love this product already. It feels great on my face and smells amazing. I am excited to see what it does in the next four weeks for my bit of sun damage but so far Inlove it. I wouldnand will tell my friends about this."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.” I recently received my sample and absolutely love it. I have combination skin and so far this stuff is awesome for both my dry & oily parts. I would highly recommend!"
"Oh how I love this product. My skin is so smooth and absolutely smells amazing. My husband actually thought that I bought new perfume. I can't wait to buy more of this. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review.”"
I have dry and sensitive skin and bought this product and a face wash to go with it with the hopes it would help since it was highly recommended to me by friends and dermatologist. I never wear make up. It has been 2 weeks now since I started using them and has done nothing to my skin but caused it to breakout and blemish. Very disappointed on the products and sad to have waist my hard earned money.
"I trying to find a good moisturizer & then found this aveeno & it worked miracles! It makes my face soft & glow althrough out the day, it cleared my blemish scars up a little & its very affordable. The best so far i have tried & i aint switching back to no other brand!"
"I had been using different moisturizers and never found one I was really satisfied with. A few years back I tried Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer and have never looked back. My skin is always amazing, clean not oily, never makes me break out, always keeps my skin moisturized. Plus I love that there is an SPF in it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new moisturizer."
"I love it! I have acne and my skin is dry but oily.I have Tried so many different products, and this is the only one that does clog my pores,doesn't make break out,leaves my skin nice, smooth,radiant,with Out the shiny look,or oily feeling.it even cleared up my acne spots.can't get any better.I use all the sevens products for my kids and my self."
"Before this product, my face was dull and dry. I started using AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15 after washing my face and after showers. Immediately within a week I saw results. My skin tone improved noticeably and appeared more radiant. Also I love how this product doesn't have any harsh irritants and is oil-free. So my face doesn't break out like with other moisturizing creams I've tried. It's a keeper for me and definitely recommend it to everyone."
"I have combination skin and it is so hard to find products that work continuously and don't cause further breakouts. This moisturizer is EVERYTHING! It does actually make scars and marks from previous breakouts lighten over time. The moisturizer itself is light, not greasy, and feels great on my skin. Great for the winter cold too! Totally protects! I love Aveeno!!"
"I used this moisturizer for a while and did a great job and I love the fact that it has SPF which is super important to me. It is not super expensive but also not the most affordable (for me), so that's why I haven't repurchased it. Overall I would recommend this product. Great Job Aveeno!"
"Previously my skin was not feeling the way i wanted to be...tried various brands, most of them are very popular in market..but didn't satisfied fully until i used this particular product. After using this couple of days i was feeling so different,immediately brought the radiance i wanted..:) After that no looking back...I am using this almost 3 years now...i never felt so good about my skin(touchwood)!While i visit my relative out of country I always carry extra so that i never get run out of this amazing product! Thank You Aveeno!!"
"I have very sensitive and delicate skin. Going outside leaves my skin splotchy, oily and dry. I have tried so many products and this is the only thing that works for me. It keeps my face supple and prevents the splotchy sunburnt look. The SPF 15 is a positive as well. I recommend this for anyone who has sensitive and or combination skin. If you have tried a bunch of other stuff this is what you're looking for."
"I love this face lotion. I have generally dry skin, and this lotion does the trick. I apply it to my face right after washing my face in the shower, and it curbs the dryness, and is a necessity before I out on my makeup. It makes my skin feel so nice, and the smell is fresh and clean."
I recently purchased this product for the moisturizer and the tint. I am go go go from early in the morning to late at night. I do not like wearing makeup to work so this is perfect for my lifestyle. I also have psorasis and this product doesnt bother it. I will continue to purchase this for years to come.
So far so good...after having tried other pricey products that didn't work on my blotchiness this Aveeno seems to be working. Even after only 10 days or so. I love how thick and rich it feels on my face but doesn't feel that way after I massage it in. I even rub it into my elbows which have darkened over the years.
"This daily moisturizer is perfect for my skin. I'm fair skinned and its really sensitive so I can't use a lot for my face. But this makes my skin glow, makes my (very few) pimples reduce in redness, and that's just perfect for me. I use it every day, and the first day I was shocked! If you're fair and sensitive skinned like me, USE it."
"I purchased this product a few months ago. The following day after the first use, my face was literally red in spots, and I have dark skin. Accompanied by swelling lasting two days. Second use a whole two months later cause complete facial swelling eyes and lips included. It should be possible to upload a picture in the comment section. Unsure of what's in this product causing the reaction, but I have discontinued the product for good. Also got rid of all the products from this brand and I had them all."
"I don't see similar problem, but every time I use it, by the end of the day I scratch my eye, or sweat and if it gets in the eye it's very bad! I might be not lucky, but Today I tried it again and it's in my eye, so red, burned, cannot go anywhere... But I like everything about it and I look pretty with that glow..."
"I have used this product now - going into my 3rd week and for the past 45 days my cheeks feel like they are on fire and they are red. I have never had this with my other skin car product, however the price had gone up so much I decided to try this product. I have used your body lotion and loved it! This however, I think I will have to stop using unfortunately. I see a couple other people have also had this problem."
This is THE BEST moisturizer! I tried expensive ones ....this beats them and is reasonably priced!!
I like how it makes my skin feel and I recommend anyone to use it.
I have very dry skin all over my face and its working we'll.
It worked so well on my face and it smells so good
"Light weight, not greasy, skin feels smooth. Don't know about wrinkles yet, haven't used it very long."
This moisturizer feels so smooth and natural...no chemical smell like with other brands. It's the best I've tried!
This is my favorite moisturizer for use under my foundation. Never greasy and evens out my skin. LOVE IT!
I love this as my daily moisturizer because the added sunscreen. Hydrates without the greasy feeling
Love this product. Lightweight and not greasey. It has improved my skin flaws and does not interfere with my make up application.
"This lotion not only moisturizes your skin, it leaves it positively radiant as the name states. It is wonderful!"
I had good skin just some dark spots around my mouth I wanted to try to get rid of before my wedding.. only used this product for a week and now my face has never been worse. I have red bumps EVERYWHERE all over my forehead and cheeks. I'm so upset.
I have used this product for 3-4 years. It feels great on my face and is not greasy. There is very little smell ( if any) from this product. Great product overall ! :) I have purchased this product In Canada and USA.
I fell in love with Aveno Face Lotion when it was in the blue bottle. I am 66 yr. old and look 56! It got reformulated and became Positively Radiate in a green bottle. NOT the same! :-(
This product is the best. I noticed that my skin has become brighter and I love it. The smell is amazing. I have combination skin and yet this does not make me oily or greasy. A little bit goes a long way and feels great on skin.
I use this every morning and love it! I have a newborn and very little time to get ready so I use this to product to brighten my skin and add a little extra glow.
"I LOVE THIS BRAND! Lotions,facewash and this MOISTURIZER! I don't feel greasy or oily after i use it. I feel refresh everytime I put it on. BUY it!!!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!"
I've recently got this in my baby shower gifts and have been loving it keeps my skin feeling good when outside in the sun [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the tinted moisture (fair-light) moisture for a number of years, ever since my dermatologist recommended Aveeno products. I'm protected with sunscreen, even out my skin ton and, moisturize without looking ""madeup"". It's a win-win!"
My skin is completely transformed after using this product. I seen results almost immediately. I am 40 yrs with 5 children so I do get much time for me but you wouldn't guess that after using this product.
"I love this product! It feels greasy if you rub it between your fingers, but absorbs completely and does not make your face an ""oil Slick"" during the day. Has a pleasant and subtle scent that evaporates quickly."
I received this product from crowdtap in exchange for honest review. I love how light weight this product is and non greasy. It absorb quickly leaving it silky smooth. I like doesn't make skin oily and can worn under makeup.
"I use this product on a daily basis, I LOVE IT ! my skin looks radiant, healthy and with a great texture. It works perfect for me I have been using it for years I try other brands but nothing compares to Aveeno :)"
I have very acne prone skin. This moisturizer is light and non-greasy. It makes my skin look more radiant. I will buy this product over and over again. I think I will try the face wash also.
I Love This Moisturizer!! It Makes My Skin Look Brighter And More Even. I Love The Idea That It Is SPF 15!! I Would Recommend This Moisturizer To Anyone!!
I love this lotion. It helped clear up some dark spots i had on my face. It makes my face feel alive. Softens and smooth it. I couldn't ask for a better product. Thank you
This is what I've been looking for. It's my go to moisturizer and sunscreen at the same time. Very light weight and feel good on the skin. Highly recommended.
This is the perfect amount of moisture and gives you that healthy glow.Its a great prep step before applying makeup. I use it every day and love the results. My skin looks fresh and smooth.
I've starting using this product a few days ago. The results so far have been more than satisfying. My skin is smooth and the product doesn't leave you feeling oily or greasy. Love it!
I use Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer and Cleanser. They make make face feel clean and not tight and dry. Love the moisturizer for the smooth but not greasy feel it leaves on my skin.
"I love this moisturizer, it has an nice light texture, it's not heavy or greasy. It has a nice scent and I can really notice the difference in my skin tone and the skin feels so soft and supple."
I complete my morning facial routine by using Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer SPF 15. The product is light and works into my skin easily. I have noticed a change in my skin and I feel protected from the sun. Thanks Aveeno!!
"I'm shocked--I've been using the expensive french yellow dept. store lotion for 25 years now. I started to use this lotion 3 weeks ago & I cringed when I smelled a slight fragrance but so far, so good. No breakouts at all! It cost half of what I've been paying so I'm anxious to start trying the other Aveeno products now. Thanks!!"
I've been using the Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF 15 moisturizer for over a year. I've tried other brands of moisturizer because I've had really dry skin (specifically in the T-zone) as a result of medications. I also have extremely sensitive skin and found that many moisturizers had extra chemicals that irritated my skin-- thus resulting in redness. Positively Radiant is the ONLY moisturizer I have NEVER had an adverse reaction to! My mom was recently looking for a moisturizer and I knew there was only one I would recommend.
I love this product. I have brown spots from sun damage and after 1 week I started to see my brown spots fade and my complexion start to even and even glow. It's a great balance containing SPF and natural ingredients so using it daily covers a multitude of benefits.
I used to have weird pink marks on my cheeks that wouldn't go away no matter what I did until I bought this and the positively radiant facial scrub. I use them both daily and my skin is nearly flawless now (I use these with Ambi Mark Treatment). It's extremely soft and I barely have any marks on my face and I feel good going out without makeup now.
"My mom actually got it for me and at first, I wasn't so sure about it, but now I use it every morning before I put my makeup on. I've noticed the first few times using it I couldn't really see a difference but after a while, I've noticed the blotchiness around my ance has cleaned up quick a bit."
"I had dark patches all over my face and neck. Was told it was due to pregnancy and would eventually fade. Not only did it not fade, it darkened further. I tried everything, prescription and otherwise and nothing worked. A few years ago I tried radiant 15 and within months, all of the patches disappeared. My skin loves everything about this lotion."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. and after trying it, i loved it, how easy it goes on and how soft and smoth it makes my skin feel."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I have sensitive skin and can still use this moisturizer every day. It leaves my skin feeling very soft with no oily or greasy residue. The smell is great and not overpowering. The added benefit of the spf is an amazing bonus!"
"I switched to this product when Kiehl's stopped carrying my daily moisturizer. The Kiehl's product was $54 for 4 oz. This one is 1/4 the price, but feels almost as great as my Kiehl's. It took me a while to find this one, and I tried almost every drug store moisturizer. But this has been my favorite."
"I used to only use the Dove lotion with SPF, but that was discontinued so I switched to this one. I could not be happier! I have dry, sensitive skin so I can't use too many products on the market. It is not greasy and it leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day:)"
"I'm a believer♥ I always wonder if these products actually worked, until one day I decided to try them. I had lots of brown spots on my face(which I hated) and when I started using moisturizer after a few days I saw a big difference in my skin, not only was it soft but the spots where lighter:) now I can barely see them and i'm totally changing to the Aveeno products from now on"
"This definitely works to improve my skin texture and tone, and I recently began seeing a difference in a couple dark spots on my skin, so I am pleased. However, it seems to cake up a little when I reapply throughout the day, but it is not that big of a deal. The entire Positively Radiant collection has been really great to my skin, and I think I may try the SPF 30 moisturizer next!"
"Initially my skin seemed to respond favorably to this lotion bit six weeks or so after I began using it, the effectiveness began to degrade as did the length of time the product was effective (and seemed to either ""wear off"" or ""needed to reapply."" If I want to increase the length of of effeteness, I had to reapply at least four times each daily. And, use my night-time Aveeno skin product every night. I don't really know if the effectiveness of the nighttime use was effective after applying it around 10:00pm."
"I've only been using this for about a week. After using my regular face wash my face feels dry and I need a moisturizer. I used Neutrogena in the past. I don't really any skin problems and Neutrogena worked fine, however after using Aveeno I will be mkaing the switch. It feels smoother on my skin. But like I said I've only been using it for a week, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
"Well, I have used Aveeno products before, and they just never disappoint! :) It's totally worth trying, to see if it fits your facial skin type! Its not thick, or too thin texture. It has just the right balance, to have moisturized, soft skin! :) I even wrote about it on my blog.. justanothergirlysite.weebly.com Check it out please!! :) If any of you need help finding the right skin care product, then come to my website/blog.. justanothergirlysite.weebly.com And my things that I write on their will surely help! :)"
"I recently stopped using my ""Department Store"" moisturizer because it is now almost $140.00 a jar. A relative had given me a sample of the Aveeno Moisturizer to try and I really liked it. This was a great deal and did not cause my pocketbook to have a stroke!! It is light and makes my skin soft and smooth and feels very silky. You can't beat the price!!"
I start my day in a great routine with the best moisturizer. I had severe facial blotches from my fourth child. I used this product and it helped tremendously. It was difficult to go to work without being stared. The situation was especially difficult because I was in the front of the classroom with students ranging from pre-k to 8th grade not to mention everyone else in the schools. I gained my confidence back with this product. It is a powerful product and WORKS. It is not extremely priced. It is an ethical product. It is zen.
"This is a great moisturizer and its a plus that it has SPF. A while back a had problems with my skin it became very sensitive and I started to wear Aveeno, this saved my skin! My redness is gone and the itchiness from allergies improved (other products made it worst) I recommend it to everyone this a must have for you if you like a lightweight moisturizer, specially if you live in hot weather as I do."
"I totally love this moisturizer with out it my face skin looks and feels so dull almost like an old baseball glove.Cant live with out it, the only thing that works for my dry skin!♥ my phone is not working so good thats why i couldnt rate BUT I GIVE THIS PRODUCT 5 STARS""AND YES ITS EFFECTIVE AND IM SATISFIED!!"
"This moisturizer was recommended to me by my dermatologist. After having used several of the pricier brands, I found Aveeno to be a welcome change. It is non-greasy, absorbs easily and did not break out my skin. The product kept my skin hydrated all day, and an added bonus was the SPF protection."
I loved the way if left my skin. Not only does it have spf but it also gives your skin plenty of moisture. I have sensitive skin and it didnt give me a rash or irritation. Which is great for me since I have a hard time finding things that dont make me break out.
"It's been more than two years since I started using it, and there isn't one day that I don't use it before going out. I also put it on before going to bed at night. It's simply the best. It has made my face shiny and even all over.it prevents breakouts. It keeps my face soft and moisturized. Thanks Aveeno"
"This is the ONLY product I use on my sensitive skin, it is the only one that actually helps me to clean and prevent breakouts. It leaves my skin feeling freah and rejuvenated. I have tried many expensive brands and NONE do the work like this one. In love, forever sticking with this!"
"My grandma has used this for quite some time and she looks amazing for her age. I would say that she looks a good 15 years younger than her age. When I started taking care of my skin, I went to her for advice. This is the moisturizer that she swears by and I love it too!"
I've tried numerous moisturizers and have either found them to bee too heavy or waxy feeling. I did not find that with Aveeno. My skin absorbed it and felt great. There was no waxy feeling. No residue left behind. My makeup went on fine and looked great. No settling into lines or anything. I highly recommend this. I have dry to normal skin and it worked great.
I like to put this under my make-up or even for those days that I don't. I have been using the Aveeno Positively Radiant for 8-12 weeks now and can really tell a difference in my skin. I would recommend this for anyone who is wanting to even out their skin tone.
love aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer ... its great on my skin works wonders leaving a great lovely scent and soft moisture to my skin .. wouldent choose anything else than aveeno products its all I use! I highly recommend aveeno products.
"I only use Aveeno products! I have very dry, itchy skin AND eczema. It is the only product that soothes my skin, while not causing break outs or rash. Aveeno is a lifesaver for me. The positively radiant moisturizer leaves my skin smooth and fresh, and my face beaming!"
"Amo este producto. Yo vivo en FLorida y el sol estaba dañando mi piel con horribles manchas, desde que uso Aveeno Moisturizer mi piel esta más bella, nutrida y humectada. Mis manchas incluso han desaparecido casi por completo. Amo mi piel y amo Aveeno."
The Aveeno product line gives women quality skin care choices that have multiple natural benifits in one. I love that the moisturizer has SPF and also helps reduce the sign of age spots and blotchiness. It goes on light and does not leave you feeling oily. Positively radiance allows me to start my day feeling nourished and radiant!
"I use this product everyday for ten years plus! Everything Aveeno from shampoo to lotion. I found that it's the only product that works for me! I tried a lot of Products out there and was never satisfied till I tried Aveeno, I recommend it to everyone and anyone who needs a product that actually works."
I'm 46 yrs old with sensitive dry skin. This lotion makes my skin look rejuvenated. Keeps me moisturizer and on day off I don't even wear foundation! It's the only face lotion on the market that doesn't make my eyes burn or my skin itch and it is perfect under my makeup or alone.I love this stuff! !!
"Let's just put is this way when I wake up in the morning I totally look like I had a rough sleepless night. My skin is puffy, dull, and blotchy. As soon as I wash my face and put this daily moisturizer on my skin looks and feels amazing. My skin looks so good that most of the time I don't even need to wear foundation. Just some eyeliner and mascara, and im ready to conquer the day."
I tried it and lived it. The first week I felt my face more softer and brilliant. I recommend this to any one who is willing to try a different product you will love it. My over all opinion about thus product is I will absolutely be buying this product again and again .my skin tone has changed to an even shade it has made my face look radiant and better then ever.
"I love Aveeno Positively Radiant! I use this product every day. I have really dry, itchy skin and after I shower every morning; I apply this all over my face. It's light so it doesn't feel greasy at all. It never breaks me out, so it's good very everyday use. I love that it has spf 15 in it. I know I am saving myself from future wrinkles and people compliment me on my skin all the time. Love it and will keep using it."
"I have been using this moisturizer for six years and I absolutely love it. It moisturizes really well and absorbs wonderfully - no greasy feeling. My skin is sensitive and used to break out frequently, but this moisturizer never irritates my skin or causes breakouts."
"I love AVEENO® POSITIVELY RADIANT® Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15.Its my Fave one.Previously I had no glow on my skin,skin texture was rough with brown spots.Now its been 3 months with Aveeno my glow is back,skin looks smooth and radiant.Really Loved it! Finally I found something made for my Skin! Thank you Aveeno!"
"I love, love love this product. I use it religiously, every single night, before going to bed. I also use it in the morning after I wash my face and before I apply my makeup. It doesn't feel heavy or make my face feel oily. I would highly recommend trying this amazing product!"
I simply love this product my fiancé and I use it every single day it makes our skin glow. This product does not leave your skin oily but hydrated and soft. I give this product five stars because I believe that it's an everyday essential cream for the face for every day use to show your true radiance. The best part about it it's in Aveeno product and it's all natural.
About three months ago I started using Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 and it is wonderful. I started using it so it can diminish my brown spots and it just works miracles. It has diminished my brown spots and I notice a radiant and glow to my skin.
"I been using this product for more than 4 yrs and I wouldn't change it for another moisturizer! It has help me have a tone, bright, soft skin and with the sun discoloration I used to have every summer before using it! So now before summer I make sure I stack up on this wonderful product. My skin is worth it! :) love you Aveeno"
"My face gets really dry especially in the winter. I have used a lot of different brands of moisturizers but they all failed. But when I saw this product on tv, I did not hesitate to try it. Since then, I never went back to the old stuff. I am so happy with the positive result and my skin is so much better now."
"I previously used this product with the Ultra-Calming Foaming Cleanser, but now I use it as a stand-alone. It works great. My skin is already showing improvements from the dryness after a week without using it with the cleanser. The scent is light and the texture is light. It definitely has helped with my skin tone."
"I am a girl who has always had acne. Big, sore, prevalent Acne. I started using this moisturizer along with Aveeno resurfacing scrub and my break outs are completely gone! My face has never been smoother! It evened out my complexion and kept my face less oily. I swear to everyone by AVeeno for face and hair care. Even if I'm without it or forgot it on a trip I go and by that I can't even use or borrow another brand! I will forever love Aveeno!"
"This is by far the best facial moisturizer I've ever used. I have combination skin, but very pale and sensitive. I've had so many issues with heavier moisturizers not working well with makeup. Ever since I started using this moisturizer, my skin is less dry and irritated and I can wear any foundation or makeup over it without fear that it won't blend. Simply the best for complexion and moisturizing - with or without makeup!"
I requested this product as a Christmas present and loving it. I saw all the ads with Jennifer Aniston who has flawless skin and idolized that. I apply the lotion in the mornings before my makeup and my skin seems smoother and brighter. I would just wear it alone but not brave enough yet. Hoping all the spots and discolorations will blend away. Thank you Aveeno. Trusted brand!
I wanted to try this as a replacement for what I had been using for years & the fact that the brown spots were becoming a problem for me. I noticed a difference in the feel of my skin immediately! My skin is much less dry than last winter & the brown spots are fading but not gone. I will continue to use this product as it performs so much better than my previous moisturizer.
I LOVE this moisturizer! I am pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers and was so happy to find one that worked for me at a great price! I decided to try Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer after recommendations from several of my favorite YouTube beauty gurus. I am so glad I did! I like the fact that the moisturizer isn't greasy or heavy! It makes my face feel refreshed and that fact that it contains SPF is so important! I can't imagine this product not being part of my daily routine!
I have used a lot of moisturizers with SPF 15 and this is by far the best. It is light - not at all greasy or sticky - absorbs fast and leaves my skin soft in a way that no other moisturizer in this category has. I've recommended this to many friends and family members who now all use the product too.
Wow Aveeno you are great I absolutely love this product this moisturizer does not feel heavy and it reduced my pimple size on the first day by the second day my pimples are gone I am not joking especially where i live in Manhattan this is great for my skin this moisturizer makes my skin matte and also makes my face just glow I love this product.
I am guessing that it is the ingredients for sun protection that is causing my skin to flake using this product because I like Aveeno products in general. I haven't noticed any lightning and the sensation of dry skin is significant enough to be distracting. It is definitely not acting as a moisturizer for me.
"I had to try this after seeing all of the youtube videos of people raving about this moisturizer. Sadly, this product made me break out and the shimmer in it did nothing for my skin. I really wanted to love it, but didn't work for my dry and sensitive skin."
Just start using it and I'm loving the way my skin feels and look.
Keeps your skin soft and fresh looking all through the harshest winter weather.
Look no further this is the best product! ♡☆♡☆♡ Love it! Looking forward to trying other products.
I have alot of sun damage this product helped erase some of that damage.
I bought this a few weeks ago and my face got an allergic reaction.
"Worked outside all my life skin got rough, now it's smoother and younger looking even has a glow about it."
Love how soft my skin feels. It is the best I've found in the market. I prefer this one to the other types of Aveeno moisturizers too.
"I love this product, keep my skin moist and soft. To be honest it makes me look youger and fresh!! I hardly recommended this product."
This product is and does exactly what it says it will. My skin is radiant and with the dry winter air it still feels moisturized and glows.
"I must say, I have yet to meet an Aveno product that I don't love, but positively radiant made post pregnancy skin so much better!"
"The product has glitter on it, that's why it says that is ""positively radiant"". I like the texture and the sensation of the cream on the face, but totally disliked that the product comes with glitter on it, horrible!!!!"
"I bought this product because of all of its great promises. After using it for 3 days my skin is dry, red, itchy, bumpy, and scaly. Even after ceasing to use the product my skin is still gross and dry and won't stop itching."
"I have super sensitive skin especially on my face, I also live in Colorado a very dry and hot climate. I have never had a problem with this product and will continue to use it. I ski and it has protected by face even from snow burn. Love it."
This moisturizer is the only facial moisturizer that I have used in years. It does not break out my skin. It helps even my tone and keeps my face moisturized without feeling heavy or greasy.
I absolutely love this product. It never leaves my skin oily and I love the protection of SPF. I have noticed my skin has evened out and feels much smoother.
My dermatologist was the one who recommended your Positively Radiant w/ sunblock 15. Use it daily and love the way my skin looks! Thanks for offering such a superior product...
this product is amazing it has made my skin so dewy i dont even want to wear make up it has clared up all of my acne blemishes and left my face model perfect i cant wait to do my skincare routine and use it right away
"I've been looking everywhere for a moisturizer with UVA/UVB rays! Thankyou so much!!!! Please don't discontinue this EVER! This has helped my skin ALOT, my skin tone my blemishes, texture. My skin feels so soofftt! Thanks again:)"
"While I love Aveeno products, this lotion is not good. It does not absorb well into the skin and collects in your pores. Not even sure it helped at all with the SPF."
Have been using this moisturizer for the past so many years and this has suited the best for my ultra sensitive skin. It totally helped my skin to get better after using it for a while.
"Just started using about a week ago. Haven't noticed any radiance yet, but i'm In my 70's so it my take longer. Lol! So far it feels good on my skin which is sensitive. Always do well with Aveeno products."
Love this product. I have been using this product for a couple of years. I have had excellent results. I use it alone for sun protection and under my make up. so perfect. I'm very allergic so this works well for me.
I read the reviews before buying Aveeno and I must say the Facial Moisturizer feels so good on my face and I feel wonderful wearing it. This product is amazing.
I wanted to try something different so I bought this. It is very thick. As soon as I put it on my face I start perspiring. You have to press hard for it to spread around your skin. It seems to soak in real quick and my skin feels smooth.
"Keeps skin looking luminous, even toned, firm, and smooth. No other daily moisterizer has touched my face for over five years now. It's works winders for my sensitive skin."
I love your products they are all different and unique and they make my hair and skin feel like liquid gold.thank you for all your wonderful products.
"I purchased this for my red, combination, flaky face. I LOVE it! Leaves my skin glowing without feeling greasy. The redness has diminished and no more flakes!!! I have tried many facial moisturizers and this is a winner!"
My husband and I love it he works out in tge sun wind and rain and he love this moisturizer because his sensitive skin is moisturize all day also my face looks more radiant
I love this moisturizer. It works very well for me without making my face oily or shiny. It's even gentle enough for my teenage daughter to use as well. Works great on hands too.
I use this in the morning and the cream at night. My skin has never looked better! The tone has improved and so has the texture. I can wear less makeup!
I love this moisturizer. It's the only one I've found that keeps my skin moist without making it feel oily or causing breakouts. It's perfect. I use the whole face skin are line.
My whole family uses all of the Aveeno products. My husband works with his hands and this is the only lotion that helps. My 2 yr old and 4 month old have beautiful skin thanks to the baby products!
I love love!!!! Positively Radiant is the best moisturizer I've ever used. Aveeno continues to give me beautiful results when other products just fail. Best products!!!!!
"When you live in a state (MN) where the weather is cold and dry 6-9 months of the year, your skin could use some extra love. Aveeno is exactly what the doctor ordered...especially their face lotion. Love it, love love it!"
This is a must for me. I love it because its noncomedogenic which means it wont clog pores helps prevent acne! We all need a moisrurizer with spf 15 or better.
Couldn't be any more happy with this product it is the best for my skin. It is a must i use it everyday my skin had change alot with aveeno is truly the best.
I have always had sensitive skin and this product was amazing. Completely felt moisterized and protected with the spf. Working in the dermatology field I know any aveeno products are the best and only recommend aveeno.
"This stuff smells good and makes my skin feel soft and 'awake'. The only con (for me), sometimes it makes me breakout if I use it everyday. I have really really sensitive skin."
"I love this moisturizer!!! It feels great, no greasy feel what so ever. SPF protection is definitely a necessary plus. Moderately priced, it's a must have in my daily use."
I have used aveeno face products for 3 years now. Before aveeno i had the hardest time looking for the face products that doesnt make me break out or cause my face to feel oily even after applying. I am happy with aveeno.
Its hard for me to find a SPF moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts for me. Then I tried Aveeno Positively Radiant. My face feels so soft and no breakouts. I love Aveeno. You can't go wrong with their line of skincare products.
I have been using this product now for 2 years. With combination skin (oily and dry) it is hard to find one product that works. This does. Would not use any other product.
I wouldn't know what to do without this product. I apply it every morning and every night. I love the moisture and sunscreen it provides in the morning and the calming feeling it gives me before I go to bed. A must have.
I love this moisturizer! It feels great on my skin and has SPF 15 which is important to me. It's a solid part of my morning routine and I don't see that changing any time soon!
"This is the only moisturizer I will purchase, or trust on my face. I swear it's magic in a bottle. So thankful for this product! My skin loves it too ;)"
my skin is dry and I have tried several brands looking for a product that gives me satisfaction and smoothness. This line of products I love because it leaves my skin feeling greasy and also contains sun protection factor
"What a phenomenal product. I have always enjoyed the entire Aveeno collection, but I LOVE this moisture and glow you get from this product! Definitely try this out!"
My younger Cousin Got Me Using This Product And My Skin Had Never Felt Better!! It Doesn't Make My Skin Feel Oily Like Other ProductS And moisturizes Wonderfully. I Love It!
I've used this product for several years now and while Ive tried different products I always come back to this one. It makes my skin look and feel great!
"I've been using the same product for 5 years, it has reduced the lines and dark spots on my face. I will be 50 this year and many people think I'm in my 30's. Tnis is a wonderful daily moisturizer."
I use after using the facial cleanse daily. My favorite is the tinted moisturizer..I apply be for my foundation and it keep s my skin moist and covers flaws be for foundation is applied.
I started using it this summer and I have noticed a difference in my skin. I am also using the night cream and cleanser. I have seen that my skin tone is much better. Love the whole line.
This product is so much better than all the other facial products you can buy. You can wear it alone or as a under your makeup moisturizer. Smooth facial reconstruction with a bonus of sunscreen
"I love this product, I have used many different moisturizers on my face & found that none if them did what I wanted or needed them to. This is a light non greasy formula that feels great on my face & reLly helps even skin tone!"
Love this face lotion. I have combo oily/dry skin and this is the only lotion I have found to keep both under control and have a good medium. Makes my face feel super soft and love that it has SPF 15
I love this product for all the benefits and more by the soft texture helps me a lot to improve the tone of my brown spots making me look fresh and radiant skin
I went to a dermatologist about dry redness on my face. Every lotion either irritated my skin or made it oily. The dermatologist gave me sample of aveeno positively radiant. It was love from the first use!!!
"I love love this product. I love how its very affordable but still works as good as a ""high dollar"" moisturizer! I also like how my skin doesnt break out like it has with previous moisturizer ive used. I will for ever be an aveeno customer! :)"
I just love Positively Radiant daily moisturizer. I have been using it for three years know. It is light smooth and feels so wonderful on my skin. I use it twice a day everyday. And I love the way my skin looks an fills because of it.
"this is the best daily moisturizer ever, my skin is glowing and so soft. I am in my 40's but my skin always looks younger ..I will Positively used this forEVER. Aveeno means Beautiful ."
"I can happily say that this is truely a great day-to-day moisturizer for my COMBO skin! Great texture and not too ""greasy"". I love to use this under my makeup which makes my skin glow!"
"At first I was a little hesitant, however after using it everyday for a few weeks it did really reduce the brown spots on my face. I will continue to use it."
Have been using this product since almost 4 years now. It makes my soft and feeling light and flawless with each application. Falling in love with this lotion more n more with each passing day..
This moisturizer is perfect for me! I have very dry skin and am a freckled complexion. I love that this has a SPF of 15 as I am outdoors quite a bit. I wear a hat but I love that I have a daily product which gives me protection too from the sum.
I have been using this over a year and I have seen a big improvement in my skin's tone.It is a great moisturizer that goes on light and non greasy.I love it!
"I Love, Love ❤️ using Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer because it makes my skin so soft and glowing! I use this every day, after cleansing my face. My daily cleansing duty is Not Complete without it!!"
"I've used this for a year now and I love it! Moisturizes nicely but doesn't make me break out. Although my face is usually not very shiny, some moisturizes make it shiny.This one doesn't.I'm happy with this product."
I have been using this product for over a year now along with Aveeno Daily Mositurizer and have got good results. My acne scars are going away slowly.
"I've used this produce in hope that it would work like the commercial claims. Follwed the instructions daily....and no it did not work at all, not even a little bit. We have to remember that probably 99% the commercial with actress......her face looks ""perfect"" probably because she's wearing makeup that is airbrushed. I will not recommend or use this product. It didn't harm or make things worse....but it didn't improve my skin.....Very disappointed...."
"My skin type is combination/ sensitive. I love how it has a natural smell to it, even skin tone just like it said it would, and took away my brown spot problems i had on my chin. This is my everyday routine and i always get compliments on how great my skin complexion is. I tried other moisturizers and they can't compare, so glad i discovered this product i truly believe in it 2 years +"
"I stored it in my cabinet and rarely ever used it Because i already had moisturizer. I discovered I was out of my other moisturizer and I had no money to buy another bottle so I had to use the Aveeno moisturizer.I woke up with dirt bumps all over my T-zone and pimples too. I was severely disappointed and even after I stopped using the product they wouldn't go away. I am so angry at aveeno for making great products, but this one is so horrible."
I have been using this product for TWO WHOLE WEEKS and I have yet to see ANY results. I am VERY disappointed in this product. this product is so disappointing I didn't even want to give it one star. SHAME ON YOU AVEENO for leading people to believe this product I even worth ONE RED CENT!!!!!!!!! This is just a SCAM and I feel sorry for those who were tricked into buying this monstrosity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is by far one of the worst products I've ever used on my face. I've been using this product for about 3 months and I have seen zero progress. It does not help with brown marks or evening skin tone. it's very oily and leaves my pores feeling clogged. I have developed more black heads from using this product. I will not buy again and I will discontinue using this.. Waste of money.
"I purchased this product about two weeks ago. My skin feels great and looks better. It is not oily it does not clog my pores. Being winter my skin is also very dry and this really moisturizes great. My routine is to put this on before my primer and foundation and it goes well under my makeup too, and I wear makeup almost everyday."
"I wanted a lotion that toned and evened out my skin tone, plus keeps it young and protects it from further damage..this is it and MORE! I love this lotion because it keeps my skin perfectly balanced, moisture-wise. I have normal skin that can sometimes get dry and this WORKS. I put my makeup right on top of it and my face isn't left too greasy, PLUS it has somehow cured my chapped lips! When I spread it over my face I just go right over my lips with it and by the next day my lips are just perfectly smooth!"
"I really needed a good moisturizer and because of Aveeno's good reputation, I purchased this product. I don't regret it. It may be too greasy for oily-skinned people, but it is hydrating. One con would be the price. I bought it for $15, which was pricey compared to other SPF products."
"Product arrived damaged. Ordered items were placed in delivery box without any protection or package fillers. So, the items must have been thrown about during the transports process. I would really appreciate it if Walmart would do a better job of shipping orders so that items arrive undamaged. Otherwise, I like the product. I've used it for many years."
Love this light Daily moisturizer! I could never remember to put on a light sunblock for every day exposure and this moisturizer has it in it! It leaves my face feel protected while not feeling heavy. Only down side is that 1 full pump is a little over ill for my face. But no biggie there.
"This product made my face break out soon after using it and was hard to clear up. The price is also extremely high compared to other products out there. I chose Aveeno because I value their name and reputation and have a body lotion from their brand that I love. However, this just wasn't up to the company's standard. Unless you want to deal with unsightly breakouts (and I normally have very clear skin) you shouldn't waste your money on this product."
"Guess it's my own fault for not reading all the fine print. I'm 59 years old and have never had a moisturizer stain my clothing. The box does say ""may stain some fabrics"". I have had problems with some sunscreens staining fabric. But I was buying a moisturizer - not sunscreen."
"If you suffer from frequent skin allergies, this product is likely not for you. I have a minor soy allergy that was HIGHLY aggravated by this product: redness/rash, welts -- the works! ""Natural"" and ""hypoallergenic"" are just marketing terms -- you can be severely allergic to nature."
"I have been using this moisturizer as all over face/eyelid moisturizer. It dosen't dry out my skin or irrate my eyelids like other face or eye creams.Left my skin soft. I would rccomebd this to others looking for a daily moisuizer.I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I love the moisterizer!!! I am convinced this will be the only one I used for my dry skin in the winter and oily skin in the summer it is not heavy nor does it leave a filmy feeling on my face."
"my skin was brighter and softer after just one use , it seemed to make ky freckles blend in with my complexion , and i like that it has an spf in it. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I loved the feel of it and liked that I didn't break out with it due to having sensitive skin. I recommend this to anyone and was so happy to try it out. I have since bought more due to how great it works on my skin."
"i'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I have dry skin and hate feeling dehydrated and patchy. I have tried lots of moisturizers and this one is awesome. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and super soft. I love how good it makes my skin feel and I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno® rewards program, and Aveeno® sent me a samples of its POSITIVELY RADIANT® DAILY MOISTURIZER BROAD SPECTRUM SPF30 to review. I really liked this moisturizer. It is thick and creamy without being greasy and it left my face hydrated all day. It absorbed easily and my face looked luminous. Highly recommend."
"I recieved aveeno for free through the crowtap page to review,i only was givin a week to review but in that week my face felt so soft and refreshing. Normally i cant use face stuff due to have senstive my face is but this did not bother it at all. Smells great and feels great!"
"I love Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer. I have super sensitive skin. This is the only facial lotion I can use. It doesnt clog pores or cause any skin irritation. I love the smooth, silky feel. Not greasy at all. I get a lot of compliments on how clear my skin is!"
Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer with SPF is awsome. My face gets very dry in the winter including my eye lids. This lotion goes on smooth and is not greasey. It stops my skin from flaking and smells good. It also provides sun protection so thats a plus. I would recommend it to all my friends.
I've been using this product for years as my facial moisturizer. It's not greasy can be use in all seasons. My skin texture improved after a few weeks of using this product and I love it because it doesn't make my skin itch nor rashes like any other moisturizer. Good for sensitive skin.
"My skin has always been so dry and eczema prone. But any other lotion and I break out. This is the most amazing lotion and I can really tell a difference if I go a few days without it, especially now that I'm expecting and my skin tone is all over the place."
I have particularly dry skin and must used daily moisturizer on my face everyday. The hard part was finding a moisturizer that worked & didn't appear to greasy. I got recommended the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer & have been using it ever since. It works the best & only one ill use from now on.
"I was sure if I would like it or not, but my mom have me a bottle and I would Never go without a bottle after using. My skin feels awful without it, utah weather is so harsh on my skin. Some skin products make you break out, feel greasy or heavy on the skin. Not this stuff, I love it:)"
I've been using this moistarizer for about a month now it does have a smell to it I have to agree but I have really dry skin and even this is not enough for me I' think this moistarizer should only be used in the summer and not in the winter since in NYC right now is winter . I don't like the way it works for me and I will be using something else !!
"Good moisturizer. Good price, does a good job, smells nice. Makes me look glowy."
I just wish this product line was available in smaller sizes so I can take them when I travel.
Works well with my sensitive skin. #WalmartContest
Tried so many daily face lotions. This tops them all. Its smooth and not greasy. Best stuff ever.
I love using this product it really does give you soft radiant skin! And you can't beat the price!
"I love this stuff! It keeps my skin in check, I don't even need to wear makeup sometimes."
Loved it! Made my face feel Amazing! My face is no longer dry and flaky. It feels fresh and moist.
Feels great when you put it on. No oily feeling. Great moisturizers ain't got nothing on aveeno!

I love Aveeno's products. They make my skin soft and give it a dewy appearance. I highly recommend this product and other Aveeno products.
I love the feel of this moisturizer on my face and love the fact that it has SPF protection. Also love the ease of use with the pump container.
Very light fragrance that melts into my skin and stays moisturized all day. I noticed a definite change in smoothing my skin around my eyes.
Absolutely love LOVE this product! Vital in my skincare routine! http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/05/drugstore-skincare-routine.html
"This facial moisturizer is great! I have used other moisturizers and I believe this is the best I have ever had, including Cerave."
This Aveeno works so much better for my skin. It's the perfect moisturizer alone and under makeup. I won't use any other brand.
This product is a lightweight moisturizer perfect for daily use. I purchased two packs to share with my Mom and Sister.
Love it! Best moisturizer I've ever used. I use it every morning after I shower. cant leave home without it! :)
Moisturizers usually leave my face feeling blah and oily but this works great and leaves my face feeling soft
I use this with the Aveeno Positively Radiant face wash and love this. Noticed improvement in skin and brightness. Former Avon user.
"Everyone needs to protect their skin and this is the ticket! I feel great when I wear it, no greasy face for me!"
I love this moisturizer. Not too.greasy. and works great. Especially in the winter! And it doesnt make.my skin break.out!
For 15 years I used Oil of Olay until I tried Aveeno and I been using it for the last 8 months and love it. I will never go back!
I have been using this product from almost a year and I m very happy with it. I started using this through a friend but now in love with it.

"Its amazingly lightweight, yet potent moisturizer. I hate that greasy feeling. And I dont grt thst with this moisturizer."
I've tried many different products ranging from really expensive to fairly cheap.This one works the best for my skin.
"When both my kids had @ once, they were little. I would put( in sink @ both), I even used in baby daughters hair, it worked way better, the best."
"I've tried many products to help my spots and circles, etc. I would love an opportunity to use this product!"
Beat moisturizer ever! Only face lotion I have been able to use that does not cause me to break out!
I love that this product is affordable and works so well. It's great that it has spf 15. I use this everyday and never leave the house without it on.
I always use this in the morning befor I apply any make-up. I love this product and have used it for several years.
I love all Aveeno products. The moisturizer leaves your skin feeling clean. It is a very lite product.
I started using positively radiant over a year ago. I turn 45 next week and im told all the time there's no way im that old. Thank you Aveeno!!!!!!
My mom loves it and the brand it's awesome I have used the face wash and it's good specially for my sensitive skin but I haven't used the moisturizer
I love that aveeno positively radiant is hypoallergenic. I'm a new user of this product however I think I've found my holy grail moisturizer !
"My fave moisturizer hands down! I love this for my morning moisturizer, leaves my skin feeling amazing! Love the SPF."
"this product says it evens out skin tone, but i've been using this for at least 3 months and haven't seen any difference. It also makes my skin greasy in my t-zone. I will not buy again"
"I never gives reviews, but, I have to compliment Aveeno on this product. I am 46, wear sunscreen daily, and have literally tried them all. Hands down the best!"
I have only used this product a few days and like the skin effects. But the fragrance in this product should be noted on the packaging since any fragrance is an allergen to many of us. I don't think I will continue using it
I had really hope this product would brighten up my face since it says positively radiant. But I have been using it for a couple months now and my skin is still the same. I am disappointed. I am back to trying to find a good moisturizer.
Too soon to tell if it works--just started using it. Word of warning: don't get it anywhere near your eyes. Kind of a bummer; eye skin needs moisture too.
I used to use this product for years and it worked perfectly. However I think the new formula is not as effective. It does not moisturize skin deeply and the moisture does not last. It's better as a sunscreen.
I heard this product is amazing and have friends who use it all the time. I would definitely need to invest in this product. I've been an Aveeno fan for a long time and I know this should work.
"Wow I have used oil of olay on my face for years and decided to make the switch to aveeno. I had been using the aveeno body lotion forever for my eczema issues and is amazing, I'm glad I made the switch for my face too. Very pleased !!"
This product works great ! My cheeks and forehead tend to get dry. With this product it does not happen. I have very sensitive skin and excemea. This works well for it also !
I have been buying Aveeno face moisturizer for years. I love this product cause it gives me smooth skin and it protects. I would recommend thus product to anyone.
I have used Positively Radiant for years and constantly get compliments on the clearness of my skin. I absolutely love this product and will never use anything else.
I love this! I used to get the expensive facial moisturizers that I could only get in one place. Now I get better results and spend a lot less with Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer!
"I have very sensitive skin, and this is one of the only daily moisturizers I can use. Love that has an SPF. I need to use it more than once a day in the winter, but I don't break out from it, so using more often is fine."
"I used this product when my aunt came to visit me, I used it for 3 weeks and it was pretty good. It wasn't the best product I've ever used and I will not purchase this product myself but it works really great for my aunt and my friends."
This is the only moisturizer I can use on my face. I love your product.
It's really good. Sometimes I wish I had more of it.
Has changed the appearance of my skin dramatically in just 6 weeks.
I have used it foe about 3years and it really plugged up my pores!
This moisturizer helps my skin hydrated and protects from the sun
"This moisturizer made my skin all bumpy and awful looking, I wouldn't buy this again!"
"I use several Aveeno products, but this is too heavy for my skin. Fees like I'm wearing a mask."
"It doesn't totally eradicate dark spots, but it does fade them a bit."
"Would not purchase again, Love their body lotion but not high on this face one."
"Excellent product. Lightweight,with soft 15"
"Light, non-greasy, has SPF--I'm wearing it everyday. Would recommend!"
This is awesome for my dry 40 something face. It really helps and protects with the sunscreen!
I use this everyday on my dry skin. It works all day and it doesn't weigh down my face. I love it!
Love the effects of this face cream. It goes on smooth and seems to calm my skin.
"I love the spf. Living in Texas, every little bit helps!"
This is so effective and I love it...I used it already for many years.

I love all Aveeno products for myself and for baby.
I swear by this product. It adds moisture to my face and leaves me with fresh glowing skin!!
Absolutely love this! First time I used it I was hooked!!

"I love this product, the only downfall is I can't travel with it. Travel sizes, please?"
this product did moisturize but did not even out my skintone. after awhile it starts to feel greasy and not at all fresh.
This product is a part of my daily regimen along with the Positively Radiant Cleanser! Great products!
"Don't expect this to protect you from the sun. Maybe to class and back, but don't go anywhere else or you will get burned!"
