"My Mom used Ponds Dry Skin cream for years, and up until she passed away at age 94, she was getting compliments on her skin. When I was younger, I bought into the ""designer"" skin products, but because of allergic reactions, I began using Ponds. That was about 30 years ago. I am going on 71, and I am always getting compliments on my complexion. I always tell people about my ""secret"" - Ponds Dry Skin cream that I buy at the grocery store. Thank you for a terrific product."
"I have loved the Ponds line of cleansers and moisturizers for years! Never have believed you need to spend a fortune for pretty skin at any age! From living in Alaska for 12 years, to now living in Florida, Ponds moisturizer for dry skin is the best:). I get many compliments on looking younger than my 56 years, and I owe a large part of that to Ponds! Thank you for helping to make all women feel and look beautiful at any age or income status!"
I've used Ponds since I can remember. My mother has always used it and her skin is gorgeous . I use the green lid for makeup remover and to refresh my face. The blue lid to moisturizer my entire body and face. I'm going to be 50 this year and often I get asked how I keep my skin so nice. I always say Ponds and sunscreen. Here's an up-close photo from my cell. Keep using Ponds. It works!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i was15 years old when i ask mom to buy ponds for my dry skin and since then i have been using this wonderful cream,,my friends ask me what i used for my face and say ponds but they say i lie! but no this is my secret ponds in the morning and night time even better. love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best face cream I have ever used! Other creams- more expensive brands- either made my skin break out or didn't work. This one is the best! I use it every night and morning. I also use Pond's makeup remover and skin cleanser. My mom ALWAYS used ponds!
"I had used Neutrogena sensitive skin daily moisturizer for about 5years. I ran out about 2months ago and grabbed this Ponds that I had bought one time when I was out of state and had forgotten my regular lotion. Needless to say I have stuck with it and have been using it once, sometimes twice a day and I cannot get enough of it! I love the way it feels on my skin and it has helped so much to diminish the 2 dry spots I had on my face! I have never had more smooth, glowing skin in my life!Kelly, 35yrs old"
Every time I turn around someone is telling me how beautiful my skin is I would like to be one of your models [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this cream under my powder foundation and its wonderful! My face looks soft and my makeup doesnt look cakey. Layer it on heavy at night for deep softness! love it!
"I've tried all kinds of skin care products, from drug store to high end. None of them compare to Pond's. I believe beauty should not cost an arm & a leg. Pond's is affordable and works better than pricier products I'll never stop using Pond's!"
"I have used this for years. I like the scent to me it smells almost like baby powder. It does not cake, goes on smooth, & does not leave my face greasy My friends comment on how youthful my face looks, also right after I use it on my face, my face feels cool."
"23 years of ponds - never can go wrong,morning and evening used, 53 years old"
"The only thing I have ever used, as my Mother did and now my daughter. I'm 77 and have great skin and very few wrinkles."
I have very dry skin this stuff moisturize my face so good i can't get enough of it please don't ever stop selling this!
I am almost 66 and get compliments on my skin several times a week. They can't believe it when I tell them I just use Ponds. I have tried many very expensive creams before and never had skin like i have now since using Ponds for 10-15 years now. Thank you Ponds.
Used Ponds all my life. I'm 75 with good skin. not bad for an old lady...
Smells great and works great!
I cannot keep using this cream! I have made the mistake of buying it for the third time and still the right side of my face breaks out in a rash.
I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 30 YEARS AND IT KEEPS MY SKIN FRESH AND MOIST. I'M 80 YEARS OLD AND HAVE FEW WRINKLES WHICH I ATTRIBUTE TO USING THIS PRODUCT
I have been using ponds since I was in my twenties. This is what the actresses used back in the day. It smells good while keeping you looking young by 15 years. Just the right amount of moisterizer for normal skin. They talk about using seral vital to look young which is that same as eating watermelon. Ponds is just great for me in the winter months and does not break out normal skin. Watermelon in summer and Ponds Dry Skin formula in the winter or all year round for normal skin. THE Best in my opinion. Thanks Walmart...
I am 70+ and I have been using Pond's cream since I was a teenager. My momma and my granma used it. They had very nice young looking skin. I was selected for a skin study as they thought I looked at least 10 years younger than my age. The Florida climate is harsh on your skin and heat in the winter dries your skin. I use Ponds cream at least once and up to three times a day depending on the weather. I use it over my sunscreen. I highly recommend this cream.
"I had used this years ago and liked it. Don't know why I stopped using it. It's a great moisturizer. Easily absorbed if you don't over use it. And has a feminine light scent. Makes me feel pretty! Won't clog pores, is what I was looking for, this is it."
This is the best cream I have found to sooth and improve dry aging skin. You can feel and see a difference immediately! Over time the appearance of the dry spots diminish and my skin look healthy. I avoid hot showers and harsh soaps. This will dry the skin again. This is a great buy and is delivered to my door with other items to get the free shipping.
My family has been using this product for years! Love it and it works great for neck and chest.
This facial cream can really do a good job of retaining moisture and keep your skin soft and hydrated. Price is good comparing with other name brand. One con effect is that it is rather greasy. (At least I feel it this way)
"I have tried several moisturizers and face creams but this works best. As a guy I need a quick application but non-greasy cream for my dry skin, and this cream does the trick."
"I have been using this for about 12 years, I'm 31, and I love it. My face is SO dry and this is the only stuff that keeps it under control. I have sensitive skin and this has never been irritating or has caused breakouts. I seriously don't know what I would do without this stuff. Liquid gold!!"
"Not Only does this keep my dry skin hydrated, and easily removes make up but it even helps keep skin with eczema from being irritated. And it's easily found everywhere"
"My grandmother, my mother and I all have used Pond's Dry Skin Cream for years and years. Our family of women have always known the benefits of your product and appreciated what it has done to keep our skin as fresh and young looking as possible. While i am almost 71 years old now, my skin still feels healthy and alive, thanks to using your cream every day!"
"I know this isn't the primary use, but this is the only cream I've found that doesn't irritate psoriasis on my feet! It's difficult to find a that isn't loaded up with irritating ""acids"", etc. that is also a cream, and effective at holding in moisture. (I love this on my face, too.) A true life-saver because it's not over-designed, and is truly suitable for sensitive skin."
"My mom buys this cream for me because of my terribly dry skin everywhere. She has been buying this for a long time for me. I actually like this product. I use it on my arms, legs, and face. I don't care for it on my face so much (because I use a face wash), but overally, the product is great. I think it's a little expensive."
"I have very sensitive skin. Nothing worked including what my dermatologist prescribed me until I started using Ponds. Within the first week I noticed a HUGE difference in the way my skin looked and felt. My grandmother also told me that my great grandmother used Ponds and had ""the most beautiful skin"" I'm a believer!!!"
"Started using this wonderful product about 6 months ago. Amazing!! I'm 47 now and though my skin looks great, I really wanted to step up my moisturizer regime. I bought Pond's because of it's good name. I use the Dry Skin Cream as my night cream and will never buy an expensive product again! Thank you Pond's for keep in it classy and affordable!!"
"My Mom has been using this facial cream since she was a child, and as early as I can remember (I am 32 right now), as early as being a toddler, I can remember my Mom using the cream on myself, my brother and sister after bathing us to ensure hydrated, healthy skin. I have used Pond's ever since and all of my girlfriends have complimented me on my smooth, blemish-free skin! I have always since my toddlerhood have had smooth, silky radiant skin and I can definitely attribute it to Pond's - and so can my siblings!"
"I use Ponds Dry Skin Cream year round, absolutely love everything about it, and the light scent doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all. It's one of the very few things I purchase over and over again. Walmart has the largest selection on Ponds and the best value around."
"It just occurred to me how LONG I have been using Ponds Dry Skin Cream. It has to have been over 60 years. There have been some other products that I have liked and used regularly, but sooner or later they have all disappeared or have been totally changed. Congratulations to your company for offering this nice, simple, face cream for so many years. I am 85, do I have gorgeous skin? Well. . But I don't think its too bad. Keep up the good work!"
"There is a reason why this has been around forever! It is the best. Living in Utah during the winter can seriously dry out your skin but not with ponds! My grandma used it, my mother uses it, my sister and I use it and even put it on the kids when they have dry skin and my father just started using it. Love it! Please don't ever take it away!"
"Pond's Dry Skin Cream is the BEST moisturizer out there. I love the lightweight texture, yet it's quite rich. A generous pea-sized dab is all I need, morning and bedtime (after an AM shower or PM cleaning with a baby wipe). The fact that it's so inexpensive makes it even better. My skincare routine is pretty basic, but this is the only moisturizer I use on my face. I've been using it for about 25 years and will never use anything else if I can help it. Please don't ever discontinue making it!!"
"A long time ago, I had chest acne problems, it was so bad that I always cover my chest covered clothes during the summer. I tried using different products to get rid of acne, and still it wasn't working. Awhile ago, I showed my mom my chest and told her that I had this problem for a long time. She decided to recommended me, this product, the Dry Skin Cream. After few days of usage, as in a result, my chest acne has cleared up! I couldn't be happier! I'm planning to buy more in the future! :)"
"A little goes a very very long way with Ponds, so be careful when digging in to begin your moisturizing. Ive been using it for a few weeks now. Its helped a lot with my super dry skin. Hopefully with continued use ill see more progress. Its a thick full coverage moisturizer with a very subtle scent to it! Def recommend for day to day usage."
"I would have given this face cream five-stars, but it has a fragrance! Why on Earth does a face cream need to have a fragrance, when it is marketed for ""sensitive"" skin? I do use it on occasion, but I constantly smell it and eventually it does begin to bother me. I'm looking forward to trying a different ponds facial cream, which is fragrance-free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my go to everyday moisturizer that I am obsessed with. I have been using it for over 6 years now and I swear by it. You only need to use a tiny bit because it's really spreadable. I travel a lot so sunburns are common, so I use this on my shoulders and it provides such relief!"
"My mom and grandma have been using this for product for as long as I can remember! If its not broken, dont fix it. This cream is STELLAR! Not too heavy, not too light. Works during the summer months without making my skin oily and greasy and work during the winter when my face is way dryer. I have tried other lotions but this is my holy grail. I will continue to use this for a long time because it has not made my skin inflamed or produced any allergies, which is very common with other creams."
"I had no idea how much I needed this cream in my life. Ive been struggling with dry skin all winter and nothing I have tried gave any relief until this. I never really considered this cream, not sure why, but I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pond's is another brand I love!! My grandmother and even both my great-great grandmothers have been using this for years. It is such a good moisturizer for dry skin. Especially in the winter time. I love that in comes in a tub I use my ecotools sponge to dip into it and apply it on my face. I would recommend this to anybody no matter their age or skin issues!!
"I suffer from dry, flaky skin, and have tried other more expensive products like ""la roche posay"" but ponds definitely beats the competitors. I do look a little bit shiny with ponds, but it beats the flaky skin i had before. ponds also spreads really well, and makes my skin texture look great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used ponds through my 20s and now the start of my 30s. I have dry skin and nothing is as rich and moisturizing as this cream! I am a beauty junkie and I can't find anything better. Especially in the winter, the heaviness of this cream leaves me hydrated and dewy."
I like this lotion. It hydrated my skin great without the oily residue feeling. It has a light scent. A little goes a long way with this lotion. It has helped me a lot this winter and kept me from having dry skin. I got this from my Influenster box. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face moisturizer has saved my life! I used to have noticeable dry skin under my foundation but since using ponds dry skin cream my face is so smooth and hydrated. The only thing I would change is the smell. Sadly it smells like old lady (sorry), but it works wonders!"
I have been using Pond's Dry Skin Face Cream 1-2 times per day for the last 32 years. I have normal to dry skin. People are always giving me compliments on how young I look and I'm giving this product partial credit for that. LOL I've been using it forever and haven't changed my moisturizer ever in the last 32 years. Pond's dry skin cream is a great product! imho
Smells great feels wonderful [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
M gym had this in the women's locker room and I tried it. Feel in love with it.
Pleasant fragrance and it isn't too greasy goes on nice and silky
I was expecting 3 JARS AS described. I only received ONE LARGE JAR. I ordered the 3 to put in three separate gift baskets for friends. DISAPPOINTED!
"I use this as a makeup remover and a moisturizer. It works great! It removes all makeup, even when I use a primer or have waterproof makeup."
I find it really makes a difference in drug weather conditions. It keeps your skin moist and soft during the driest weather.
"This is great, light moisturizer I use on my face. I have used this product for many years and have always been satisfied with it."
My Godmother recommended this product to me for windburn on the face on a cold day. Wow! It worked great and I continue to use it even preemptively during cold weather or in general as a moisturizer
"I am 80 years old and have used Ponds cleanser since I was a young girl. Everyone tells me I do not look my age. My skin is smooth, no wrinkles nor dark spots. I still work full time and enjoy every day."
"I was excited to try this product from all the good reviews I read. Unfortunately after two days of use (pea size amount to easy into the product), I broke out with white heads and red bumps along my chin and forehead!"
After burning my delicate skin with numerous anti-aging products I tried this just to sooth. I love this stuff. It makes your skin very soft. I now use this for day and night and my skin has never felt or looked better.
Its now winter and I need Ponds now more than ever. But besides that Ponds is amazing! I love the feel and how rich it is. For Christmas I ask for 2 more jars of it! So I never run out lol Its a MUST to have
"I'm 76 years old and have always use only ponds face cream. Lately I have notice wrinkles on my chest, so now I use it on my neck and chest, and I have seen a big difference. My daughter calls me Benjamin button. Thank you"
I have been using POND'S - Dry Skin Cream since the age of 32 now going on 50 next month. I simply love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a problem with dry skin on my face after I shaved.  A few years ago, I picked up the Pond's Dry Skin Cream and began using it.  It works perfectly well!  I have used it everyday for probably over 10 years now."
"I love this cream, it is good for dry faces, and even helps me clear up some of my psoriasis. I use it as a body cream as well. Even though its a heavy duty cream it drys on light and has a nice refreshing smell. Thank you ponds!"
"I have used expensive products which are very good for aging skin. I decided to cut down costs and have been using Ponds moisturizer and cleanser on my aging skin for years! Just as good, never any side affects or blemishes. Thank you Ponds!"
"I use this religously every day! It's the best cream ever! It doesn't have that strong scent like most creams, it's perfect! I just wish it costed less!"
My face is usually super dry and flaky so I decided to give this a try and it's a miracle. I put it on right after I wash my face and makes it so soft and not dry at all. If I miss a day I can totally tell. I would recommend over any brand.
I absolutely love this moisturizer. My face is always so dry when I get out the shower and I pair this with witch hazel and my face is set for the day. It's not oily and it also rubs into your skin instead of setting on your face like grease
"I've been using ponds for about 2 year now and I love this more than any other lotion ! It helps my dry skin so much and it does not make me break out , also it's price is very fair for how big the bottle is ."
I have been using Ponds dry skin cream for years. I am 84 and have no wrinkles. I contribute that to Ponds cream. I use every morning and at night to take off makeup and then put more Ponds dry skin cream on. Friend 99 uses Ponds no wrinkles.
Don't get me wrong it is hydrating and I have dry skin but it's to hydrating because it leaves my face really oily whenever I put it on. If you buy it use very little unless you want to be shiny then yeah lol.
"My friend recently told me about pond's and now I cannot live without it! It makes my skin feel so soft, and has become an essential part of my skincare routine."
"For the price, this stuff works great on dry skin. It has an oily feel to it compared to other creams, but its moisturizing effects seem to last longer than some thicker, but less oily creams. Id recommend this to anyone with super dry skin."
I have been a faithful Ponds cream user for years! I dont usually consider myself married to products but this one is an exception! My skin always feels hydrated and smooth after application!
I like this face cream it just is a little bit heavy for my skin. It caused me some breakouts. However if my skin is feeling extra dry when its cold out it does a good job keeping it hydrated [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ponds has become my favorite moisturizer since I began using it a couple months ago. Leaves my skin feeling great and smells good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My go to face cream for decades! I use this as a makeup remover at night. I apply liberally and wipe away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This worked well on eczema. It has a strong scent that I would prefer it not have. However, the product worked well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its very moisturizing if you have REALLY dry skin. Personally, it leaves my skin greasy, but my skin is more towards combination. I tried this because my mom has dry skin, it works well for her."
"This paired with my Lancme facial cleanser keeps my skin soft, supple, and clear! Definitely a must have in my skincare routine. Awesome for those dreary winter months. The best part is its totally affordable! Would buy again x 1,000,000,000"
"My favourite face cream, I have super dry skin and it feels horrible unless I use this dry cream. It helps so much pounds Is one of my favourite creams"
"My grandmother used the dry skin cream, my mother is 91 and she uses it. I have people compliment my complexion since rediscovering it and my daughter thinks it's great."
"I had started to develop horrible dry skin after using a facial antibiotic regimen for my cystic acne and someone turned me on to this lovely product! It cleared up in a couple of days and I discovered that I could even use it on my hands, but I that had been dried out by the icicle cold weather! Go out and get some if you're looking for a moisturizer!!"
Great to use during winter. Keeps my skin from cracking. Also great for my eczema breakouts. I've been using it for years and it never disappoints. A little goes a long way and makes your skin feel super soft all day long! I recommend this to everyone!
"Love to use this everyday in the morning and night! I always use this after i shower because i have dry and itchy skin. Makes my skin hydrated through the day, helps make my makeup more glowy. Bought this bottle about a year ago and still have more than enough. Alittle definitely goes along way POND's Dry Skin Cream"
I have been using ponds dry skin cream as a moisturizer since I was 15 I am now 54 .. I am very happy with it for my face as well as my body .. I go to the beach a lot and needed a basic moisturizer that I could slather on without fear of dyes or perfumes ... The only other item I put on my face is witch hazel and it cleans my facial pores better than any soap ever has.
I always bought this for my mum .she loves it .i love it too .we have been using it for more than 20 years now .we never had any regret to buy this product.it moisturiser skin very nicely.i would definitely recommend this to my friends.i would love to repurchase it .POND's Dry Skin Cream
Do not buy if you have sensitive dry skin. I use this every morning and night and before winter came it worked well. Now that it is colder and my skin became more dry it's horrible. Doesn't help with dry skin and it burns my skin and irritates it. If you have dry and sensitive skin I don't recommend at all.
"Before purchasing this product, I read the back and it stated it was non-hypoallergenic, and does not clog pores. This is false. I used this product for two days and skin severely broke out. It smells good, and hydrates my skin but the breakouts are not worth it."
I love using the ponds for my dry skin when i get out of the pool I get very dry and for being a swimmer it is a daily use for me. This brand is also affordable and anyone could go get it at your local drug store. I buy this very often like 2 every month but I but the small one and a bigger one every time.
"My mascara is usually very difficult to get off of my eyes. I wake up looking like a panda and my white pillow cases end up ruined. Since I tried this however, everything has changed. And my sensitive eye area does not get dried out lie it did with wipes. It is so gentle, but really does what I need it to"
"I like this! It's good on my sensitive skin and moisturizes well. I've used this in the past and recently started again, and I don't regret it. Nothing too crazy and the packaging isn't incredibly exciting but it does what it says it will and that's all I can hope for."
"I like how my skin feels after using this product. My skin does feel hydrated and soft after using this product. I like that this doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't cause my skin to breakout or have any other issues. I think this smells good, however I do find the scent to be overwhelming sometimes. I find this product to be priced reasonably and will buy again when I need something but can't afford something more expensive."
"This product lives by its name! Pond's Dry Skin Cream really does work for dry skin. In the colder months, my under eyes and around my mouth get really dry. I put this on every other night and it sinks right into my skin and leaves me feeling moisturized!"
I like this cream but it's too heavy for my face. I've started using it on my elbows and legs for dry winter skin and found it's better used there for me. I think it would be useful for anyone with normal or SUPER dry face skin but for an oily face like me it just adds unnecessary shine.
This moisturizer is good for the price. It moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy. It is a gentle formula and always leaves my face feeling soft. I think it is an effective product. I will purchase this cream again and would recommend this to others.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it! There's a reason why this cream has been passed down from generation to generation. It's so good. It's thick, so you don't need a lot. It's creamy and absorbs well into the skin. The ONLY thing I wish it had was a wand or something to scoop the cream out because I hate putting my hands inside a jar. It has a very light scent, nothing overpowering. Don't put too much or you may look greasy. SERIOUSLY a little goes a long way. POND's Dry Skin Cream"
My grandmother uses this cream it is very moisturizing and does not clog your pores it can be used on very very drying skim and give immediate results. It's non greasy very nice and besutiful.love the floral scent to this kind of like a perfume but very rejuvenating.
I got a small jar one day while I was working. It was very cheap and my skin was very dry that day. This was so effective. The packaging was so small and cute. And it's perfect to fit in a small purse for on the go. This brand has been in my family for generations. So I love it always!
I have oily skin. But in the winter my skin turns very dry especially when I put on a topical ointment for my acne. This is a very thick cream. I was not a fan. Made my skin very oily and just gross feeling. I wouldn't recommend this for people who have oily/combo skin.
"I used this dry skin cream in the harsh winter where I lived last year. It did not disappoint. It wasn��t too thick, and was great for my dry and cracked skin. I used this on my grandfather when his chemo treatments dried his skin out, and he loved it too."
"These are a serious MUST HAVE. They are AFFORDABLE, they WORK, they SMELL GREAT!! I love them and I will never use anything else. I highly highly recommend you try one for the needs you have. I use this for my dry skin, but they have so many great ones."
"This cream was a bit too heavy for my skin so I had to use it sparingly. My skin does get dry in the winter but this formula didn't work well for me. However, the product was very soft - I ended up using it as a hand lotion and that worked well. It would have been great for my face had it been a little lighter in the formula."
This is always part of my nightly routine. It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh after a shower. If my skin is feeling oil prone one day is can leave a little bit of oil residue. It smells clean. It's really inexpensive and it's something everyone in the family uses from grandma down. Will repurchase very soon.
"I'd like to start off by saying this definitely gets rid of dryness. So as advertised this is a great dream, my only complaint with this which is why I knocked off a star is that it isn't fragrance free and my skin is overly sensitive to fragrance. I would recommend 100% I use this in winter times for my body and it's the best!"
Best skin cream ever!! After I shower I put Pond's Dry Skin Cream on my face and it feels so refreshed. I have sensitive skin and it was always a struggle for me to find something that made my skin feel and look great then I find this product and it has done wonders. I would def recommend!
"I only use this on my body, never on my face. I feel like its pore clogging and will break you out! also ONLY wear at night, because if you wear this in the sun, you will tan and get crazy discoloration. Its pretty thick, creamy and really moisturizing for your body though."
"I started using Ponds in my teens and continued thru my twenties. Then, I fell for the ""buy this miracle cream"" ploy and after years of trying countless creams I gave up trying to find something that worked for me. Menopause has played havoc with my skin making it extremely dry and crepe so once again I've been struggling to find a good cream, THEN, I remembered Ponds. I love this cream, my skin looks wonderful, and the scent is like an old friend. Thank you Ponds don't ever change this cream."
"This is my holy grail night moisturizer! I recommend getting the smallest size because the bigger ones make it harder to get everything out because it's hard to reach down to get the product out of the bottom. This sinks in pretty fast and leaves my skin really moisturized the next day. Though it's really moisturizing, it isn't heavy or greasy. Have been using this for years and definitely recommend!"
"It's perfect for winters. I have been using its since years and it has always been in my skin care products specially in winters when my skin gets really dry. It does have strong fragrance, however I like it. Reminds of my teenage days and when I first began using it. Lol"
I have had this same tub for probably a year now and it is still going strong. You can't beat the price and you only need a little bit to use on your whole face and neck. I don't really care for the scent as I'm not a fan of powdery smells but this stuff works great and you really just can't get much more for the price.
"I been using Ponds for years, I wear it along under makeup on my hands I also rub it on my elbows."
I have dry skin. It works well on my face.
nice [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great product for moisturizer
Love this dry skin cream. I have used it for years. Works great!
Item is as good as I remembered.
"Why did they change the formula. There is now too much perfume and something else which makes my eyes sting. I loved the old cream and used it for 20 years, since I was a teenager. I can't use it anymore. Why couldn't you have sold the old formula alongside the new one? I am really disappointed and I am still searching for a new cream."
"I love Ponds, especially this specific cream. My mom has been using Ponds since she was 18, and I have been using it since I was 17. I'm only 24, but some of my friends are already to show slight signs of aging skin. Not me! Daily use of Ponds for the past years has left my skin unchanged, soft and radiant. I will continue to use it for the rest of my life!"
"I've used ponds because I was in need of a moisturizer and well I can't ever find the right one. I've read and done research that this is a good moisturizer, I trusted the reviews. I tried it on for months later realizing I was breaking out so bad around my cheeks I wanted to cry. I continued using it having high hopes that it wasn't the moisturizer after a while I gave up on the moisturizer and gave it to my sister."
"I got started using Pond's because my grandmother and mother used it. But like a lot of other reviewers, as I got older, I stopped using it because I thought I needed to use the more expensive creams because they ""worked"" better! Well after about 10 years of using other products, I thought I would give Pond's a try again and I am so happy I did!! Don't know why I waited so long to try it again, but I'm back and will not use anything else again! My face feels softer and looks better then it has in a long time. Thank you Pond's"
I use this before I apply my foundation and at night. This works well on the skin and keeps it hydrated. I highly recommend this item.
Nice product very soft exellent coverage long lasting
"So far so good though too perfumed for me, would like another small and it should be much weaker."
I usually felt after washing my face that it was really dry. I tried this product and its great! Just a small amount will do!
"Have been using this moisturizer for many years, as did my mother. Have tried others, but this is the best."
"If you have a dry and tight feeling skin , try this products. It works wonders, within two days you feel and see the difference."
Once you try Ponds Dry Skin you will never go back to anything else. Feel the difference and you be the judge.
I put this on before bed after I washed my face and my skin looks and feels great! Only use a little though cause it's a little heavy.
Yes it's great alp the time every time what more go get it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanted something to moisturize my face at night. Thought I would try well known Pond's. It is heavier than I prefer and I don't favor the scent.
This face cream has caused me to break out REALLY BAD. I've gotten acne in places where they usually never came up. Ruined my skin.
"This skin cream is very affordable . I like that it moisturize my face , I tip though is dont use a lot because your face can look a little greasy."
"Love this. Never leaves my face feeling oily. Hydrates my face and neck so well, I'm impressed for how cheap it is! :) Give it a try!"
This is a good product. It doesnt clog my pores which is a good thing but it kind of feels like I am applying water to my face
"love how easy and affordable is, leaves your face very smooth. not dissaponted at all with this product.. meet every expectation ive had."
"I am using it as a body cream, for dry skin. I bought it 2 weeks ago and i use it once a day, my skin feels hydrated."
Ponds is a great product. Very effective. Been on the market for years. Reasonably priced. Like it very much
"Best moisturizer out there! I use it every night to combat my dry skin problems and its never failed me. Reasonably priced, smells nice (mild), and works amazingly."
lotion is very moisturizing and smells really good. im happy i bought it bc my skin has been unbelievably dry. bottle seemed a little small for the price but thats ok. i definitely recommend to others
"I have tried this along with cold cream cleaner .. it works wonder.. my face is so clean and soft .. my family have used this for years .. try it , you wont regret it! :)"
"Saw it on sale in Walgreens and decided to give it a try. My skin feels so much better after applying it. As the product is not pricey, you wont feel the pain even if you applied a generous amount on your skin. Love this!"
I have very dry and sensitive skin which means I have lots of trouble with a lot of products. This one works great for me. It makes my skin so soft and does not irritate it at all.
Super good moisturizer for dry skin. Very hydrating and help my skin to stay hydrated since I have super dry skin and putting this on makes me feel much better. Right now I'm using my second one. Would recommend for any one with super dry skin. ❤️❤️
"my fiance swears by this stuff! He works outdoors and gets dry skin, wind burn, and chapped face. He has tried several products and this is the only one that is quick and effective"
Not too sure how this moisturizer is because I started to break out soon after I started to use it. Does feel a bit heavy and greasy on the face. POND's Dry Skin Cream
Okay when you put it on your face it leaves it way too oily as if the skin isnt absorbing the cream so i dab it off with toilet paper but its still been helping keep my skin moisturized at night and when i wake up
My face gets dry and flakey in the winter. This ponds dry skin takes it away with in a day. It is a little greesy and makes the skin on my face oily the next day but it srill takes care of my dry skin even after washing my face the next day.
I tried this as my grandmother used it all the time it does work well but as I age my skin is becoming very sensitive and I have to be careful of skincare products.
"Got this from the Influenster Reviewers box. It is too much fragrance for face, but I actually like it on my hand. It is hydrating and moist. POND's Dry Skin Cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love it! it's creamy, it has a delicate fragrance that smells great and left my skin soft and supple from just one use. Best of all no stinging ,no redness ,no rashes, like I usually experience from other more expensive face creams"
Love this for a moisturizer. It does have oil in it so if you don't want any oils I wouldn't use. It's effective for me who has normal to dry skin definitely gentle I buy it all the time
I have severe dry skin and this is NEEDED for soft supple all day moisture. It doesn't clog pores or have any harsh scents. Great product especially for winter months. I would recommend to everyone. And you can't beat the price
"This product I found was really good, the packaging is nice and simple and it's not to in your face. It is a really affordable item, it was my first time using it and I would definitely but it again!"
"I have very dry skin, especially during the cold days so I wanted to use this as an overnight moisturizer. It definate did the job but it does have some what of an oily effect on the skin."
Pond's Dry Skin Cream is very moisturizing. It is very gentle. I have very sensitive skin and it didn't not make me have any sort of reaction. This was my first time using this cream. I might buy this product again.
"Bought this for my husband since he has dry skin, especially in the winter time! He uses it daily and has noticed a difference! Definitely met my expectations. Would recommend to others."
I bought this due to a rebate to try it. I liked it as well as the cleansing cloths and the anti wrinkle dark spot moisturizer. Great for combination skin also
I bought this on sales from target. The texture is great and flawlessly fits my skin tone. Highly recommend it. Great for all skin type - as my skin is prone to acne.
"This removes makeup soooo easily. At the same time, it's also moisturizing your skin, so it's like a two-in-one. It removes any amount of makeup and is not harsh on the skin. The amount you get lasts such a long time and is worth the amount you pay."
POND's Dry Skin Cream I use this when my skin is feeling a little dry . It moisturizes well & the package it comes in is simple & good for taking when traveling .
"I have to say I never use it to moisturize my skin, no matter what type it is, it gets my skin super oily. The only reason I give it 4 starts is because it is a great makeup remover!"
"This moisturizing cream is really good for the price. I've used other creams that are a little better, but if your looking for an moisturizing cream that won't break the bank I would give this a try."
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! I have been using this product for many years and recommend it to everyone. It hydrates my skin but doesn't make it oily.
"It is a cream for dry skin that reduces the dryness noticeably. Suitable for sensitive skin, hypoallergenic and does not clog the pores. Makes your skin soft and radiant. Perfect for the current woman"
"It really helps my skin out during the winter time. Very affordable, very satisfied with the product. I don't we're foundation so,this is all I put on my face. It great for I needed it for I will buy again.POND's Dry Skin Cream"
I love this cream for when my cheeks are really dry in the winter. It is perfect and has a nice delicate smell to it. Super inexpensive and lasts forever! A little goes a very long way.
I'm very impressed with this ponds moisturizer. I've been using this for 2 weeks now and i love it. My skin is not oily nor dry and it works great on my skin. I love the smell and the way it leaves my skin so smooth and the price is very adorable.
This is an old stand by in my beauty routine. I buy it for my husband now because I was dealing with some medication related skin issues but I can always trust and rely on ponds to not irritate my skin and to leave it feeling better and not dry.
Are you use this in the winter when my face is dry from the winter air it's so easy to use you wipe it all down then clean it off with a washcloth and hot water gets my make up off very easily
"It's one of the only lotions I am able to use on my face. It makes it feel so soft, it doesn't burn, and it is the only lotion that does not cause me ance. I recommend. Plus I love the light scent of it."
I'm very picky about what I put on my skin because it's dry and sensitive. Ponds is what generations of women before us used and there's a reason they're still around. Their products are amazing. This is hydrating and it doesn't break my skin out.
This will moisturize your skin immediately after applying. I tend to get dry skin because I was my face so frequently because I work out that someday my skin is more dry than others.
Kind of heavy but does its job. Skin feels VERY hydrated and soft the next day. I usually put it on at night and would blend it with tea tree oil and it works wonders for my acne. If it didn't feel so heavy I would use it during the day too.
"these keep my skin very clear and clean. I love these for before school. They remove any dirt and oil on my face. They are so nice and quick to use. They also really exfoliate well too! Perfect for oily skin, maybe sting if you have dry skin."
I like this alot but it is really greasy so it does make your face look shiny if you wear too much it might just be me but after using it for a while my eye started itching I might be allergic to it but yeah
"Cheap and efficient night cream. One of my favorites that I started using after my grandma told me about it. Good on sensitive skin, and always makes my skin feel clean and moisturized. I would definitely recommend it to others."
"This Is a great cream, the only downfall is that it can be very greasy feeling on your face and on your hands after putting on it on. I would make sure that your skin is very dry before using this cream."
I love this dry skin cream! I have very dry skin especially in the winter. This cream prevents dark spots from dry skin on my face. This product has been a life saver.
Ponds is a cheap brand but it always does the job. Use it every night after a good face wash and it keeps your skin hydrated and happy! I recommend it always and would use it always! Sometimes you don't need the crazy expensive stuff!
I have very dry (sometimes painful) skin and just after one use I could feel an amazing difference. The packaging is nice and neat. It was very gentle on my skin. I would 100% recommend this to everyone.
"I love it because it helps my dry skin become so much better, but it does make it really really greasy after and my face is greasy all the time, but much more with it on."
This bottle is seriously never-ending! It only takes a small amount and my face is super hydrated and happy. This is definitely my favorite drug-store moisturizer!!
This product is really nice. I only use it in the winter because in the summer I like to use hydrating oils because they are lighter on my skin. This is a very thick moisturizer so in the winter I need that more.
This works wonders! The only thing is that a LITTLE goes a long ways! I would suggest using it at night because it is shiny unless you have time in the morning for it to completely dry!
This skin cream always works great for me. It goes on light and doesn't leave a greasy feeling everywhere. I get bad dry spots on my face and within 3 days of using this they all cleared up!
The cream for me was super greasy. When I put it on my skin the cream seemed to heavy and oily. Used a few times to see any difference. No difference when used at different times. Maybe can work for someone else.
Its hard for me to find a cream for my face this one is okay it hydrates my dry skin. The packaging is okay. The price is good and you can get it at most drug stores.
"My skin gets very dry in the winter , ponds comes neatly packaged easy to open and close the lid very gentle and smooth to put on good value not pricey at all ! No need for improvement already one of the best products!"
"Over many many years of experimenting with other face creams and expensive lotions, I always return to good, old Pond's dry skin cream. My face loves it, it has never caused an allergic reaction, and it feels rich and smooth on my face."
When looking for an affordable drugstore lotion I think this one is great for dry skin it really hydrates the skin and doesnt feel sticky on the face and it doesnt smell bad
"My face ever need moisturizer, Ponds face cream do the work."
"Amazing lotion it's creamy and u don't even need a lot to put on your face just a dab, so it last for a long time. It works really well and I also use it for my hair"
Great
Love it smells good too
5 Stars
"I subscribe to a monthly skin care box and have tried various high end moisturizers. Ponds continuously wins over the high end products for my dry sensitive skin. Ponds does not irritate, does not cause redness, does not leave my skin feeling tight and itchy. I love Ponds and have been an active Ponds customer for over 6 years."
"I have used this for years and recently my husband started using it as well. When using this, I never have a problem with dry skin. Knowing how well POND'S works, it's one less part of my skincare routine that I have to worry about. I would definitely recommend."
"My mother is 95 and used ponds her whole life. She looks seventy! She has been telling me for years to use ponds but I never did. At 54 I started getting the crepe papery look on my neck. I tried multiple beauty creams and none seem to help. Mom kept telling me to try ponds. I gave in and gave it a shot....my skin looks great now. Crepe paper skin is gone! Been using ponds each morning and night and will continue to do so! I guess the saying... ""Mom knows best"" is true. Thanks Mom!"
I started using this product when i moved to a place with dry climate about a year ago. It surprisingly very soothing and i didn't get any acne or blemishes which i would normally get while using winter creams. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a well moisturised soft skin.
"I tired tons of face creams to help my skin get into the winter weather, expensive ones from the mall and online. And ponds is the Best. My Grandmother used ponds and her skin was fawless at 85. So I went back to the basic and my skin has never look better."
I absolutely love this product. In the last 2 years I have been through many many products trying to find something suitable for my skin. I just turned 40 and my only complaint is that I didn't find this sooner. Not only does it hydrate my skin but it has also faded my blemishes. Thank you Ponds so so very much.
It does exactly what you claim. Immediate and lasting effect on skin. Yet gentle on the skin with no adverse effects. Tried other brands through the years ( am now 55 yrs old) and nothing truly compares. Began using Pond's dry skin cream when as an avid long distance cyclist in the micro climates of the SF Bay Area one needs protection from the cold wind and the hot weather all in the same day.
"I have to say that this is one of the best moisturizing creams that I have found. I friend introduced me to it because my face is very sensitive to moisturizers. This one did not clog my pores or cause any acne on my face. I can use it twice a day, and I love the way it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It has helped rejuvenate my skin in many ways. I will use this until I am very old! It is wonderful, and I hope that there will be more Pond's products that surface over time."
"I started using this cream a month ago and am now kicking myself for not having tried it sooner. I'm 25 and have had extremely dry flakey skin for years that no matter what I used would not get softer without causing massive breakouts. After one month of using Ponds Dry Skin Cream morning and night my skin is now glowing, soft, and silky smooth. I've also noticed a lot of redness has been reduced."
"I've used many moisturizing products over the years, both expensive and drugstore brand. I started having problems with dry skin on my face over the winter, and none of my old standbys helped. I decided to try Pond's Dry Skin Cream, and I'm a believer. My skin is no longer dry. It's soft, and friends have told me my skin looks great. My makeup goes on more smoothly. This is a fabulous product. I'll never use anything else."
Best cream for your skin. I use this after exfoliating and it makes my skin feel wonderful
Makes my skin feel hydrated and smoother. Probably the best dry skin cream I've ever used.
Love this cream. I put it on at night and it makes my skin soft and younger looking.
"It just a little bit greasy. But, it is good though!"
This is a great and reasonably priced moisturizer. Good for normal to dry skin
"Great lotion, not runny, not thick. Hypoallergenic. Smooth and soft, noncomedogenic."
moisturizers amazingly well. i apply right after showering
Swear by this stuff...use it daily. Never leaves me feeling oily or gross. Goes on easily and feels amazing.
"My skin used to be so dry, but when I started using this cream everything change. Now my skin is so hydrated"
This is an amazing very creamy and thick moisturizing cream. Great for severely chapped skin or dry feet.
Goodbfor dry skin bit makes it feel really oily n i don't likrvyhat the spit corrected soaks into the skin better moisturizer then this
I use this in winter time because I have very hard time keep moist in my skin especially on my face everyday I will use it
I use this cream before going to sleep and after taking a shower every day and I just love the smell and how it works
"I only use this product at night and when my skin feels extra dry! Other than that, it can be too oily feeling when used during the day"
Soooooo cheap my god. I love this cream. Really good for dry skin like me. Feel good on the skin. Again so cheap and you get a lot too.
This is more like body lotion. I wouldn't use it for my face because it might clog pores but the pink one they have is amazing.
I had a really bad wind burn and I used this for 2 days and my face healed up completely. Now I use it everyday and it last me a year.
love this product cold cream for taking off my makeup in night. i used it when i did stage makeup class in college
Keeps my face moisturize all day! I'm all about saving. So it's very affordable! Helps make your makeup smooth
I loved the selection that this company has. The hydration of this product was amazing and I really enjoyed using it!
Amazing mosterizer big jar at a great price and definitely works for my skin type I would 100% recommend this to my friends and family
"This product is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. It has just enough hydration to us under makeup or at night"
"I like it a lot, I just wish it didn't make me so oily. But that's the only down side. Kinda comes with using products for dry skin"
"I think is very cheap, it is a very good moisturizing cream, i think is a good option when you normal night cream is over."
Its not too oily which is my problem. I think it does a good job of hydrating but it soaks into thr skin really fast which isn't always a good thing
"It smells pretty clean, and it's a pretty decent moisturizer. It's not my absolute favorite, but it does the job, and for a good price as well."
This night cream smells so good and sinks into my skin quickly. I wake up the next day and my skin is smoothand glowing
This is one of the best cream for dry skin and im using this product and loving them already and would definitely recommend this product
The product makes the skin look beautiful and smooth in addition it smells great and a little amount of the product goes a long way.
"Ponds my all time favorite product from childhood.Me and my mother, grand mother also used this cream."
I love this cream. That's hydrate my face and my eyes area a lot. After makeup I usually put a lot of cream and I really feels the difference.
I love Pond's it leaves my face feeling very smooth and moisturized. Plus it smells really good. It's not too costly either!
"I bought this because it said it wouldn't clog pores. But now I see the SECOND ingredient is mineral oil, which is comedogenic. Disappointing."
Ponds is the king of all skin creams. Ponds have been a recommendation of mines for a very long time. I love this product.
It definitely did it's job of not making my skin feel so dry. It moisturized so well and had my skin looking flawless!
"Love this cream,works like a charm. Only need a dime size ammount. Normally use it to remove makeup off my face! Or after I get out of the shower."
Favorite moisturizer! Recommend for anybody who needs a primer for dry skin. Works really great and helps improve skin!
I use this every time I shower or wash my face. It's really moisturizing specially during winter/dry season
"I did not really like this product that much. It was a nice moisturizer, but it made my skin too oily."
I love the texture that leaves on my skin I use them to treat my skin before sleep and I love buying it again.
This is perfect for dry skin. Made the tiny flakes I have go away. Perfect product and easy to travel with
Ponds skin cream is a classic everyday must have. My grandmother used this for years and I enjoy it now. I highly recommend this product.
"Great for the price also great for dry skin. Nice smell. After couole uses, skin feels and looks great!"
"Pond's are really gentle and too soft,uou can see the difference after using pond's directly it's really effective"
Love love this product for ur skin. It helps with dryness. Smells good. I would recommend this for anyone
"I have used this Ponds face cream since I can remember. My Grandmother used it, and the great scent reminds me of her."
Love how it makes my face feel! Finally soft and not dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always used this face lotion. It it the best and I would never use another. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My grandmother used this and I do today! I'm retired and need reasonably priced beauty products; used Clinique for yrs., for past 8 yrs. used Pond's Dry Skin. In the a.m. your face still feels soft after sleeping. Use it twice a day, a.m. & p.m."
I have used Pond's Dry Skin Cream for over for over 40 years and love the way it brightens my skin. I like using under my eyes to get rid of dark circles. Keeps my skin soft and makes me look younger.
I just went out today & bought this ponds dry skin moisturizer & the ponds cold daily skin wash thing.. and after one use my skin was SO SMOOTH & SOFT. I'm so happy with the results so far. Can't wait to see how much better my skin gets.
"I always had dry and acne prone skin, a friend recommended to me this product and I fell in love. I use it generously morning and night and no longer have a need for any foundation. Made my skin smooth and incredibly clear."
"I don't know why I haven't tried this sooner! I have dry skin but after using this my skin feels so soft, smooth, and hydrated with no blackheads or breakouts. I can't recommend this enough. People have been telling me my skin looks great."
"PONDS IS MY BEST FRIEND. I'VE TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS, UNLESS PROVEN DIFFERENT I CAN'T GO WRONG FOR USING PONDS PRODUCT. I ALWAYS GET COMPLEMENTS ON MY. (PIC WILL NOT UPLOAD)"
"It is much better than other products. I tried many other facial products, but this one really impressive me. It works really good, and made my skin more soft. Like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this just started using it, works great. I have used lots of moisturizers and they either made my face too oily or break out. Ponds gives me just enough moisture without making my face oily."
"Pond's Caring Classic Dry Skin Cream is good and moisturizes well. It quite good for the price. But, I do not like the smell. It's not a bad smell by any means, just not for me. I would recommend trying it if you are hooked on a more expensive cream."
"I bought this cream once I realized that the Nivea cream I once own didn't do the job for my skin. I was a little bit sceptic at first cause I've never heard of this product, but the results were pretty good. However, I think this cream should be used on skin in a weekly routine and not daily. Especially for dry skin, because it gives a lot of moisture."
"This is the very first moisturizer I've used that did not make my skin irritated, red, or full out blister with hives! It's soothing and has never given me acne either! My whole body is extremely sensitive to anything it come in contact with and this has been a huge relief! I use it for my whole body. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Pond's dry skin crem since I was in my teens , I'm 80 years old, my mother used it before me, that is the onoy cream we have ever used. No makeup and I was told I look 10 years older. No age spots or not too mANY WRINKLES. aLL BECAUSE OF PONDS."
"Once I'm done with my nighttime cleansing routine, I use the Pond's Dry Skin Cream moisturizer all over my face & neck area. Instantly it hydrates my skin and feels so good going on. You don't need much of the product. It's not overly oily or sticky. I love it!!!"
I used POND's Dry Skin Cream as a moisturizer to help my face. My face gets really dry and my mother told me about the brand POND's so I started using it. I used for awhile but I thought it was a little greasy to me and made my face look really shiny. I want using much but still my face looked shiny but it did help with my dry skin. Also it didnt irritate my skin so that was a plus. I would buy again and I would recommend.
"I take this to travel but Ive stopped using this under my makeup. It makes my skin too oily but If I go out makeup less, this keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day. Its cute and compact and I went through a few of these so I will definitely buy more in the future."
I love this product so much. I have very dry skin and I apply this after I wash my face at night! And I wake up with smooth skin. Doesn't make it feel too oily either. I also like to put it on before I apply my makeup! It makes it go on smooth! Love love love this product!
"This moisture works pretty good, it is just very heavy on my face. It causes my skin to be oily so I can't use it in the day before doing my makeup. If I have a dry spot on my face, it's perfect for that. I would recommend it because it is a good price for a heavy cream if you have dryness."
"i've used ponds creams for about 30 yrs,not including my moms,this is the only product my mom would use.and i've loved it,now i'm 47,and my mom 66, i still use these products,i also use the cleanser,dark spot,rejuveness .it is the only product i trust.no matter which one you use your face will feel moisturized.the only reason i picked recommended by friend,cause i had to pick one."
"Absolutely perfect. Formula is thick, but not to where you feel oily and sticky. I have normal to dry skin and it has prevented the dry skin around my nose from flaking and peeling. It also makes my skin look shiny and dewy without looking oily or too wet. Even if you use this product every day, you will not run out for a while because there is so much!"
"I've tried pretty much everything. Neutrogena, Clean & Clear, etc.. I will never use another face cream again! I have combination and sensitive skin, and I absolutely love this. It has a pleasant smell, thick consistency, and you get a ton of product for your buck! As a teenager, I need to keep my skin moisturized and youthful. Thank you for this amazing product!"
"I've been using this product since my junior years in middle school. I have had dry skin for as long as I can remember; this product was recommended by my mom and grandma who have also sworn by it for years. This is my all time fav moisturizer at nights to remove makeup, as moisturizer during the winters, and as a refresher in the mornings year round. I wouldn't recommend to people with oily skin as it is very hydrating."
"I bought this cream for the first time today. My skin became extremely dry and sensitive after becoming pregnant with my second baby. Nothing was working, I was desperate! I tried so many products to releive the flaky, tight, and rough texture of my skin. Today is the first day in months where my skin doesn't feel or look dry. No more tightness, no more flaky patches!!! I am so happy with this product!!"
"I purchased this product to use on my face in the winter. It worked well. Once I got pregnant, I needed something to use on my very itchy belly. THIS PRODUCT WORKED WONDERS!!!! This is the best belly moisturizer I have found and I tried everything. I apply in the morning and night and my belly doesn't itch at all...."
I PURCHASE THIS FOR MY 92 YEAR OLD MOM WHO HAS COME TO LIVE WITH ME FOR THE PAST YEAR. I REMEMBER HER USING THIS WHEN I WAS LITTLE. SHE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 70 YEARS NOW AND SHE DOES'NT LOOK A DAY OVER 70. I THINK SHE HAS DISCOVERED THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH IN THIS CREAM. SHE COULD DO A COMMERCIAL FOR PONDS AND ALL OF THE PROOF WOULDS SHINE THROUGH IN HER YOUTH LOOKING SKIN. SHE SWEARS BY PONDS.
"This cream is wonderful - my mother used it and as my skin has got drier I have been using it. The results are as good, if not better, than much more expensive creams. It manages to be both incredibly light and deeply moisturising and feels lovely on my skin. Frankly, I'd pay a lot more for it."
"How did I not purchase this before?!?! I have extremely dry skin year round to the point where my skin is always flakey. No other facial lotion had help as much as this one has. It is just as good, if not better, than the clinique dramatically different cream, and A LOT more affordable. This has been keeping my skin hydrated without making it look oily throughout the day. It has definitely become my holy grail."
"Great product with an even better price. Wonderful for very dry winter skin, feels thick and greasy at first but when rubbed into skin it leaves your skin feeling soft and clean! Have never used a better moisturizer for this price. Keeping this one around! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For the past 5 years I subscribed and tried many commercial skin moisturizers over the price of 15+. Neutrogena, Aveeno, Olay, etc, but none has kept my skin truly moisturized long enough. It does leave a slight sheen after 5 hours-ish on my skin which can be dabbed off by a tissue, but maintains great moisture. I highly recommend this product."
I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and I can see a major difference in my face. Feels amazingly smooth at night after I shower and when I wake up I apply more. I hardly used any facial moisturizers until now. I absolutely love it and I will never go back. Now I am 20 years old with hypothyroidism going on 8 years and I have very bad dry skin everywhere. I can now wear foundation without irritation. Thanks POND'S!!! :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very picky and this is perfect for me. I truly hate taking off my makeup because I am a girl and can be lazy but it is so worth it when I am able to put this stuff on after. It makes you feel so clean and cleansed. It has a super smooth feeling and your skin feels so much better in the morning. Perfect to use on sunburnt areas!!! Love Ponds!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer! I use it on my face, arms, & legs so they feel soft and smooth in between seasons when the air (along with my skin) gets dry. I for some odd reason love the fresh baby powder smell of this product, for I know others don't find it pleasant. It's nice and light and very easy for me to work with. The only reason why I gave this product 4 stars is because at another big name retailer (where I purchase this product from) has it two dollars cheaper...."
would not leave with out taking it with me. Makes my skin soft and cuddley.
This product makes clear results within weeks makes the skin soft and smooth
Wow! works great and is affordable. A little goes a long way too!
This product does moisture the skin but leaves a weird feeling to it. It's on the thicker side
I love this face moisturizer this is the only thing I use
This cream will literally last a lifetime. My friend introduced me to it and it's amazing!
Perfect moisturizer! Can be used year round and doesn't leave skin feeling heavy and greasy.
Product does the job and makes my skin feel great. I have used better products though
"This is great for my dry, sensitive skin. Great price and not too greasy. I would highly recommend!"
Always use this every single day in the morning and my skin tells hydrate. So good for every day
I liked this because it's very hydrating. It's a very thick cream but does sink fast.
For the price you can't beat the amazing results. I reach for this product every time.
"This is not the best moisturisor because even though it is for dry skin, it is a little too oily"
"I have rosasea and love the smell, great for my dry feet too and love the smell."
Has made my skin look years younger.
I use this product very often and its very effective. Thanks Ponds.
I have used this cream for many years is very good
"It moisturizes, and makes my skin feel soft and youthful. This is my routine after I use the cold cream cleanser. My skin is blemish free."
I have used Ponds cream for over 30 yrs. I wouldn't use anything else. I have tried the more expensive creams but always go back to Ponds Cream. I use it every time I wash my face and before putting on foundation.
I use this cream on my clients face who has dry skin before I apply their makeup. It works really good and does not leave their face greas. Its lightweight and smells great
"This is the cream that was always in my house growing up. Takes the make-up off and hydrated but definitely greasy. However, I have not broken out because of it."
I'm so glad I made this investment. It really works for me. At one point I thought something was wrong with me when my skin was so dry (round eyebrows and nose).
"it honestly clogged my pores and made my skin appear very oily. I would not recommend this product unless you have severely dry skin. My skin ranges from dry to normal. Try another brand, don't waste your money!"
"I enjoy using this product for my fry skin. It smells powdery, like a baby product almost, but I like it! This product has lasted me a long time and I feel it was a good price!"
"Just bought this moisturizer. My face is a dried out mess from the summer heat. So far Im liking it. It spreads easily, not heavy or greasy. The smell kind of reminds me of a baby."
"This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way and this product is filled to the lid, it will last forever. It's not too greasy and keeps your skin feeling very soft and moisturized."
My grandmothers secret weapon to young and flawless looking skin! This product has been around for as long as I can remember. The value of it is good for your money and it leaves my skin looks young and healthy!
This is a great little product for getting off the day or even makeup! I only had a sample size but I would purchase this for sure! It isnt at all heavey or oily
This moisturizer is great!! It never left me feeling so oily which is so important! It's a great value for the prices as there's lots of product! Has a great gentle scent. This really got rid of my dry skin! Highly recommend
"I've been using this cream since I was a little girl! My mom used it all the time. It's really moisturising and leaves my skin feeling super soft! It does help with my dry patches, super affordable which I love!"
The very first use of Pond's dry skin cream instantly relieved my dry burning face after using harsh cleaners that are not Pond's brand. He healed without a heavy coating. It's very light and comfortable.
"The ponds cream for dry skin , has helped me since the day I noticed nothing I got really locked the moisture in ; this cream does not leave my skin oily but never dry I love it I will use this for life !"
I'm 15 and have really dry skin. I've tried about every single product under the sun and nothing works as well as Pond's! I recommend this for everyone! It has a nice light scent to it and really gets the job done.
When reading this ad it brought out exactly what if I'd like to see. What happens with the cream and how to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really hoped that this would do the trick with my dry skin. I have used it for about two weeks hoping it would get better but it makes my face extremely greasy! It feels like there is a layer sitting on top of my skin!
Ponds is amazing! I have acne-prone skin that tends to be dry in some areas. This is the only moisturizer I've found that can effectively rid of dryness without breaking me out! Only complaint is I wish Pond's sold a moisturizer with SPF.
"This brand has been consistently producing a great product for decades. The same product my Mom used will always be my ""go to"" lotion and cold cream. The price is way below the expensive creams on the market while having the same or better results."
I love Pond's and this moisturizer its amazing! It's a little greasy but the best moisturizer ever!!! I use it every night along with other Pond's products!
This was recommended by someone I follow on YouTube and it's the best face cream I've used. It's very good for dry skin like mine. It is also very good if you wear makeup regularly.
"I've been using this since I was a teenager. When I get asked my age people are shocked! It's proven great against premature aging. And, trust me, I've tried many other more expensive brands and they all fail. I love you, Pond's! Love!"
"I have an extremely dry patch of skin next to my nose, so I decided to try this. I dont know why I let myself buy this. The second ingredient on the jar is mineral oil. Mineral oil and petrolatum glycerin both block pores. I have been using this product for three days and I'm getting painful acne all over my face; However, my dry patch is healing. I am going to use this as a body cream rather than facial cream now on."
I never have had a problem with any facial creme but the Pond's Dry Skin cream seems to have triggered a very bad response on my skin. I cant use the two jars that I bought due to a severe itching and slight rash. It might be that some ingredient in it just disagrees with me but I would check the label before purchase if you know of any allergic reaction. It has a very nice appearance and fresh fragrance but cant be used by me. I may call Walmart and see if they will accept a return.
"I am really disapointed in this brand and thought I could trust it. I have been using this product, nightly, for the past 5 months and it has given me the worst acne of my life! It has destroyed my skin and given me so many scars, I am so embarassed by the way I look now."
"You know, my grandmother used this when I was a young girl. Now I use it. It is a simple old classic, that has been around for over 100 yrs for a reason. It just works. No long list of ingredients, no harsh ingredients,not expensive, I just love this stuff. Have the cold cream, green lid, and moisturizer blue lid. Makes my face look so moisturized, soft, smooth. Highly recommend."
"I use this specific product for my face as well as my whole body, especially my hands."
"It's very creamy and it's good but I like more the matte cream for my skin, by the way, the smells is so good"
"Keeps smooth very smooth and hydrated for people with dry skin. After usage skin feels cool, there is no irritation when used"
my mom used pond's dry skin cream for years. She died at age 100 but looked like she was in her 70's
It really works! I use the Rejuveness and it plumps up everything and beautiful dewy finish. And the price it right! Thanks Ponds!!!
This is the only product i always come back to because it never does me wrong. It is sooooo moisturizing & Keeps my dry skin from flaking all day
I LOVE ponds! Will always trust it on my sensitive skin. Works amazing and no strong smell. Doesn't leave your face greasy
A little goes a very long way. My skin felt so soft and hydrated. It did not clog up my pores and didn't make my oily spots any more oily
"I LOVE this face lotion! I love the smell, the way it makes my skin feel, the price, the packaging. Everything. Love love love"
I have very dry sensitive skin and am always looking for a product that gets me moisturizer feeling... best!
"A little but goes a long way with this product. But, i find that it is a little thick and leaves my skinny feeling slightly greasy."
Moisturizes very well. I have extremely dry skin due to certain products for my face so I love putting this on after a long day
"I have used this product for at least 20 yrs, I have sensitive skin, it is a great moisturizer face and body, always soothing, my luxury!"
Have been using Pond's Dry Skin Cream for many years after cleaning face and before make-up application. It's the best.
I love it ! And my face is really smooth and my cheeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great lotion for dry skin or any skin in need of moisture. When I apply it at night, it leaves my skin very supple and soft in the morning."
I have dry skin and my face stays moisturized all day !! I have been using this since I was small and honestly I still love it !
"I'm really excited about this cream. In the winter my skin is so dry, especially my face and this cream makes my face feel like silk."
Great product by ponds. Works very good on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the way my face feels when I use it on my face everyday [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have used this for years to remove makeup and as my sole moisturizer. This is the best price I have ever found both in stores and online.
I just wanna know if i can use this cream under my make-up? Can i apply it on my skin and after a couple of min can a make-up??
Excellent product and value. My skin was dry that it used to flake off. Within 4 days of using my skin feels and looks great!
"excelente, quality and price, simply is like a miracle."
"this is a good product, i suffer from dry skin and i have used better products"
I love how soft and soothing this feels on my skin! Especially after a weekly exfoliating regimine.
It does the job without having to pay a great deal for it
I like the product and Walmart service.
i use to us pond's years ago. I just started back using it. I use it with Aloe vera cream.
Got thus in the winter beauty box and loved it! Especially in these cold winter months.
Top of the line no doubt! a must have item! always! generation to generation.
Affordable and great facial skin lotion. Smells good too. Highly recommended!
"Grandmother, mother, sisters, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, nieces...we've all used it for years."
I use this product for makeup removal. Love it for that.
"Even though I have dry skin, I feel it is too heavy on my face and blocks my skin's breath. I won't buy it anymore."
Excellent
"For me, this is a miracle in a jar!!! I am in love with this product and want to try them all!"
amazing its oily like most moisturizers definitely recommend
Thanks ponds it's been working on my skin every time I use it
