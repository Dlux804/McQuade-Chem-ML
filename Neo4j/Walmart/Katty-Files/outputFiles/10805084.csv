I like this moisturizer because it is light and does not irritate my skin. The weather has been cold and dry and my face has not dried out because I am using this product.
This is my 2nd time purchasing this. It makes my skin so soft and moisturized all day. I use this every morning and night and it's great because I have oily skin
I fricking love this product so much! Where has it been all my life? I definitely recommend this to anyone who has oily skin. It definitely clears it up so quickly and the oily part is gone instantly. Neutrogena should sponsor me. I love their products loads
"I took a quiz on my skin type about three weeks ago and this was one of the recommended products. I have a very, very dry nose but oily everywhere else; I use this product all over my face after I cleanse (morning and night). I recommended this product if you have combination skin due to the fact that it doesn't make oily skin even more oily."
It is a great moisturizer and leaves my skin shining and my face feels smooth and radiant all day
"Before finding this product, I had no success with face moisturizers. I have an oily skin and this does the magic of keep my face fresh, light, and moist."
"I bought this proud icy a few weeks ago, and I really like it! It's great for sensitive skin like mine, and leaves face feeling like a cloud. Iran light and absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky feel."
"About a month ago, I decided to buy/test Neutrogena, and I was sceptical because I have tried proactiv, clean and clear, etc. I must say, I'm happy with the results so far. The results took less time to show."
I'm very pleased with the product. Just what I was looking for. My face it's a combination of dry and oily so I apply it all over my face and it does the job.
"I have very oily skin, however, I needed some type of lotion to put on my face without adding a shine. Thanks to oil free moisture, I discovered the perfect solution to that problem. I am very satisfied with Neutrogena's oil free moisture."
I bought this a few weeks ago & I love it. Would definitely recommend for oily skin. I use it before I go to bed & in the mornings before I apply makeup.
"This product has helped my skin in just a matter of days and I'm so thankful! My skin is now clear and feels so clean, I will use this product again and again."
I have used this product for quite a while. This is just the first time I have gotten it on your site instead of buying locally. I think it is a really good product.
I started with Neutrogena Sensitive skin face lotion over 40 years ago. I have to admit that I don't limit it to my face. I only use Neutrogena make up remover face wipes to clean my face and neck. I will be 66 soon and I am often mistaken for my 45 year old daughter's sister. Thank you Neutrogena!
"I have used this as my daily light moisturizer for several years and highly recommend it, particularly in warmer weather. I hope to find a Neutrogena product that works this well on my very sensitive skin that is a bit more hydrating without being so heavy it breaks me out."
I've being using this product for about 3 years and my face feels great. I was and am lucky for finding this excellent product.
I am rather please with this product and the others I bought with it (bath wash and body oil). A good purchase!
"I bought this a month ago, my adult acne is persistent. It is slightly better, however, very slightly... sadly, I'm at a loss on what to try next..."
I got this about 2 weeks ago and I love how light weight it is. Soaks right in and doesn't leave face feeling greasy
This moisturizer is just the thing for sensitive skin. The oil free formula is light and feels great on my skin.
I have been buying this moisturizer for years. I love how it feels on my skin without any overpowering fragrances or colors. Always seems to have the right Ph balance so my face doesn't feel dry or oily.
This product is very light on the skin but I did find something that wasn't pleasing. As I finish putting the product on my face I could help but feel that my face felt greasy. I decide to wait a couple of minutes to let my skin soak it up. But it still felt greasy. I was a little disappointed. It might just be my skin.
"I have been using this product for 25+ years and am so thankful I found it! I am 52 years old, and most people think I have had ""work"" done...I haven't! I always wash my face in the morning and evening with Neutrogena Daily Wash and follow with this daily moisturizer. I have very few wrinkles, and am often mistaken for being much younger. I have tried more expensive products in the past, but always come back. It's not oily, and I love having the sunscreen built in."
The only cream that doesn't burn my skin when applying . I had a chemical burn on my face many years ago and now my skin is extremely sensitive. I can't wear makeup at all and can only use Dove for sensitive skin to wash with. This and Neutrogena hand cream - Norwegian formula (I use this when my face is extremely dry) r the only 2 creams that don't burn my face when applying.
Like the lotion for lightness & protection from dryness in this high desert.
Very happy with this. Just wish it came in a bigger size
I purchased the product about 3 weeks ago Excellent Try it will not disipoint.
My daughter uses this and loves this product. Makes her skin so soft and healthy looking!
I loved it it's worked for me and I have oily skin it worked me it will for you trust me
I am 78 yrs. old and have very dry skin. I hope to never be with out this product.
I brought this one week ago and it work really good for my sensitive skin
"This is a wonderfully light, fast absorbing moisturizer with no fragrance. Perfect for sensitive, combination skin."
"Best moisturizer I have ever used, but has paraben please take out this ingredient"
"I am a male with particular needs for face hydration without an oily effect. This product does a great job for the price. I like a similar product by DDF, but it cost 5 times as much."
"i have been using the Neutrogena moisturizer with spf 15 in it for a few years, and have really liked it...lately I've notice it makes me a little oily so i have switched to this one for sensitive. I read the reviews on it and says it really helps oily skin..I'm not to impressed??? It still makes me oily, so i think i will go back to the green bottle cuz at least it has spf in it!"
"I so looked forward to trying this after Dr. Dray recommended it. I applied it to damp skin after using Cetaphil to cleanse. I have used Cetaphil for 30 years. This caused red streaks like a sunburn on my skin, and my eyes were swelling, stinging, and watering. What is in this product that's formulated for sensitive skin that would do this? What a waste of money."
I've been using this product for over 20 years because it delivers. I use 2x a day once I. m and the. At night. The product is non greasy and I use the sunscreen version to block harsh sun rays. By using daily I have kept wrinkles and skin damage at a minimum. I highly recommend. Thanks product works and is easy on the budget
I just bought this moisturizer a week ago after trying everything on the shelf & I could not be more satisfied! I can already tell a HUGE difference. I've always had really dry sensitive skin & this is the only thing that keeps it soft and clear! I definitely recommend if you have similar skin issues!
I got this moisturizer as a Christmas gift this year and I have been using it ever since! It makes my skin feel so soft. I put it on my face every night after cleaning it. I highly recommend this product.
I only used this for a few days and had to stop due to my skin breaking out. I read the ingredient list. It has Petrolatum in it. This is a very pore clogging ingredient.
"I have been using this product for years, it was first recommended to me by my dermatologist. I don't even accept face moisturizers as gifts anymore (I give them away) because this is the only moisturizer I will use on my face. I am very acne prone, and this is my moisturizer. Amazing product"
"So this product worked really well for me. I have sensitive acne prone skin and most other moisturizers that I would use would cause me to break out or exacerabte any bumps that were pre-existing on my face, however this one did not. Best if used directly after face is washed/dried. I must say that I did need to use more than one pump of this but other than that it's a good product."
"This moisturizer claims to be non-comedogenic, however it contains Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Isopropyl Isosterate, and Cetyl Alcohol. ALL of which are known comedogenics and are known to clog your pores. Dealing with acne prone skin is a constant uphill battle as it is, the last thing I need is to be spending my money on products thinking they will be healthy for my skin when in reality they are horrible for it. Very disappointed in Neutrogena and the blatant false advertising of their products."
"I've been using this moisturizer for years. This was recommended to me by my Dermatologist years ago. It works well. Very lightweight. I've had no stinging and any type of negative reactions. When I use it, I only use it in the daytime under makeup. I use something heavier as my night cream. Sometimes I wish it were a little heavier, or had more vitamin or sunscreen benefits, however I do realize that those extra things may deter from it being for sensitive or oily skin. I would definitely recommend this!"
"This product definitely gives me acne. I have tried washing my face without using this moisturizer and have no issues. The three times I've put this stuff on, I have consistently awoken to small pimples, especially on my forehead and around my eyes. It does moisturize, but it's not worth the repercussions for me."
"During the winter months ( in Minnesota) I have still experience driness after application.... The one remedy I found was running a slice/chunk of cucumber over my race's skin surface,wait 5 minutes then remove cucumbers residue with face wipe with witchhazel... Let dry for a few seconds then apply 3 pumps of the moisturizer letting the excess absorb within a few moments."
"Ive used this moisturizer for about 4 years after going to tge dermatologist and she recommended this. This doesnt make me break out at all, however i do only like this sensitive skin oil free one. Tried the one with sunscreen and the sunscreen irritated my eyes very bad."
"I purchased this product looking for an alternative to a higher end designer moisturizer that I usually purchase cosmetics from. The ingredients, quality & overall benefit have been very comparable if not exact. Price was the difference, what a value and a substantial amount less that what I normally purchase. I'm a complete convert. Have started purchasing other Neutrogena products as needed."
"I have been having issues with dry skin, especially during the winter months; thankfully, I found a product that really works, for great moisture and soft skin. I have been using this product for roughly over a month. Neutrogena's oil-free moisture-skin is a great product to get rid of dry skin and increase facial moisture."
"I have been using this product for nearly 9 years and this has been the only moisturizer that doesn't feel like it's burning my (extremely) sensitive skin. I can't recommend it enough. After application, my skin feels soft and refreshed, but I don't get any feeling of lasting residue of lotion afterwards. It is absolutely perfect."
I love this product. I love how it actually moisturizes. It soaks in nicely rather than leaving a greasy film on top of my skin. It hits the dry skin. It feels like my face is soaking up the moisture like a sponge. I tried the combination skin and it was not even close. Please don't change the formula!
"I bought this product a couple days ago. I have sensitive skin, but Neutrogena oil-free foundation did not irritate my skin, so I thought this product would be great as well. However, my skin got red just after I used this product, and next day I found some breakouts. I immediately stopped using it."
"I bought this moisturizer and the first day I used if my skin broke out into a really bad rash, I was unsure it was the moisturizer until I did a test patch. Instantly my face got red, swollen, bumpy and it burned. I do not have sensitive skin and I have never had a problem with any facial products before, I love Neutrogena products but this one I unfortunately do not recommend from my experience."
"I use this moisturizer year round. I have very sensitive, easily irritated, combination skin that is prone to breakouts. This product never fails me... I can use it under my eyes as well without any problems. No need to spend the extra $ for eye cream! I like that I can use this product for both uses!"
"I bought this product after trying proactive and it worked wonders compared to proactive. I used it just before i put makeup on and it never clumped my make up or made my face look weird. It actually made my face look really smooth. I also have oily skin so this was nice because it didn't add to the oil i accumulated over the course of a day. Awesome product, i would recommend it to anyone."
"I have red, sensitive skin that is also extremely dry. I was excited to try this as a lighter option to the hydro water gel (extra dry, the regular formula causes me to breakout). This made my rosacea flare and gave me a rash/bumps all over my cheeks after the first use. Not wanting to give up, I tried it again and the same thing happened. Will be returning.. Definitely not for sensitive skin."
"I've been using this product for almost a year now and it has been fantastic. My skin gets really dry in the winter and this moisturizer is heavy enough to keep my skin from peeling, but light enough to use during the summer when my skin get oily. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with sensitive or oil-prone skin."
"I wanted a regular moisturizer that I could use daily because I hate that tight feeling your face gets when it's dry. I've tried other moisturizers but they burn so much and I tried this one because it said sensitive skin and it didn't burn when I applied it after cleansing. It leaves my skin feeling so nice throughout the day, I recommend it if you're just looking for a daily moisturizer that doesn't take a toll on your skin."
"Have been using this product for at least 18 years, maybe longer and appreciate that it is soft, moisturizing and fragrance free. I have very sensitive skin, especially to perfumes and this is a life saver. Thanks Neutrogena! Please keep making this product!"
"I was currently using a product line I had used for years but they changed their formula and it caused redness, burning and irritation. I had to try something mild to see what would happen, 1, the irritation cleared up, and 2, this kept my skin clear without any irritation. It's difficult, each product can affect us differently For me, it was a life saver."
"I've always steered away from moisturizers because they've always made my combination skin break out. It's always been easier to suffer the dryness than to suffer the breakouts from moisturizers. With this product, I get the best of both worlds. Great product!!!"
"Hands down BEST moisturizer for sensitive skin. I have been using this one for years- every time I try something else (including other Neutrogena moisturizers) my skin freaks out and I come running back to this one. I never break out when using it, and it makes my skin look calm and hydrated and even. I can't imagine not having this in my cabinet. Oh yeah...and no wrinkles or lines exist on my face and I attribute that to this baby. Thanks for taking care of my crazy sensitive skin Neutrogena!!"
I have very sensitive skin. Pretty much everything I use will burn my skin! This moisturizer has been a blessing. Feels so good on my skin. I've never had any issues whatsoever! I also have oily skin and this moisturizer hydrates without making me feel oily. It absorbs quickly so you can apply makeup without waiting. It's everything Neutrogena claims it is! Thanks Neutrogena !!
"This is one of a few moisturizers that have worked great for me. I have a bad problem with breaking out every now and then and was afraid to use other moisturizers in case it clogged up my pores. I found this product listed under the ""non-comedogenic"" and gave it a try. It worked GREAT. I use this after every wash (day and night) in case my skin starts to dry with the facial wash. It has helped so much with moisturizing my skin and not clogging my pores!"
"I have ridiculously sensitive skin and, although other Neutrogena products have caused severe allergic reactions, this is the ONLY moisturizer I've found that hydrates without causing breakouts. Generic products have proven to be a joke--I'm assuming that's because they aren't hypoallergenic. I'll likely use this product forever."
"I've been using this moisturizer for over 15 years. I love it. It is the only moisturizer that doesn't make my face break out and keeps my skin so soft. I can't use anything with even a hint of oil or I break out with pimples, and even a hint of fragrance gives me a rash. I've tried fancy, expensive brands, but this is the only one that treats me right. I've completely given up on all other lotions and potions. This is the only one for me!"
"I always keep this moisturizer on hand. I'm always trying new things, but I always go back to this and use it if my skin reacts and is upset. I have sensitive skin with rosacea on my cheeks, this does not irritate my skin at all and keeps it clear. I highly recommend this!!"
"This product is amazing for my skin. I have really dry skin, i couldnt find anything that would work... I always had to carry a travel bottle with lotion in it just to keep my face hydrated... Since i started using this my skin feels wonderful! I love it, I apply it after my showers and i can go all day with smooth hydrated skin.!!! Bottom line i love this product ..."
Let me start off by saying that I have spent a lot of money on big name skincare brands. They advertise for sensitive skin but those products either felt too heavy or didn't moisturize my skin enough.
"I have dry sensitive skin and this moisturizer is perfect for me. It feels as if I'm applying water to my face, and it absorbs very quickly! My skin feels like it can finally breathe. I cannot recommend this product enough!"
"I used to have bad acne, I switched to this moisturizer about 1-2 years ago and have not used anything else since. It doesn't clog pores which is great to prevent acne. My skin dries out very easily but this cream really works wonders in terms of keeping it moisturized. Its very light so it feels like nothing is there. In addition there is no grease or shine. You can't go wrong with this lotion. Highly recommend!"
"I have struggled with rosacea for a decade and needed to find a moisturizer that my ultra-sensitive skin can tolerate. I saw another glowing recommendation by customer who has rosacea, and so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. With other products I usually break out and experience redness, but this one is gentle and provides much-needed moisture, especially in winter. I use it every day now."
"I do love Neutrogena's cleansers but this moisturizer for sensitive skin was a let down. In the winter I have very dry skin, when I put this on it burns quite a bit. I have used other lotions for sensitive skin and found them to be quite soothing so I was very disappointed when I bought this product. If I wanted the burn I could have found something with SPF at least. Not a great lotion for dry sensitive skin."
I use this product at night right after I have washed my face. My face always feels nourished and moisturized after I use this product instead of oily and sticky like other brands made me feel like. I have extremely sensitive skin and I have never experienced any irritation or breakouts due to this moisturizer
"One of my biggest problems is using lotions and breaking out or if I don't use lotion, my skin gets extremely dry, itchy, and peels. This oil-free lotion for sensitive skin is perfect. It moisturizes without making my skin feel oily or causing breakouts. I will certainly continue to buy this as long as it continues to work and so far, it's definitely doing the trick!"
This product amazes me with its formula. It makes sure my skin doesn't get irritated from anything and it nourishes my skin for the whole day. Before when I tried a similar brand it didn't feel the same. It feels good it works great. I recommend this product to everyone even if they don't have sensitive skin.
I have used this product 1 time and it swelled up my face so bad that I had to seek emergency treatment. I have painful and itchy raised hives all over my face and can no longer see out of my left eye due to swelling. This product is horrible and I would discourage people from using any of their products.
"This moisturizer..... I seriously love it! This is actually the second moisturizer I have tested out in all of my acne days & this works wonderfully!! It really does go deep into my skin to moisturize it. I did try out the combination one but it was alright.. it was just not as moisturizing. Whatever the skin type is, I really think that this moisturizer is the ideal moisturizer for all skin types!"
"Just started using this product and it is great. It did not break my skin out at all, and 99% of products do effect my skin badly. It is a curse having sensitive skin, but this product will now be my new best friend. Left no greasy feel, and did not conflict with make-up application. Skin felt smooth and supple. If you have sensitive and, or oily skin, you should try this product !! You will love it !!"
"I don't really have sensitive skin and I'm not really allergic to anything except latex, but this lotion dried my face out and made it very red and puffy. I've only used it three times and it burned going on, so that should have been my first clue I guess. Very disappointing! And painful!"
"I have combination skin, and get really dry and red around the apples of my cheeks. This lotion did a good job at helping with the dryness and softened those rough patches. BUT, it burned as I was putting it on and also for a while after. Not sure why it would burn if it's meant for sensitive skin. ALSO, my face looked oily/shiny after I put it on, which is what I want to avoid because I can get really oily sometimes. Im going to try it a little longer in hopes that my skin just needs to adjust to it?"
I'm a fifty year old male with rosacea and sensitive skin. I've been using this on my face and neck just over a month and my skin has never looked better! It seems to help even out my skin tone too. I've used far more expensive products but none have worked this well for me. I've always had combination skin and this lotion eliminates the dryness and prevents the oily/shiny areas. I couldn't be happier!
"This lotion is just AWESOME. I not only have sensitive skin, but dry and acne prone skin, as well. This lotion doesn't make me break out, it's not greasy-feeling or gross, and when I started using it, I noticed a difference in like 2 days. It makes my skin very soft and hydrated, even in the middle of winter. This is by far the best face lotion I have ever used. It's worth every penny."
i hate the feeling of cream on my face and avoid it at all cost. I bought this cream on a whim and have fallen in love with it super light weight doesn't leave your skin feeling wet or sticky. and keeps your skin feeling hydrated and soft all day. great for really sensitive skin.
"This makes parts of my skin feel smooth, such as my cheeks, but my forehead and nose are shiny. This is a disappointment because I use this product a lot. I then have to apply more makeup then I would like and this makes my pores clogged and causes breakouts. Overall this is a good product for sensitive skin, but causes shine."
"I have mixed feelings about this product. I have VERY sensitive skin, so I was happy that this specifically said sensitive skin. While it didn't make me break out, it makes my skin VERY red after application, and oddly makes my eyes burn, water, and get very red even though I DON'T PUT IT CLOSE TO MY EYES (so there is NO WAY the lotion got in my eyes). This is a reaction I would expect from a heavily fragranced product. Very strange. I have never had any other moisturizer do anything like this."
"So I used this product for 6 days and ended up with a really bad rash and breakouts. My rash is still there and its been over two weeks. I'm so disappointed in this product, not what I had expected. Don't even bother trying this out, its not worth it."
"I have used a lot of moisturizers, but had never had one burn like this one. Interestingly, when I searched for ""neutrogena moisturizer burns"" I came upon this site and found another person who is having the same problem. I am wondering what is in this product that would cause my skin to burn as if sunburned when I apply it and cause my skin to turn red in places."
Love this moisturizer. I have dry sensitive skin with mild rosacea and it always helps calm it down. I always go back to this even though I love trying new things. Would love it if you came out with a sensitive cream form for winter though! Or a whole dry/sensitive skin line with a day cream with SPF and a nice dry/sensitive night cream! Thanks Neutogena for always making great products!
"I love the oil free sensitive skin moisturizer. I have been using it for about one month, and my skin is soft, clear, and bright. This product won't clog pores or leave any greasy residue behind. However, it is water based, meaning that it may not be the best choice for very dry skin. For people with sensitive skin, it works a little too well. Enjoy!"
"After trying several high-end expensive moisturizers & no relief. I picked this bottle on a whim. And am I ever glad I did! Instantly soothed & calmed my dry, acne prone, sensitive skin. I am using it morning & night after cleansing. Very pleased, I am thinking of also trying the night cream."
"I love this lotion--it can be worn alone or under makeup. What I don't like is the bottle--by the time you get down to the bottom 1/6 or so, it is nearly impossible to get the rest. I leave it upside down, use a cotton swab, etc. I sent an email regarding this, and the response was that the tube could not go to the bottom of the bottle because of air flow. Why not use a longer ""straw"" with a slit carved out of one side? This product is not cheap, so I want to get every drop."
"I first found this product online, searching for a moisterizer for my sensitive, flaky, skin. I found it in an store near me, and purchased it. I put it on that night and woke up, my skin looked amazing! I use it every night! I have to say, it does leave my skin feeling and looking a little greasy, but by how good it leaves my skin, I don't care! I just prefer and think it is better to be used as a night cream."
"i started using moistuizer when i used this... that was the summer before 5th grade. I'm now going into eighth and when so many other people use 2.7 million things on their face, I'm perfectly happy to use just this and my deep clean invigorating scrub in the morning and followed by Neosporin alone or with On-the-spot treatment. i don't think i could live without this. when my face was dry as the Sahara after trying Clearasil ultra, this got it back to normal in a matter of days. don't discontinue this. Ever."
"Tried it. Was great the first day. The second day, my face turned bright red and began peeling. It was so painful. Gave it a week to heal. Thought I must have had a sunburn....nope...no sun and the next day bright red, swollen and pain again! Definitely not for sensitive skin! And to think that I bought this to protect my face!"
"I was disappointed in this product. It started to give me small pimples on the sides of my face. Other than that it worked great, it didn't make my face oily and it felt light weight on my skin. Im so sad it made me break out. Since it worked in other ways for me, im going to recommend it"
"I have been using this morning & night after my face wash and toner. It is lightweight, glides on, and leaves skin feeling velvety smooth. My skin is extremely sensitive, and this is the first lotion I have been able to apply all over my face without sensitivity and/or breakouts. It is not thick and does not clog pores. Also, I use it before applying my foundation and it does not make my skin look oily at all. LOVE this product!"
"I am in my early forties and have sensitive, acne prone skin. Nearly everything I use makes me break out or irritates my skin, but not this moisturizer! I've been using it 2x a day for about two weeks and I love it! After years of buying $$$$ beauty products I'm finished. This stuff works, I can find it anywhere and it's a great price."
"This moisturizer is seriously amazing - my skin was so dry before that it was flaking and it's usually pretty oily, too, but after I used this moisturizer basically a day or two later my skin recovered and now my skin is so smooth and silky. I hope this product continues forever, I will keep using this moisturizer for as long as I can because it's amazing! I only wish they gave you a bigger bottle :)"
"I use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser along with this product, they are both great with Sensitive Skin. I have used this product for over 2 years and when I paired it with the Exra Gentle Cleanser my face felt amazing. This product is a lot easier to find then the face wash."
"I was originally using the oil free moisturizer with SPF 15 and was very happy with it. However, I decided to try this one recently and can't believe how light it is. My face feels fresh and stays feeling clean, no greasiness. One pump covers my whole face and on the rare occasion that I decide to wear makeup it works wonderfully. My skin feels healthy when I use this product and I couldn't be happier."
I am 35 and have developed a really sensitive skin in my early 30's. One is being too oily it easily gets dirt causing pimple breakouts and being in a tropical country does not help at all. Only this moisturizer serves me the purpose after my dermatologist recommended that i use it. I am so happy with the results. Too bad i could not find it in any local store selling Neutrogena products.
"This moisturizer made my skin look and feel very irritated, almost rashy. It also made my eyes burn even though I was very careful and did not get it near my eyes. I tried it 3 times but it was too irritating to see if maybe my skin would get used to it with more uses."
"I have sensitive skin...but only in the winter. I hated having to switch to some expensive moisturizer in the winter but this one is the best one I've tried and I know I'll be sticking with it in the future! It is quick drying and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily at all after using it. I also love that it doesn't have an overpowering smell, it's just really fresh, clean and lightweight- just what a moisturizer should feel like! You won't be sorry for trying out this product if you have sensitive skin!"
"i""m really picky with my skin especially since it's so sensitive, i've used this product for a week now. I use it whenever i know that i'm NOT going out into the sun because it doesn't have SPF so i use it as a night moisturizer most of the time. It leaves skin MOISTURIZED and SMOOTH. so great!"
"I have extremely sensitive skin, over the years I've tried everything from Rx to over-the-counter moisturizers only to breakout or get severe skin irritation. Using a night-cream was never an option. Neutrogena's Oil-Free Moisturizer is GREAT! I am using it day and night for several month now. So far, no irritation, no breakouts, and the light lines that I had all but disappeared. I am constantly being complemented on how great my skin looks. Thanks Neutrogena!"
"This moisturizer works like magic! I really like that its free of fragrance and free of sunscreen.It absorbs quickly and completely leaving my face feeling ever so comfortable. Thanks Neutrogena, for making an excellent product, and know that you have a customer for life!"
I have tried many facial moisturizer's and I ended up using Clinique Gel for years because of my very sensitive oily skin. I started to notice that sometimes I would still have dry spots around my face so decided to look for another moisturizer. I didn't do any research until after I actual used this product and was like WOW!!! It leaves my skin so soft and it feels great. I don't have to re-apply and it last all day!
"I love this product and have used it for some years now, having first tried it while visiting my family in the US. However it is not available in the UK and I have to get my daughter-in-law to mail it to me when I run out! PLEASE, why can't we have this for sale in the UK?"
"I started using this maybe a week back and the results are great. A few days ago i came back home with alot of make up on and i was too tiered to remove the make up or wash my face. Dreading that sleeping with make up on would probably be horrible for my skin and that i will wake up with my skin feeling very dry i still went to sleep. Oddly when i woke up, my skin felt fine!!! I realized it was because i had put the moisturiser on before applying make up. I was impressed :)"
My skin is oily at the same time dry and I am so afraid of breakouts that I choose products carefully. I just bought this product yesterday and SO FAR I love it. I love that it is oil free AND noncomedgenic at the same time. I also wanted a moisturizer without spf so that I can tan. I tend to only use neutrogena products because they are oil free & noncomedigenic so I feel safe using their products. It's a little too soon for a better review but I really hope that this product won't dissapoint me.
"I am 51 years old but still have oily and sensitive skin. This is the most gentle moisturizer I have ever used, and I have used many. It makes my face feel soft and disappears quickly and leaves no oily residue. Thank you Neutrogena for this wonderful moisturizer. Please do not change a thing. It is PERFECTION..."
"According to me it's perfect for even people with oily skin I feel soft & smooth after using it,and it doesn't turn your skin black or oily if you expose your skin to sun. It's helped me a lot , I was tensed for my skin because every product I used turned my skin more oily and make my skin look more worse .. Thank you Neutrogena"
"I just tried this for the first time and I love it! Its consistency is more similar to lotion. It is not oily and heavy, which I like. This is great for people with normal skin, but it might not be enough moisture for people with very dry skin. I also really like that I get the perfect amount of moisturizer in one pump! Sometimes I have the tendency to put too much (or not enough) on, but this lets me do less guesswork."
I use to use Dermalogica's version of this product until I caught wind of this one. It does everything it says it does and at dirt cheap prices...love it. I would recommend they change up the pump/bottle to allow us to get to the last remnants of the moisturizer though...can't seem to get that last bit of it with the pump they use now.
"This works great for my skin. (I have combo skin, and didn't want any SPF) I have normal breakouts, this doesn't agitate them at all. However, if I use more than one pump it seems to increase my breakouts. I use it in the morning and at night. Looks great with or without makeup!"
"This was the first Neutrogena moisturizer that I bought. and i was a bit upset by how much it cost but i really wanted to try it. now that i have, I L.O.V.E. it! All other moisturizers irritated my sensitive skin. This product moisturized my skin without the oily look. The first day I went back to school while using this product, one of my friends said that I looked ""flawless"" (even though i have pimples) i REALLY wish it was cheaper. but im loving this product."
"I have pretty sensitive skin, particularly on my face. After visiting a dermatologist for acne, she prescribed a number of acne medications for me and advised me to also use a facial moisturizer twice daily, although she did not recommend a specific brand. Every one that I tried made my skin burn and get red, especially combined with the acne creams, until I found this one. It is a very light moisturizer, and it's not greasy at all. And it's very moisturizing for my skin. I love it!"
"I am a big fan of Neutrogena. There products are amazing!!!!! I have used this for 5 months and i love it, it sinks into my skin so fast plus its GREAT for sensitive skin which i have.The only thing i dislike is that it smells kinda gross but overall great product, thanks Neutrogena you have done it again"
"I bought this after reading positive reviews, but when I used it for the first time, my skin was moisturized but still shiny in areas. My skin is naturally sensitive, and this moisturizer was very soothing. However, I was unsatisfied with the result."
"I have been crazy for years about perfecting my skin care routine. After moving to a more humid environment, using lotion would make my face break out on my cheeks. This is the only moisturizer so far that keeps my skin supple and happy without causing it to break out."
"I started using this product a while ago, and so far, so good. It is light, absorbs into skin easily, and really does moisturize - with no harsh smell. However, I have oily skin and at times it can feel greasy. I also suffer from moderate acne, and I still cannot tell whether this is causing me to breakout or not. For someone with mildly dry skin, this product is excellent."
I wish this lotion was around when I was in my teens. It is just wonderful. It goes on so smoothly and instantly moisturizes my skin without making it feel oily. It feels hydrated and healthy. I have used this for more years than I can remember and I get told that my skin is beautiful. ( have had severe acne in my 30's so it is something to have wonderful skin now. Thank you Neutrogena!!
"I bought this 2 weeks ago. I had not been using an evening moisturizer, but with the colder temps my skin seemed a little drier. I noticed stinging, burning, and redness of my cheeks after the first application, but thought maybe it was the hydroboost I have been using in conjunction. I tried it without the hydroboost and it was 100 times worse! The stinging and burning were severe and now I look sunburnt! Very disappointing. I can not recommend this at all."
"Have tried this for just over a month and not too happy so far. Yes it moisturizes, but it always leaves my skin more oily than before, you can pat off the oil with a tissue its so oily, my face feels slimy thanks to this product. I'm going back to using clean&clear their product didn't leave my face oilyer than before."
I bought this about a month ago after thinking I needed a change in my skincare and loving all of neutrogenas other products. unfortunately i was pretty upset after the first few weeks of using it as it left my skin looking and feeling oily and not fully moisturizing my face
"I have sensitive and acne prone skin so I needed something that would not make it worse . I'm happy to report that since I started using this moisturizer, my face has significantly improved. No more acne; just a few bumps here and there and for that I'm grateful."
Moisturizers my face with minimal oiliness limiting breakouts.
"Why would Neutrogena put so many parabens in their products? Apparently, not concerned about the health of their customers."
Been using for years and love this moisturizing product that doesn't clog pores but truly moistens. Good value for such a good product.
I spend a great deal of time outside and this wonderful product keeps my face moisturized without the greasy slimy feel of other products
"I got this and it really helps with my dry skin!! But it does say on the bottle that it won't leave skin greasy or shiny.... and it does. I don't know if it's just me, but if you have oily skin already, i wouldn't recommend using this."
Please give us a much larger container with a regular pump. There is so much waste with current container.
Thank you.
My daughter with sensitive skin and eczema loves it and says its great and she uses it everyday. It does what it says it will.
This product is chock full of parabans--an allergen. I just learned that this product is what has been causing horrible eczema outbreaks on my face. Shouldn't sensitive skin products have allergen-free preservatives.
HOW IS THIS AN OIL FREE LOTION BUT IT HAS PATROLIUM IN IT?? NOT TO MENTION SODIUM HYDROXIDE (WHICH IS LYE) USED MOST COMMONLY IN RELAXER...TO CHEMICALLY STRAIGHTEN AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR. TAKING THIS BACK TO STORE!!!
"I don't usually give such bad reviews and I'm sure this product works for many, but just keep in mind it's not for all. After using this product for a few days, I realized that it burned when I put it on, and it left my skin being very very dry."
This product burned my skin after using twice. I am appalled that it is recommended for sensitive skin. I am seeing a dermatologist today as my face is still burning even after removing the moisturizer from my skin.
Hi i am using this product since 1 month and it suits even my combination/ oily skin that's why I recommend this product to those with combination skin also
"I have moderate rosacea and every other moisturizer I've tried irritates my skin. After much experimenting, I found this product and I love it. It feels good going on, absorbs quickly, and most importantly, no irritation or flare-ups."
This being a sensitive skin product I thought it would work for me but it broke me out horribly. It was a waste of my money and I wish I never bought it.
"This is the only moisturizer my daughter can use when her face is irritated. She can use other moisturizers normally, but when her face is irritated this is the only one that doesn't bother her."
This is the best moisturizer ever! It is gentle on your skin and doesn't cause pimples or breakouts. I have used this for years and ran through many bottles. I have tried other moisturizers but always go back to this one.
"I was looking for a good moisturizer and came across this, after the 2nd day of using it my skin broke out. i dont ever get pimples or have any breakouts so this was very upsetting to wake up and find big red pimples on my cheeks."
i have sensitive skin and have a lot of trouble finding the right products for it. this moisturizer burns and is very greasy. it may also be causing breakouts. if you have seriously sensitive skin definitely avoid. plus it has mad parabens. gross.
I have been using this lotion for over 15 years. It is the only lotion that I can use with no chance of breakup and no greasy feeling. It feels natural! I love it.
i absolutely love it! after I washed my face with St.ives I realized that my skin was starting to peel so I got this and when I rubbed it on it made all of the peeling disappear!
"i love this!! 1. no fragrance 2. good price 3. moisture, but not oily 4. spreads well 5. a little goes a long way i use it everywhere even on the plane!"
"My skin is super sensitive and oily, so I thought this product was perfect because it is said to be lightweight and meant for sensitive skin. Well, I thought wrong. It hurt my skin and made it oily. It's too expensive for the results I recieved. -.-"
"Great lotion for sensitive skin! Tried others that left your skin feeling oily, not this one. Can apply make-up right after with no problem. Great product!!"
"This is the worst moisturizer I've used! Gave me a rash all over my face the first time I used it! :( very disappointed in this product, especially cause it's supposedly for sensitive skin."
Normally don't write reviews but this stuff is pretty good. I break out like a teenager and i am 28. This product gives me needed moisture without causing me to break out. A little heavy for the summer though. Thank you Neutrogena.
This is a great product. My skin is so moisturized after I use this. I have the most sensitive skin and this product doesn't sting or cause breakouts at all! A must have! Totally worth a repurchase!!!
"If you have really dry skin and want something to moisturize with, this is it. However it made my skin have a oily sheen and not the matte look I was going for."
"This facial moisture cream is just the perfect combination, especially for those of us with sensitive skin. Even better, it's fragrance free! This cream leaves the face feeling revitalized without loading down on heaviness. Thank you, Neutrogena!"
This is the best facial moisturizer I have used. The tone of my skin has become more even and I attribute it to the level of moisture I receive from this product. Only downside is it can feel slightly greasy at times.
Excellent product. I have struggle with acne prone skin and the medication always drys my face out really bad. Skin feels great. Use this 2 times daily and more if in the sun.
"I bought this product to try it out and it said its for sensitive skin, but within two days of using it, it caused my face to have a rash and turn bright red. It's very painful and when I apply it on my face it burns."
"After searching and trying countless moisturizers I've finally found one that doesn't make me look oily and breakout! Before using this I had dry patches and eczema on my face, and now? All gone!"
I use this everyday and it's gentle enough on my face for daily use. I have oily/dry skin but it doesn't seem to make my t-zone oily or my dry cheeks patchy. I'm happy I purchased this product.
"I have had problems with some of my facial cleansers leaving my skin dry and irritated. After the first time I used it, I immediately saw results. My skin feels so soft, it feels very light as well and does not clog my pores. It's brilliant"
"ohhhhhhh myyyyyyyyyy goshhhhhh. this is THE perfect moistureizer!!! does NOT clog pores, leaves skin smooth, not too greasy. soothing and non-irritating. PERFECT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN."
I have really acne prone skin but this moisturizer doesn't break my face out. Its light yet does the job. LOVE IT!!! I just wish it came in bigger bottles!! :)
I'm on my second bottle of this moisturizer and it works great for my dry and flaky skin. I've tried different moisturizers but only this one actually moisturizes my face. I definitely recommend it. It works better when I use it for my cotton mask.
"This is nearly the only moisturizer I can use. It never breaks me out, goes on smoothly, and sinks in immediately. Frankly, I think oil-based products probably are more effective as wrinkle reducers, but if you need oil free, this is a great choice."
"I have been using this product for years. It is gentle on the skin and keep it quite supple. I always try to keep an extra bottle in stock and never to be out, because this is only product I use."
"Essential every morning. I wish it had sunscreen, but then I probably wouldn't use it - they irritate my sensitive skin and make it oily. This does not irritate, only balances. Feels like nothing - just wear a hat. :)"
"Shaving is rough on the face. This no alcohol moisturizer is first-aid for the face. Do a cold water rinse after your shave, pat dry, then apply a bit of this moisturizer on face and neck. It absorbs quickly. Good to go."
"I love this moisturizer! I've been using it for months and I love it because it keeps my skin hydrated and soft, without making oily under my make up. I use it before bed and in the mornings and my skin is no longer oily."
been using this since high school works great and a bit more than i like to pay but it does last a long time so its not bad . not greasy and is fragrance free which i love !
"I mean, this is the best product i've used! Like I love it. Before I discovered it I had an acne face filled of breakouts, since I started using it my face looks really nice like there's not any other product like this in the whole planet!"
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used on a daily basis. It works well under makeup and I do not have skin breakouts. This product is a great value and makes my skin feel so soft. I would not buy any other product.
This is a very good product and I have very sensitive skin. In my opinion it is as good as some of the more expensive department store moisturizers. I would highly recommend this product. Oil-free does not mean that it doesn't moisturize.
"It's amazing. I have very bad acne. It seems to break out all the time, that 's why I'm very careful to choose moisturizer. Thank to this moisturizer, I don't have to worry about my problem anymore since my skin feels so smooth and soft!"
"I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER!!! I have really sensitive skin and I could never find a product that locks in moister and doesn't cause irritation, but this product does both very well. I definatley recommend to anyone with sensitive skin"
"It feels so soft without that greasy feeling. It can be used at any age(my friend's teenage granddaughter loves it), and is the perfect moisturizer under makeup, or alone."
I like it first of all because it is oil free and oil free lotions are hard to find that will slip into your skin without leaving a shiny look. It lasts all day until evening when I use it before bed. It keep my makeup looking fresh.
I didn`t like the product as it really doesn`t moisturize your skin at all. I was really disappointed as I do buy quite a few of their products!It costs alot more than what it is worth.
"The product is very good, I got it for a present, but due to the terrible delivering system the box was totally destroyed so it was useless as a present"
"Most every other moisturizer makes my skin react (the nerves start tingling), and this is the only one that doesn't do that. It is my moisturizer of choice. Thanks to Walmart for carrying it!"
"After opening the box I found that the pump is broken. I have sent it back in for a return, which is frustrating because it not only means a trip to UPS around the holidays but now ill be without lotion for some time."
"been using this for 3 days and I feel tingling on my face, is that normal?"
"but gonna continue it and see how it goes, hope the tingling sensation not gonna last long.."
"My old facial moisturizer changed its formula and now I hate it. On the hunt for a new one with spf. This stuff goes on okay, but my face is super shiny by the end of the day and if I rub my eyes at all it burns like crazy! So... On to the next one for me."
"Love my Neutrogena moisturizer, absorbs fast and didn't leave a mess on my touch screen."
"I bought it for my wife, she loves it"
It dries very quickly on your face and moisturizes your face.
love it! no longer have dry skin on my face and it also works great as an eye makeup remover!
"I was using Clinique for years. Switched to their oil-free when it came out. Price kept going up, so about a year ago, I tried the Nutrogena Oil-Free Sensitive Skin product, and for several months had no problem. I started having skin redness and flushing about 3-4 months ago, and started using different products under this, thinking something else was going on. I have extremely sensitive skin. Perhaps it just took that long for my reaction to occur."
"I really wanted to love this, but unfortunatley this product irritated my skin and made it red and blotchy. But, I think this is an overall good product: it's light and absorbs pretty well. It didn't make me break out and it gave me the right amount of moisture. My skin is just overly sensitive and very picky anout what I put on it."
So far it works. it keeps my skin nice and smooth especially after i used it the first time when i had super super dry skin i had a week ago. i didn't do anything to my acne and seemed like it made it more red and a little more irratated. otherwise i'll use it any where else on my face
Product is as expected
Nice size for the price..Use Mary Kay and this is the next best thing Glad i chose Neutrogena I will purchase this again..
I bought this product 3 weeks ago & after my 2nd day of use I noticed a rash on my face.
It's advertised as being for sensitive skin and then it has parabens? My skin broke out so badly using this.
"I have oily, acne prone, and sensitive skin. This is the only lotion that works for my skin and has become a permanent part of my routine."
"Love this moisturizer. It is the best. Please don't change a thing about it. Great for face, neck and chest area."
"My skin gets dry easily. This provides good, lightweight moisture without causing me breakouts ( I have large pores)."
I love this product. It makes my face so soft and smooth. You don't need a lot of it to do the job. Very awesome product.
I have looked and looked for a moisturizer with no fragrance and NO spf. PLEASE do not change your formula. Thank you!
It doesn't irritate my skin or clog my pores like most moisturizers I've used in the past. I do wish it came in a larger size though.
"The best moisture for my extremely sensitive, oily, acne and dry skin. It is so light and soft. I love it!"
Tried this for the first time this morning. WOW! I'm glad I bought this...if this keeps working like this I will be purchasing more.
I don't have that sensitive skin but man this stuff is amazing! It doesn't leave your skin flaky or dry(: I use it in the morning and night.
"I have tried every sensitive skin, natural and whatever moisturizer out there and this is the only once that doesn't irritate my skin!"
This stuff is a life saver!! I used to have flaky skin but now i can put this on under my regular make-up and my skin looks and feels ahh-mazzingg:)
I love this product it leaves my skin soft and smooth. Plus it doesn't cause acne for me. It's an wonderful product buy it.
I have been using this lotion for many years. It doesn't bother my sensitive skin. It doesn't have any smell. My husband and son also use it.
My skin is a lot less dry using this.It is an extremely great product.It makes my skin really soft.My favorite moisturizer now!!!Buy this!!
It's a really good product it does not make my face oily or feel irritated. It does not smell so good but it leaves my skin soft.
I've been using this moisturizer for years i will admit I've tried a couple others at times but came right back nothing can compare.
"This means it won't cause break outs, so the people who said that must have just had a break out? It smells like bubble liquid and babies :]"
"I was breaking out a lot and had dry skin, when I started using this my face got really smooth and there's no acne in sight. works really fast too!"
Contains cetyl alcohol even though it states no alcohol. Used this product for 20 years and now have developed rosacea and can't tolerate the ingredients.
I have Rosacea and bought this to try because it was labeled for sensitive skin. It made my face beet red and irritated like it has never been before.
I've been using this stuff for years! Great moisturization without being thick and greasy. It does not irritate my sensitive skin whatsoever. It better not ever get discontinued!
"I love it, always hydrated my skin but It would be better if you guys give a bigger size. I don't always enjoy going back to the store every after 2 months to buy a new one. Make a bigger size please!"
My face is very sensitive and can get oily. Love this cream and it never is a problem for me!
"I have never been able to use a moisturizer on my face because they all break my skin out( even though I'm in my 50's) This one for sensitive skin works and does not cause a break out, I use it daily."
"I love this product. I have extremely sensitive, irish rosacea prone skin and this is is the only product that does not irritate it! Love it, buy it, you won't be sorry."
"My skin's a real pain. It's combo and acne-ridden. I used to use something else, but it ran out. Then I found this beauty, it was wonderfully cheap and it really is great. My skin seriously hates anything too moisturis-y but this was okay. The only problem with this is that I wish it was a little more moisturising. I tired putting two squirts on my face, but it became too oily. Other than that, I'd highly recommend this product."
"I have been using this product for a decade now. It is a must-have in my collection. It moisturizes, does not irritate or leave any oily-greasy feeling, and lasts all day long. It goes perfectly under makeup or for a fresh look. It is affordable and one bottle lasts a few months, with daily use."
"I've used this for years under my makeup. It is just light enough to apply without being sticky and waiting for it to be absorbed. My skin has always looked good, so I'm not sure if it is all this product. I've used Neutrogena for years and felt that they are good."
This product left my skin feeling very tight and dry
"I love this product, it's so light and non greasy!"
Will Neutrogena ever get rid of parabens in the products?
I use this product everyday. I love how it works on my skin.
"It is mainly silicones, does'nt provide true hydration"
This lotion made my face break out into red splotches and caused dry irritated skin :(
I have dry sensitive skin and this really helped my skin not break out.
This is the best moisturizer i could ever find for my acne prone skin!
Good moisturizer. I can apply it on my face at night as well as it doesn't contain SPF.
It's light and comfort. I shared with my daughter.
Non-greasy moisture doesn't clog pores or irritate. Leaves skin smooth & soft. It's great.
Goes on smooth and silky without any oily feel or look. Great product works very well.
"I love this moisturizer, It is great for really sensitive skin. Helps with my acne."
Very nice moisturizer! I use twice a day an its awesome
This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and calm. Give it a try.
"Oil less, guality product. Have been using for a year and very pleased."
I like how it moisturizes my skin without leaving it oily and it's helping with my breakouts
"Good moisturizer, no greasy feel and it does not clog my pores, just like the bottle claimed."
It hurts so bad when I put it on! I had to take it off right away I couldn't take it
"I have oily and sensitive skin, so I thought this product would be perfect for me. It burns when I put it on and now I don't know what to do. :("
"I have very dry skin in the winter season, my skin is also sensitive. Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Oil Free Moisture keeps skin feeling nice and smooth without making it oily, and it doesn't break me out."
"I have combination to oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and this does really good. I use this after I shower and all I need is about half a pump for my face. It is very lightweight, which is what I need. But if you have dry skin this may not be moisturizing enough for you."
"I have very sensitive skin. And I don't like greasy moisturizers or strong scents. Love this stuff! Better than the Dept. store brands I was using & a lot less money. I love the pump! Only a little at a time pumps out. Perfect! Non-greasy, non-irritating, non-scented. Does the job. There is nothing not to like about this stuff."
"This product states that it is non comodegenic, but if you look at the ingredients, there are several medium to high level comodegenic substances. If you have sensitive skin, prone to blockage, this product will be bad for your skin! Make sure you look at the ingredients on products, because any product can list “non comodegenic”, without real factual evidence."
Very favorite. No left over greasy feeling once I put it on. Love it!!
"Because this is oil free it doesn't clog my pores! It's so lightweight, but gets the job done!"
I really like this product and plan to keep using it.
"I have combination, sensitive skin. I bought this and it made me break out and made my face really red. Would not recommend to anyone."
"I had a SEVERE allergic reaction to this product. My skin was red and puffy with little bumps all over it. At it's worst, my eyes were so swollen that it was difficult to open them. Would not recommend this for sensitive skin."
This product exacerbates my rosacea and causes me to break out terribly. Any one with a soy allergy must avoid this product! If you don't know why you are breaking out try to avoid soy. It is a known allergen.
"This agitated my sensitive skin and made my face feel stiff like I just put glue on my face. Whenever I went out into the sun it would always start to run, it never properly absorbed into my skin."
I have very sensitive acne prone skin and must be very careful what types of mousturizer I use. I love this product because it is light and does not cause skin breakouts.
This lotion does not contain SPF 15. I bought it for that reason and it doesn't contain any SPF. Either they sent the wrong bottle or the site has the wrong description.
I like this because I needed a lightweight moisturizer. I get breakouts when I'm under stress. I've worn it under my foundation which I think makes it look better.
I've been using this face lotion for over 25 years. It's not greasy or sticky. My face is very dry and I need to put something on it after every shower. It feels good on my face. A little pricy but it's worth it to me.
I like this stuff. It's not oily at all. It's lighter than I thought it. My ONLY problem with it is that there is no SPF factor. Not even 5! I think that this would make it more oily and heavy. I love this stuff though and highly recommend it.
I have used this sensitive skin moisture for years and it comes through as always a nice light moisturizer. My only complaint is trying to find it priced at $9.99. The local Walgreens has it priced at $10.99. I live on a limited income and may just have to try a different moissturizer in my income bracket.
"I have super sensitive skin and always seem to get my favorite things discontinued. I've been using this for a few years and have found that it works really well to provide light and non-greasy moisture. Do not follow the packaging though, where it says 2 pumps. One light pump is enough to cover me from forehead to neck. The only thing I don't like about this is that it has no spf. Is it really so hard to add SPF without giving up the ""sensitive skin"" tag???? Aside from that, I'd strongly recommend for sensitive people."
For over 20 years I was using the Intensified Daily Moisturizer. Suddenly it was discontinued. I've tried other brands and this one but none compare favorably. I found that this one spreads too much cream on the face so now I put some on my hands first and rub them together and then apply to my face. Works well. But I still wish I had the Intensified Daily Moisturizer!!
Love this product so far. Been using it for only two days now. I use this product in the morning after i wash my face. I usually have either extremely dry skin or oily. After washing my face it is usually dry and flaky. My skin is super sensitive and when i use this i dont have the issue with my skin being red and itchy. So far this product is amazing on my skin.
Used this product for many years and love it.
This face lotion is excellent.
"love it, its the only moisturizer that doesnt give me a rash!"
"Not only is this light on my face, i have no greasy residue after applying it, and my skin feels great from continued use!"
It makes my skin look and feel much healthier. It's also light weight so when I wear my make-up you can't tell I have it on.
This is an excellent product!! I've used it for many years. There is no fragrance. It really is oil free. I highly recommend!!
"So far it seems to be working, my face and neck is much more moist than before, yes I will continue using it,Thanks I like it."
"I bought this recently and I made sure to avoid my eyes but it started tingling and burned my cheekbones and when I woke up the next day, my eyeslids were swollen to the point where I could barely open my eyes."
I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS LIGHT WEIGHT AND IS NOT GREASY AT ALL. I BRAGGED ON IT SO MUCH THAT MY HUSBAND BEGAN USING IT FOR THE SAME REASONS.
"I have oily and sensitive skin, this lotion dries quickly , isn't sticky, and best of all doesn't break me out! It makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I usually put this on at night after cleansing."
"Even though for sensitive skin,it irritated mine. So I can't use it. But it did make my face soft."
Keeps face really smooth after a shave. I've tried others but this is my favorite.
Great facial lotion for sensitive skin. Only lotion that doesn't break me out.
"Great for her sensitive skin, but does the job!"
"Started using this product based on recommendation by dermatologist. However, it made my skin breakout and my rosacea flare up badly!"
"I had to stop using this because it costs too much. Otherwise, great product!"
