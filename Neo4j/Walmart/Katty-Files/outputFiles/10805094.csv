I just love this product. My dermatologist recommended it. It does not leave me greasy although I have combination skin. It has become my favorite moisturizer!
I have been using this product for about two weeks now and my skin feels much more smooth and hydrated. I have noticed some of my dark spots lightening and I feel that they will continues to lighten with more use. This product goes on very easily and creates a semi-smooth surface. Works nicely under make up too. No strong perfume scents whichbis nice. Does have some smell but not overpowering. I am happy with my purchase!
I switched from Mary Kay Products to Neutrogena products several years and have been very happy. I no longer have a problem with dry skin and the products keep me looking younger looking. I will continue to use Neutrogena for many years to come.
"I love this light yet effective day moisturizer! I'm glad I found this as other daytime moisturizers with sun screen feel heavy on my face, especially under make-up. This really works for me...I just wish it came in a larger container."
"Visibly Even Daily Cleanser & Moisturizer was the ABSOLUTE BEST. I was so disappointed when I found out it was no longer available. Neutrogena is the only product I can use on my face, now I'm using Hydro Boost, nowhere near the same as Visibly Even. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring it back. Why was it discontinued???"
"Terrific, and needs to be used daily. Why no option for larger-sized quantity? Buy both. One for the airport and one for home."
"I used this before and it did gradually lighten my dark spots. I used it everyday for several months, it takes time but it is good for the price."
I bought this product a month ago thinking it was a moisturizer but it is too similar to Neutrogena sunscreen. Doesn't seem to help my skin at all with moisture issue and I have plenty of their sunscreen products
I like the product but was concerned that neurogena does not make it mandatory that the item is not sealed. When we purchased at a local store there were all sealed at the tip...
Neutrogena is my go to brand so I try different products they offer and I'm not a fan of this moisturizer . Other products I can intantly see results . But after a month of using this product I haven't seen any results of even looking skin .
I've used this product for many years and will continue to use. My skin tone is more even and has a certain glow!
I have used this product for 20 plus years. It's not greasy or oily and does not clog pores. I get compliments all the time on how my skin glows!
I have been using this cream for the last two months and it's the most effective lightening and sun protection cream i used so far
I was using Neutrogena Radiance for years but they discontinued this product and suggested Visibly Even Daily Moisture Cream I have been using it daily since my purchase.
This is the best moisturizer for acne scars and hyperpigmentation hands down! However it works better with the cleanser! Why was it discontinued? Will it be coming back!
Noticeable difference in morning after using Visibly Even at night. Great!
"I used Neutrogena products for many years, never disappointed!"
It doesn't work as fast as I thought. But if you give it time and use it twice a day it works!
I've been using this product for almost 10 years. I think it helps keeps my skin clear and smooth.
I just bought it and I like how it doesn't leave ur face oily throughout the day.
I love the smooth sheerness of this product and the SPF and also the way it goes under my foundation so nicely without making it greasy or cakey.
"I USED THE CLEANSER ALONG WITH THE MOISTURIZER, BUT SINCE I CAN'T FIND THE CLEANSER I'M AT A LOSS...PLEASE BRING BACK THE CLEANSER."
BRING BACK THE VISIBLY EVEN CLEANER! BRING BACK THE VISIBLY EVEN CLEANER! BRING BACK THE VISIBLY EVEN CLEANER! BRING BACK THE VISIBLY EVEN CLEANER! BRING BACK THE VISIBLY EVEN CLEANER! (HIT HELPFUL IF YOU AGREE)
Please please please bring back the Visibly Even Facial Cleanser that goes with this moisturizer. The two works together as a gem. Don't know why the cleanser is discontinued..
"I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I will definitely buy it again. I have very sensitive skin and had trouble finding creams that didn't break me out, however this feels great on my face and it's like it actually glows."
"I've been buying this for 3 months and use this as both a moisturizer and sunscreen. It definitely is reducing discoloration/uneven texture, while being gentle on my extremely sensitive skin! A little bottle lasts for so long, and my make doesn't slide around or cake on top of it."
My skin is very sensitive to even oil free moisturizer. I need this product back as soon as possible.
"I love this product and to the fact that I don't have to go to the drug store to get it, is wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very disappointed in this Neutrogena product. Made my skin bumpy in two uses. It was supposed to be non-comedogenic. I would not recommend this product.
"You can tell from the pictures that it does work...It's the same cheek. I love this moisturizer except it can get a bit greasy on my combination skin. However, a little powder will fix this. I do recommend it. I had nasty pimple scars and it got rid of them. My face is a lot clearer now. I use this alone with no foundation."
"I really liked this moisturizer; however, being very, very sensitive, I had to stop using it. It may have been due to the SPF in it. I really did love how my skin felt; so velvety and smooth. It also made my skin look more even-toned. The value is outstanding. I would recommend this to those who do not have sensitive skin. I went back to my Neutrogena for Sensitive Skin and am loving it. Just wanted to try a different product. Hope this help"
I have been using this for years. It is the only moisturizer that makes my skin smooth and does not make it look or feel greasy. With me being African American it is hard to find something so perfect for my skin type. After two weeks of use my friends started to notice a difference. I have recommended this to several other people that were trying to find something that would work on evening out their complexion.
I have been using this product every since it first came out I want to say between 6-8 years and I will never stop using as long as it is on the market. This product is great at fading away dark spots and making my skin look very smooth and youthful. I'm African American and this is the BEST product for woman of color. I hope they never discontinue. I always get compliments on how great my skin looks people always think Im wearing make-up but with this product there is no need to.
"I LOVE this moisturizer but Neutrogena PLEASE consider putting this in a pump bottle. The cleanser would be nice in a pump bottle as well. As a women of color this moisturizer helps with fading dark spots, looks great under make up and has a high spf which is what we need especially during the summer months."
It does a good job of moisturizing my skin for the duration of the day. I do like the pretection it gives me from the rays. I have been using this product for about two weeks and have been noticing some improvement in the appearance of my dark spots. However I started using burts bees radiance night creme with royal jelly also. I am uncertain which product is causing my skin to become more even. I am really glad I purches this product.
"I love this product. I am missing the cleanser. I used Visibly Even for several years now. It evens my skin tone, but is not harsh. I like it because my skin is a medium brown, and I don't wish to lighten it. It is hard to find a product the is gentle and effective. The combination of the cleanser and moisturizer can't be beat. These days I have search the web for the cleanser."
Love this product. I have combination and acne prone skin. It doesn't break me out and has lightened some of my acne scars. I mix it with my neutrogena mineral sheers powder foundation to make the perfect tinted moisturizer that covers blotchiness and evens out my skin tone better than most foundations by themselves.
"I have complicated skin, super sensitive with rosacea & freckles. This stuff is amazing. It actually gives me enough coverage without that caked on feeling you get from foundation & the sunscreen is a plus. This is all I have to use and I just wish I'd have discovered it sooner. I should've known it was great just like every other neutrogena product I've used. Bravo! Please don't discontinue this one, I'd be lost."
"This product is not used for quick results, I have been using it for 8 weeks now and not every scar is gone, but all of the light scars have vanished! The dark ones are fading. I plan to continue to use this product. Be patient and consistent with it. It does improve your skin without the feeling too heavy. I love the fact that it has 30spf because the sun will make your dark spots worse. Give this product a shot it will be worth it!"
"This is the only moisturizer that doesn't break me out. After a few weeks of use, my acne prone skin was noticeably less red and because my pores weren't being blocked, clearer. I've been a dedicated user for months. I have sensitive, combination, and acne prone skin and it is difficult for me to find products that work. Please Neutrogena keep this product for life!"
"It does what it claims ""reduce blotchiness..."" but I would prefer to not use products WITHOUT paraben. Some experts claim parabens are bad for your skin and actually make your skin worse over time. Many people are also sensitive to products with fragrance. Take out the paraben and fragrance and I'm good. Otherwise, I'll keep trying other non-oily facial sunscreens."
"I was diagnosed with Rosecia about 1990, I found that Neutrogena products were the best product to use on my face. When they came out with the visibly even products, they were even better for the treatment of the red places on my face. Now people can't even tell that I have Rosecia."
"I have been using this product over a year now. I discovered it when I first found discoloration on my face from the sun. I am 55 years old and this product has worked wonderfully for me. I use it every morning without fail. The spots dissappeared within 2 weeks and never returned, keeping my face soft and smooth with no irritation. It is easily absorbed into the skin and feels great with no smell. Thank you for a great product!"
"At 50+ I still have a T-zone and have to be careful about moisturizers but my skin is definitely more dull than 10 years ago. This product has worked beautifully! My skin looks almost as good as it did 10 years ago. It is brighter, softer and healthy looking. Please do not stop making this product. I see some have tints but they don't look good on all of us! Thank you"
"I have been using this for a month and a half.,It keeps my skin soft ,smooth,and clear and for the 1st time in along time,it is starting to even out again.coworkers keep asking me for skin regime.i use this with the Visibly Even face wash,i call this my fierce combo !"
"This moisturizer really works great and I much prefer it to Neutrogena Healthy Skin Lotion. It isn't nearly as greasy, absorbs well and smells amazing. I have already noticed improvements to my skin tone and texture after a couple weeks. I am also someone who suffers from mild acne and this product is gentle and doesn't break me out."
"I LOVE the Visibly Even BB Cream so when I needed another tube, I purchased this - couldn't find the BB. The first time I put the new Visibly Even on, I knew I had a problem. I'm allergic to this hypo-allergenic product. Can't wear it and now I've discovered BB is gone. What am I going to do??? Really disappointed. I wish I knew what the exact ingredient was that gives me grief but with ingredient lists so varied and ever changing, I have no idea. It's hit or miss and this time was a big miss. Disappointed."
"I have had acne since 13. Now at 24, I may have the occasional flare up but mostly, I'm stuck with dark spots and acne scars. I tried products with hydroquinone but saw no results after 3-5 months. I purchased the moisturizer at the end of May and now at the beginning of July, I can see my skin evening out. I'm African American and I do use topical meds for my acne, but I credit this product for my more even skin tone. My only issue is that it says it's non-greasy, but I apply it with a cotton pad because it's so greasy."
"ihave used this product for less than a month. i usally suffered from discolouring and blotchness in winter and summer but thanx to neutrogena. my skin is now evenly toned, bright and beautiful. my female colleagues ask me if im pregnant coz its so amazing, the change is not only seen by me. i have thrown away all the other moisturizers ive been using. please please dont discontinue it"
"I have used Neutrogena Daily Moisturizer, SPF 30 Visibly Even off and on for about 5 years, along with the Visibly Even Cleanser. My daughter has complimented my skin only twice, ever, and both times were when I had been using this on a regular basis! I think it really does help with evening out my skin tone. It has a nice, light fragrance and isn't heavy or greasy."
"I saw Kerry Washington advertising this product and I decided to check it out. Being African American I wanted a product that will help even my skin tone and moisturize without being greasy. I have used this product for about 3 months now and my skin looks amazing. My skin tone has become even and I have been getting lots of compliments with most women wanting to know what I have been using. To top it, it's a sunscreen as well. Love it! Love it! Love it!"
"No complaints about this product. It's simply perfect: the smooth consistency, faint sunscreen scent (so you don't feel like you're going to the beach every morning), and true results! I used to have blotchy skin with dark spots, and this product has truly evened out my skin tone. It almost glows now. I love this moisturizer!"
I used this product daily for two years and love it. It keeps my combination skin 40's looking great! It quickly fades my acne spots giving me even tone skin. It also reduce the dark lines of my wrinkles. I love that I can wear less makeup & I get tons of comments on how great my skin looks.
"I am a 63 yrs. old Asian women, very fair skin. I do not have any wrinkles but lots of freckles and age spots. I like this product with soy complex as I tried hard to lessen my discoloration in old age. I definitely recommend this moisturizer as it is spf30 and is not greasy."
I have tried pretty much every Neutrogena face lotion they have and this one is by far my favorite. My favorite part is that it doesn't feel or smell like sunscreen but I can wear it all day even when I am outside for many hours and not get burnt. I have pretty oily skin but it doesn't leave my face too oily and I often wear it without makeup. Highly recommend!
"I just turned 60. Have been using it for at least 3 years, maybe a little more. I have people tell me I look younger then I am. It's not runny. I use it every morning, and in the evening if I'm headed out someplace. Oh, by the way, I'm a male, and an avid cyclist, ball room dancer, enjoy the dating scene so I have to keep up."
I am almost 30 and starting to see some small age/sun spots. I started using this lotion a little over a week ago & am already seeing results. My skin is incredibly smooth & my spots are already starting to lighten. I love that this has SPF 30 along with all the other great things it does. I would definitely recommend & will be buying again & again!
"Seldom do I purchase a product that actually does what it claims. Visibly Even is different. I am 63 yrs. old and was not good to my skin when I was young. I had quite a large age spot on my cheek just below my eye. I used Visibly Even once each morning for about 3 months and it literally disappeared. I have another spot on the bridge of my nose that is still there, but greatly faded. To my mind this is preferable to something more drastic and vastly more expensive."
I've been using this product for years and love it but why can't I find it in stores anymore? It does brighten your skin and a little goes a long way. It seems like it took a while to see a difference but when you use it everyday it does smooth out blotches and makes your face look great.
"I normally don't believe this ""after 8 weeks results,"" blah, blah. I needed a daily moisturizer with an SPF and I have dark spots. After one week my skin did look soft and my skin did not break out. And then truly after 2 months or so, my pores were minimized, my dark spots are gone, my face looks younger and the SPF30 is a big plus for where I live. My foundation is easy to apply after this Moisturizer. I DO hope that Neutrogena will not D/C this one!"
"This product does what it says it will. Usually I have red cheeks, and this product reduces the redness. I also like the thicker formula because it goes on easily. It also makes my foundation go on smoother. My only complaint is that it is a little overpriced for the amount that you get."
"I've used this product for at least two years now and I love it. It's hard to find a good SPF 30 and I like everything about this one. It smells nice, it's light, it definitely evens my skin tone and, bonus, it photographs well! All of that with helioplex, too?! Honestly, I wish they carried it in a bigger container. I really love the way this one makes my face and neck feel!"
"I was looking for a product that will clear my dark spot, I had try a really expensive product before and didn't work for me, since I've used some of the neutrogena product for my acne before and was pleased with the results I decided to use this one as well, after a week of using this product I saw a change, now I use it every day and also use the night rapid tone repair..... LOVE this product."
"I love, love, love, love this moisturizer. I picked it up while at the beach in July, happy enough that it was SPF30. I've been using it daily for about 5 months and wasn't sure about the results. Until I looked at the pictures from the beach. OMG. What a difference! I reccomend this to everyone. Except my sister, who is allergic to soy."
"I have used this products for 2 years now. It continues to be one of the only moisturizers that doesn't make me break out and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I have combination skin and need something that will moisturize without making my face oily, and this is it. SPF is also very important to me as well, and I like that this product has SPF 30 and helioplex. I always recommend this to my friends and they are always pleasantly surprised when they borrow this moisturizer. 10/10. It's perfect."
i have bad acne and using this after toning gives fantastic results. ive been using it for a few weeks now and my skin tone and texture are already evened out and acne marks are fading. best moisturizer out there. it really isnt greasy at all and it doesnt look too shiny because it is absorbed quickly. a little pricey but definitely worth the purchase if you want flawless skin!
"Most daily sunscreens are too greasy or do not provide any daily moisturizing, so I was happy to find this one. It makes my skin look softer and I can easily apply make-up over it. I also noticed some of my dark spots becoming lighter. It's a keeper for me. Hopefully Neutrogena will not d/c this one."
"I like this new updated version, it is less runny. I have older skin that suffers from blotches, brown spots and even the occasional pimple but I really need to use an SPF + moisturizer during the day. This one does a good job of softening my skin (instantly) and lessening my brown spots. I wish they had a night cream version of this preferably without retinol (too harsh for me) but with all the other good stuff, hyaluronic acid, peptides etc..."
I'm 20 years old and have been lifeguarding since I was 15. I have significant freckles and sun spots from all those years in the sun. I also have old acne red spots. After using this for 2 weeks I could see a difference in all my spots. I not only use this in my face and neck but on the tops of my shoulders because of the mass amounts of freckling there. I do wish it had a less sunscreen like smell but it isn't that strong nor does the smell last. This is a good daily moisturizer.
"I usually am not sensitive as I can tolerate retinol and other strong products. I ordered this as it seemed to have the same ingredients as the other Neutrogena product that is no longer made that I was using. My face stings when I use it, though a little less over time. I like the size for travel but I'll look for something else with SPF 30."
"Although, I'm only 20 and don't have age spots, I do have a few acne scars and blotchiness due to sun and tanning bed exposure. I am on my second day of using this moisturizer and it's fabulous so far! My face feels incredibly soft, balanced and moisturized. My blemishes are also much more calm and not as noticeable. I think I'll stick with this product for years to come - I just hope it's never discontinued!"
"I've been using the Neutrogena Visibly Even foaming cleanser morning and night and the Visibly Even daily moisturizer each morning for several months. And, I am more than happy with the results. My dark caramel-brown complexion actually glows! Thank you, Neutrogena!"
"This product doesn't quite eliminate the blemishes like it says it will. I like the feel of moisurizer because it doesn't feel like you have anything on your face. Everything rubs in very well. About the blemishes, I am also pregnant, so ever since then my spots haven't cleared quickly like they did before, Now the spots stick around for months."
When I'm pregnant my skin is awful and I get dark discoloration from pimples that just won't go away. My youngest child is two and I thought it was high time to try to do something about my skin since it makes me shun from photographs. I've been using it for about six weeks and I've noticed a definite improvement in evenness. It's also great for the dry climate here in Colorado and worth the cost. I'm eager to see how my skin looks after another six weeks.
"I love the product overall. I have good skin but this gives me an extra glow and doesn't break me out. However I may have to move on, because it causes my eyes to burn and water. It's a deal breaker because its uncomfortable and makes me worry that I'm damaging my eyes. I hate that this is happening because it's the it's the only drugstore spf 30 that doesn't leave a chalky residue for me."
I use this to treat my old acne blemishes. I have brown skin. It's been 4 weeks since I started using this and some of the very light spots on my face are almost gone. The darker spots are slowly lighting up but I assume that this will take more time. I use it twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening. It does not break me out. It does not have a heavy chemical smell like other lightening creams. Hopefully this will continue to work within the next month or so and I can write a second review on the overall results.
"This product is decently expensive for the poor quality it has. I have had it a few weeks now, and I haven't seen a difference in my skin. If it's changed anything, it might be my vision, because even though I've tried avoid putting it around my eyes it still majorly affects them being on my checks. I am not sure if I just have really sensitive eyes or this product is dangerous toxic, due to the times I've put the moisturizer on, I tend to not be able to see and my eyes start to terribly water and burn for a while."
"I've been using this lotion for more than 5 years now. It works magic on my skin. It leave my face with the perfect blend of moisture and protection from the sun. Also, I have acne prone skin and this product is super effective at doing what it says it does without causing break outs and other irritation to my sensitive skin."
"I am hoping that Neutrogena will bring back the Visibly Even BB tinted moisturizer. I used it for years. Now I am on the search for another makeup. With the Visibly Even BB light to medium tint, I only used that, plus a plush and power and was done. Hope the company will reconsider what I consider, a serious mistake."
"Neutrogena facial products do exactly what they say they will do. I have been using them, along with the microdermabrasion tool, for decades."
"Great product. I have very sensitive skin and I can't use just anything on my face so when this product came on the market, I decide to try it and to this day, I've not had any regrets"
"Nice, non-greasy moisturizer. I have oily skin. Leaves skin perfect for applying powder foundation. Been using it for years and it really does keep skin free from blotches. And the sunscreen of 30 can't be beat."
"Please bring back the Visibly Even cleanser! I used it for 15 years, and it made my skin great, few blemishes and an even tone. It was perfect! With reviews still coming in talking about it, it was obviously popular!"
"love the moisturizer but it doesn't work as well without the cleanser please bring back the visibly even foaming face cleanser, its the only thing that worked for my skin"
I am a Afro American women and have tried many products that say they can make your face even and tone and they never worked even the most exspensive ones this product is great it works so well for me . Brenda Harlem Newyork
"Have used this for over a year now, and I can honestly say that this is the best moisturizer/sunscreen I have ever used! (and I have tried them all beleive me) PLEASE NEUTROGENA.. NEVER STOP MAKING THIS !"
"i used to have dark spots before but since i started to use this product, I noticed that my skin glow and less visible dark spots. I really love the results.....thanks Neutrogena : )"
I had stubborn blackheads and decided to try this product. Awesome and amazing results. It stopped any more blackheads from appearing and has faded away most of the existing ones
I use this in the am and Rapid Tone Repair at night. The combination of the 2 products seems to be doing wonders for my skin. The Visibly Even moisturizer absorbs very quickly and doesn't cause my skin to breakout even when I put on makeup over it.
The redness and dark spots on my face look as if they disappeared when I applied this moisturerizer. It was so effective that it seemed like I didn't need to use my foundation.
"I have never had skin sensitivity problems, no acne, not even as a teenager. But there is something in this that I am allergic to. I broke out in a rash all over my face a day after I began using this. Wish I knew what it was that I was allergic to."
"I bought the original version of this product a few years back (SPF 15, much more liquidy, non-greasy) and was very disappointed with the new version. It is greasy and heavy. It is a huge let down compared to the previous version."
"omg, this the best i have ever tried and believe me i have tried them all. i have acne and this lotion pampers my skin and after a month it actually started to minimize my acne scars. Neutrogena please NEVER discontinue this marvelous product!"
"I noticed a big difference in my complexion after using Visibly Even , my skin was softer and in two weeks time my dark areas seem to be lighten .I'm very pleased"
I have always had oily skin so I was never able to put lotion on my face. This lotion is not oily feeling and absorbs without a heavy feeling. I love it!
"I'm a guy and I use this product. I am in love with it. Now more than ever, I love washing my face just so I can use this product. It has made my skin feel so smooth, and I have noticed a difference in my complexion. Please keep this product around!"
I have been using this product for six months and I love it. I use it in the summer and winter. It leaves my face smooth and glowing. I'm always getting compliments. I'm not going to stop using it!
"This one burns my eyes but the SPF 15 was perfect...I used for 5? 10 yrs? My skin looks terrible...after 2 years, still on the hunt for a replacement. If you can handle the SPF, this is best product out there."
"I have been using this product for several months. I am pleased with the smoothness it provides under make-up. Fortunately, I could order it online as it is not consistently available in many stores. Catherine"
My dermatologist couldnn't believe how much better my face looked after a few months of using this product. Fabulous results on evening out the white spots of vitiligo.
Like the light lotion feel and believe that this is helping with evening out my skin. Feel it is protecting my face with the high SPF rating so I make sure to always put this on first thing in the morning.
"This Moisturizer is the greatest, As so as you apply it it makes your skin so soft over a period of time it works miracles for your skin I highly recommend this product please keep this around!"
The Best Moisturizer out there...Great product for the face...PLEASE never discontinue this! Have a hard time finding in stores! Have been using for several years & great results!!!
"I tried this product for the first time today and in a short while my eyes started watering and I developed an allergic reaction. I washed my face and felt some relief, but both eyelids are very red and my eyes continue to water. I am disposing of this product."
This does make a positive difference in my skin.
"I tried this product to improve my skin tone. I put it one my face and a couple minutes later my eyes started to water, then they started burning. My eyes were burning so bad that I had to wash the stuff off my face and then I had to rinse my eyes out with cold water for about 5 minutes to make the burning stop. It literally felt like somebody sprayed me with mace.."
"I bought this product thinking it was a tinted moisturizer. It is a white cream with SPF30, which, as a fair-skinned person, is good. It doesn't have any kind of tint. It smelled pretty pleasant and it's not greasy or heavy. I have not used it long enough to see a difference in the evenness of my skin, but Neutrogena usually puts out a good product, so we'll see."
"I am in my fifties, bald man with a shaved head, with a convertible... the moisturizer is a great product, covers nicely without being greasy. Having a SPF of 30 is extremely necessary, the visibly Even does just that... blends my face, neck and head. I was disappointed when I couldn't find it in my usual store... which is why checked the website, just got to try a new store! Highly recommend regardless of color, age or sex"
"I have been using this product for months now and my skin isn't dry like it used to be, this product has really made my skin look healthy!"
Absolutely luv this product. Made my skin so soft and smooth and luv the fact that it has SPF 30!!! Plan to use this for as long as possible
I use this every day. It makes my skin soft and I love the sunscreen in it. I would recommend this to any one!!!
Finally a product that doesn't breakout my acne prone skin. I have been using this product for six weeks now and my skin looks Fabulous.
"I love this moisturizer. However, I love the original tinted version the best! The tint was light and fresh."
I love Neutrogena! Literally as soon as I put this on- my skin feels silky smooth. I don't even notice the spf. My Mom loves this lotion too!
"This product made me break out. Might work well for others, but i noticed anytime i use spf i break out horribly..so it could be just me."
I saw results within the first week of using this product together with the foaming cleanser. Definitely recommend it!
I love that it's both a moisturizer and sunscreen. One less product I have to buy. It does not leave a greasy feeling and absorbs very well. I've been using this product for over 3 years.
I use many Neutrogena products and this is just one more that I find reasonably priced and a good value. It also does what it is supposed to do. I use it all year round.
"I have always used Visibly Even Foam but this is the first time I am using the moisturizer. It did not disappoint. I cleanse with the foam and then use the moisturizer and my skin is not only even toned, but also very soft and the smell is amazing."
I was looking for a new moisturizer and happened to come across this one I absolutely love it and won't be changing any time soon. It leaves my face feeling so soft and doesn't leave it greasy.
"As a mid-30 y/o African American woman, I love this product mainly because it's not greasy and leaves a smooth finish. I have been using it for at least 2wks now and I'm hoping to start using the cleanser as well."
"When I visited my friend in Swaziland in 2009, she recommended I try this range and I was at first hesitant opting for the orange visibly clear range but when I eventually switched I'm hooked. Too bad I can't get it here in Zimbabwe ahve to travel to South Africa whenevr I need to stock up"
I love it! What happened to the face wash that went with it! Please bring it back
I used this product for a while but had to discontinue use because it made my sensitive eyes water.
I love this product. It works wonderfully and its not heavy or greasy.
Why can't I get to the visibly even foaming cleanser???? Help
"used for blotchy skin...not greasy, keeps face smooth and slows wrinkles"
"Noticed significant improvement on my skin tone, less blotchy"
I like this as a moisturizer/sunscreen. It is very thick though and therefore difficult to apply without using a lot of product!
Great for the skin. Nourishing and holds all day. Spots slowly but surely go away and leave a radiance for your pleasure.
I use this product as my daily sunscreen+moisturizer. I have an oily acne prone skin but it's still good for my skin. I saw an improvement of my dark sots caused by acne and this is a good products in fading marks as well.
"WONDERFUL!! Great my skin complexion is dark ,uneven on my face from gardening and skin lupus . First time user and I need more. using daily defense with tint which I love to help hide spot . Almost Visibly even, noticeable now . I Love It"
I love this moisturizer!!! My skin regiment is not complete without it. It is great for my sensitive skin. It doesn't burn my skin like some face lotions and it leaves my skin smooth and supple looking.
Really good product .
Love this one! Makes my skin look smooth and eventoned. Great product!
every one always say my face looks so glowing and beautiful!!!....I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!
Been using this moisturizer for about 5 years. Keeps my skin smooth. Pleasant fragrance and lightweight
"Ready to try it. But, shockingly, the perfumey smells added to it gave me a headache. Can't you develop a fragrance free version? This is not what I expect from Neutrogena!!!"
I have been using this product for several years and still like the simple healthy look and feel I get from it. Going on line direct to you makes it easier to continue use of this product; convenient! Thanks!
This product works great for my sensitive skin. I just wish I could get a nite cream to go with it and that it is in stock more regularly. It seems to be in stock off and on and there is nothing else that works as good.
"I love this moisturizer. It doesn't really do much for my acne spot, but it is a great moisturizer and sunscreen. I use a vit c cream for my acne spot."
I agree this product is ideal for women of color. I have been using this product for about two weeks & I love the results. My skin glows all day. ( I also use this with Ageless Intensives Correcting Concentrated Serum Night.)
"I have been using this product for almost 5 years and it has evened out my skin tone, protects against the sun and leaves my skin feeling smooth beautiful."
When I.first out it on it was great. My face looked smooth and radiant the entire day. But when I took it off I was left with painful breakouts that I'm still trying to clear.
"I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and you cannot use this product with makeup, my skin is a lot more oily and shiny. but its evened out my tone. And I have a great skin type that's never oily but that is the biggest problem using this product. I would recommend looking at something different before buying this one .I might even go back to chanel"
"I liked the moisturizer and saw improvement in a week - but the tube made it to difficult to get the last of the product out. For a daily moisturizer, I want a fast and efficient flip-top or pump; I don't want to wrestle the tube to get what I paid for ---- especially not for a product I want to use every day before I catch a train to work. I will buy faster/easier products instead."
"I bought this with the intention of evening out the hyperpigmentation my acne left me. It's been about two months so far and there is some improvement. It's great having a sunscreen that doubles as a moisturizer, but this was a bit too heavy for my taste- it doesn't spread very easily. I do recommend this, but I'm not sure that I personally will repurchase this product."
I used it the first time and I noticed how soft it made my face feel. I love it already!
"Decent moisturizer. But made my face feel greasy, even after i put on powder and make up. Haven't used consistently enough to know if it works yet"
Love this moisturizer! My skin looks more even and I barely us any foundation now. Not sure what night cream I should use?
"I do wish this had some color in it so I would not have to use anything else on my face. Otherwise, I am pleased with this product."
I found this to be just right for me. t goes on easy using just a little and does not irritate my skin.
I would recommend this product to people who have oily/combination skin like me because it is lightweight and does not feel sticky.
"first time trying Neutrogena Moisturizer with SPF. It smells awful, I need to hold my breath when i put it on my face. It also feels greasy, and doesnt even skin tone as it says. Only used 2 times then put it on the side. Its a waste of money."
"I dont suggest buying this product. although it made my face feel great as most Neutrogena products do, it wasn't worth the fake tan appearance on my clothes!"
this is a light face cream. It makes my skin smooth and do not clog pores.
"Great protection from the sun, not oily like similar products."
My face looks smooth using this product.
"like the sunscreen, helps with blotchy skin, smooths and evens"
This lotion comes on a bit greasy but does fade as you rub into skin. I do not appreciate the glitter that is left on the skin from this product.
great
didnt do much . i used it for three weeks and it is a bit heavy.
