"Just bought this and am in love. Especially the soft smell, like a baby product! Perfect soft silky lotion, non greasy, light texture soft, perfect size bottle with pump, calms my skin great ingredients simply adore this. Pls never discontinue. Wear 50 SPF OVER so 15 SPF is fine. Pls put this nice scent in the foaming cleanser which has no bland scent and don't like."
"I bought this product after using a friend's when I was out of town. I love the smell, spf, and the level of moisture. I could see how it would be on the greasy side for some, but using it before I sleep really makes for nicely moisturized skin when I wake up. I've noticed a BIG improvement in my acne spots too, but that could be the spf keeping the sun from darkening them. A big fan of this moisturizer."
KEEP IT IN STOCK IS EXTRA PERFECT FOR ANY AGE
"ALL MY FRIENDS GIFTS ARE IN MY LIST TO THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS, SPECIALLY THIS ONE MEET ALL NEEDS FOR A RADIANT FACE LIKE OURS"
HONEST PROBE FROM US
"I purchased this product as ""another in a succession of facial moisturizers"" after the one I was using was discontinued; I didn't have really high hopes, but am SO glad to be wrong! I was losing hope of finding something that would again give me the softness and pliability I was used to ... the first day I used this Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer left my skin soft again and smooth - two days' use is even better. One more happy customer! Please don't change a thing?!"
My second reviews so far i was so excited about the first forgot to mention the most important thing. I've had rosacea since my 30s and im 42 now there has been nothing even medicinal creams and lotions that have worked. this has pretty much taken my rosacea from a 10 to a 2 and people have noticed. I'm super excited and I wanted to throw that in there because this really is a miracle product.
I've tried many moisturizers over the years and this one is the best for my sensitive skin. Never any redness or irritation.
"I bought this product a week ago and since using it I have noticed that my skins feels very bumpy, when it didn't before. It's not acne, more like a rash but it isn't red or irritating. I'm a little disappointed because this moisturizer made my skin feel amazing, but if this doesn't go away within a couple of day I will not continue using"
I tried this Ultra Calming daily Moisturizer and it made my face redder than it was and it burned like crazy. It was so irritated and hot I had to wash it off at work. I am really bummed. I was looking forward to having a nice sensitive skin face routine. I guess the search continues. I bought the foam as well. But I am not even going to try it now.
"Love this , I was looking for a cheaper alternative to help with my redness and burning I get from regular moisturizer's and found this, it is amazing! Love the smell, works almost instantly, works great , and this is coming from someone who has spent HUNDREDS of dollars on expensive face creams , please keep this product and don't change anything about it !"
Have used Aveeno for years - just began using the Ultra-Calming version with sunscreen - wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely sensitive skin. I have never had a problem with this product and am pleased with how it works for me. I will certainly keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Aveeno products and am generally satisfied. But, this lotion has ingredients that inflamed an already dry, itchy skin. I had to return the product and would not recommend it for anyone who wants relief from a moderate itch on their face."
I have been using this product for many years now and it is the best moisturizer I have tried. It makes my skin look and feel clean and smooth and the right tone.
This new ultra calming lotion has fragrance in it which is bad for sensitive skin. Also the ingredients in this version are different than the old version that was discontinued with spf 30. The old version was so nice and it didn't irritate my skin at all. I bought this thinking oh it's the same lotion with 15 spf instead of 30 spf but that's not the case. Same name but different ingredients.
"I have recently changed my body moisturizer, facial cleanser, body wash, and body soap all to Aveeno products. I am totally satisfied that I did. However, when I tried to switch to the daily facial moisturizer, I could not tolerate the fragrance. Please make a fragrance-free version. No fragrance is one of the reasons that I love your other products."
"I have suffered from extremely dry and sensitive skin for over 20 years. I have been to a skin specialist who was prescribing cortesone creams with little impact. I came across the Aveeno ultra calming cream and have never looked back. The ugly red itching is gone, my skin is clear and health looking. If I forget to use the cream and the redness returned, after only two applications of the cream it is clear again."
I just bought this today and will have to return it to the store as the scent is too strong. Made my eyes water and itch and never even put it around my eyes. I was very hopeful as I love the face wash (which is fragrance free by the way). Why would Aveeno make the wash unscented and put scent in the moisturizer? I had to re-wash my face. Please remove the scent and I will gladly buy again!!!
I have only purchased this product once since Aveeno discontinued the ultra calming SPF 30 version. I really do not like fragrance in skincare items. Iwish it was fragrance free like the SPF 30 version was. it does have a nice finish though. Please bring back the other version
"In have rocacea and tried several far more expensive facial creams. Only this product helps, my skin doesn't hurt anymore, feels soft, non greasy and there is no redness anymore. I live in Belgium and i allways buy a couple of bottles when i'm in the USA. If i'm out of this facial Cream and have to use an alternative the redness comes back very quickly! Ps i chose TX as my state cause that's the one i allways visit! But Antwerp is Belgium!"
I had tried oh so many products and none of them did anything for my skin. And then I happened on to Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer. I knew from the moment it touched my face I had finally found the face cream for me. I love using the product and my face loves me by looking years younger. Thank you Aveeno -please don't go anywhere!
"I am a guy and bought this for redness. I have the calming cleanser which is unscented. I thought this would be the same way. NO. It has an overwhelming floral perfume smell. I cannot go out in public with this on and I cannot image a woman liking this, because if she is wearing perfume, then this aveeno cream will overpower it . If you want to smell good you put perfume on, not face cream. I buy aveeno products but this one was a big upset. Waste of money, not even giving it to the girlfriend, I will try to return it or trash it."
"Have previously tried a lot of moisturizers, from the very expensive to cheapest store brands, nothing has worked for me. I had a very dry itchy T-zone looked angry and red all the time. After only a couple of days using the calming cleansing bar and moisturizer my skin feels great. When you get comments from your hubby and friends about how younger I am looking, I know it works !!! Love it. THANK YOU"
"I have acne-prone sensitive skin, and this moisturizer was the first Aveeno skin care product I tried. I live in a dry climate, and this moisturizer does not cause break outs or irritate my skin. After I tried it, I tried the ultra calming foaming cleanser too, and it has really helped my skin. I have been through A TON of products through the years, and this moisturizer and face wash are the only OTC products I have been happy with and stuck with. I don't use the ultra calming makeup remover cloths though."
"My skin is sensitive and red skin reaction. I bought this product thinking it would be good for me, but no...Very bad ingredients for a sensitive skin...parabens and perfume...this is not for sensitive skins!!!! Now my skin is irritated and very red!!!"
"I used the fragrance free for several years and loved it--as another user said, you could put it on day or night and be assured it would work and not irritate your skin. My face reacts horribly to fragrances and about the only thing I can use now is plain vaseline."
"I have eczema on my face to the point where I get sore spots on my chin and cheeks that are red and itchy. I kept using hydocortisone cream whenever I had breakouts of sores, but I wanted something on a daily basis to prevent them. This product prevents them and has reduced my breakouts! My skin feels great and my sores are not frequent at all anymore! I just love this! YAY!"
"I'm 31yrs, am currently dealing with stubborn acne and the only thing that is helping with the redness and pain is the Aveeno Daily moisturizer. Not only is it helping with moisturizing and calming my skin, but the areas that are not broken out are nice and soft. I highly recommend this moisturizer!"
"This is the only product I have found that removes all the weird redness I get around my nose. This started in my 30's and this miracle moisturizer literally got rid of all the redness within a couple days! I have been using it for years and swear by it. It is also a good moisturizer for the rest of my skin, plus it has SPF, so I can't lose. Highly recommended."
"My skin is extremely sensitive and acne prone so it is hard to find products that don't irritate my skin even more. Aveeno has always been there for me and I always go back to their products! This moisturizer is very light, yet it does an excellent job at hydrating my skin. I use this every morning underneath my makeup or by itself and I love how it has SPF 15, great bonus!"
My skin has been difficult to deal with lately. Most recently I started getting this red patch on my cheek. I was embarrassed by it. One day I went out during my lunch break and bought this moisturizer and used it immediately. By dinner time the redness was less noticeable. I cannot wait to see wait it does in a week !
I had stubborn acne and tried everything... turns out my skin was too dry and that's why it was breaking out! My skin has cleared up 100% and this product is absolutely a miracle. I am a loyal customer for life! Highly recommend... so much that I just had to write a review!
I've been using this for a week and I already love it. I definitely feel like my skin tone is evening out and my redness has calmed down. It leaves me feeling moisturized without being greasy on top of my skin like some moisturizers tend to do when they don't soak in well.
"My skin is soft now and the redness is down. l like the way it dispenses, not too much at a time, and I like the size of the bottle, doesnt take up much room in the sea of my cosmetics. It smells good (just enough) and helps with redness. First experience with Aveeno, I want to try more products. I love cosmetics and always open to new products."
"I've been having issues with reacting to products, so I was looking for a sensitive skin spf and tried this one. My reaction to this product was not as severe as it has been to other products, but I still experienced itching, which went away as soon as I washed off my face from this product. I'm not sure which ingredient I'm reacting to, but I'm wondering why a sensitive skin product would include fragrance in it. It's a guess that the fragrance is part of the problem for my face."
This is a great product. I would prefer that it be scent free. This is a general observation for all products that are dispensed from a bottle with a pump: There is a lot of product still in the bottle when the pump stem does not reach the bottom or when the product is too thick to pool at the bottom of the bottle. How about a different type of container or designing a container that does not waste at least 2 tablespoons of this wonderful moisturizer?
"The best daily moisturizer i have ever used. a trye treatment. has changed my complexion 100%. finally, a product that does what i need. and the smell is lovely. i wish there was also an spf30 version. and a nighttime version. i need more products from this line!"
"I have very normal skin, not dry nor oily and have never had allergic reactions to anything. I regularly use Aveeno calming daily moisturizer so thought this would be a great add to my regimen. The first time I used it I woke up the next morning with my entire face red, hot, itchy and swollen. It took about 2 days to go away. I hadn't changed anything else that day besides this cream so needless to say it was the culprit."
"I'm sensitive to many products containing fragrance, and this moisturizer irritated my eyes, sinuses and gave me a headache. I'd recommend it to someone who's not sensitive to fragrance. I've been using the ultra-calming cleanser, which is very good and fragrance free. I didn't even think to check to see if the moisturizer was. Would love to see this product without fragrance and an option without SPF."
"I have tried a lot of moisturizers, including some that have been expensive. None have given me the softness, nor feeling of this moisturizer. I had a hard time finding this for a while in stores, hence the move to other creams. I wish there was a companion night cream. Love, Love, Love, it!"
Absolutely love the ultra-calming cleanser and moisturizer...my face was inflamed from something I had just started using and with the Aveeno ultra calming products my skin settled down in a couple days...I also had to go back to my mineral foundation as well... My skin is considered combination and have struggled with finding a good moisturizer and the Aveeno ultra-calming is awesome...absorbs in the skin quickly without leaving it feeling greasy like many others...a keeper for sure!
"I'm a thirty-year-old-male with amazingly sensitive skin. Since college, shaving my face has led to irritation. My neck area was the absolute worst...razor burn and ingrown hairs weekly. I've been using this product on my face and neck daily since I was about 25 years old, and the difference is around an 80% reduction in irritation from shaving after using daily for several weeks."
I've always had redness in my face and have never found anything that helped. This stuff is amazing! I'm either completely clear of all redness or will have a slight hint of pink but in the right places so it doesn't look bad. It helped tremendously when I was pregnant and the redness was getting worse (that's when I found the ultr-calming lotion and tried it for the first time). It makes a big difference in how dry my face DOESN'T feel without being shiny or oily. My makeup also looks smoother when I use it. LOVE this stuff!
"I had been struggling to find a cleanser and lotion to get the redness and extreme dryness on my face under control. I tried the Ultra-Calming products and saw results over night. The bottles say that past users saw an improvement in a week, so I was thrilled to see a difference in one use. I use this everyday now and could not be happier with the results! My face finally, after over a year of trying other products, is starting to look healthy again. I could not be happier with this wonderful product!"
"So far its the ONLY thing i've found that helps my dry skin (as a result of my atopic dermatitis), especially after showers. Even better than prescriptions. They always try to give me some sort of hydrocortisone anyway, which I don't think you can use regularly on your skin. I use Aveeno every day and it makes my face NORMAL :) i figured i had to review it after using it all these years. Only downside: a little pricey. but pick it up on a 2-for-1 sale if you can and you're golden."
"I started using this product three days ago my skin is completely red it looks as if I got burned, my face is completely in pain, I can't believe this is happening, I had a wedding to go this Sunday and due to this I would not be able to attend to my bestfeiends wedding..."
I feel so depressed and I been out of work since yesterday...
I use the ultracalming face wash my face is so sensitive to everything this works great so I tried the daily moisturizer within a few min of applying my face was itching burning @ had hives washed it off applied hydrocortisone cream @ took a benadryl would be nice to have an ultracalming fragrance free / dye free product !!! Had to give a star this is a 0 star
"So disappointed. I put this product on for the first time this morning and by the time I drove to work my face was covered in hives and my eyes swollen. I remember thinking as I put it on, ""why would they put fragrance in a calming lotion?"" Ugh. I hope I don't have any meetings today."
"The Calming Night Cream worked well for me, so my expectations were high."
Have tried many products in my life and have been using this for 3 months now and my breakouts have finally stopped and my skin looks clean and clear. I use to use expensive cleansers and creams. This cleanser cleans my skin better then anything I had used previously. Since I am older I would like to try positively raident but am afraid to switch since the products I am using now are doing so well.
"I thought I would try a more economical face lotion, I have always used Clinique. This lotion makes my skin really soft. It also smells so strong, it gives me slight headache. Also, my eyes are watering pretty bad (no I didn't put the lotion in my eyes). And it has made my skin even redder than normal. Back to Clinique."
"This is one of the only moisturizers I can use on my very sensitive acne prone skin. Many other products that claim to be for sensitive skin give me a bad reaction. After using this product even a few days my skin's redness is greatly reduced. This product is tried and true. I would definitely recommend the whole ultra calm line to friends. Aveeno, please come out with a sensitive skin night cream and moisturizer with higher SPF to finish off the line."
I have tried all kinds of moisturizers even very pricey ones and I love this Ultra Calming moisturizer! I can use this every day and my skin feels great! I appreciate the sunscreen in it and it has really reduced redness. I would so be willing to try a tinted version of this product if it comes out!
"love this stuff!!!! Can you make the Ultra Calming Lotion in a travel size though? or in a slimmer 2 ounce bottle perhaps? I only use the Ultra Calming Lotion and I have a bottle for home, car, work but would like a slimmer version to keep in my purse or for travel and I have only found slimmer bottles for the other types but not the Ultra Calming Lotion.....just a suggestion..."
I have had very very dry sensitive skin all my life. This is the ONLY moisturizer out of the dozens and dozens I've tried that hasn't broken me out. I've been using this since I was 13 and am now 17; I still have never found a moisturizer that works as good as this.
I love using Aveeno Ultra Calming Moisturizer along with the cleanser. These products work great for my skin type which I use to always have redness on my face and my face was always irritated. Now I get compliments on how great my skin looks and how much it looks better.
"I have been a fan of the positively radiant line but I was out of my Aveeno so I decided to use my daughters cleanser. That was the WRONG thing to do!!! I landed up with a chemical burn on my face. I was red, eyes swollen and eventually my skin began to peel. I immediately went to the store and purchased this product. I LOVE IT. It is not harsh, smells good. It is like putting silk on my face. I would recommend every woman to use this!"
"Have been searching for a lightweight daily moisturizer with SPF that won't irritate my sensitive skin and this is the holy grail. My skin is dewy and not shiny, evenly moisturized even with combination dry and oily skin. Has also helped resolve some minor acne issues in my T-zone that the supposed super cleaners like Proactive and Acne Free couldn't clear. I guess gentle can be better!"
"I love this product! My older sister recommended this to me and I had no idea of the amazing results! The week I first used it, my skin looked clearer and reduced the redness. I use it daily and will continue to! No other product helped me the way Aveeno does! My close friends and family have noticed a complete difference, too! I totally recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this for my dry flaky skin and I applied it 2 times a day and a week later my skin was super hydrated and soft, I also use it before I apply make up and my face is evened out with flaky skin I hope you decide to buy this product and I hope it works wonders for you to!!"
"This moisturizer is the best I have found to calm the redness on my face, especially around my nose. I use the Aveeno Ultra Calming cleanser also and it works great with this moisturizer."
"I am in love with your face lotions, but the smell of the ultra calming is overwhelming and frankly smells like pledge furniture polish. Please remove and it will be PERFECT."
"I love Aveeno products and really wanted this to work, but the scent is overwhelming. It makes me cough and the scent is unpleasant. I strongly prefer unscented products. I am going to return this bottle to the store."
"It stinks! Unbearably! Why not make this fragrance-free?! Also, I agree with what someone else here said, fragrance & sunscreen are NOT calming. If you're going to make a product for calming, PLEASE concentrate on it being just that--CALMING!."
I bought this moisturizer about a year ago almost and I'm absolutley in love with it! It's so calming on my skin and makes it very smooth and gentle. The added SPF is a bonus for sun protection which I love.
"This product did not do as advertised; it made my skin burn and even more red. It was most definitely not calming, and it made my face feel a little stiff along with the burn. It also has bad ingredients, such as parabens."
This was a great product and then they improved it. Now instead of being the moisturizer I use to calm my skin it is what is irritating my skin. I will never purchase it again.
"I have been using the moisturizer and makeup remover wipes for almost 2 weeks and my skin looks great. I have not had to use any of my prescription creams or lotions. The flaky, painful red blotches are gone!"
My face was getting blotchy in places and oily in others. I found this to help even tones. In the mornings I mix it with my tinted moisturizer and I am getting great results!
"My skin is very sensitive; it is red, sometimes peels, dry, and has no ""glow"". After using this moisturizer, my skin is radiant and doesn't seem as sensitive. It makes me feel more confident. I love Aveeno Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer!"
I have really bad acne and redness. It makes my face look so clear and it heals damaged and dry skin in under an hour. best moisturizer ive ever used. by far.
Good moisturizer for sensitive skin. Makes the red spots go away and it's not heavy on my face. The only problem is that it's too expensive but the good news is that it lasts a long time (about 8-12 months).
"The ultra calming face wipes have been a life saver for my rosacea so I thought I'd give the lotion a try. Unfortunately it smells so bad that I'll never use it again. Why wouldn't it smell the sa,e as the wipes? Sad."
"Product is great for being in sun, but does not moisturize my skin as I expected. I am 70 years old, very dry skin and this did not seem to help. Sorry!"
I tried this product cause you no longer have the fragrance free one and the smell made me sick. Please bring back the fragrance free ultra calming daily moisturizer.
"I developed a severe allergic reaction to the moisturizer I had been using for years, leading to welts and hives on my face. NOTHING worked until I found this product, a true ""miracle"". My skin has never looked better!"
I had really red skin from irritation on my skin. This took away all of my redness and now my skin is healthy and soft and smooth looking and I love it :)
This greatly reduced the redness in my cheeks. It evened calmed most of the redish-purple color on my niece's arms. I don't use much on my face because the lotion is a little greasy and makes my face shine. Overall a great find!
Aveeno Ultra-Calming Moisturizer works great for my rosacea. It soothes my face and reduces redness. The price from walmart is much cheaper than anywhere else.
So far so good. Smells great too [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturized calmed my skin and made it feel soft. My skin even has a nice dewy look to it. I was having issues with dry spots and some redness caused by irritation, both problems are a lot better. However, I am very sensitive to smells and the fragrance gives me a slight headache. I would recommend it for dry, irritated skin as long as you are not sensitive to fragrances. Maybe just smell it before you buy it."
"I've actually noticed a decreased in my redness. No other product has helped with redness before. I was very impressed. I noticed it in a few days but definitely in a week. The only downside is it does make your face a little bit of a whiter complexion, nothing crazy, but I don't mind since it evens out the colors on my face. it could just be the added sunscreen."
"I had redness and flaky dry skin on my face for about 2 weeks. Aveeno is my go to brand when my skin gets irritated. Unfortunately the Calming Lotion did not help as I anticipated. In the first two days my redness cleared up but the 3rd and 4th day my face begin to breakout and have more dry patches. I read the packaging and trusted this product to ""fix my face"" but was disappointed. There is also ""fragrance"" in this product which should not be used to treat sensitive skin."
"This product is the only product that actually worked on me. I have dry to normal skin and I never really had a major issue with my skin, but this year with the stress of nursing school and not being to careful for my face I noticed redness on my cheek and chin. It got so bad that it was embarrassing. After a few weeks of applying AVEENO ULTRA-CALMING® my skin was clearing up. I love this product and I use it daily. I highly recommend it. Also smells great. Thank you AVEENO for this product! #HappyCustomer"
"I have tried all of the Aveeno moisturizers and this one, the Ultra-Calming is very soothing to the skin. It is gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I prefer the Positively Radiant moisturizer, but my sisters who also have sensitive skins all love this one. It does not break you out of clog up any pores."
"Works well on calming skin irritation, however lotions with sunscreen do not work well for my combination skin. My dermatologist recommended this so I gave it a shot. Within 15 minutes of putting it on my face, it is covered in oil-ugh! I'll try using something else on my t-zone, and use this on the other parts of my face. It would be nice if it was fragrance-free."
"I love how this moisturizer keeps my face from being dry while not being greasy. I use two pumps on my face and one on my neck daily ~ and I always have a backup so I never run out! I tried the ""comparable"" store brand once since it was significantly cheaper... But I went back to Aveeno; you get what you pay for!"
"I first used this two years ago and I loved it. I've tried other moisturizers since then, but I have yet to find a better one. I have acne and sensitive skin and a lot of products either irritate my skin or dry it out, but this moisturizer leaves my face feeling smooth and soft."
"I have been using this product for years and will continue to do so because I am so satisfied with the results it gives me. However, about 2/3 of the way through every bottle the pump mechanism fails. I have to dig out the rest of the product with the tube inside the bottle and when that doesn't reach the lotion anymore, I use a chopstick. It works, but can you fix the pump? I can't be the only one with this problem. Thank you."
I bought this to use over the winter. My skin turns bright red from dry winter air. This definitely reduced the redness. I only need half a pump so 1 bottle last me at least 4 months. It does have a floral scent which doesn't bother me. I am now addicted to this line and I plan on repurchasing.
"Great everyday sun protection. Light moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts and melts into the skin without being greasy. I started using this product in the winter when my skin got quite dry from forced hot air heating, but have continued using it to abate dryness all year long. The SPF is a great added bonus for me, because I don't feel I need to use another facial sunscreen that might be heavy or cause me to break out."
"Pretty much my whole teenage life I have had acne, and luckilly it stopped when I was 20 (minus the usual pms-related breakout) but now I am stuck with acne scars and red skin. I started using Aveeno Ultra Calming 5 years ago and it has worked miracles! My face looks so much less scarred, the only color on my face is a healthy pink on my cheeks! This has greatly increased my confidence and I can finally go out without makeup with confidence! Definately trying out the SPF 30 variation this summer!"
"I have been using a harsh prescription acne medication for almost a year, and one of the major side effects is a burning sensation and all-over redness that has not disappeared. Since ALL of the other sensitive skin lotions I had tried (even Dove) only made my face burn more, I was a little skeptical about the claims the television ad made. Even after the first use, however, I could feel immediate relief... it was amazing. I would HIGHLY recommend this product!"
How can you add perfume to a product and say that it will calm sensitive skin? This makes no sense. It burns when you put it on.
"This product is great for redness reduction, however, why is there a rubbery fragrance. Please get rid of the smell..."
It's called calming and recommended for sensitive skin... Hello my skin is sensitive to FRAGRANCE. What happened to the fragrance free bottle?
"Love, love, love this moisturizer. It is the only one that really moisturizes my dry skin. My skin does not feel tight anymore. Thanks, Aveeno!"
This seems to magically clear up the occasional red flush my face takes on. I use it with the cleanser for an added boost.
"Did not like this moisturizer at all. It left a gross residue on my face, kind of like cheap sunscreens. Didn't moisturize at all and made my face flakey with sunscreen residue. Will not use again."
I LOVE your products. I have been suffering with Rosacea for years. Now I do not have to use prescription creams because your Ultra Calming Make Up Remover and Moisturizer take care of my redness and flaking. I am so happy!
"I tried the Aveeno Calming Lotion last night. I woke up this morning with a bright red, itchy, swollen face. I have never had a reaction to lotion like this before. This product is not good."
I will never buy anything else other than this product. I am very lucky to have finally found this product. I have been using it for several years.. I never leave home without it.. Pleez never ever discontinue!!!!!
My face has always been dry and a little too rosy on my cheeks. This product is awesome and it calms my skin. I have always liked Aveeno and will purchase their products for the rest of my life. ^_^
My skin is acne prone and it doesn't need much moisturizing but this product left my skin feeling smooth and I began to noitce it evened out my skin tone. One bottle lasted for a good while. I recommend this product as a good daily moisturizer.
"This is my favorite moisturizer. I have oily skin to begin with, so I was worried this moisturizer would be greasy, but it's light weight and makes my skin very soft and smooth. It also works great for calming my skin."
"I bought this on a whim. I have very dry sensitive skin, and could not find a product that that helped. After the first week, my skin was soft and my mild acne had started to clear up. My skin has never looked better. I have also never received so many compliments about my skin. I have been a faithful buyer of this for over three years. I will never use another moisturizer. This is well worth the money."
"TERRIBLE PERFUME SMELL, HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS CALMING??? SMELL IS SO STRONG IRRITATES MY EYES AND NASAL PASSAGES. WHY WOULD YOU ADD THAT TO SOMETHING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CALMING AND FOR SENSITIVE SKIN??? DUMBFOUNDED"
"CLINICALLY PROVEN TO CALM SENSITIVE AND IRRITATED SKIN, WTF? REALLY? IF THIS CALMS YOUR SKIN THEN YOU DON'T HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. WASTED WAY TOO MUCH MONEY ON THIS."
"I've been using this product for YEARS and it's great. (Seriously, at least 8 years nearly daily). My routine is to cleanse my face (wash and/or micellar water) and then use this in the morning under my makeup. It even blends well with my foundation if I have drier skin or want a lighter makeup look. And I put it on right before bed. It provides great moisture (even when I was on accutane which is SUPER drying), but it feels weightless - never that sticky feeling from just putting on lotion. I love this product."
"While I have had an great experience with Aveeno's Eczema Therapy Moisturizer on my eczema prone skin, the Ultra Calming Moisturizer made my face sore as soon as I applied it, and it remained sore throughout the day/night I used it. It also made my face red. After a week of use, there was no change in these symptoms."
"This is comparatively expensive but the only moisturizer that soothes my hyper-sensitive skin. I've experimented with others but over the past 9 years I keep coming back to this one. In the winter I wear it as is, and in the summer I'll cut it with a thinner moisturizer and add a little higher SPF sunscreen."
"I love this moisturizer, it doesn't feel greasy or thick on face. It smells nice and is very good for my sensitive skin. The only thing i would say negative about it is i wish the SPF came in 30 or 50, i have very fair skin and would appreciate the higher SPF."
"I've been using this product for years (along with the Ultra Calming Foam Cleanser) and love them both! I get redness on my cheeks at times and these products have helped it to fade... Love it solely for that purpose! :) I like the smell of both these products..I actually bought the makeup removing wipes today and am sure that I'm going to love those, too!"
"I have been using this product for about 5 years. It is the only moisturizer I have ever used that has actually helped instead of harmed my skin. I use it every day, and it will last me about six months. I have never found anything better for my super sensitive skin."
This product really lives up to its claims. I have used it for two years now and my skin has shown great improvements in overall tone and even lightening of spots. I love that it is not at all greasy. My only complaint is that I wish it were available in at least a 30spf.
"I've tried many other products for sensitive skin and this is the only one that fits my skin perfectly. Every other brand, including the expensive brands either makes me itchy, break out, or keeps my face feeling oily and greasy all day. I'd give this 5 stars, but it does contain a small amount of parabens of which I'm not fond of."
"My skin can be quite finicky and I have had trouble finding a moisturizer that was light, had SPF and wouldn't clog pores. This was the answer! My skin always feels soft and refreshed. I have been using this everyday for the past two years! Thank you, Aveeno!"
"My move from Hawaii to Chicago in late fall proved the be harsh on my skin. I was almost peeling from the dry, cold air and wind hitting my face so I chose to switch moisturizers and decided on AVEENO® ULTRA-CALMING® Daily Moisturizer. It was a great decision as my face is much more back to normal and not getting as wind-burned or dry. Thank you, Aveeno!"
I used Eucerin face lotion before using this and my psoriasis on my face was having to be controlled with a additional Rx steroid cream. Once I started using Aveno ultra calming it took about 5 days for the psoriasis to clear up and I haven't had a problem since. That was a year ago. AWESOME!!!
Love how my face feels for the first hours.After about an hour my face feels greasy. It does help with the redness. I think it's better used as a night time moisturizer. Over all I love the product it does what it says. But would recommend it for night use.
"I really like this moisturizer because it's one of the very few products that does not irritate my skin! it actually does what it advertises, it calms my skin. Before I tried this, I had noticed some dry, irritated patches on my face. A few days after I started using this I noticed they had disappeared. I now use it everyday and plan to keep on buying it :D"
"I had never had sensitive skin until I reached my 40's. They I couldn't even put anything on my face without redness, itching and irritation. I was trying everything I could find. I did a little research online and found your product. I bought it and all of my problems went away. No more redness, itching or irritation. I will NEVER buy anything else! Thank you so much!!!!"
I just got this today and I have been dealing with a really nasty dry rash across my chin and upper lip and nothing was helping I got this today and have used 3 times within the day and see a noticeable difference the rash is getting a lot better and it doesn't itch as bad and is starting to fade so far I love this it has helped just within a day I highly recommend this product.
this formulation is not anywhere near as gentle as the old formula - be very careful.
I recommend this product for any woman that has problems with redness and dryness.
This moisturizer is perfect for any skin type and for my sensitive skin with rosacea.
great moisturizer even in hot humid weather
Works well and lives up to it's claim of healing. 15 SPF is a nice feature.
"this product is awesome!first moisturizer i've ever used that doesn't clog my pores and make me break out,even when i use it every day..great find!!"
"I tried this because my face is super sensitive and after I started using it, my face broke out in a rough and dreadful rash. I used their daily moisturizer before and it worked ok so I am surprised this product did poorly for my facial complexion."
This is the best moisturizer for sensitive skin I love it. I had a reaction from makeup nothing would sooth my skin but this. I made the mistake of trying something else never again will I do that. This is the best!!!
it was given to me as a sample and i love it!!!! i wash my face every morning and my face is dry and tight. i use just a dab and it's enough for my entire face and it just feels alive!
"This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used. It smells great but doesn't upset my sensitive skin and leaves my face fresh and naturally beautiful. By far the best product for my oily, sensitive skin."
"Hi, I've been using this product for years and it has always been tinted. I just received a bottle from an Amazon order and the lotion is white. Have you changed the color ?"
I think this product is awesome.it does what it claims it does.my face stays red all the time when I use this it works....no more redness.first time users will not be disappointed.
"Ive been using this product since my dermatologist recommended about 16 years ago. The bottle lasts forever since I only use it once a day to moisturize in the morning. I have very sensitive skin plus acne plus combo dry/oily. I have not noticed a difference in formula like everyone has said in their reviews, it still as effective as it has been the last 16 years. I can't imagine using any other product, don't discontinue this please, ever."
"I have been using Aveeno Ultra Calming moisturizer for sometime now... Have very sensitive skin... When my face is red,and irritated this really does the trick... However having a hard time locating it now... Just hope it hasn't been discontued?. Story of my life.. Find something that i like,and it is discontinued..."
"This is an excellent product for calming skin to reduce redness. I wish I had known of this long ago. I have redness on my chest, neck and arms. Daily use of this lotion and redness actually is gone. I never can find this on shelves in store so I buy it online for site to store."
"Red, itchy, bumpy face. Still not sure about the cause. Probably stress... This cream settled it right down and gave me peace of mind. I stopped using all of my skin care products when this started and I was afraid to try anything new. But when I saw ""ultra-calming"" I decided to take a chance. Sure glad I did. Thank you Aveenl!"
"I have very sensitive skin and always have really bad acne. I have tried many different products and while I liked the Positively Radiant Moisturizer, this one seems to help my skin even more. I use the Positively Radiant Morning Scrub, this, and the Positively Radiant Night Cream and see a huge difference! I will definitely continue using this combination."
"My skin has been very sensitive since the Spring-Summer months have begun. This product actually brings down redness on the skin and is very soothing. I would recommend this product to anyone who especially has sensitive skin. I will purchase this product, again, and again."
"I have extremely sensitive skin, and was looking for a daily moisturizer that wasn't greasy. Ive used neutro daily moisturizer that has spf 15 and it had that ""sun screen"" feel. This lotion is 100x better, not greasy and a little goes a long way. Def going to buy again!"
"This product is one of my favorites it moisturize my skin without being greasy. It's a very light and it has SPF which is a plus for a daytime moisturizer. The redness calming effect works great, I would prefer if it came in SPF 30 since I live in FL where is very sunny all year!"
"I love, love, love this product. I have been using it for years. I love the way my skin feels and that it calms my red splotches. I live in interior Alaska. This is the only product I have found that defends my skin against the dry -40 temps without being too heavy. <3 <3"
Been using this for years. & I always get compliments on my skin. Its helped me reduce redness. & it's 1 product I can't live without! Must try! I didn't give it 5 stars because in the winter time my skin does get a little dry and the moisturizer doesn't help as much as id like but it still makes a Huge difference.
This is my favorite product aside from the clear complexion line. I have struggled with bad skin my whole life and aveeno has been a big help. The ultra calming lotion is great for my dry skin without making me break out or leaving my skin oily. Thank you for making this product and winning free product would really help me out because I spend lots of money on thw aveeno face washes make up cloths daily face pads lotions and shrubs.
"I have never used Aveeno products before, but I was curious to try this one because I have sensitive, oily skin with redness in my nose and chin. On the first use I felt stinging when I applied it and the redness in my face was more noticeable. I continued using it for three weeks to see if I would get used to it, but I still feel stinging every day, the redness is still worse, and I have even noticed my makeup doesn't last all day anymore. This just doesn't work for my skin so I am switching back to my old moisturizer."
"I think this product is great. I am 20 and still get a lot of acne and redness. This moisturizer really makes my skin less red and I don't have as many breakouts as I used to. It's not overly greasy either. It was a little more expensive than other moisturizers, but well worth it considering how well it clears my skin and that the same bottle has lasted me 6 months."
"For a ""sensitive skin"" product its really weird to me that this product isn't fragrance free??"
This is the only lotion that I can use because my skin is so sensitive. I love it!!!!
I have to return this product. It made break out in a horrible rash on my face.
I like how they are bigger than most calming wipes. Also its nice to not have to put anything sticky on your skin.
I love this moisturizer I have been using this for about three years daily. I recommend it to everyone with sensitive skin.
"I've used this product for years now..always get compliments on my skin....I have roscea, and I helps keeo me moisturized!"
"I really enjoy this product Aveeno Ultra Calming Facial Moisturizer with SPF 15 not only does my facial skin feel protected., its creamy, only takes a small amount for my skin, and smells good and clean."
very gentle. lightweight. doesn't bother my eyes. (some moisturizers do) I've recently recovered from Rosacea and sill have extremely sensitive skin prone to breakouts.
I bought the Aveeno for my rosacea. My skin is very dry and I hoped it would help. It has soften my skin alittle. Not sure yet if I will keep it or not. I have only had it for a week
It worked really badly for me. I thought it would reduce my redness but it didn't it actually cause me to break out a lot on my chin & on my forehead.
"Pump keeps breaking. Happens with many bottles. Posted video at Aveeno Facebook page and they just deleted it. Tried again, they deleted again. Video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slvzlDAeB1s"
I never leave the house without it! I have tried so many products. This is the only one that works and does not irritate my skin. Thank you for creating the perfect balance.
"My skin is sensitive & prone to oiliness. This is the best moisturizer I've tried, & I've tried a lot of them! It is soothing, fast-absorbing, & non-greasy. It also helps to keep my skin matte. Love!"
I have very sensitive skin and have used this product for a few years. It works great! It's non-greasy and calms redness. It doesn't feel heavy and has never caused a breakout. I love this product.
I love this moisturizer. My skin is ultra sensative and I have tried everything and Aveeno is the only products I use now because nothing works as good or as gently.
"Simply stated, I love this product!! My skin is crazy sensitive to most products. This lotion manages to keep my skin soft and hydrated without irritating it. I have used it for years and I will continue to for years to come!"
This moisturizer is amazing and light weight and it works perfect for my skin been using it since it came out on the market and will continue to use it as long as it's being offered and I can find when my supply runs low.
I am flying to my grandson's wedding. Of course you can't take your normal size products on a plane. I wonder if you would have samples for the foaming cleaner and the spf lotion so I can keep on with usual face care. I really like your products and would just like samples to take on the plane. Thank you.
"Dear Aveeno,"
"I wish I could send you a photo of what angry skin looks like! I am hoping I can be a good example of before and after! Today is day one of me switching from Clinique skin care to your Calming line! I can't give a legitimate rating yet, but I hoping to change this to 5 stars. I took a great closeup shot of just how bad my skin is right now."
The product was not worth the price because it ended up break me out really bad. In places where I really dont even get pimples. The scent was to strong for a product that calims to be for sensitive skin. I wouldn't recommend it for people that have acne problems. I used it for about a week. the first couple of days my skin seemed to be doing fine but then it went crazy.
My skin has changed tremendously since giving birth a year ago. I used to have extremely oily skin and now I have dry/sensitive skin. I have tried several daily moisturizers and so far this is the only one that has addressed all of my skin issues. My skin stays moisturized throughout the day without producing a greasy mess and my cheeks are no longer red and flushed. I can't give 5 stars because it has only been a week BUT my skin usually lets me know pretty quickly when it is unhappy with a product.
"I use all of the products in this line, I love it! I wish they still had the over night cream :("
My 20 year old daughter swears by this product to moistureize her face. Says it is the best moisturizer. Who am I to argue with that?
I have very sensitive skin. This is the only moisturizer that doesn't break my skin out. It has no oil.
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it as a day lotion, and I use the Aveeno Clear Complextion at night. Absolutely wonderful products!"
"Absorbs into the skin quickly and reduces redness and irritation over night... Over all great product, will be repurchasing"
The scent is very calming. The texture of the lotion is just right for my face even I perspire a lot.
"Took away the redness in my skin in 2 days. Smells great, feels great. It's Aveeno .. enough said! : )"
So glad that I picked this kind to try about 2 years ago. I haven't used anything since. And the bottles last along time.
I love this sunscreen/moisturizer! It really does calm the redness after a few days of use. I wish there was a night cream as well!
I recently began using this and the face wash. My face feels so refreshed and smooth. I convinced all of my cousins and now they're believers too!!!!
I just bought this product yesterday in hopes to battle my extremely sensitive skin. So far so good!! And it smells great!!
Love this on my face after shower in the am. Skin feels smooth and no breakouts.
"This product is hard to find in any store, but I'm glad it is available online at Walmart."
"Great product, does what it says, calms senstive skin!"
The older I get the more sensitive my face gets. I finally found something that works.
Love this lotion it has everything you need in one bottle.
"This moisturizer calms and soothes my sensitive, dry skin. Love this product!"
Does anyone else have this problem? I love it but what a pain to use the pump as a stick to get some out every day.
"I haven't tried this product yet, but looking forward to trying it out. My skin is always dry."
