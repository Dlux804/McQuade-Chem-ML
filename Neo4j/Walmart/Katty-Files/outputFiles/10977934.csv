I have been using ProX for 4 plus years . The 32 spf got me started using it because I needed a good sunscreen for my face since I play a lot of outdoor tennis. The bonus is how much it has improved my skin. I also noticed how it has minimized face wrinkles. I am really sold on this product and use it every day. Thanks ProX!
"I am so happy with this product. Rich, creamy lotion. Plus 30 SPF. The ultra-expensive lotions are not any better than this product, so why pay more?"
WOW! I've been using your Pro x line for about two weeks and my crow's feet and my above-the-nose frown lines are half as deep as they were before! The feathered lines above my lip are also far less noticeable. Finally! Something that does what it says it's going to do. Even my 74 year old mother is having some improvement that shows on her face! I've been using Olay since I was 13 and I'm 46 now. People think I'm far younger than I am ...Genetics or Olay? Who CARES! LOL! I'm a believer!
Love Olay! Have been using Olay products since my twenties; been using ProX now for several years. I'm 42 and get compliments on my skin all the time. I use Olay ProX age repair lotion with SPF 30 in the morning and Olay Total Effects 7 in One anti-aging night cream at night. Both work great against fine lines and wrinkles.
"I couldn't find this WONDERFUL product on the shelf; so, I ordered it online. When I got it, I couldn't wait to start using it again. I tried other moisturizers promising the world, but they don't hold a candle to ProX. Funny, the container was white inside not red. It seemed a little thicker than I remember. If your package has changed, please let me know. I'm still going to use it, because I believe in Oil of Olay."
I found this product by trusting the Olay name. I am extremely happy with the results. I use it as a night cream. The best price was at Walmart.
Sort of heavy on the face at first but is non greasy so it gets absorbed afterwards. Good product.
"I used to use Estee Lauder, Lancome, Clinique, etc. But my friend told me that Olay can compare with those department store brands skin care products, so I tried it recently. I bought two different lotion, this one and Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Micro-Sculpting Serum. This lotion is very dry, I don't like it. I wonder why it's named Moisturizer? It didn't moisturize the skin at all, I wound't recommend this lotion, but I do like the Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Micro-Sculpting Serum!"
"I use and like the Olay Regenerist products, so I thought I'd try this lotion with sunscreen. Unfortunately , it makes my eyes sting so I can't use it on my face."
"This is one of the best creams I've ever used, including products that have cost $150.00. Sun damage has been reduced or eliminated and it keeps hydrating all day. Very comfortable as it never feels heavy. Try it and you'll never use anything else."
"I've been using the Age Repair Lotion since it first came out. I absolutely love it!!! I do NOT feel the lotion leaves a greasy feeling. For me it is a very cool and smooth feeling, very refreshing. It still amazes me each time I use it what a difference it makes to my face. Not only does it feel great but it gives my face a fresh, bright and youthful look. I get comments frequently that I look 20-25 years younger than my age, and I credit this product for a lot of it."
"I've been using Pro-X moisturizer for over 3 years now. It works very well under foundations and alone. I've tried others: Clinque, Lancome, and even the Total Effects is good but for me the Pro-X works best. I thought it was just my thinking - until I noticed when I run out and use others then return back to Pro-X I get compliments from various people some who see me all the time comments like ""wow your skin looks good"" or ""you have a glow"". I'm finding it hard to find in stores these days."
I purchased Olay Professional ProX Anti-Aging Age Repair Lotion with sunscreen. I thought I was buying a moisterizer but when I opened the box and read the directions it says: Apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply at lease every 2 hours. Use water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating. Can someone tell me is this just a sunscreen or is it a moisterizer with sunscreen? I am sure I just don't understand the wording.
I've been using this product for several years and have always loved the way it makes my skin look and feel. It actually has a brightening effect. I've tried other products but always go back to using it since nothing else compares. The SPF 30 gives me the confidence to know that my skin not only looks good but is protected from damaging rays. That's important at any age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion is the best that I have ever used. It not only moisturizes but also provides SPF 30 protection that really works. I used it every day both with and without makeup depending on what I'm doing. It is wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is amazing. It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue. It erases fine lines and provides all-day protection from the sun. My skin feels firmer. No one can guess my real age. the usually guess 10-15 years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Good skin is a balance between lucky genes, great produces and care. You can't control the genes but you can control the other two. I spend a lot of time outside and I wear sunscreen 365 days a year. I swim, hike, ski, garden, etc; sunscreen alone is nice but I want age repair as well. This product is the perfect combination. I am very happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love knowing that my face is protected from the sun every time I apply my favorite face moisturizer. Never leave the house without it. Would give it a 5 star but it is a little on the expensive side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using ProX Age Repair Lotion every day for many years. I love that it makes my skin feel so soft and that at the same time I'm protecting my face and neck with sunscreen. It absorbs quickly and allows me to put on my choice of makeup without having to wipe off any excess ""grease"". People drop their jaw in surprise when I tell them that I'm 74 years old. Good Genes and ProX! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is perfect for preparing your face for the day, the SPF combined with the moisture. It gives my face the needed moisture, I have compliments all the time and have given some many my daily routine. Which of course starts with this staple, I have faithfully been using this product for 3 years and younger looking everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My Dermatologist recommended this product because I told him other moisturizers with a high SPF made my eyes water. He said Olay products don't. I have used their products for many years. They are always well reviewed and especially this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Friends gave me unsolicited compliments on my ""young and fresh"" appearance after using Pro-X Age Repair SPF 30 for just one month -- no other product I've used in ~10 years has elicited this kind of reaction. I love the Pro-X line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using Olay Pro X about 3 years ago Since starting I have noticed I no longer have dry flaking skin. First thing I do when I get out of the shower is use Pro X. I get the added benefit of putting on sunscreen every morning [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay is the only product I use. My skin looks great and feels smooth. I've been using Olay for years, I love it. I now have my oldest daughter using your products. We buy the bars of soap, moisturizer, the body wash and other Olay products as well. My daughter and I love the product's and won't use anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for over 5 years. It has kept my skin soft and supple and protected from the sun. I don't go a day without applying Pro-X repair lotion on my skin. Even my kids have remarked at how young my skin looks. I highly recommend!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for 8 months - love how it feels on my skin, and the sun screen is a nice bonus. It wears well under makeup, and does not clog or cause breakouts.

"I have tried many products to repair my sun damaged skin, wrinkles and large clogged pores. This repair lotion not only did what it claims to do but, the results are noticeable in such a short time it was amazing. No only does it repair my sun damaged blotchiness but it has a great sun screen so I don't have to apply another layer on top of it. I would recommend it to anyone who has uneven skin tone or not. just to keep your skin in great condition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product along with the entire ProX system for 2 years. The difference in my overall skin tone and firmness is dramatic. People ask me what I use and I tell them only Olay ProX. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a senior citizens who has been trying for a long time to find a product that replaces my expensive department store brand. Pro-X Lotion does everything I need it to do. It brightens, exfoliates and leaves my skin looking luminous. It is a snap to put on my foundation, no tugging of skin. Love the fact that it has a SPF 30 built in. Olay you have a new convert and the price is right! I have recommended this to all of my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I started using this cream, I could tell a difference in my skin the next day. I believe it does everything it says it will do.

"I have been using this product ever since it came out. I moved from total effects to Pro X because of the UVA rating of 30. It smooth's your skin, and keeps it moisturized and hydrated all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used to use the expensive department store products. Welllllll, I tried Pro-X Age Repair lotion, and absolutely LOVED it. The wrinkles and lines have been smoothed away; my neck looks much better. I have used Olay products for years, now. Several of my neighbors, who are my age (68), have started using the Pro-X Repair Lotion, and they love it, too. My skin feels and looks wonderful. Thank you!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for over two years now. It seems to help my skin with the sun. I have sensitive skin and I live in a sunny state. When I use this product I feel my skin is protected and I have less irritation when I clean my face in the evening after I've been exposed to the sun.

"I have been using Pro-X Age Repair Lotion for a month now, and I have received several compliments on my skin! I thought there was a visible difference, but when other people commented, I was sure of It. Thank you for this miracle lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This goes on nice and smooth. It spreads well. I can't say it reverses wrinkles like my Clinque laser (sp) but that is a serum. The reason for the 3 stars- I find my makeup doesn't go on well on top of this lotion. It doesn't matter how long I let the lotion dry, they still don't blend. Maybe I use too much lotion? I like it best on days I don't wear makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pro-X Age Repair Lotion with sunscreen is my favorite Olay product. Having turned 67, boy do I need it! Pro-X makes me look 10 years younger! And it worked really fast, I could see a huge difference within a week. Keep up to good work Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Always works better than any other wrinkle cream. I layer it with the latest new formulas.
Have used this for several years and it seemed to keep wrinkles from progressing any further and generally kept my skin in beautiful condition. But it's been gone from stores for months. Please restock it!
"I first bought this a year ago. It was on clearance at my local Walmart for 8 dollars. I love it because it moisturized so well, but it also makes my skin look and feel amazing. I don't break out as much, and it protects from sun damage..."
I have used this for many years now and find that this is the best product for my sensitive skin. I use it every morning and rarely wear makeup. An added bonus is that I never get sunburned now. The sunscreen in the formula works very well.
