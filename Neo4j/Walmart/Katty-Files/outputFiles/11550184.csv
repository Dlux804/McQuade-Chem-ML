"Very pleased with this product as it isn't heavy or greasy, yet it keeps my skin soft and hydrated throughout the night. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't cause any discomfort. I highly recommend it for women with sensitive skin who are looking for an anti-wrinkle cream that won't irritate their skin. It works great!"
"i find this to be a quality and effective treatment. i am 61 and my skin looks good. of course this is a night treatment, but i take care in the day too. i use their astringent, and face cloths to clean off all make up. love the products !"
"I truly see a difference in my wrinkles - they have been very softened after using this product for a few months. I use the Neutrogena Retinol Oil serum after cleansing at night followed by this deep wrinkle moisturizer. My skin feels hydrated without that heavy, oily feeling. This cream absorbs so well and I love it! It works if you give it a month or two."
I have used this product for many years and am pleased with the results.
I am very sensitive to most products but I have no problems using this. Keeps my skin smooth.
"Love the fact that there is no greasy oily residue, just softness. I have old, sun damaged, sun spotted skin. I also like that it does not smell. I will be using the entire tube and report back on the results, as I just purchased it. Upon application I have not received any redness, my skin is fair and very sensitive."
I like the way it feels on my skin. I can't swear that I have less wrinkles sadly.
I would not recommend the product. It did not work even a little bit on my fine lines. It does moisturize but nothing else
"I have used Neutrogena in the past with great success and love most of their products. I wanted to ""up"" my night regiment by using this cream to smooth and minimize wrinkles early on. However, after using this product two times, my face swelled up like a balloon to the point where I had to go to the doctor to help with the swelling. I have never had an issue with any other cream used. Just a warning to be careful when applying to sensitive skin."
"use this product daily at night as follows: 2 pumps plus 3 pumps of neutrogena oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin. the results are outstanding!! am 77 fair dryish skin plus lots of sun damage catching up to me from my 20s thru 40s, ie deep wrinkles! however with these two amazing and effective affordable products am seeing vast improvement in the reduction of the deep lines!!"
thank you neutrogena!!
"I wanted an affordable retinol and this fit the bill. Kept my skin moisturized while it went to work on my skin - my sister noticed a difference in about two weeks. It helped reduce my fine lines with little irritation. Some people may notice some sensitivity at first, like with any retinol product, and you can start by using it just every three days or every other day and it should help with that. I absolutely recommend it as an effective product all the time, along with an effective sunscreen."
"This product is excellent for middle class women like me, older than 40, making less than $75,000 a year. It is a night-time only cream because it causes exfoliation overnight. It causes the surface facial skin to slough off, revealing the newest skin below. In the morning, scrub off the exfoliated skin, and use a good hydrating day cream, and a good foundation, because exfoliation causes uneven tone, along with the wrinkle reductions."
"I used this product as directed for about 3 weeks with good results until I awakened one morning to discover my face was swollen in all of the areas treated by the product. That was about 1 month ago, and now I regret ever using the product. I am no longer able to use soaps, moisturizers, and foundations of any sort on the skin around my mouth, chin, and neck without risking peeling, followed by a burning, rash-like reaction. I would give anything to return my skin to its previous state before I started using this product."
"Started using the repaid wrinkle repair moisture and serum and filler in April and now almost 4 months later I'm looking 10 years younger. My skin almost overnight started having wrinkles on my cheeks and around my mouth but since using these products I can honestly say its like night and day the results. My son is getting married in Dec and I was so upset about my skin, but now they can take all the pictures they want, 70 is not even a worry anymore since I found Neutrogena. Thank You"
I have been using this product at night for about two months and just bought another tube today. It really smooths my skin and is helping break up a rather large sun spot. I feel its tingle and I know it's working. I use to use Olays Regenerist serum but found this to have more results.
"I am so impressed with this product. I've only been using it for a few days and my complexion is smooth and clear! I've used a more expensive brand before but this is so afffordable and I feel it works just as well, if not better, than the more expensive night cream I used. I love it and I'm loving my skin right now!"
I have been using this product for over a year now and my skin has significantly improved. It's wonderful on acne and acne scars. I also noticed that my skin is smoother with less wrinkles. This product beats out the expensive department store products!
I used this for 3 weeks & then one morning woke up with red swollen skin all over my face but especially on cheekbones & around the nose & mouth. I haven't been able to wear any moisturizer or foundation for 2 days & alternating ice & heat to control swelling. Ice is working but I won't buy this again.
"I bought this product because of the success I have had with the day product with the sun protection in it. For some reason though it cause the largest, most painful pimples I have ever had on my cheeks. Not sure if it is because of a contradiction with the day product, or an ingredient in the night product causing the problem."
"I have only been using this product for a month and I am so excited to have come across a deep moisturizing cream that doesn't irritate and delivers what it advertises. I am 43 years old and for the first time in my life I have found the only cream that reduces oilyness, congestion, and dry patches. I can't wait to try the serum to see what great things it will do for my skin."
"I also have used Rapid Wrinkle Repair moisturizer for more than a year. This product adds a ""Deep Wrinkle moisture."" Am still confused which product contains the stronger amount of Retinol, therefore I alternate the use of each. I do think my face is smoother and a bit more toned."
"i expected to see my under eye wrinkles become less visible within two weeks. i wasn't too worried about the time frame but once i started using this product, the skin around my eyes have become very dry and red and very sensitive to the touch. it has been about a week and a half, and i have not been using to every night due to the issues i was having but im still trying!"
"PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO BUY. THIS IS A GENTLE BUT EFFECT PRODUCT. I USE IT AT NIGHT, BUT I ALSO USE DURING THE DAY FROM TIME TO TIME. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WITH OTHER PRODUCTS, I HAD TO APPLY A SERUM PLUS OTHER FACIAL PRODUCTS. THIS PRODUCT ALLOWS ME TO APPLY ONE VERY EFFECTIVE APPLICATION."
"I'm starting to get those lovely lines on my forehead. Thought I'd try out a wrinkle cream so I picked this one up. And now, 10 days later, I am so surprised and excited by how much my wrinkles have dissappeared! Thank you for making an affordable cream that works!!"
I absolutely love this product! It improved the texture of my skin immediately and cleared up my acne in 10 days and I'm still clear with continued use! I've suffered from acne for 15 years and this moisturizer was gentle yet effective and helps with fine lines too. I have combination dry to oily skin and this lotion worked perfectly for me. I'm having a difficult time finding it in stores now. Please continue this product!
"I love this product so much .My face was so dry and I tried many different product but they gave me the sticky feeling plus acne ,finally I decided to use this one and it is the best Moisturizer for my skin ever. my skin is smooth and so soft ,makes me wanna touch my face all the time lol"
Help! I used this night wrinkle cream on my forehead and started to notice the center of my forehead seemed to be turning lighter but not my whole forehead. Parts were darker. So I tried reapplying for about a week longer thinking I may not have covered my whole forehead but it isn't helping. My forehead actually looks like the center of it is one color with dark blotches around it. Help! How do I fix this discoloration of my forehead???
"I have only been using this product for 3 days and can already see a difference in my skin. Although I'm not using this for wrinkles as I don't have those just yet, it has given my skin a nice glow and has impressed me already. I will continue using this product and I would recommend it to others."
"Sinks right in and my skin looks good. I am 53 and have very few wrinkles. It is mostly good genes, but since I have been using this product there have been no new wrinkles or problems. It feels good and I like the ease of buying online. I am saving a lot since I stopped using the brands from the dept store and the results are the same or better."
"Love most of the Neutrogena products, and this one is no exception."
"I love this so far. I put it on over my moisturizer at night and have noticed that my wrinkles around my eyes are much less pronounced in the morning. It seems really hydrating, though I still put it on over moisturizer."
"Here's all I'm saying...I'm 62 years old. I was in the grocery store a week ago buying some things for my two grandbabies. The clerk asked me how old ""MY"" baby was!!!! Enough said!! Thanks, Neutrogena"
Use this every night and wrinkles are almost gone! It helps with skin dryness too. I use the day version every day. Showed these to my skin doctor and he said they would be good to use.
What percentage retinol is it?
It's almost last on the lengthy ingredients list - that's also mostly parabeans which is known to be horrible for your skin.
How can this be anti-aging if retinol is barely in it?
You really only need a dab the size of an English pea to get the job done with this moisturizer. It is very effective. I have noticed an improvement in the appearance of fine lines and overall skin clarity. It is light and feels great. I am hooked!
This is a great product. I'm 39 years old and was beginning to have some deep brow wrinkles due to squinting. Used this for two weeks and they were gone. They were only indicator of my age and now everyone says I look about 30.
I love this stuff!! I just started using product. It's AMAZING! My sun spots are gone! My skin looks great. Soft beautiful skin. Beats all those expensive products I have tried for less money. Thanks Neutrogena.
"Best anti-aging cream on the market. Hands down! I I use liquid Neutrogena facial cleanser to remove every trace of make up, a toner, and then this cream at night. Love what it does to my skin."
"Love this product! But where has the daytime product,ageless intensives deep wrinkle moisture with spf 20 gone? My friends and I feel this is your best product recommend it to everyone!Truely a miraculous product. Please continue it."
It's good but has an odor to it.
Love It [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this product 3weeks ago , now my face has broken out in itchy red blotches!"
I use this product on my hands in conjunction with my regular hand cream. It smooths them and makes them look younger.
"I can see difference just after one use. My skin is soft and less wrinkle! It's amazing , better than some expensive products."
"My skin looks better and younger, my wrinkles are much less noticeable. I would definitely recommend this product."
Reduces lines under my eyes and makes my face smooth. This product is awesome!
I put Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Night Moisturizer every night on my face.
I recommend ROC for retinol products. I found the cream doesn't absorb well into the skin.
I have only used this 4 times but it seems to be working. My skin feels softer and smoother under makeup.
Amazing results in just a few nights of treatment any small lines totally disapeared I am so impressed with your line of skin care S. Freis
The Deep Wrinkle cream for night time is great. The day Deep Wrinkle cream is great as well. My friends and I have never had our skin look so great. Please bring back the Deep Wrinkle day cream so we can look great again.
I am really satisfied with this product and sevice. I highly recommend this product
"I had a pretty noticable worry line above one of my eyebrows, more like a furrow. Within a matter of days I couldn't tell there had ever been anything there."
Good news. I have found a lot of the Deep Wrinkle Moisture daytime cream at many Target stores in Los Angeles county. I have told my friends as we all LOVE this product and it make our skin look GREAT. Thank you Neutrogena.
"Love it, been using it for years. Works great on wrinkles, and I don't think anyone should feel that it ever too late to start. My skin looks great, most people think I am at least 10 years younger than my real age!"
"I start using this product and the serum. The first day my skin got red and itchy. I stop for one day, when I used again my whole face got red and big, including the eyes. I will never used again. I bought these products for the brand image. I am completely disappointed."
"This product has made my skin red, dry and extremely light sensitive. I bought some just about a 6 weeks ago. Using it gradually. My face was a mess red blotchy itchy and sensitive. I stopped for a week to allow my skin to recover. Tried again gradually increasing the use and again the same results! Dry red extremely sensitive skin. Really disappointed in the product. Will have to go back to my more expensive Skinceutical line."
"I have used the Neutrogena intensives for years and have often been told how much younger I look than my actual chronical age.. Only problem is finding this product at [...]. I have only been able to purchase the original daytime cream, therefore, I am ordering online."
"I'm having a hard time finding this product at ""brick & mortar"" retailers, so when I found it on the walmart.com website, I ordered it. I like the product, since I've been using it for quite awhile. However, what I liked better was that walmart shipped it to me for free & I had it within a few days! Great service!"
"I've been using this product for months and there hasn't been any difference in the appearance of my 11. I am really disappointed, because the reviews, on different sites, stated it would work, but it doesn't, so don't waste your money on this. Perhaps, if you have a very, very light 11, it will work, but if you have a normal aging 11, it will do absolutely nothing in reducing those lines."
I've used Neutrogena products for over 40 years. The Ageless Intensive Deep Wrinkle Moisturizers are the best of all the day and night time products for my skin at my age. I'm very disappointed that you have discontinued the Deep Wrinkle Day Time SPF 20 moisturizer. Any chance of putting it back on the market?
this product have change me.my face look different and I feel young.I had been using for more then 1a year . But t was undering if you have something for steach marks in the body.
"I bought this product expecting great things and I do believe it does work, but while working, it has left me with white lines all over my face. It actually looks like bleach lines? Nothing makes them better or worse and noticed after 3 days use :("
It keeps my skin moisturized all night and I notice a glow whenever I wear it!!
my skin feels so smooth in the morning after I use it!
"I haven't consistently used it every night since it came about 10 days ago, but it feels really good and I already see some improvement."
"This product made my skin very soft. I love it, too bad it's so expensive."
Really like this!
