"I noticed a difference within hours of using this product. I have sensitive skin and hesitated to try anything new, but after I applied this product I only noticed a slight tingling. My skin looks smoother and feels softer. I plan to use this moisturizer on a regular basis. I'm very happy with the results."
"I have been using Ageless Intensives for more years than I can remember and now, as I turn 80 next year, seem to have few wrinkles especially on my neck. I particularly like that the products have SPF 15 or 20 and give me the protection from the sun that my fair freckled skin needs. The daily cream is not heavy and a perfect base for makeup. The night cream is not greasy and very absorbent."
I've been using this product for a few months and definitely see an improvement in fine lines and wrinkles...plus it's an excellent sunscreen.
I have been using this product forever......faithfullu on a daily basis. Would not want to be without it.
I have used this product for many years and get complements on my face skin.
I've used Neutrogena for years. This is a good product but I have to say I haven't really noticed any improvement over the Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle cream that wasn't deep wrinkle. Maybe I haven't used it long enough or maybe at 66 years there's not much that can be done about deep wrinkles. I will keep using it.
"I have extremely sensitive skin, so it is hard to find a face cream that will not cause breakouts. This formula goes on smooth without a greasy feel. I have not had a break out yet. I put it on every morning under my make up. Hopefully it continues to work for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love the products and the way my skin feels using these products.
"I haven't really used Neutrogena products, but thought I would give this one a try. It ended up being fine as a moisturizer, but I like the feel of L'Oreal moisturizers better - they make my face feel softer and smoother, and at my age, I need that!"
"I have always like Neutrogena products since the 1970's when my mom bought me the ""see through"" body soap! I keeping with tradition I have my daughter use the acne products and she is very happy. I picked up the ""Ageless Intensives"" and noticed a difference that same day."
"I am a 50 something woman and have been using this product for several years now and have seen a significant improvement in my skin......clear, glowing and healthy. I constantly get compliments on my skin and you can't beat the value. As for the comments on the smell, I don't understand that because this product seems fragrance free to me. I am sensitive to fragrance and this does not irritate my skin at all."
"This product is amazing! I usually wake up with lines on the side of my nose, between the lower eyelid & cheek bone and on one side of my lip from the way I sleep. It usually takes a few hours to disappear naturally, but this product plumps and smooths out with in minutes... Thank you neutrogena for making my mornings start off right:)"
"I'm 50 Y-O and haven't really taken care of my skin. I did Botox several years ago but can't afford it anymore and frankly, it could have been the DR, but I just wasn't happy with the results. This stuff is Incredible!! I truly SAW results the next morning! I am a REAL PERSON stating this is a Great Product! Blessings, LC/Westlake, OH"
"I have been using Rainbath Refreshing Shower Gel for many years and I love it. I never thought about using anything other than Clinique for my face till I had to look for a more economical product that did the job. I am very glad I tried the Ageless Intensives line, the results and the savings have been amazing. I am 57 years old and I just want to thank Neutrogena for keeping my skin looking young."
I have tried many moisturizers but once I discovered this I haven't used anything else. I even have my 77 yr old Mom and my sister using this. It goes on and dries quickly to put under your makeup. I'm 52 and have been told many times I have beautiful skin. I don't hesitate to tell anyone it's Neutragena! I have used the makeup remover for many many years. It is my one item I cannot live without!
"I love this product! I, too, am sensitive to fragrances and cannot detect fragrance in this. I asked friends and family if it was offensive to them and they did not notice a bad smell either. I would recommend this to anyone noticing facial lines and looking for a sunscreen and moisturizer combo!"
"I am fifty-something and use this product every single day. One cannot always gauge one's own skin improvement, but others can! My husband has commented that my skin looks wonderful and to keep using whatever is keeping it that way! Even my dental hygienist asked me if I'd had a facelift! It is so nice to be complemented like that. In short, try this product and see what happens."
"I was just sitting here at my computer, and for whatever reason, was running my fingertips over my forehead...and it clicked, ""WOW, I'm hardly feeling those deep lines anymore!"" Don't get me wrong, they are still there- I'm feeling them, but they are not deep like they have been for so very long..... =D So, I found the Neutragena website, searched for the new product I had bought, just so I could let them know~ IT WORKS, and I've barely begun my use of it! ."
"He was complaining that he was starting get that deep forehead wrinkle. So I gave him my tube and bought myself another one. Well, now he is a regular user, his skin which tends to be oily looks great and his forehead looks younger than many men younger than his 69 years. Myself it is a miracle worker on my neck, my neck makes me look at least ten years younger thanks to this formula. I also add the liquid Ultra sheer SPF 70 sunscreen my neck."
"I have been using this for over 6 months. It sinks right in and I feel my skin looks good and I haven't developed any new wrinkles. I bought this to replace higher end dept store brands and I think it has performed as well or better. But hey, I am 53 and there are no miracles.With this product I believe I am ageing gracefully"
"I've been using this product for a while now. Approximately 3 months. It sinks into the skin nicely, no oily feeling; feels great actually, and it's doing what it says it would. I have moderate acne prone skin and this has not made me break out. Buy it, you will not be sorry!"
"Bought this product at cvs, after the first use I notice I had had very dry flaky skin, a specially around my eyes and cheeks and then the following day my eyes swelled up, with scaly dry patches on my eyelids ( at that point I stopped using the product). It took a week for my red, dry skin to recover. I would never use this product again. After some research I have read similar experience to me from other users."
Very disappointed and suprised this product is still allowed to sell.
I love this deep wrinkle cream for day use. It has SPF 20 which does not cause me to breakout as many other creams do. I put on the Ageless Intensives serum first after cleansing followed by this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and works PERFECTLY under make up. I have seen a huge difference in the appearance of my skin after using the Ageless Intensives Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle line of products. I truly hope that Neutrogena never discontinues this line. It really works!!
"I use this every morning, and I have no visible wrinkles, even at age 65!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It works, I am 75 saw results and not at the $80 or more products on the market. Cleans every nite. And apply"
"Purchased this item recently, used a small amount on my face and had an intense allergic reaction and woke up barely able to open my eyes! I do not recommend this product!!!!"
"I am not sure if it would work as well for everyone but as for me, it worked great! My skin looks like it did 10 years ago. Grant it, it's a bit pricey but itI think it's worth it. I would buy it in bulk if I could!"
It moisturizes and plump up the top layer of skin cells very nicely. This with the anti-aging serum work very well together. And the daytime version with the SPF is great as well.
This is the best of all anti- wrinkle daily moisturizer I have ever tried. perfect all day under make-up. You can see results in days. A little pearl size dollop and you are good to go!
"I have tried many ,many creams and moisturizers for my face and neck and eyes. Nothing has worked as well and for as long as I have been using Neutrogena products. My skin is 65 plus years old and it feels and looks better than when I was 40."
"I have been using this for 2 weeks. I did a lot of research an I have found that this tops all the other high price items. Not only that, it does what it says."
"My skin looks much better, does not feel oily, and product did not change my texture color. In total honesty the odor is not bad and barely noticeable compared to other product that trigger headaches for me."
"I use this in day time, makes skin have moisture and protects from the sun. Wrinkles are decreasing, crows feet are almost gone! I also use the night version. My skin doctor said it is a good product doing a good job."
"I have used this product for a long time and sometimes I will try something else, but always go back to this. The moisture is just right and for under make-up."
So far every product I have purchased from Neutrogena has made my skin softer and look younger! My pores are smaller and my dark circles are almost gone!!
I have tried to find effective products for years and have spent considerable money on very expensive products. These Neutrogena products have started working in less than two weeks and I can already see some results.
"Burning, Tingly, Flaky, Dry Skin"
"I have always loved Neutrogena products but this one is a huge disappointment! After, roughly, one week of use my skin began to burn and tingle horribly bad. Mainly around my eyes, under my eye was worse, high cheek bone area. Now my skin is very dry and flaky almost like I have a sunburn. I definitely would not recommend this product!"

"Used this for two days and experienced major skin peeling. My face was so raw and painful, I had to apply burn lotion and cortisone to get some relief. Skin was falling off me in big, scaly flakes. Actually didnt leave the house for two days because it just looked and felt awful."
Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After three mornings use, my face developed brown/ red patches and also dry rough places in areas around my face. I had to use makeup to hide the look. Is this project supposed to rid skin of pre cancor cells? I am not an allergic person! Neutrogena, PLEASE EXPLAIN!"
This is the ONLY product I can use as a day moisturizer and sunscreen that does not redden and dry out the skin around my eyes.
Haven seen to much change yet.Still trying I like the way it makes my skin feels. Goes on so smooth and dry so fast.doen't feel thick.
Has a good result
"I love this product but I HATE the tube! Neutrogena, please change it! Half way through using the first tube there was a hole in the tube. The directions say to 'recap tube tightly' but in doing so the tube gets twisted which causes more product to come out and causes holes in the tube. The product is a 5 but because of the tube, I'm rating it a 3. Please change the tube. Thanks in advance!"
My skin tone and over all elasticity have improved drastically. I love this product!
This product has helped erase some fine lines on my skin.
I got this moisturizer as a present and I want it back! Can I buy it in germany?
"Love this product, glides on beautifully. The smell is pleasant."
My derm recommended I use this cream to even out my skin. I'm in my 30s and used it 3x. I had to stop because my face had such bad reaction to it. I haven't had an acne breakout like this since I was a teenager. I'm very surprised because I love other neutrogena products. Not sure what happened :-(
"I really wanted to like this. And I tried it every day (AM only, washed it off at night) for three weeks. It put 10 years on my crow's feet/cheeks, accentuated lines when I smile :( Would not recommend for the entire face. My skin usually does well with Neutrogena products but I am going to try the next step up in quality."
"Though it seems to absorb into my skin at first glance, this product produces a shiny, oily mess on my face hours later. I now have several acne bumps around my nose and mouth area, which is unsurprising since all oily sunscreen products do this. I was hoping this formula would be different, but it isn't."
"I use this only once a day at night as I have sensitive, dry skin - I noticed it was too much for me twice a day. I use a different moisturizer during the day...I am a repeat customer using for a few years...it does help smooth skin and diminish some fine lines ...I'm 68 and when I get lazy and forget to use it for a few days, I definitely notice the difference."
"I can't say I see a big improvement in lines, but it does wonders for age/sum spots. I need very little coverup makeup now. I am a repeat buyer, and will continue to be."
"I usually use a different Neutrogena retinol product. and really like it, but I thought I would try this one because I'd like something a little more intensive but the smell is so bad that I can't actually stand having it on. Honestly my first thought was that is smelled like urine."
"I bought this because I thought the brand is well known and the packaging said dermatologists recommend... I used it once and my face went completely red and feels like its on fire... When I got to work this morning I was asked if I drove to work with my head out the window... Don't buy... It's not worth the pain, suffering and damage to your skin... Invest in a higher quality product... This is your face after all."
"I really like the results from this product, but I am so put off my the foul smell that I think I may have to switch to something else. The smell is terrible!!! I thought at first that it was a ""bad batch"" but when I replaced the tube with a new one, same situation. It's revolting and not something I have encountered with any other Neutrogena product."
I thought I got a bad batch when I smelled the product. After reading other reviews I see that this stuff really does stink. It smells like a petroleum base product... I am going to continue to use it because it's not cheap but I won't ever buy it again.
"I really like Neutrogena products and have being using them for a couple of years now. I decided to give this one a try because the SPF is higher than the other one I was using before. It really does the job and my skin feels great, however, it smells really bad. Not pleasant for neither me nor my fiance. It feels a bit awkward when people can smell it on your face!"
This is a question rather than review. I have only used the products day and night for 3 days. I feel that my skin is drier and deep wrinkles appear more prominent. Is this usual in the beginning or is it an indicator that this product is not for me? I'd value feedback. Thanks
"My skin never feels moisturized after using this product. I feel that I want to put more lotion on after one application. I also don't care for the smell. Otherwise, I feel the products beneficial properties, anti aging, appear to work. This lotion does work but there are better products on the market."
"I switched from the rapid repair to this one, and I'm not happy. My face broke out on my cheeks, nose and above my lips and only been using this for almost 2 months. I thought it would go away within a few days of using but has not. I might shop around or go back to the rapid repair. I used that one for several years."
"I likeNeutrogena's prodcuts, but not this cream.. I was very disappointed.."
This product smells bad. I have decided to discontinue use because of this bad odor. I have tried to adjust to the odor but can't. I have used it maybe ten days total and will not use it anymore.
"I wish it didn't smell so much- like sulfur or something; it is a very unpleasant odor. I am going to continue to try to use it up, but I am not sure if I can make it..."
my skin is very dry. I don't experience a feeling of being moisturized.
"Very bad, skin looks worse after using it. Not feelling any wrinkles."
"This product has left my skin dry, flakey and sensitive."
absorbs quickly and really helps with the wrinkles.i love it
