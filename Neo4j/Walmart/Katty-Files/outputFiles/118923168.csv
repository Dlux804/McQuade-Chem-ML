I tried 4 other brands of sunscreen before trying the EltaMD brand. It is not waterproof but is more of a cream. Other brands just sat on my skin and left a residue. The cream rubs in well and has no odor.
This is a great sunscreen product recommended by my Dermatologist.
"Doctor recommended SPF 30 Broad-Spectrum. Zinc oxide 7%, Octinoxate 7.5%. $10 less than on amazon"
