Love this product!! Never feels greasy and absorbs quickly. Makes applying my foundation makeup go on so smoothly.
"You can feel the difference from the first use, hydrates instantly and helps me a lot with the lines of expression."
It really helped my skin I recommend it for everybody especially this one because it has the sunblock in it
The best day moisturizer with sun protection. I use this everyday and love it.
I have used this product and love the way it feels on my face.
"It's so creamy on my face, it feels like I'm being washed with peanuts!"
It's pretty greasy and you really have to work it in to avoid the white cast that is given by the SPF
