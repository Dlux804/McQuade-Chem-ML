"I've been using Oil Of Olay products since I was in my teens, I'm now almost 50 years young and I still love this product. It does exactly was it says it will do."
Really nice finish after rinse. Very sleek feel. Washed my face well. No reactions from my sensitive skin. My face felt clean and soft. I'll buy this one again.
This product exceeds my expectation of oil of Olay cleanser products. I have used expensive mall variety cleanser and this product is way more effective by leaving my skin clean and moist. The best part is the price is less than the expensive mall variety.
I tried this for the first time and I actually really like it. Its so creamy I loved how it felt on my skin. The price is a bit high but I feel its a more luxurious cleanser of the olay collection and it did give me a beautiful natural glow afterwards. I recommend and I will purchase again.
This was the he first time using it but it was awesome and I loved it I will be using it again it makes your face feel great and refreshing.
This is my go to skin care product. It leaves my face feeling clean and looking fresh. I am a repeat user of this product. It totally met all my expectations and was very effective.
This is such a nice cream! It's so gentle and not too thick I love how it cleanses the face after a long day! It really brightens the face from the dirt and junk throughout the day! You should try it out for yourself! It's smell isn't too bad but it feels good!
"This product was great, it brightened and illuminated my skin within days. The product was soft and didn't feel too harsh and left my skin feeling refreshed. The product wasn't expensive and therefore was good value for money, I would definitely recommend to others."
"I opted for this cleanser whenever I ran out of my Lush one because I'm definitely on a budget , but I felt that I went through it so quickly that it kind of defeated the purpose of why I bought it. Overall, I enjoyed the texture, but I'd opt for my more expensive alternative."
"This is another product very difficult for me to rate, as I haven't used so many others I could compare it. It's a good value, it smells good, it has a nice bit of grit to scrub my skin without irritation, but it doesn't lather very well and dries out so I need to continue adding a bit of water as I'm scrubbing. It's also a bit difficult to rinse off. As far as brightening, it doesn't do anything I can see."
"I love Olay skincare and this cleanser is one I have repurchased again and again, because it just leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and healthy! I never used to use cream cleansers as they often leave a greasy film on my already oily skin, however this one rinses off really well and leaves my skin soft, not oily."
"Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening Cream Cleanser is a great drugstore product. As such the price is considerably lower than that you would find at a high-end store but you may be trading the efficacy of the benefits' claims. I found it to be a reasonably priced product that really delivered on the cleansing claims but lacked profoundly in the brightening claim. Then again, I only used it about a month so maybe I was asking too much too soon."
As a teen I would use some of my Mothers Olay products and ever since then that is always what I use. Olay has wonderful products that make you feel fresh and youthful! I love this specific product because of the easy application. Olay is great about making their products easy to handle and apply.
"I like the smell of this cleanser. It exfoliates, but its a very gentle exfoliation. It's never irritated my skin in any way or caused me to break out. It's decently priced for how long a bottle of it will last. As far as making your skin more luminous...I'm not sure, though."
it is good but not amazing it brightenes my face but i doesn't hide the dark spots or heal them and it has an oily greasy finish to it that i doesn't enjoy very much but it is good for the price range and available every where so it's easy to be accessed to it all the time
"I quite like this moisturizer. It helped with my dry skin, and even got rid of some acne scars. It didn't clog my pores and cause me to break out. As for brightening, I haven't noticed much of a difference. I think the price point for this product is very good as well given the amount of product you get."
It smells amazing.it refreshes your skin and energisers and brings back the glow. I always use it after I come back from outside. this also removes my dead skin and takes off of the leftover makeup I had on my skin but I did not see any brightening effect as such.
It's really great for the skin.it makes your skin radiance and glowing. It's a good price and can find out in any drugstore.
Todally my must have every day cream I lovee it my face look so bright and radiant after using it I would todally recomended it
Great product and super easy to apply to skin! Would always use this product and definitely recommend!
This cleanser does wonders! I received some free samples in the mail and I was shocked out how much it did for my skin. Not only did it evened my skin tone but it masked my fine lines
Olay is one of the best skincare drugstore brands. Their products always smell amazing and leave you feeling refreshed. They are cheap and effective. I enjoyed this product for about 6 or 7 months and loved it!
"I am currently OBSESSED with this product! I have incorporated it into my routine. I have told everyone that I know about how effective it is, and have heard positive things back. I love this brand and look forward to trying more of its products!"
"This cleanser is amazing, it gently cleanses and leaves skin feeling so radiant and refreshed. The brand is a bit on the pricy side but you definitely get what you pay for, and I would buy it again and again."
This face wash put moisture back into your skin but do not try and wash off your eye makeup it doesn't work but it is great to deep clean and put moisture back to your face
This is nice but not my favorite. It does help to brighten your complexion but I have others a prefer more. It does deep clean and leaves your skin with a dewy finish. It's just based on preference.
"From beginning using this product, I notice a few things that can be noticeable. My skin began to clean up and felt very moist and refreshed. The product was very effective for the current price range. I would recommend this product to everybody."
It wasn't the best but it was pretty good I'd recommend it. Got it for a good deal which I appreciate I hate spending a ton of money on skin care or makeup it's annoying but this was good
"I feel this is the only product out there that helps combination skin types! My skin didn't feel extremely tight or super oily after washing my face, I love this product it's so amazing!"
Have and ca. Say I didn't use it for 3 months but after I started to use it it worked wonder in the eye it made they look all woke even when I was tiret
"It's very moisterizing. But it dont think is take out my makeup properly. If you have really dry skin and does not like foam face wash, this product is good for you."
This oil leaves your face feeling refreshed and amazing helps breakouts! I am a first time user and it for sure met my expectations. Good value and not pricy at all. I would recommend to others for sure!
Reveals a beautiful natural glow and keeps your skin moisturized and smooth to the touch. I love Okay products especially because they are within my SAHM price range!
It made my skin so smooth and it has that mosterising feeing to it it is very gentle to use on any skin I would recommend the price is good for it's worth it comes in a nice bottle as well
"Really smooths out my skin and paired with the micro sculpting cream during the day and the night recovery cream before bed, my face looks and feels better."
"I really enjoyed using this face wash, I liked the soothing smell and it made my skin look bright and healthy. I love to try different products so I have not repurchased but by no means is that a reflection on the product."
I bought this on sales from target. The texture is great and flawlessly fits my skin tone. Highly recommend it. Great for all skin type - as my skin is prone to acne.
I've used this product for a couple weeks last month and it's a nice soft cleanser that isn't too harsh on my skin however i haven't found an extreme difference with my skins brightness so for that i'm only giving 3 stars.
I love this product. I've been using this for 4 years now and this is the only thing that makes my face look bright and keeps my breakouts disappears.
"Made my skin feel amazing for the first couple days, nice and smooth and fresh. Had a nice smell to it! It didn't help much of my breakouts so I switched to something else!"
For an over the counter cleanser it is my go to. When I don't have a lot of money but need a quality brand olay is it. It cleans well without drying out my skin. The price is right.
The product is very effective. I bought it after seeing my friend applying and using it and I could see change in her looks. That is when I decided to buy it
I love the smell of this cleanser! I usually switch up my face cleansers but I have stuck to this one for about 6 months now because I love the way my skin feels afterwards!
I love Olay products. They are affordable and you always know you're getting a quality product. I could tell a difference in my skin after just a few uses!
"The truth is not finished using this product, I can not say it is bad because I did not give time for action, however it has good texture and nice smell"
"I love this cleanser so much! None of the okay products are harsh on my skin, and they smell amazing! I also like the tightening effects of this cleanser where my skin feels a lot more firm which helps a lot with aging!"
"The exfoliant in this isn't terrible for my skin, and actually leaves me glowing. I can feel it peel the first layer of my dead skin off but not too much that it tears into me. Great cleanser."
I have very sensitive skin. Can use this every day without skin breakdown.
My face feels so clean and smooth after usage. Doesnt leave a residue behind like some products.
This product does it's job. It's not too harsh. I have sensitive skin so I can't use just anything. It's affordable and lasts a while.
Really like it a lot. It helps minimize fine lines and smoothed the skin nicely. Its pretty gentle on the skin
This cleanser is very gentle! It works very well. Its a good price not too expensive this was my first time using it but I will use it again!
Little pricey. Amazing product though. Goes on so smooth and evenly. Feels Great. Love it and the other Okay products I use
"Love Olay. The Luminous line is AMAZING. I used the Regenerist line, then they came out with this one and I was hooked! I. LOVE. IT."
Great for aging skin and great for uneven skin tone with repeated yes it met my expectations harsh on the skin
Just started using and i really do love this product! Packaging has pretty colors and easy to get out!
This is really sickly and I use it in the shower. It's just easier that way for me. I'll get it again
This serum actually works on my skin. I've tried numerous different types of serums and this seems to do the trick. I recommend.
"Not bad, does a good job at making my face feel clean and bright, I would definitely buy it again it also smells amazing"
I absolutely love the olay regenerist luminous brightening line face wash works amazing makes skin very soft and bright
I am not sure this product did a whole lot of brightening with my skin but it did clean it and did the job. I would not buy again.
love thissss so muchhhhhh ..... perfect for my skin type ..... i highly recommend it for every mommy's out there
"This product lightens up the skin and is a cream, its affordable and would be any great treat in your beauty regimen."
It doesn't suit my skin type as i have oily face. I feel like it didn't give brightening effect. But good option for moisturizer for less price
Great great product for giving your skin a nice brightening !!! Such nice packaging and such an amazing price love it !
"The product is not bad I just believe it is not something you really need, especially for this price"
Olay is one of my favorite brands. This is oil free cleanser that is gentle on the skin but gets the job done.
"I use this when I have particularly bad break outs and it is nice and gentle on my skin, yet tough on my breakouts. I love this face wash!"
I love the okay brand overall and just about every product I've tried. This cleanser is no different. Works well even with my sensitive skin
Amazing! Has worked so well for my husband and the smell lasts forever we love it and the conditioning is amazing!!
This definitely helps brighten your complexion! It smells very good and you skin doesn't feel dry once you use it.
I have badd black spots on my face and I found out that this product works best for me and every since I have really been in love with it .
Love this luminous brightening cream cleanser. Feels soo good on the skin and highly recommend for those who have sensitive skin
Very nice and I love to use it a lot and recommend it to all my friends because it is worth the experience
That's very nice product if there free sample it awesome to have and better product from anyone which is currently in market
"Helps brighten my skin, makes me look more awake and bright. Skin feels clean. Olay has been around for years and I trust all their products"
This was also good it makes my skin glow in just one use i dont use it often though idk why its pretty good lol
Again a really great product this hydrated and softened my skin so well. I love that it doesn't break out my sensitive skin!
Olay really know how to wow me with their skincare products and the best thing is that the price is affordable
Love this product! Makes my skin feel super fresh and clean. I think it's a good value compared to other products out there!
Love love love! Great cleanser and my skin feels amazing! It's just a little too pricy for my liking!
"Amazing products, can literally find it anywhere but I'd just buy it online! Literally loveeeeee this !!"
Doesn't dry out the skin and does slightly brightens. Very creamy and luxurious! I definitely recommend it!
This brighting cream is nice. The packaging is good and the price was decent. This made my face very hydrated and I loved it
Great product! I use the spray in the morning to wake up my skin. Leaves my face looking right and refreshed.
Love the way this scrub made my skin feel and look! I used it a couple times a week for brightening. Definitely saw results!
I really love this product! This is an excellent brand. It gives me a perfect finish! I reccomend it so much!
"I like to use cream cleanser as I have sensitive skin, I don't like anything too harsh. This is great for my skin type."
"I received a very smal trial size of this product. It was very light and moist when applied, and in the morning it was completely absorded. skin didn't look tired or dry. The packaging is attractive and convenient. I am not familiar with the price of the regular size, but if there were a good deal I would like to use it."
I absolutely love this product because it's great for my sensitive skin. The product is not too strong or harsh. I like the after smell and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh. Would not recommend for those seeking to resolve blackheads or acne. It is best used for brightening the dullness of the face.
I thrive on proactive because I breakout easily. I tried the regnerist luminous and it felt good on my skin. Overtime I noticed that my skin texture is much better. I do not break out anymore. Another plus is that it's not costly. Feels good on the skin and gives a certain glow.
"I have used Olay products for many years and they have been kind to my skin. The Regenerist line.has been my favorite thus far, but I discovered the Luminous line and was pleasantly surprised by the results! My skin is visibly brighter, refreshed, and clean. The cleanser is light, smells great without being overly perfumed and is easy to use. I love it! I know it works, because I get compliments from friends, family, and strangers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of those AMAZING products that deliver EXACTLY what was promised! I was using this product and the Regenerating Cream Cleanser on alternate weeks; and this one was absolutely 'my' Winner! Made my face look healthy and 'luminous!' Thank You! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this cleanser!! It minimizes the appearance of pores. Other products say they do this, but this one really does!! It also makes your skin feel really exfoliated. It's so smooth and glowing after using it! I would love to buy the Microderm Abrasion Brush and try it, just haven't been able to fit it into my budget!! I'm sure it's an amazing product too!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've had acne marks and uneven skin ever since I was a teenager. I decided to try this since nothing else worked and this cleanser is it! I love how it feels and I can see brighter, more even skin after just 3 weeks of continued use. I am a fan of the Luminous line for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a 59 year old mother of 5 children - 2 singles and a set of triplets - my face has been through a lot of stressful contortions. This product truly does brighten and make me feel luminous! And young! I get so many compliments on my skin, and it's all due to the Olay regenerist line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser tightens my skin for a more youthful appearance while lightening darker spots that recently started to appear on the apples of my cheeks while leaving my skin soothed, soft, and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The only brightening cream I want to put on my face is this. Works and it's worth the price.
"This really does work to get that luminous, glow from within look that people want. Love it"
Works great. Does not dry my skin out. Good for taking makeup off and brightening your skin
"Like it, doesn't seem any better than other cleansers for the price. Don't like the price"
"I can't go wrong with this product, always compliments my day and protects my skin drom the sun"
This is a good face wash for the AM. It leave your skin feel accomplished and ready for the day.
great product. gave me a nice glow and left my skin feeling very good. will purchase again
I love Olay's Luminous line. I live the moisturizer! This cleanser is good. It works well. What I love is that it is a great product at a great price!
I somewhat like this product. I feel like it could be a little better for the brand but it's alright. I like the feel my skin has after using these products and how bright my complexion seems to be after as well.
"Works fairly well, helped my skin look healthier and vibrant. Overall it freshens and tightens the skin to make it seem more alive. Definitely a good product"
I really like since it's moisturizing but it doesn't really brighten my skin and I use this twice a day but never seen a difference I would recommend to use this to moisturize your skin rather than using it as a brightening cleanser.
What a great product. As I get older my skin has changed. Regenerist Luminous Brightening Cream Cleanser livens up my skin and love that clean feeling it leaves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Great cream cleanser that makes your skin luminous and clean feeling when done. Doesn't over dry your skin but cleans it thoroughly.
This product is wonderful it helps with my skin and helps me look alive even when I have gotten a whole 8 hours of sleep
This face wash leaves my skin feeling very clean and smells great. I use it on my clarisonic and it foams up nicely.
I love this product! I have sensitive skin & it works perfectly. I don't have any issues while using it or even after. Definitely recommended.
"The word brightening alone was enough to get me to try this product, I suffer with severe acne dark spots and scars so this really helps"

I love this serum. It is so great on my skin when I use it. It is very gentile and has very nice packaging
One of my favorite creams specially if I wore a full face of makeup that day. This will do wonders to your face
"This is a lower priced store shelf product. But when used regularly, it really does cleanse and revitalize your skin. I'm very happy with it."
The luminous brightening cream cleanse was very good for brightening up the darker parts of my face without leaving my face oily
I love love this brand and all of their products i highly recommend it to anyone who loves clean skin
My skin actually glowed after using this product. It looked and felt like it was healthier and softer. Would reccomend.

Great moisturizing cleanser for sensitive skin on an everyday basis.
"I loved this product. Decent price, great feel, my face looks and feels cleaner."
"Fantastic product, and I'm recommending this to everyone I know, and everyone, I don't know! :D"
It does nothing to my face so far but i hate that the fragrance is too much for me to handle. It feels like I'm washing my face with perfume.
I recently purchased this product and I am very impressed! It made my skin feel silky smooth and seems to help out with the redness.
