"I started using this product in my 20s... it was one of the first most advanced face creams developed. I am a retired cosmetician and represented cosmetic companies in a major department store for 8 years. After studying many companies products and trying them, I still prefer Revlon's Eterna 27. The texture and feeling of the cream on the skin is amazing. The results are astonishing. I am now 62 and hardly have many lines on my face. I'm glad I started caring for my skin at 16."
"My 87 year old Mother told me about this cream over 30 years ago. Her skin has few wrinkles! Have not found anything better! It doesn't have a lot of water like other creams. Nurishes the skin while you sleep; doesn't irritate eyes, I can use it all over my face and neck with no irritation. Good value compare to other expensive creams! Food for the Skin! Nancy"
I've been using Revlon Eternal w/progenitin for years. I would not considering changing to any other moisturizer. I highly recommend this product if you are over 50 with dry skin.
"Love the thick texture on my skin, gives a long-lasting moisturized feeling and smells wonderful. Hoping that long-term use will slow the aging process!"
I love this product and have used it for 20 years! I am 74 and have no wrinkles on my face and neck!
I've been buying this product for for 46 yrs and it is getting harder to find so was happy Walmart had it!!
"I am in 30s and this cream works for my normal/dry skin in Southern California environment with wind and sun. I used to $50-$100 cream, and bought this item based on many review from seniors! I am glad! Not only has everything in a moisturizer face cream, smells sense of my mother! I apply this cream as a base 5 minutes before my sun block in mornings, and after cleaning my face in nights. This is absolutely a trust product with a reasonable price."
It is a very rich heavy creme. I like to use it as an intense mask I put it on thick relax for 5 minutes then wipe the excess off. It's a once a month treat or after too much sun.
My grandma has used this face cream for decades and it keeps her skin looking great. It is very hard to find--we always have to order online.
THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT! MY FACE GETS VERY DRY IN THE INTER MONTHS GRAT MOISTER DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS IT WILL BUY IT AGAIN. WOLD RECOMMEND IT IF YOU HAE VERY DRY SKIN INT WINTER MONTHS.
"I have used this cream since 1972. I haven't had dry skin on my face since then. Also, really keeps wrinkles away. I just wish it still came in a 6 ounce size."
"I've been using Eternal 27 for many years, and am very satisfied with it. I use it morning and night and sometimes in between. I can't always find it in my local drugstores, that's why I purchase it online from Walmart. This is the second time I ordered it from Walmart. Both times I received it w/o any problems. Will do so again when necessary."
I have used this product for over 30 years.
"I have used this moisturizer for 10 years! I absolutely love the the way is makes my skin feel! I have tried many other expensive moisturizers they do not compare to this! I even use this on my elbows, hands, arms and legs during the winter when it is so dry!"
"I love this & will continue to buy it at Walmart; I used the ship to store, no shipping charge & picked it up the next day....great service...."
great product! easy to find at walmart.com. dont confuse with plain eterna 27. eterna 27 w progentin is better.
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. Leaves my skin soft and supple. Makeup goes on very easily without tugging my 61 year old skin! Love this stuff, but it is getting harder to find. So glad to see that Jet had it!!!!"
"I have been using Eterna 27 on my face for over 50 years. When I heard Revlon was discontinuing manufacture of this product I was heartbroken. Nothing moisturizes my face like this product even at 10 times the price. I was thrilled to see Wal-Mart still had some. I wish Revlon would continue with this product. It is the best they ever made for very dry, scandinavian skin."
"I order the Revlon Moisture cream for my mother. She has used this product for over 40 years. It was first recommended by one of her sisters, She will use no other cream ,I used to buy her the larger one but they stopped making the larger one. Since i have moved to another state i order it thru Walmart and it's delivered to her home in 1 week. I order her 5 or 6 jars at a time. She swears by it. She is 86 years old and has always gotten compliments on how soft and young she looks."
"I have been using Revlon's Eterna 27 since I was in my early 20's. Now at 63, I am a faithful user -- my skin is amazing and people cannot believe I am my age. . . I am always asked if I'm in my mid to late 40's. . of course, it's genetics, but I also believe its Eterna 27. . my daughter started using at 25 and doesn't have a line on her face. . a great product!"
"This product has been around since the 60s, when Revlon was a department store brand. The product's longevity says a lot. It's a rich emollient creme perfect for dry skin or for anyone in winter. Especially good for saggy, crepe-y neck skin. Look for this version with Progenitin (pregnenolone) as opposed to the standard one."
I have used it more than ten years. This cream is very good & moisture. I like it very much.
I have used this product for over 30 years. It is the best. People tell me how nice my skin looks and I am 67.
I have used this product 50 years and to date no wrinkles. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for 40 years. I am now 60 years old and I know I owe my smooth skin to Eterna 27. Why is it not being sold in stores anymore in the larger size?
I have used this cream over 20 years. It feels clean and moisturized on my skin. Other people comment on how nice my skin is and ask what I use. I'm very pleased with it.
Bought it for someone as a gift. They were pleased
Thicker than the Eterna 27 day cream.
Great moisturizer for night time
"helps with the wrinkles, thanks for stocking item"
"The best service, extremely prompt, one day only for delivery!"
"I have very dry skin, this product works very well for me."
Excellent results for soft healthy skin
Old favorite from 30 years ago. Stays on overnight.
This product is just the best for every skin type. It creates smooth youthful looking skin. Great for sensitive types also. Try it!
My mother used this product we just could fine it thank God walmart carry it now am so happy and it was deliver fast.
I have been using this moisturizer cream for years. Feels so good on my face and keeps my skin soft and moisturized.
Been using this product since I was 32 years old. I am almost 70. It is a product that I highly recommend. It works!
"I used to use it years ago but, evidently I have become allergic to it as my skin turned red and burned."
"My husband's mother, who is 104, uses this product on her face and has for years. I order it so she can have it on hand."
Best moisturizer EVER. Been using this since the 80's. I've tried every expensive brand and nothing beat ETERNA 27!!
"I am using Eterna since at least 45 Yrs., glad it is still available. I started with the Moisterizing Creme, as I got older I use the Night Creme all the time Skin is dryer."
Used it for many years...just difficult to find. Glad I located it on-line. Thanks
Love this - wish it still came in the larger size.
My wfe buys nothing else.
I have been using this cream for 20 years and love it. My face looks great for my age! Used to get it at WalMart in Commerce - but I have not been able to find it there lately. Nice that I van order it!!!
I have been using this face cream for over 40 years and my friends always say Moe you have such great skin. It is because of this cream. I once gave a bottle to my friend and she still uses this cream. Try it you will like it.
"I hate to be the first one with a bad review, but I didn't see any outstanding improvement with my skin after 2 weeks use at twice a day. I am 61 with very good skin, but with age there comes dryness, and this product didn't moisturize at all for me. I'm just using the remaining product on my chest and arms to use it up."
I have been using this product for at least 30 years. It is the best and I have no wrinkles
Keeps face moist at night.
Great skin product
This is the absolute best moisturizer I have ever found and I hope it is never discontinued. Nothing can compare. My mother used it for years and people alsways commented on her beautiful skin. I wish I would have followed her example earlier!
I have used this cream for many years and have tried others in those years but nothing else is as good as this cream. It keeps my skin hydrated overnight . My skin never feels dry or tight.
I have used this product for 50 years. Today I am 70 years old and wrinkle free. My mother is 94 and has used this product most of her life and is wrinkle free. It is the best. I constantly get ask what I use because my complexion looks so nice.
"I get so many compliments on my skin since I've been using Revlon Eterna 27 with Progenitin. When I tell people I got it at walmart, they try to buy it at the store and unfortunately you can only get it online now."
"I'm really writing about WalMart.com customer service, I had to get in touch with them and they handled the concern I had immediately--I think the best service I have ever had from anhy online purchase--Thank you Walmart---PS:Bought product for my wife--She has used it for many years and thinks it's great."
After only one week I can tell a huge difference!!
"It would be nice to be able to purchase this item in the 6 oz. size. While these are convenient, they are not very practiable for storage when storage is limited."
Excellent moisture cream.
"I buy this for my mother, she is obsess with this product."
The best ever have use it for years.
Have used this product for 35 years.
I read the other reviews and decided to try it. This is my second order.
"Since I just started using it, I can't tell. But I do like the way it feels on my skin"
I have used this cream since the 70's...just found it on line here...I think it is the very best anm thankful that I found a place to get it again!
