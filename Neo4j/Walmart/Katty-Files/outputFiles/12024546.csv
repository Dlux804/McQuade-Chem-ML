"I got tired of applying moisturizer and then a sunscreen every day, started getting clogged pores. This Cetaphil daily face moisturizer not only is comfortable on my combo skin, but has the great 50 spf sunscreen so no need for another layer on my face. I use their night cream and body lotion as well, and my skin feels so healthy. I'm 60, people !"
Great product. Not oily. Good for normal skin.
"The product is more sunblock than a facial moisturizer . Its quality is undeniable, however at the time of acquiring this particular product on line, the ultimate purposes was to get a deep moisturizer with some sunscreen protection and not viceversa. I live in a city with desert climate (Dry) and decided to buy this product for allegedly moisturizing properties, so far I have not seen the results I want to get with this product."
"I have used this moisturizer (new to me) for about a week and love the way it feels on my skin. I do have sensitive skin, and this does not bother me at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is great having a moisturizer and SPF50 all in one. So much better then just using sunscreen on my face. I've never found a sunscreen that worked for me under my makeup. I really like other Cetaphil products so was happy to see this. Will differently be using this forever!!
I had been looking for a good moisturizer with sunscreen and finally I found this one. It's awesome and also use it under my makeup
I love this product. It is moisturizer and sunscreen in one.
It is a pity I can't buy it here in Germany.
Protection is necessary out there to protect us from skin damage and cancer. I discovered this and other Cetaphil products. They make good stuff! This one applies nicely and the moisturizing seems nice...
This is one of the few sunblocks I can wear that does not break out. It goes on kinda greasy. It is expensive but it goes a long way. I wish they made it with a higher SPF and also one that was not so greasy as this won't work underneath the makeup..
"This does its job in moisturizing my face, however, it burns my eyes. Even after putting it on and applying my foundation my skin starts burning. I have really dry skin and it works as far as that goes, but I can't handle the amount of pain I'm in after applying it."
"My mom left this after one of her visits. i'd run out of sunscreen, so decided to give this a try. This lotion is very lightweight but delivers a nice moisture to my skin. I use mainly for the 50spf factor however the moisturizer is sufficient and I have very dry skin. Thanks mom!"
"This cream definitely moisturizes, areas under my eyes and check bones are not dry and wrinkly. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the tackiness of the cream no matter how thin I put it on. When I slide my fingers across my face, it pulls and drags."
Best moisturizer with 50 dog I've used and I've tried a lot of products!!!!
I had a lazer treatment for Roseca and my Dermatologist told me to use this product to help heal my skin after the treatment. All is good.
"Product is good however leaves white cast behind. My skin is dry, that might be the reason i did not find the product moisturising. Hence returning back."
goes on clean and non-greasy and comes off clean and non-greasy. Did not sting my eyes or leaves pimples the next day. ONLY face sunscreen I will use!
I like the fact that it really does protect my face and it doesn't irritate my eyes. I also love the moisture it provides. I'm very happy with the product and plan to buy more.
"About 3 years ago my coworker introduced me to this product. I have super sensitive skin, but I reluctantly tried it anyway. To my surprise it did not irritate or break me out."
Zero stars! Gave me and my son acne! This stuff is garbage!
"I have been using this for years, very good moisturizer. Love it also because it has 50Spf."
"LOVE IT, I USE IT ON FACE, HANDS, ARMS AND LEGS........NOT GREASY - STAYS NICELY."
Great sun protection for the face. The zinc adds a glow under your make up.
Great sunblock and moisturizer
I have rosacia. This is the only sunscreen lotion that I have been able to use repeatedly. Thank you.
Light and works perfectly as a moisturizer as well as sunblock.
"Although this product advertises as non-greasy, it does go on quite greasy. Takes over an hour for the shine on your face to disappear."
this is super greasy and would clog your pores. i used it 2 days in a row and noticed it clogged my pores and would produce lots of blackheads.
This moisturizer works well with my makeup and is SPF 50!
My son has severe acne and is being treated for it by a dermatologist. She recommended this as a good cleaner for his face while he undergoes the treatment.
"Love itâ€¦Referred by my dermatologist. As I am getting older those lovely wrinkles are coming out, and all that other fun stuff that happens to our face as we get older. Wish I had this when I was younger, probably could have helped stop some sun damage! I have normal skin and think it's a great product. 1 tube lasts months!"
"Very strong sunscreen smell, also very thick formula."
The SPF 50 really made a difference in his skin.
Moisturizes my face great doesn't look like I have sunscreen on! I wear makeup over top of it with no problems.
"Excellent daily moisturizer with a full 50 SPF! Sinks in quickly, no fragrance and a super-star under make up."
"I had no problem with the sun and protecting my skin, but after wearing this for a half hour, I get a horrible metallic taste in my mouth. SPF 15 or SPF 50. It's every time, too, and I'm careful not to get it on my lips. Wish I could figure out which ingredient it is that causes that so I could simplify sunblock shopping."
"I wanted to love, even like, this product because I use the cream and I really love that. Unfortunately, this stuff makes my face so shiny it looks like I'm sweating. Even when I blot with a kleenex I'm walking around with a thin sheen of what looks like oil slick on my face...bummer...."
This is an awesome product that is recommended by some of the top detmatologists
"I love this stuff. The protection is awesome. It doesn't clog my pores or make me breakout! I have combination skin which can be pretty sensitive and I am prone to breakouts. So, this was a miracle!"
Is an excellent product for your skin.
"Haven't used it much yet, but from the times I have used it, I like it. Feels good on skin, rubs in well"
"My husband agreed to use this for some patches of dry skin on his face. He plays a lot of tennis, so his skin takes a beating from so much sun."
"I like this because it goes on smoothly, doesn't clog pores and had SPF 50 protection."
Best moisturizer for my skin. Only moisturizer with SPF protection that doesn't make me break out.
I have a salicylate allergy and this product does not cause a reaction
This product is good. A little goes a long way.
"I love this one, leaves my skin very smooth and it keeps it moisturized for long."
