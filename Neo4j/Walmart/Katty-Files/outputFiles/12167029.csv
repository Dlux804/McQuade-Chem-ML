"I've struggled for years to try and find a moisturizer for my face. I'm 55 years old, menopausal skin, and prone to breakouts. A new cleaning regime and I started using this product. My face feels amazing!! And it feels like that all day. I use it as a primer under my makeup and it really helps with foundation application. Please dont ever stop making this stuff...its like gold!"
67 Years old and love this moisturizer.... Have benn using it foralong time daily! Nothing better than this!
I been using this Renewing Collagen Elastin Moisturizer since my 20's... It always gives me a fresh feeling in the mornings. Now that I will be turning 60 this year... People still think I am in my 40's... I couldn't thank this product enough...
It really works I have impossible dry skin...It doesn't smell bad it just i don't like any smell at all so it is confusing a little bit but it goes away. It was my best friend last season (cold season) and it will be forever. This moisturizer is fantastic.
"St. Ives Swiss Formula Collagen Elastin, All Skin Types Facial Moisturizer, 10 oz jar is reasonably priced and works much better than the higher priced collagens out there. I first started unsing this product about 30 years ago when it came in a 16 oz. jar. Even though I am in my seventies, I still must produce ID to prove I am a senior citizen. I use this product about 3 or 4 times per week."
RUN ... DO NOT WALK to your closest Walmart to purchase this St. Ives Collagen Elastin! I have paid 10x the amount I paid for this product - for less effectiveness - the product is fantastic with Super results! My husband uses it also and he really loves the softness it produces!
"I have touchy skin. Too much moisturizer and it sits like goop on my face. Not enough moisturizer and I'm dry as a bone. I read other postive reviews on the product and thought I was trying it. I'm impressed, it's just right! I like how it feels and I personally don't have to use a lot and I like how my skin looks softer. For the price it's well worth trying and it has a lot in it as well. Very good."
I heard about this product on the doctor OZ show and have been using; it for a while but I have not able to find it at our local store. It was rated by one of his guests as the same ingredients as some of the expensive brands. I love it and how soft it makes your face feel.This is much more than I originally expected sine it is so reasonably priced.
"Although I have only been using this product for one week, I have noticed an improvement of my skin. I purchased this product because of the reviews from Dr. Oz. A terrific value! I purchased a 2 pack for under 10 dollars through Walmart.com. That's 20oz for under $10.00 vs 1.7oz @ $24.00 for a product that I had been previously using. Super fast shipping and delivery. Very satisfied!"
I found out about this product December of 2013 and have been purchasing it since then. It is great stuff and very reasonably priced. This is the first product I have found that I like as much as the expensive moisturizer that I have used for 25 years.
"This moisturizer is sooooo amazing. It's lightweight, non-greasy, smells great, and lasts a long time. It doesn't leave any nasty, greasy residue on your skin. It has a slight coconut scent to it I think and it's just so wonderful. Trust me, you will love it! It's such a great value...you get so much for a small price."
i like that i can take just a bit of it and i can apply it all over my face; it spreads easily. i also like that i can put make-up on after a few minutes of applying the moisturizer. two things i would like as an improvement is to be made a bit thicker/creamier and to add spf 15 or higher benefits.
"I have always liked using St Ives products. This is great, goes on smooth and creamy. It feels good on the skin. You can't beat the two for one deal either. I would highly recommend this. I usually buy in store, but when I couldn't find it there, I was so happy to find it online, as I had run out, and definately wanted to get more."
"I myself, first heard about this product from Dr Oz. I tried to find it at my walmart at home but couldn't so I ordered it on here. Awesome price and awesome product. I am only 22 so I don't have wrinkles yet but I love how it makes my face feel. And Im thinking if I use it for years maybe I'll never have wrinkles haha. Its definitely something I will continue to use from now on! Love it!"
"I am going to get this! I always buy top dollar moisturizer from Ulta or Sephora, but on a recent trip I forgot to pack it. My sister offered me her moisturizer and I was skeptical due to the inexpensive brand. Needless to say I was wrong! Thanks baby sis! My skin looks n feels amazing."
Work for my face..I'm 44 y/o...I saw a recommend on Dr Oz program..I give a try..working perfect for me so far..plus a budget....
I really like this face cream! Was looking for a cream that absorbed well and was Not sticky or tacky. Makes my face feel wonderful. Price is great too.
"The jar in my recent order is the first time I've used this product. It glides on, and absorbs quickly, and feels soothing on my dry skin. Can't comment on the anti aging possible effects, but it is an excellent moisturizer."
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I ALREADY SEE THE DIFFERENCE ON MY FACE. WRINKLES ARE SUBSIDING CANT WAIT TO SEE RESULTS AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS!
"I have used this product St. Ives Collagen Elastin for at least the last 5 years. I am considered a senior citizen, but I really don't look it. My skin is very soft and the only time I have any wrinkles is when I smile. Love it"
Beautiful smell love how it tightens my sling and it moisturizes without being greasy or buildup my skin absorbs it amazingly in love with this stuff It was worth it
I have enjoyed using the St Ives Collagen moisturizer. I use this in the morning with serum. It soaks into my skin nicely and feels soft and subtle all day.
"I have used the product for a couple of weeks and I have to say it's amazing, my face feels great and I noticed a soft glow in the morning! I will continue using this as long as I'm able to purchase it!!!"
"I got this product for my mother , there is lots of change in her face in few days.. Very shining, and smooth skin.i would definetly recomend this product and its worth for the money that we spent on this ."
"This is seriously the best affordable moisturizer out there. I've been using it for years, and often get compliments on my skin. I have paid way more for others that are simply not as good and always end up coming back! This one is light, not greasy and it doesn't have heavy perfumes in it. It's also mild enough for my sensitive skin."
"Been experiencing extremely dry skin do to some medical conditions. I bought this for my face but it's so yummy and such a value I've been using it all over my body. Light and creamy when it goes on, soaks right in.. No residue. Only gave it a 4 on effectiveness because I've only used it for a week or so but it sure seems promising."
Great product! I have sensitive skin that I think is in the middle stage of getting dry bc I am getting older and still oily. This product is wonderful. I wear it at night. A little goes along way so it will last forever. I will never buy those over the counter expensive night creams again.
I tried 2 years ago and since that time 1 use it 3 days a week
"Throw away your expensive moisturizers!!! I've spent so much money on moisturizers, and nothing has compared to this! i love this. it doesn't leave a greasy texture to my face at all, and it keeps my face moisturized all day!! i apply this after my nightly routine, and in the morning whether i'm wearing makeup or going bare!"
I love this stuff. I got it because it was a cheaper face moisturizer but this stuff is awesome. I have not been able to use many lotions or skin care products because I have super sensitive skin and Im allergic to almost all of it. But this stuff I am not. And its so gentle on your skin. I feel so good after using it. My skin doesnt feel oily or gross after using it. It is just so awesome. I highly recommend it.
"love this product and have been using 35 years. I am getting up there now 76 and can still pass for 60 as is my husbands age. It truly is a timeless product, is non greasy and just gives your skin a visible smooth and healthy glow. My daughter is 52 and now can't live without it. All the stores in my zip listed have zero jars,Please Help!"
"I have already recommended this to so many of my friends, even my mom! and all of them have been so impressed. One of my friends who usually has to use dermatology approved creams can use this, and is so impressed! It lasts ages, and never fails to hydrate any type of skin."
I love this product. Its helped get my dry and flaky skin feel smooth and hydrated. Its a good price and the container is packed to the brim with cream so you know itll last for a long time! This cream is amazing. I refuse to go back to my old moisturizer after trying this one out.
I have used this product for at least 10 years. I feel it is partially responsible for the comments that I don't look 61 years old
This was purchased for a ninety three year old friend and she has been using it for a long time and really enjoys the product.
I have been using this moisturizer for about a week now and so far so good. Love the feeling in my skin
I love this product !!!!it's good on my skin abd healthy benefits.makes feel Buetiful!!!!love the price on this stives timeless cream!!!
"This lotion is just awesome,my skin looks&feels great!It's not greasy or sticky&I use it as day&night on my body&as a night facial moisturizer(before going to bed)I don't use all that expensive lotion&creams.St. Ives is the best."
"I have had a rough go with finding the right moisturizer over the past thirty years, I bought this product and have never looked back! My skin has cleared and the price is wonderful!"
Twice a day all over my face and neck. Great product.
This might be good for some people but for me personally it didn't moisturize enough (and I have what I consider to be normal skin). Might be ok along with an additional moisturizer.
"Saw this on Dr Oz years ago and have been using ever since. This is a very inexpensive daily moisturizer that does a nice job. Has a very light consistency that absorbs quickly, scent is very faint. Jar lasts a long time."
"I have trouble with my face becoming oily by midday. With this moisturizer, my nose doesn't get oily. It comes in a big tub with I'm not used to, but very little is needed to cover your entire face. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product."
"I like that it's not greasy, but it only last for awhile. I noticed that after a few hours, my skin was tight and dry. If you have dry skin like me, you will need to re-apply as needed."
"I have been using this moisturizer for years. I wash my face with Pond's cold cream, and then my next step is this St. Ives product, and I do these steps, twice a day. Makes my face feel healthy and clean, everyone should use it male or female."
I am actually in love with this! Not only is it super affordable but it lasts a really long time. Its really helped my skin out during the harsh winter days.
Just wanted to say for those complaining about packaging I use a qtip dip it in jar and apply to my face. That one dip is enough to spreadall over and you won't be wasting product or spreading bacteria! Hope this helps
"This is exactly what I was looking for!! It's not greasy,light (for me personally at least),cheap,and perfectly moisturizes! And it helped with my acne so that's a plus"
"I have been using timeless for 5 years and love it. I bought renewing because I thought the packaging changed a little bit is the same stuff. It is not! They have less percentage of the 3 ingredients they brag about. The collagen, elastin and saeflower oil. The ingredients listed on the back are almost the same but these 3 are lower on the list, with alcohol being higher up. I am truly bummed by the change and will no longer use it"
As I was getting older started to see these fine lines mostly below my mouth area. I freaked out nooooo! I bought many of products and nothing worked or made it worse. I finally did my research and found St. Eve's timeless and gave it a try. It worked those fine lines disappeared. I been now using this product for over 5 years. I'm 54 thank god I was blessed with good genes but can easily pass for 40 with help from Ives.
"I have used st ives timeless skin for 10 years now. This was the only moisturizer that prevented my dry skin from drying out in the harsh Michigan winter. Unfortunately I bought the new version of it 'renewing' recently. This moisturizer would be alright for summer, but does not keep my skin moisturized in winter. Please bring back the old formula."
"So every moisturizer I have used has either made me breakout or it wasn't hydrating enough. This moisturizer is AMAZING! It's light enough and doesn't make my skin feel greasy and it's extremely hydrating. It's great for layering under makeup too, it won't pill up."
I really really really enjoyed this moisturizer!!! It was the first moisturizer I had ever used (always been a drug store skin care gal) that really seemed to sink into my skin and have a lasting effect! The only reason I stopped using it is because I had heard online that St. Ives ingredients aren't that great for your skin. Very good starting point though!
"I've been trying to find a moisturizer that would really hydrate my skin since I accidentally over exfoliated my skin using Neutrogena. I've been using this moisturizer for about a week and let's just say my dry skin is so much more hydrated! It's not even dry anymore! I use this product every night and a moisturizer with SPF 15 in the morning. It would've been nice if this moisturizer had SPF (sunscreen). This feel extremely nice on the skin. Even if you have oily skin, I really recommend this product."
"I've been using the Collagen Elastin Moisturiser for 4 years now, and it is a permanent staple in my beauty routine. It leaves my skin feeling tight, moisturised and baby smooth. I can even see the difference in my complexion through old photographs! It looks the best when I've been using this particular moisturiser everyday! Even my friends and family comment on my clear skin and I owe it all to St. Ives!"
"Your products are all very amazing and I will never stop buying them. But I have noticed that I'm allergic to perfumed products, me and many others. So if you please consider products without perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When you find something that works or is a good colour (like a lipstick, nail polish, skin care product) and it is either discontinued or not carried, it is frustrating. Looking through the St. Ives website I saw that it still is available and Wal Mart carries it, not only single jars but you can order a 2-jar order. Hooooooray !!! It arrived fairly quickly and now I have a supply and know where I can get it again."
I was looking for a facial cream that would help get rid of my facial dryness and I think I found it within this facial cream. I have been using this facial cream for about 2 weeks and I am very impressed with the results that I have been getting. I will continue to use this facial cream and yes I would recommend this facial cream to someone who is experiencing facial dryness. I have no complaints about this facial cream.
"This a wonderful product, I am very please. It goes on smooth and feels refresshing to my skin. I can clearly see the difference after only a week. Other products just clogged my pores and was visible the next morning looking like small whiteheads all over my cheeks and jawline. None of that has happened since using this product, I Love it and will continue using it for many years to come!!"
I am on day 4 using this on my neck. My neck is already smoother than before.
My mom and I love the Moisturizer. It is not too sticky and feels great!
"Skin smoothing moisturizer with a light citrusy scent. Fast absorbing, non-greasy."
This product leaves my skin very soft and supple without feeling greasy.
Really great product for a very low price! Quantity and quality! Great for my oily sensitive skin!
"Very smooth formula, non-greasy and it makes your face feel smooth."
Very nice on my sensitive skin. great moisturizer.
I have sensitive skin. it works for me! love it/
Seems great at first but leaves flaky skin after a few hours
I've tried so many different types of facial moisturizers for my sensitive combination skin and it always caused an inflammation. Once I found out that St. Ives also made a moisturizer I gave it a shot since their apricot acne scrub hasn't given me any issues. Thank goodness that this stuff works! My skin has never felt more nourished than it does now and I haven't had any redness since using this cream
"I have been using St Ives moisturizer for years! Stupidly, I recently decided to try different moisturizers specifically for acne and they broke me out really bad! It doesn't get rid of acne, of course, but it definitely does not add to it like everything else I've tried. Not for this price and quantity! I think this lasts like 6 months, for real. It's absolutely amazing. Thank you, St. Ives!"
I love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin soft and smooth. A little goes a long way and it is a much larger container than most moisturizers.
This moisturizer is reasonably priced. My skin drinks it up. Makes you feel like your skin is drinking. Great for day or night.
It is very moisturizing and a little goes a long way so I'm sure I won't need a replacement any time soon.
I like the texture and I seem to see more firmness and smaller pore size. I have very dry skin so I have to layer a heavier cream to get enough moisture but I like the results so far.
This has helped my dry skin and evened out my skin tone. I use it before bed and in the morning. It helps clear up my acne when I get flare ups.
If you compare the ingredients to the one that had the purple on the tub they are in a different order now. The better ingredients have been moved to the bottom which means there are less of them. Just not as good as the old stuff…
PLEASE DO NOT KEEP FIXING WHAT IS NOT BROKEN! WHY DID YOU DO THIS? I USED TO USE THIS YEARS AGO BOUGHT IT AGAIN TO ONLY BE DISAPPOINTED YOU CHANGED IT!
"This product is a great moisturizer for dry skin. I used it daily, in the morning and also at night. I've been using this moisturizer for about 6 months now and My face looks radiant and healthy. I would highly recommend this product."
"I thought the price was wrong when I found this moisturizer, you get so much for how affordable it is. Not to mention it is so smooth and just a great basic moisturizer. And it smells great!"
The old formula was awesome. I searched high and low unit I realized it had changed. The new formula isn't as hydrating and doesn't feel or smell as nice. Unfortunately I will be looking for a new face cream
"I love this! It leaves my face feeling amazing. It's not heavy, doesn't clog my pores, leave it greasy and that nasty feeling most moisturizers do. I skin has never looked better!! Hello to a healthier me! :)"
I have battled acne and large pores sine I was 11. I started using this lotion a few months ago and my skin has never looked better! I tell everyone about it!
This moisturizer is perfect for dry to normal skin. I use it every night in my face and neck. It great product for a very reasonable price. I definetly recommend this product !!!
"I have been using this for two weeks and it feels great on my dry sky, especially during the winter. Compares with brand name, high dollar products. Will definitely keep this on hand."
This lotion is incredible. The consistency is smooth & goes on nice. It absorbs fast & diesnt leave my skin greasy. Just super soft. I use it morning and night. I love it!!
Please go back to the old formula. This new product is so disapoiting. Your loyal users would rather pay more to get the old product back. The new product contains ingredients that can be considered toxic. The collagen and Elastin are not on the bottom because of the small amount it now contains. I am actively looking for another brand.
"I'm in my 20s and since getting older, I noticed my skin doesn't revert back from acne as well anymore. I was searching and searching for a product to get rid of red acne marks and this product worked amazing! In less than a week, I can see my red acne marks lightening."
"I am 23, Asian American woman, bought this because of the great reviews. I am personally not prone to break outs, but I do have sensitive skin; after one time use my face was broken out for a week. How embarrassing! Found the suspect to be the mineral oil found in this!"
"I recently had surgery on my neck and I've been on medical leave from work over 6 months now. I've used this product on all of my surgical scars and they are barely noticeable and I expect it will do the same for this one too. Thank you for your online service, it saves time and fuel for those of us who rely on others for so many things. I'm not a burden to them now. :)"
I've only used it for a month but so far I love it. The price is great for what u get. Not greasy and I love the scent and how it makes my face feel so good. I'm 62 yrs old and wanted something that didn't have a lot of chemicals. I found it and I'm hooked! I'm so glad I found this product.
I gave this a try because of good reviews. It goes on great and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin that somehow other antiaging creams do. My neck seems to be more sensitive than my face. I can't say I look years younger but I'm no worse off than I was when I was spending $40 for a much smaller jar!
This is my go to moisturizer for my face. I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of years now and very happy that I took a chance on this product. It's a great value for the price and size.The product does not leave my face oily at the same time the product does a good job at moisturizing my skin.
"Have been using this for a while now. Love the way it makes my skin feel. It also seems to reduce wrinkle visibility. Sometimes I use as a hand cream and body lotion. Have bought other EXPENSIVE brands, this works just as well if not better. I would recommend this product ."
"This is really nice and does not smell bad either. I have my hands in and out of dishwater, and with repeated washing as I work in the kitchen or around the house............. so my hands are REALLY dry and irritated. This absorbs fast, and takes the burn and sting away. Bought it for my face, and I use it on my hands and arms so much that I forget to put it on my face. I like the fact that I can use it and very quickly use my hands on my keyboard without having a mess on my laptop."
"Used at night, after cleansing with lots of water. Leaves your skin feeling soft without being greasy, and actually improves the texture of your face. The value is outstanding for what you receive, and am pleased to find a consistent supply at Walmart."
"I love this product. Have tried many moisturizers they cause irriation to my sensitive skin and cause me to breakout. This product doesnt clog pores and doesnt irriate. Wish it had SPF , so I use at night and wake up with clear soft skin love it. NEVER rated anything but felt the need to with this, will never be without."
Mantains your skin feeling and looking fresh and young. This cream has one of the most important components in life collagen. We will always need it and this cream will always provide it. Nice texture and affordable cream. Highly recommend
"The cream is not moisture, it makes my skin became more dry & breakout. Not recommended unless you have a very oily skin then it shall be neutral. I read many comments saying that previous formula is much better, why don't you consider to continue with previous formula?"
"Great great moisturizer! It is probably the easiest to apply and spread compared to anything else I've tried and it is so light and fresh feeling you'll want to use it everyday, which you can because it doesn't seem to have any chemicals that hurt the skin longterm. Works great for healing sun burns as well!"
"This moisturizer is the perfect light, gentle moisturizer! It's my favorite for daily use. It comes in a big tub too so it lasts forever—great value for the price. It's so gentle I can use it under my eyes too! You can layer it, use it at night or in the morning under makeup, wonderful product! Will definitely repurchase."
I use this every single day! It keeps my makeup in place and keeps my face hydrated all day long. I do use it morning and night and I think my skin has honestly began to look tighter as well. It's been about 3 months. AND it will last a LONG time. Theres so much product it's unreal.
This product makes my skin glow. I have been using it for a month and it freshens up my skin and makes it feel alive. A little goes a long way and the price is perfect. Its gentle and seeps into my skin and keeps it hydrated. The price is perfect and you get a lot of product.
"St Ives has always been a favorite skin care line for me. I love this moisturizer so much! It leaves my skin very soft and supple and I love the natural smell. It's thick but not greasy. I use it at night and wash my face in the morning. The size is generous and it's very affordable, which is a huge plus!"
"I love St Ives products. This moisturizer is now my favorite product in the line. It works better than products I've purchased for 5 times the price. I never write these reviews, but was really inspired to after using it for just a few days. Now after a few months, it's great stuff! Also it lasts forever☺"
Great for men because the cream is not greasy and absorbs quickly.
I have used St. Ives TImeless Skin for years. It works great. My skin looks and feels great!
This cream is so fresh smelling and light but moisturizing. I use it to cleanse my face as well as for moisturizing. It is great because it does not strip my skin of its natural oils when used as a cleanser. And as a moisturizer it is perfect because it's light enough to not leave me oily but has the perfect amount of moisture for my face. I love it and have loved it for years....I am a big fan of stuff in tubs too.
"I started using this about a year ago. Really loved it, left no oiliness, no residue, never irritated my skin, felt great any time of year (any temperature). Then I got pregnant and everyone started saying I needed belly butter, oils, etc. I tried oils for a short time. Got a rash, felt itchy all the time. I switched back to my Renewing lotion and everything has been awesome. I have no stretch marks, my skin feels great and the smell hasn't offended my pregnant senses once. I love this stuff!"
I hate the new formula. I want the original timeless back.
I love this product. It really agrees with my aging skin.
I have tried several different brands but this remains a favorite. It works great and isn't ridiculously overpriced.
My favorite moisturizer! So cheap and lasts forever. I definitely notice a change in my skin. I use it both morning and night.
This moisturizer is definitely fantastic! I put it on right after I get out of the shower and I always get tons of compliments on my skin!
"Not good for oily/combination skin, also on normal skin does not get absorbed fast. But a very huge jar compared to the price."
Omg so loving this moisturizer! Its so clean and makes my face so smooth and I love using it daily twice or whenever I rinse my face with soap.
First time trying this. Saw it on Pinterest and I believe I found a new face moisturizer. Works on hands too but mainly for the face.
Really hydrates without clogging pores. My skin looks so much healthier. My husband loves it too. Does not have a fragrancey smell.
I always get compliments on my smooth skin and I am almost seventy! No one believes my age. This is a wonderful face creamand the price is so low!
"It is absorbed quickly, and doesn't feel greasy. It smooths out wrinkles easily. Feels great on the skin."
"This is exactly what I was looking for, excellent coverage, goes on without leaving a greasy feeling and makes my skin look great!"
This price is a steal. I use it at night before bed. It absorbs easily and is not greasy. My skin looks good when I get up in the morning.
Very good product. Use it everyday--several times a day and it does just as it should. Will continue to use.
good price but made my face breakout. has mineral oil in it which can clog your pores. i did like the creamy texture. will use it on my body not face to use it up.
"I absolutely love this product. The scent is very nice but not overpowering, it has made my skin so smooth and I really feel like it is working on there fine lines I have appearing!"
This a great product I have used the lotions for years but this is the first time I used the moisturizer and it is awesome makes your skin feel so soft and smooth I love it
"I have been using this for 20 years now; and it works great as a day time moisturizer. Because I am in pre-menopause now; my skin is extra dry---so, at night time I use a different moisturizer now. I will continue to use St. Ives products also."
I used this cream with the derma roller for my face and skin and my face looks great along with my stretch marks disappearing with the derma roller. Great product and price!
Nice light moisturizer that penatrates into my skin without the greasy feeling. Just wish it had a more fragrant aroma.its mot by any means a bad aroma i just love to be able to awaken the senses and this has no scent
"Haven't used this long enough to determine how effective it is, however, it comes highly recommended. So far, this has begun softening my skin and what a deal!"
"I love this product. It is light and creamy. I use it at night and during the day if I am not wearing makeup. Being middle aged, I use it on my neck and it does a good job of making that area feel smooth."
I have used this day-time moisturizer for 4 years and I love it. It is non-greasy but soaks into my skin like a good moisturizer should. I have used other St. Ives products and always find that they work.
"I love this moisturizer! I apply it in the mornings after I wash my face. I slather it on while my skin is still semi wet. When it dries, my skin is dewy and soft for the next 6-8 hours."
First time user. Very good product. Not too greasy or oily. There is no noticable odor. Does not leave a oily layer on my face. Cost is reasonable compared to the higher end products.
I use this product several times a day. Very good on my skin. I've tried more expensive products that don't work as well or at all. I always return to St. Ives.
Smells great and feels great on the skin. Very affordable and you get more than what you paid for. Leaves my skin feeling nice and moisturized. One downside however is that it doesnt keep my face moisturized for long periods of time and I end up having to reapply every few hours.
"This has been my 'go-to' all over moisturizer for many years. It's (for me) hydrating without being greasy. Sometimes I've used it as a base, and added coconut or jojoba oil during the winter months. It's aroma is light and clean. A friend once told me she saw this very same jar recommended by a dermatologist on the Dr. Oz Show. LOL Highly recommend this product."
"I had high hopes for this moisturizer because it had such good reviews, and it was a good price for such a big bottle, but it just wasn't for me. This is not a good product to use if you have oily or combination skin like I do. My face just looked super greasy after I used it, and my face still felt dry a few minutes after using it."

Very smooth on the skin. Hydrates and rich in textures. Leaves a great smell. Works on all skin types
My skin is very sensitive so I do not use it all the time because it can make my face break out. On occasions when my skin is dry I love to use this face moisturizer right before bed even when my skin is peeling as well.
"In love with this little bottle. It's the best moisturizing cream out there. Helps you eliminate fine lines, great for under makeup. It leaves your skin looking glowing and healthy!"
"I love this facial cream! It absorbs into the skin very quickly. It does not leave my skin feeling oily at all, and it does a good job of moisturizing my skin! I would definitely recommend it to anyone and will probably repurchase!"
"This product lasts so long and is very reasonably priced, my skin never breaks out when i use it and my skin always feels perfectly hydrated after using it. The packing is cute and simple and perfect for storage!"
Im in love! Smells so fresh and leaves my skin velvety soft! Ive been using St. Ives products since I was a teen Im now in my 30s and still love them!!!
I recently lost 135 lbs and have loose skin everywhere. I was trying to find something that helped with the wrinkles. This formula is for your face but I use it on my popeye arms and my thighs - after 3 weeks I really see a difference. I have used expensive dept store moisturizers for years and this stuff work 100% better. I call it my little secret that I am sharing with you.
"Ladies, I am 44 years old, my only child will be 25 years old this year, and people have told me I look like I am in my early 30's. Even my daughter tells me I am a vampire :) LOL (She means I look like I never age). I have been using this face cream for years. I do not have any lines on my face, and I do not have crow's feet. Enough said ;)"
"I have used the most expensive skincare products that require six or seven items to supposedly have results. Everything from Lancome, Este Lauder to La Mer. I have been extremely pleased so far with St. Ives Swiss Formula Collagen Elastin, All Skin Types Facial Moisturizer. The price was amazing and the results are as well!!! My skin appears softer and in the neck area it is improving. Also, under the eye area I see improvement. I LOVE EVERYTHING I HAVE BOUGHT IN THIS LINE FROM WALMART!"
"This feels great on my face. My face was so dry and wrinkled. It really plumped my skin like the product statement. It's very light weight.. Smells great with a light scent, that I s not overpowering and good for my sensitive skin. This product is adorable."
"I LOVE this moisturizer!! First of all, it smells so amazing and fresh. It leaves my skin supple and moisturized! I wake up in the morning with all of my redness gone and glowing skin! Plus this comes in a large tub that will last you months! The only downside is I wish it came in a pump, it would be more hygienic!"
"I've been trying a lot of skin products that will work on my skin. It's been more than a year since i used this product and find it suited/working on my skin. It's not greasy and lightweight that's makes me feel comfortable every time i use it. I am very happy with this product as it doesn't clogged my pores and works well with my face wash and toner. It keeps my skin hydrated, soft and healthy and glowing. I so love it."
"i used it on my face and it just absorbs right in. it doesn't feel heavy or sticky, and it works very well on my combination skin (dry cheeks, oilier tzone). plus i live in a humid climate and it's not heavy at all even though it is a cream. best cream ever!"
"This is one of the best products on the market. I used to use Oil of Okay Quench. However, this product by St. Ives beats ""Quench"" hands down by far. I use it not only on my face but my entire body. My skin has not been this soft since I was a baby. It's not greasy and easily absorbs into the skin. I highly recommend this product."
"I love St Ives' moisturizer and face scrub so much! This is a light lotion, I have repurchased it since my last one is gone. This is a big jar of lotion with a very affordable price!! I love how it absorbs into my skin in short time, leaving my skin moisturized and not feeling greasy. I use it day and night, and I never experienced any breakouts. I have normal skin, and I apply 2 thin layers and massage them into my skin. St. Ives, keep it up!! And thank you for the great products that you make!"
I read so much about this before purchasing. Its the best buy you can get over any expensive moisturizer. Ive been using for about two months and I can tell a dramatic difference in the very small lines I had and has made my skin so soft! I dont normally write reviews on anything but Im truly happy with this product and plan to keep using!
"I love this product I been using the same jar for a couple of years now because I only use it for my face at night but a little goes a long way, I love how it helps diminish my laugh lines, but I'm really upset Timeless Face scrub is off the market!!!! Why??? That was a great product as well it tightened my skin and made my face very smooth. Please please please bring that product back and take one the apricots scrubs away we don't need two of that lol. Thank you."
This is a lovely product at a reasonable price. For me this product has worked as well and better than other higher priced products that do the same thing. But my main reason for loving this product is there is NO sunscreen! In this sun paranoid world I am very thankful for a product without it. Thank you St. Ives
I have acne prone and combination and I havent had any major breakouts what so ever! It had leave my skin really soft when i wake up in the morning. One thing is that it does look oily after applying it. My skin is usually like that with or without moisturizer after cleansing. Ive had acne in my teenage years and This helped me clear up my acne :)
have been using this for over 25 years - back when it was in a 16 oz pink jar! always keeps my skin hydrated and dewy and i will keep using it as long as they keep making it! everyone thinks i am a lot younger than i look and this is DEFINITELY one of my beauty 'secrets'. i get a lot of free facial samples from high-end companies and nothing compares to this miracle in a jar!!
"I am a 58 year old woman with a 28 year old neck. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer that does not break out my neck or my face. I would highly recommend this to everyone. It absorbs quickly, smells great and really keeps your skin moist all day."
"Ladies I am 52 and have been searching out a all over body lotion that is not too think and makes my skin feel amazing, I gave these out as Christmas gifts also and everyone I gave them to asked where got it, as you see I purchase the 3 packs, You have to try this you won't believe the difference in you skin."
I was excited to try this as I never use anything on my face but water even in the shower. I did not need much & it adsorb quickly. The only thing I did not like that made me hesitant on trying was when I got it home & opened the lid there was no protective cover of any sort just the lid itself. Now I found this strange & thought anyone could have tried it or could have tampered with it & I would never have known.
"I was looking for a moisturizer since one morning I realized I had flaky and patchy skin under my foundation. I was terrified so, I bought this moisturizer within 1 use I seen a whole lot of difference the next day my flaky skin was almost completely gone."
"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. At 61 I love your product. PLEASE DO NOT, DO NOT add sun screen. People who request it can buy some sun screen and put a coat of that over their moisturizer... I love this as a day and night cream....thank you for keeping the price low."
"I am a 30 year old female and have been using this facial moisturizer since I was 15 (my mom used it). It is the best facial moisturizer I have ever tried. It is light weight, non-greasy, and you don't need a whole lot to cover your entire face/neck. I'm not sure if it's the cream, or genetics, but although I'm almost 30, people tell me all the time I look like I'm 18."
"This facial moisturizer is absolutely the best moisturizer I have ever used! It leaves my skin soft and smooth with a natural glow. It has a pleasant scent and it is very affordable especially since it can be used as a day cream and a night cream. That's why I'm so glad there is no sunscreen in this product!! It is perfect just the way it is and that is why so many customers continue to use it just like I have for the past fourteen years."""
"I cannot say enough positive things about this exceptional cream. I have used many expensive brands that cannot compete with this product. This is inexpensive and very effective. With my department store products I could not get rid of dry skin, but this did it. It is not greasy and unlike my expensive products it actually is soothing and does not promote the redness I was having trouble with. One more thing, it is a great makeup primer and will not make your makeup slide off."
I'm a senior (72) female and have always had oily skin. As I've aged it has dried somewhat. I've never used any product on my face other than a medicated cleanser. About 3 years ago I decided to try St. Ives and found that it really works well. I don't know if it's the collagen but I have very few wrinkles and even the bags under my eyes have seemed to decrease. This is a great product at a bargain price.
"I'm 24 yrs old with oily/acne prone skin and this stuff is amazing! Since it moisturizes my face so good, it's not producing as much oil so my acne has calmed down a lot. And the collagen is a bonus! It's never too early to start using anti aging creams. I love that you get so much product for such a great price! I've told my whole family about it. I won't be buying expensive moisturizers anymore!"
I decided to try this moisturizer a few days ago. I didn't have high expectations because every mositurizer I have ever used caused acne. After the first night I was very impressed. My face WAS NOT broken out and it felt smooth and silky. Great Product! Please do not change it.
"I bought this product 2 years ago in the 12 oz size, and it has lasted me this long. I've tried other fancier or more expensive night creams during this time, thinking that would be better, but I always come back to this. Now I have to find it in the store again since I think they changed the packaging look. Super cheap, makes my skin feel like it did when I was 20. Agree with another reviewer, the only thing that would make this better is SPF. So I only use at night and after bathing."
"I'm so in love with this stuff! I'm getting into my late 20's and though it's a good idea to watch out for my skin early to prevent as well, also attempt to reduce my obvious expression lines where I smile. In just 3 days I have noticed an obvious difference. I have that youthful glow I'm suppose to have at this age. This stuff brought it back as well as minimized my smile lines and all without clogged pores or pimples! So happy, thank you St. Ives!"
"I have been using this since I was 18 years old. I am 25 now and everyone says I still look like a teen. No one can guess my age! I am a firm believer in prevention. As soon as you turn 18, you need to start using anti aging products on your face, neck, & decolatage! Because it's not about reversing aging (because you kinda can't)....its all about prevention! This stuff is truly a well kept secret. And by the way, my skin is very acne prone, but this works for me!"
"I have used this product for a long time, 10 years? I am 52 and fair skinned. I have recommended and purchased this product for friends and they love it too! I have virtually no wrinkles, lines or crows feets. Just beatiful radient skin! Thank you St Ives!"
"I have strugling before to find a product that will suit my skin type. I have dry sensitive skin and always having a problem with my flaky skin especially in the face, Im in my early 20's so I really need to moisturize my skin a lot. Then I discover this amazing product that blows my worries away and leaves me happy and contented as well as leaves my skin hydrated and fresh. It gives me glow and healthy skin that everyone is wishing for. And it keeps me on the go."
"The amount you receive is amazing! You get so much product for such a small amount of money. The scent of the product is so fresh. It wasn't overwhelming and my skin hasn't had any reactions from the fragrance (which may be natural). The days that I use the moisturizer, I don't experience any excess oil. The only thing I don't care for is the container. I didn't have a beauty spatula, so I had to use my hands which could cause bacteria growth inside the tub."
"I have been using this forever. Occasionally, I mistakenly buy a pricey cream, but they never work as well as this! Recently, I started using it on my neck and chest as well, and after one jar there is a remarkable difference! I told all my friends, and they love it too."
"This is such a pleasant facial moisturizer. I love the earthy smell, and the silky texture. It makes my face a bit dewy looking, which is fine. I didn't buy it for the anti-aging properties, but my skin does look younger. This product, and the Green tea scrub, have made a very noticeable difference on my skin. I don't know when I bought this, but I've had it for a pretty long time. This stuff goes a very long way. I will be buying this as long as I can, I hope it never changes."
"Light, smooth, non-greasy. At age 58, my skin looks much younger, and I particularly notice that my neck looks much firmer. I put a dab of foundation on my palm, and a dab of St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer, and mix to create a tinted moisturizer....no need to blend around the edges of my face or jaw, no settling into fine lines. Just perfect, creamy skin. I love this product."
I believe this is the best cream on the market! I have spent lots of money over the years to find the perfect facial cream and found there was none other than St. Ives. Please do not ever change a thing about it. I have been using it for over 20 years and will never stop buying it.
"first moisturizer I found I can put on and not be a grease ball by the end of the day, or when I wake up in the morning. I love it, it makes your skin feel soft and smooth and hydrated. I love that I can put it on under make up too and it doesn't leave any heavy greasy feeling. GREAT PRICE!"
"I was using Mirta for collagen and elastin - the price jump has me looking for a comparable product. So far, I have had no problem using this cream although the oil ingredient did concern me as oils tend to make my face break out in little bumps ( a common thing). Thank you for a good product BUT everyone is correct in wondering why there is no protective film for the product. Please consider a seal of some sort. I'd be willing to pay a bit more for the product assurance."
"To increase the collagen in your own skin, it cannot be absorbed through the skin by means of ingestion or a topical cream. Your skin has to produce it itself, and the way it does that is by being aggravated by some outside means, like the derma roller for example. Or a less painful inexpensive method is facial scrubs. St Ives has a few good ones. I like the apricot scrub. I like St. Ives products, but you ladies should know that anything with collagen in it doesn't do much good for collagen building itself."
"I have used the Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer for many years and have never found anything else I like as much. It has just the right consistency. My skin feels clean and clear, but soft and glowing. It has kept me looking 10 years younger. I love this product!!"
I have tried soooooooo many different moisturizers (from cheap to very expensive) and I started using this about a week ago and really like it! My skin feels tighter and much smoother. I use this with the Apricot Scrub and I also use the Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask every few days. I have definitely noticed that my pores are smaller. I think I have finally found some products that I will keep using!
"I've used several different moisturizers over the years, but have always come back to St. Ives. It is now my only moisturizer and I love it. It's creamy, smooth, absorbs into the skin quickly, and isn't greasy. I use it morning and night and it leaves my skin soft, helps minimize the fine lines and gives it a nice glow. Don't waste your money on the expensive brands, this moisturizer will give you the same results for a lot less. A jar lasts me about 4 months, no other brand can do that!"
"Just started using this and i love it so much that i want to marry it! So much different from what i used to use because i have oily skin and they usually made my face even more oily. And this doesnt! Would be a plus point if there's spf included. Also, worth every cents i paid for for such a huge tub!"
Amazing moisturizer . leaves the skin nice and soft and moist without the greasiness or tackyness of other products ive used! Will re purchase ! Especially for the 4 bucks I paid for it this creates soft glowing skin and a flawless base before makeup application
"I absolutely love this formula! It leaves my skin soft, without grease, and absolute radiant. I can visibly see the difference and I love it. The smell is beautiful and I would hope this product won't be discontinued. It's amazing and refreshing and I'll be very unhappy if it is ever taken off the market."
"The first time I used this lotion was when my mom bought me a jar when I was about 10 years old, I think it was in a pink container back then. I am now 24 and still use this lotion. This lotion is so soft and moisturizing, and a little goes a long way. My skin has always been so soft and I attribute this to using this awesome lotion for such a long time."
"Love this moisturizer. Have used it for about a month now and my skin feels so smooth and soft. My skin was starting to look ""thin"", but now it looks firmer and healthier. The weather has been hot and I was afraid it would make my skin oily, but it didn't at all. One suggestion: If it had UV protection I would have given it an Excellant Rating insead of Good. Love your products!!!"
"after spending so much money on skin products,finally i found this woderfull cream.....after a tiering day at work, exposure to sun ,pollution, and 2 hours in gym,just wash face and apply this cream as a thick layer is all what i have to do now for my skin care.......when i wake up,i have softer and glowing ,healthy ,brighter skin:) thank you guys"
"I bought my first Collagen Elastin online prompted by high recommendations, price and quantity. I am very fussy about facial beauty products and I usually favour ROC but I also love a bargain. I was delighted with the product. There is so much of it and it costs less than many of the better brands smaller versions. It feels light, soft and comfortable on, smoothes lines and plumps up skin beautifully. It also has a lovely subtle fragrance."
"I'm a 43 year old guy with oily skin who tans easily. I find this product to be awesome for 1) a nighttime moisturizer after I use an oil-cutting astringent, and 2) a hydrating treatment for my face after tanning. Either way, my skin feels great afterwards... soft without feeling greasy and firmer with minimized crows feet and sun stress."
This product is perfect and wonderful just the way it is. The thought of sunscreen being added to it makes me cringe ! sunscreen is an irritant to those of us with sensitive skin and it simply does not belong in this product . I like to use this cream not only in the morning but always at night too and I'm certainly not going to bed with sunscreen on my face (how stupid) . So many people love this product and have given it a five star rating and they have stated that they don't want sunscreen added either. Please leave it alone.
St Ives is full of timeless products and this moisterizer is no exception. It has a very silky texture that absorbs into skin fast without feeling greasy or leaving behind residue. I keep mine in the frig for an added cooling sensation. This miosterizer leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated without adding extra oils. I am oily with acne prone skin and I haven't seen a problem with it clogging my pores. And let's not forget how affordable it is! As with all St Ives products I feel like I get more for my dollar.
"I have been using this cream for years and hope it never goes off the market! I love it so much and the price is affordable for me. It's non-greasy and feels so pure on the skin and it does wonders for my skin tone and look! Keep it on the shelves forever, please!"
"I have been using this product for at least 5 years and I love it, but I am also having trouble finding it on the shelves. I don't know if it just sells that fast or the stores don't stock enough of this product. Whenever I do find it, I will buy at least 3 containers so I can be sure to have enough until I find it again. It is so easy and the price is right. It works so much better than the really expensive facial moisturizers. Thanks, please keep producing it!"
"I have tried soo many moisturizers for my face because I have oily acne prone skin and all the ones I have tried seemed to just irritate my skin more or make me look greasy. Although I don't have any wrinkles yet, I adore this product! It leaves my skin hydrated and extemely smooth and soft, without making me feel greasy. And I think it makes my makeup look even better on my skin and helps it stay on longer. It's by far the best facial moisturizer I have ever used and I doubt I will ever switch again :)"
"I've been using the Timeless skin formula for years, it was my favorite. I'm disappointed in the reformulated version. I appreciate that it doesn't have sunscreen as I am terribly allergic to traditional sunscreen and have to use zinc only. Consider bringing the previous formula back, I don't want to find a replacement. :("
"I love this product! Great price and you get a lot! I have combo skin. I tend to break out on my chin and sometimes my forehead, but still need moisturizer or I would really dry out. I learned that a thin layer is best and give it 5 minutes to soak in and dry on skin. I then use a primer, Clinique Super Primer, and then my foundation. Primer really helps my foundation to go on smoothly. The moisturizer has not caused any more acne and my skin feels great! It is not sticky either. I use it on my arms and hands too!"
"I love everything about this product, the fresh scent and the light consistency. I have no problems with the container, St. Ives please dont change the formula of this product and the packaging This product is amazing and it lasts forever. Its so amazing that Dr. Oz raved about it on his show <3"
I have very oily skin especially around my period time but this product doesn't make me more oily. I use it every night & when I wake up my skin looks soft & glowy not as if I slept in a pillow covered in oil lol. I love how this smells & I think it'll last me a looooong time bc there's a lot in the jar & I only dab my finger in it. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a protective seal thing so anyone at the store can use it & put it back on the shelf /:
"It is hard to find products without sunscreen so this product is wonderful. I don't understand the sunscreen fad and don't want it on my skin. I've heard that many people don't have enough vitamin D because they wear so much sun screen. St. Ives, don't give in to the fad. My skin feels great and I seem to have fewer wrinkles with your product so don't change a thing."
"This stuff is seriously amazing. It absorbs into the skin so quickly leaving a smooth, hydrated surface that is perfect for putting makeup over. I use this both day and night and immediately noticed that my skin felt more firm and smooth. I cannot sing enough praises about this product, and the best part? It's less than $6! This is definitely something I can see myself using for a very, very long time. I've only been using it for a few days but I am already in love."
I just started using this not long ago and I already love it! It leaves my face touchingly soft and personally I like the scent. Although I am a little bit confused about the packaging. I mostly see the jar version of this product but just not long ago I found the packaging in the squeeze tubes that are the usual cleanser tubes. I'm assuming the only reason is because I was looking at two different stores in two different countries.
"I love it! This moisturizer is light, absorbs quickly, and smells earthy. I prefer a thicker cream at night, but for daytime this is amazing. It absorbs so fast and no greasy finish! It leaves my skin soft and bright with not a sign of irritation to my senstive skin. Plus, the fact that the ingredients are natural makes me love to use St. Ives."
"I have been using this for a couple days. My skin is very soft and not greasy. I can't say yet if it is a miracle cream, but I really like the way my skin feels now. And for the price, I may start using this as my all over body cream!! My hands feel great too, I just rubbed the excess into my hands."
I'm about to order St. Ives for the second time. I'm 64 and like another lady bothered by skin on my body as well as my face so I purchased the product to use on my skin because of it's low price and it couldn't hurt to test it. I did and could see enough improvement on my arms and thighs to buy a jug of it if I could get it this way. Even if I hadn't seen this type of effect the look and softness of my skin after using it and the affordability make it a winner. Thanks for a great product!
I've been using this product for the past 27 years everyday. I am now 50 years old but I always come across people commenting that I look 28!! I give full credit to St.Ives collagen-Elastin facial moisturizer for keeping my skin soft and for restoring the natural glow. Thank you St.Ives!
"I love this moisturizer! I have been using it for well over twenty years. I am 63 years old. My skin is soft, no wrinkles and people say that I look much younger. Its like whip cream. I love it. When the store is out of it I get very angry! It is the best and very affordable too."
"I have been using St. Ives - Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer for many, many years, and I am 72 years old now. I have never found a better product for the facial skin than this; of course, I haven't looked elsewhere for probably 10 years. I haven't needed to because I am constantly being told I don't look my age. That is always nice to hear since I've never had any ""work"" done. When I look in the mirror, I see a 72 year-old-woman, but she does look very good for her age."
"I LOVE this product, I have used it for 20 years daily and I have old high school friends that say I look the same as I did in high school lol, its great. Im about to run out but this jar lasts a long time (at least 6 months) and now Im having a hard time finding it in stores, really sad :( when I do find it though, Im buying more than 1."
This moisturizer is great. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth with out feeling heavy and greasy. I just started using it two days ago and notice a difference right away. I would have to say that the only down side to it is it doesn't have spf in it but not that big of a deal. And the price is great compared to a lot of other moisturizers out there. Thanks for making such a great product.
"I absolutely LOVE this cream!! The texture is so creamy & smooth, goes on excellent, smells wonderful, and love the feel of my skin afterwards. I'm 52 and my skin looks 32!! I use this daily, and I always get questions on how I keep my skin so vibrant and smooth! I tell everyone that THIS is the stuff to use. Forget the pricey junk, try this instead!"
"I have very sensitive skin, and after trying many other (much more expensive) moisturizers, I've found that I love this one the most. It is so affordable as well. Please don't add sunscreen, for those of us with sensitive skin that just adds an extra irritant, I prefer to moisturize and then add sunscreen on top! I live in super dry Idaho and constantly struggle with dry, flaking skin as well, this stuff works great! Thank you St. Ives!"
I have combination/oily skin and LOVE that this moisturizer is very light on my face while leaving it tight and hydrated. It's not thick/ heavy and my makeup looks great over it. I've been using this since I was in college and I'm 24 years old now. I always get compliments on my skin. I love this product!!
"My skin gets very dry during the winter and I hate using moisturizers that make my face feel greasy. I found this product by chance while looking for the hypo-allergenic oil free moisturizer that I used to have, also from St. Ives. First of all, the tub is huge and second of all, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the price! I figured I'd give it a try and boy was I surprised! The skin on my face immediately stopped flaking and has not felt this great in forever! Thanks for such a great moisturizer!"
"I have used St Ives since in my twenties and my 2 children who are in their mid twenties haven't used anything but St Ives and we love it. Occasionally we have tried other products for a change and always go back to St Ives products. I love the Moisturizer because it doesn't feel heavy, greasy and it is fragrance free."
"I am 30 years old. I decided it's time to find a moisturizer. After so much research and unsure of what brand I should buy, I decided on this one. It's not to thick or thin. The smell is great. My face doesn't get all sweaty or oily looking. I do have combination skin. I love this. I even use it as a body lotion sometimes. Lol!"
"This product is awesome and does work BUT the strong fragrance makes my skin SO itchy. It doesn't look irritated by any means, but it burns and stings. I swear by St. Ives products, they're all I use (green tea scrub, oatmeal mask, pand the pink lemon scrub which occasionally bothers my skin but is worth it). I wish you guys would stop putting so much fragrance in your products because they would work perfectly fine without it! I would recommend this product to someone with normal skin for sure!"
"This really is a great facial moisturizer. It blends into the skin quickly without ever feeling greasy. In fact, after a few minutes after application, I can't even feel it on my skin. I also apply it around my eyes and it never irritates my eyes even if it gets in them. I have been using this for more than a year and plan to continue using it as long as it's available for purchase. I love this product."
I truly love this product and use it everyday. It makes your skin so smooth and supple without having an oily feeling. I don't just use it on my face. I use it on my entire body. My skin is so soft. My guy is always telling me what soft skin I have. I have been using it for 3 years now. I even got my granddaughters to start using it. You're never to young to start moisturizing. Try a jar. You won't be disappointed.
I absolutely love this face lotion. I have fairly sensitive skin and also oily skin. This is usually a tough combination to find lotion for but this lotion is amazing. It tightens my skin and doesn't leave me feeling greasy or break me out. Its also a very reasonable price.
"I have extremely dry skin and this moisturizer lasts all day! Most are gone by mid morning and I've tried a ton of lotions and creams over the years! This is the real deal and it smells amazing. Don't waste money on expensive overrated products, it doesn't get any better than this!"
"I am so happy with St. Ives Timeless Skin Facial Moisturizer, Collagen. I was going crazy with all the fine lines all over my face. I've been using it for just 9 days and the fine lines have improved greatly. I was shocked even though I read reviews from others who have used the product saying in a short time they saw improvements as well. The price is very reasonable. I certainly will be a repeat customer."
"St. Ives Collagen Moisturizer is just the best for all age groups.What held me back for years is that i thought a product so reasonably priced jut couldn't be good. I was so wrong! This is very good, also, as the 1st step prior to make-up application. The astounding thing is-it works AND it is so affordable. You get a lot of bang for your buck! The only problem for me is trying to find it."
"WOW,NICE SURPRISE! HAVE TRIED MANY CREAMS AND LOTIONS. HAVE SUPER SENSITIVE SKIN WHICH ONLY ALLOWS ME TO USE CERTAIN PRODUCTS. I LIKE ST.IVES AND DID NOT KNOW THEY CARRIED THIS! I CANNOT BELIEVE IN ONE DAY I AM ALREADY SEEING GOOD CHANGES IN MY FACE AND NECK AREA! I'M HAPPY! GREAT PRODUCT LADIES AND YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE! DON'T HESITATE...."
"I am 54 years old and I have no wrinkles, people always complement my skin. I have been using the Collagen Elastin facial moisturizer since my twenties. We went on vacation with my sister and brother in law last year and we where sharing a bathroom they used my mointurizer and they are hooked. I have to confess my husband has been using it for years and his skin looks better than his younger sister's."
"I was quite skeptical as to St. Ives timeless moisturizer being one of many creams sitting on my dressing top but it`s becoming my all time favorite. This huge tub contains moisturizer that would last a life time for a very reasonable price. I am not a big fan of the fragrance but I love the light texture. It doesn't feel greasy, great for mixing with foundations resulting in a dewy finish. Oh and its working wonders for my medium acne prone skin, with or without makeup !"
I've been using this moisturizer probably for almost 40 years. My youngest son is 22 and oldest is 36 and I still get compliments on my skin. I was recently told that I look too young to have a 22 year old! HA! I'm 59 and can pass for 40. THANK YOU ST. IVES! I don't think I could have done it without you.
"This is the best product i ever had ! I just have to post a review on it that im grateful St. Ives have such a wonderful moisturizer. I had dry skin and fine lines, dull face. This really brightens and firm up my face. Notice less fine lines and it gives me glowly skin without being oily which i love it !! Im so gonna stick to this moisturizer. I hope St. Ives doesn't make any changes on this, please just stay as it is and supply more stock in singapore !! <3"
"I am 65 years old - have lived with dry facial skin for so long and have tried so many moisturizers. I refuse to buy the expensive department store creams, believing inexpensive products can be just as effective as ridiculously high-priced ones if you can find one you are happy with. Since I tried this St. Ives product I have never strayed from it - light, freshly scented, lasts a long time and my skin looks and, more importantly, FEELS great all day. I use it as a day and night moisturizer - need nothing else."
"I've been using this for a while now and my skin feels and looks great. I highly recommend this product! I use the timeless skin scrub as a cleanser, and I am so disappointed that you guys have discontinued that product because it is one of the few products a use on my face that doesn't make me breakout."
"I have oily skin (always have, probably always will). This is the only moisturizer that keeps dry patches away, absorbs into my skin quickly, and doesn't cause me to breakout. I usually put it on under my makeup during the day in the winter time, and then I use it only at night in the summer. There is no point wasting your money on expensive,greasy, overly perfumed moisturizers when this stuff works great. I'm in my 20's, and I can even see a difference in my skin. You have to try it!"
"I just can't describe how much I love this moisturizer. For me, I have sensitive acne-prone skin and this has not broken me out once, which is absolutely amazing. It's soft, and it gives my skin a glow that makes it look like I just had a $100 facial. I am a little disappointed that I have run out and can't seem to find it anywhere!"
"My daily moisturizer! I use it morning and night and my face is much softer. Also, a little goes a long way! I originally bought this 3 months ago and I am just now only halfway through the container. Added bonus: Paraben-free! Very affordable and I will be buying this again!"
I'm on day 5 using this moisturizer and I'm impressed! My skin is usually very oily and dry at the same time ( yes it's possible). So far I'm much softer and less oily. It's nice to put on my daily makeup and not feel like I need to cake on powder because of oily skin.
I really like this face moisturizer ! It absorbs right into my skin without feeling sticky or tacky. It leaves my skin very soft but not oily. Will be switching to St. Ives Timeless facial moisturizer from the more expensive day & night creams I have been using. Great deal for how well it works !
I had to try this moisturizer after seeing how many great reviews it had. I've only been using it for about a week and my skin is already starting to look clearer after getting a few breakouts. It feels a bit oily when you first apply it but give it a minute and it absorbs right into the skin. Perfect for before applying makeup. It's also amazing that it comes with way more product than other moisturizers and is still inexpensive. Absolutely love this.
"This is a wonderful, lightweight moisturizer that doesn't sting or burn when you put it on. I use mostly at night and starting to use in morning as well. I highly recommend this product, but the only downfall is that it's hard to find in stores, so I was excited to fine it online!"
"I first bought it because I wanted to give myself a break from department store priced moisturizers, and I ended up loving it more that anything I have ever used! Hope they never stop making this, feels great on my face, never oily. Fixed my unbalanced face that used to be both oily In the T zone and very dry in other spots. It is also very important to me that the product has safe ingredients and no parabens. I look forward to washing my face just to put this on."
"This product lives up to its promise. It really does reduce wrinkles, and it is also economical. Plus, I am not allergic to it, as I am to all the other face products I have tried. I just wish St. Ives would bring back their excellent shampoo and conditioner."
"I live here in Kenya, I started using this product early this year 2014. Its the best product for my face. the skin is well moisturised, especially for this dry season here. above all my skin is smooth and soft.it is now my staple product. however, here we do have counterfeit of the same but I hope this could be addressed in time."
"I use this product as a moisturizer in my daily routine day and night. I love the feel of it, it's not too thick and not oily at all. It smells wonderful and you get a lot for the price and I only use a few dabs for each use. I will continue to use this product on a daily basis!"
"Would like to tell all what a great moisturizer this St Ives Swiss Formula is.For the money it is great,but the product is great and feels so good on face and neck.Dr. Oz even says its GREAT. So don't hesitate to buy it by the price. You wont be disappoin ted with it."
"I love these products. I use this lotion on my face as well. It has a nice scent and does wonders for my dry skin. I is it everyday after I wash my face morning and night. It is very gentle, I have sensitive skin and I have no reaction to this lotion. I would recommend in a heartbeat"
I struggled for years to find a good moisturizer that would actually moisturize my skin without making me break out. Almost every moisturizer would either break me out really bad or it wouldn't do anything for my dry skin. This one is perfect! Plus it's huge so I'm never gonna run out of it lol
"I decided to give this a try as Im in my 30s and am trying to prevent wrinkles. I can say I am not disappointed! A tub of this is around $5 and last ages. Ive been using every night for several months and Im not even halfway through. A little goes a long way. It has a nice light scent, doesnt make me greasy, and leaves me feeling moisturized! When I wake up my skin is plump and glowy!"
"Well let me start with I never ever give reviews for whatever reason. However, I had to respond on this miracle product. I love love love this moisturizer. Amazing results in just a couple of weeks!!! I have been getting compliments like crazy. Please please please keep this moisturizer on the market and Thank You!!!"
"I am so happy to see other reviewers also love the scent. It's so fresh, clean, and gentle. Please don't change it! I have used this product for years, and my skin feels so soft, not greasy, and I have accumulated very few lines over time. I will always buy it! Love!!"
"I am 22 years old and am in love with this moisturizer. It's light weight, goes on smooth, leaves my skin feeling so soft and supple. I bought it for the moisturizing properties and have been in love ever since. It doesn't cause acne and is a great night and morning cream. Hope they never discontinue"
best price&best results great glow after using with StIves peach scrub will never use anything else MY skin loves it. Ive tried everything and you cant find anything with theresults for the price. I can use it as a full body lotion for this price. Even my hands look better! dr oz is right why spend tons of $$$ which we think means better results only to be fooled by horrible marketing
"I purchased 2 other moisturizers prior to trying this 1 that cost too much, burned my face, didnt help my dry skin and smelled awful. Im on day 3 with this 1 and im in love. I want to buy the entire line and pray that it works as well as the moisturizer. And the price is amazing"
"I love beauty products and made the mistake of buying this based on reviews. Not sure why it has so many great reviews. On face few days and meh... It feels cheap, in a huge tub and you have to stick hands in it. Smell is funny and odd. I guess you get what you paid for. Using it as on legs until it runs out. :("
"I must be allergic to it, it made bumps on my neck and chest."
I've used it for years. I'm grateful that I can always order it from Wal-Mart.
I've been using St. Ives collagen for years and years!
its very good for your face as an antiaging moisturizer cause it smooths your face out..
"works great, not greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This skin cream for your face is amazing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My wife loves this product and has used it for years.
"Light and pleasant. Not irritating to sensitive skin, but no sunblock."
"Still can't believe the price for such a large container. My search for a good moisturizer is over,"
I like this moisturizer. it doesn't dry me out and my skin feels smooth and soft.
"Try it, you just might like it. I know I do!"
It did not provide enough moisture for my skin.
No better cream for the money on the planet. Period.
like it use it every morning and night makes skin feel real soft. and has a nice scent
"I love this moisturizer, especially after I wash my face in st. Ives scrub!"
Very softening to the skin. Even put on elbows and knees. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I saw something on Facebook about this product. I decided to try it and I have been hooked ever since.
It really woks within days. I have tried many products but this one works the best by far. Highly recommended.
"For such an inexpensive moisturizer it provides smoothness, brightness and a very pleasant smell. I would recommend this product."
"Doesnt make me breakout like more expensive moisturizers do and you get waay more product. It definitley moisturized my skin, no oily feeling after. Noticed lines on my forehead are less noticeable Just ran out and i an on getting more asap."
Its a good moisturizer. Another product that I have been using for years. It does not have a lingering smell or scent. I purchased when it was on sale or at a reasonable price.
This makes my skin feel so soft and smooth . This is also good for me because I have sensitive skin and it doesn't break me out
"A friend turned me on to this moisturizer months ago. It is so light and easy to apply, and the price is certainly right. My skin is so smooth that I don't even wear foundation any more--just loose powder brushed over the moisturizer."
Everyone thinks I'm 15 to 20 years younger. My skin looks just as young as it did 25 years ago since I started using Timeless Skin by St. Ives. Just a very few lines under my eyes and neck. Not too bad for a senior huh?
i usually wait a few month to test the product but i've been using this for a month and MY GOD! this is amazing i was on a search for a good product for my face and im not going back to any other products
"I'm am 69 and have been using this moisturizer for about 20 years maybe longer, I have no wrinkles. I've moved recently and had to get new doctors, even they can't believe how old I am looking at my face."
I absolutely love this product! The moisturizer goes on smooth and leaves no oily residue like most moisturizers I have used. It has a clean smell. I have recommended this product to friends and family.
Am a T zone mixed Face skin 34 years old and I tried all the expensive and New facial cream Nothing fits my skin and make it soft and bright like this one and am using it scince 2011 or before cant remember
"I love this cream, its light weight, absorbs easily and smells delicious. Great value for money and it really helps with my combination skin. I have posted a full review on thetreatmenttester a UK beauty blog"
"Never sticky, even in 90+ heat in the South. I am in my 50s, it is fabulous. My daughter is in her 20s (with acne), it is fabulous. PLEASE ADD SUNSCREEN to make this PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This moisturizer is the perfect fit for my combination skin. It's helped me have a more even skin tone and complexion only after a week and my face feels so soft.
Love the way it makes my neck and face feel. I am at the age I need all the help I can get and this moisturizer really works well. I look forward to trying other products from St. Ives!
"I've been a St. Ives user for about 2 years now and I absolutely love this moisturizer, it does the job like no other. It's light weight formula, fragrance free and it's super inexpensive. Keep up the good work! :)"
"Thanks St. Ives, for another great skin care product. The collagen elastic moisturizer is the perfect soothing and smoothing solution to my skin, without breaking my budget. A high class product for a fraction of the cost of other name brands."
I began using this skin cream when I turned 39 and was about to be married. I am now 68 and everyone thinks I am in my early 50s. It is fantastic and the only skin product I use.
I have been hearing about this moisturizer for awhile and decided to try it -WOW!!!! I just turned 47 and my skin already feels like I'm 27 ! LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and everything about it !!!!
I am 48 years old and have tried many facial moisturizers. I have very sensitive skin and found St.Ives to be a wonderful product.. I will purchase this again - its great!
THIS HERE LEAVES MY SKIN LOOKING FLAWLESS.. I LOVE IT & RECOMMEND TO ALL THOSE LADIES WANTING TO START THE FIGHT ON FINE LINES & WRINKLES. IT IS VERY AFFORDABLE & THAT IS A BONUS.
"I and my husband have been using this moisturizer for over 7 years. I also introduced it to my parents and siblings in Nigeria. Indeed, we can't go a day without it. I wish that it is repackaged with a pump."
"Great product....collagen and elastin....good stuff..., it is wonderful to find this product with those good ingredients in it....tell me it is going to be around for as long as I live!"
Great moisturizer for a great price! I use this at night and in the morning and it works great for my naturally oily skin. It lasts all day and absorbs very quickly.
"I've been using this product for years, I love it people tell you how young I look , that I don't age I tell them I've been using the moisturizer for a long time and I truly believe that's my secret. Thanks St. Ive's"
Lot of people want to know my secret fountain of youth and tell me they thought I was 35 after I reveal I'm 51 and tell them St Ives products especially the Timeless Collagen Moisturizer! Thank you for formulating such a great product!
"This is my all time favorite moisturizer for night. I have spent sooo much money on products and systems that do not work. I always come back to this! I wish there was the same product available with an SPF for day wear, tho!"
How refreshing to find a product that does exactly what it says it will do and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I am hooked. I will buy St. Ives for all my skin care needs.
Please never discontinue this amazing product. I love this moisturizer very much. It is very moisturizing and quite refreshing. I use it both morning and before bed. It smoothes your skin so nicely and leaves it soft. Great for acne prone skin.
I've been using this product since I was a girl and I always get compliments on my skin. I will never use another moisturizer. I would like as someone else suggested for a larger pump bottle like the lotions.
I use this as a night cream because there's no sunscreen in it...I have combination skin and it doesn't make my skin oily or broken out at all. Great product for the price!
"I have dry and very sensitive skin. After trying this out for a month, my skin became soft and supple. There's also a calming effect on my skin. No more dry skin and allergy breakouts."
Don't stop with your face...I also use this all over my body and while it's not super intensive it moisturizes well without any greasy feeling or overwhelming fragrance. Love It!
I will be 40 years old this year and people think I'm in my 20's all of the time. I like to believe it's from using St. Ive's moisturizing products for over 15 years. I can't say enough about it!!!
"I love this lotion. Most lotions make my skin breakout, but not this one. And it feels great going on. Just need to figure out where I can get more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw this product on Doctor Oz and recommended it to my mother who is 47. After she used it a couple of weeks I noticed her skin looked healthier and more radiant with fewer lines. My sisters have noticed as well and her face always smells good.
"I can't find this product in Portugal, I use it since I wento to Copenhagen many years ago and now my father starting using mine and I dont have it anymore"
"I have been using this product for 30 years and obviously I love it! It has the perfect consistency (not thick/gummy or too greasy), a light fresh scent and makes my face feel so smooth. It's like comfort food for my skin."
"This product is affordable, smells very subtle and good, and after only a month of using it my skin is much more firm and my fine lines are gone. The only thing i don't like is that it doesn't have a pump."
"I have been using this moisturizer for 5 years and absolutely love it. I can use a simple tinted moisturizer foundation with it and avoid the heavy, cakey look of most foundations."
"Wow. I've never written a review before... but thought I MUST for this. I've only been using this for a week, and I can already tell a difference in my skin. I am almost 25 years old and think i have found my ""secret weapon"" to aging gracefully."
I LOVE this product! I have used an expensive direct sales brand for years but love this moisturizer. I can't seem to find it anymore in my area please stock this!
I have used this product for over 20 years! I have really sensitive skin and it doesn't make my skin break out when I use it. It is the only product I have ever used that makes my skin feel truly moisturized.
"Ths is one of the best product that you have, I use it twice a day, and have never been had a problem with it. Before I was using you anti wrinkle cream but you took it off the market. This is the closest thing to that."
Ever since i started using this product in 2009 my skin just glows and is always looking fresh and nice... I usually apply it after washing my face.. Totally recommend it.. My top choice for a moisturizer
"I absolutely love this product! It soaks in great, is very light and doesn't leave my face feeling oily like a lot of facial moisturizers on the market! Not to mention the amount you get and the price is great!"
"Thanks to St.Ives -Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer.This is the 2nd day I'm using and my uneven skin tones vanished ,fine lines around my eyes vanished.It's Amazing."
I have used St. Ives for many years and I love the look of smoothness and the softness my face and neck have with the Timeless moisturizer people I first meet have a hard time believing I am 60.
I have used St. Ives products for many years. I love this moisturizer. It makes my skin so soft and not greasy. Really like it compared to the regular collagen elastine moisturizer. Love Love Love this stuff.
I loved. Results can be seen from the first day. The skin
"Feels very moist, smooth, soft as soon as you put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for 20+ years. My skin is beautiful! I use it every day, even under my foundation, if I wear it. The cost is more than competitive. I can feel a difference in my skin, if I forget to put it on. A great product."
i love it simply :) i just start using it 2 months ago and i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed it super amazing moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Living in a dry climate with dry skin, I need lots of moisturizing. This is the best facial moisturizer by far.  Feels great on, absorbs quickly, and last all day!"
"Best face cream ever!I use this cream more than 20 years and for me is something magical what happened with my skin.For the first time I saw this product at ""duty free "" at Turkey and I want to try it and after I don't stop to use."
"I just recently started using this cream, but I could already see and feel the difference, especially whenever I touch and feel my face. I have never been this happy and religiously contented, thanks to St. Ives"
"Great product and finally something Without SPF in it. I'm allergic to anything with SPF. I very much appreciate the ""natural"" aspect of this facial moisturizer. Thank you :)"
"My skin doesn't do great with products sometimes, especially moisturizers so I've been using this for about three years now and it's absolutely a life saver. Moisturizes without being oily and clogging pores!"
I just purchased this for the first time and I love it! The smell and the feel on the skin are great! Why can't this be used for the entire body and not just the face and neck?
I have been using this product for over a year and my skin looks and feels great!!!! I especially love that it does not leave your face feeling greasy. It just glows!!!!
I seriously can't live without this product ! The one & only great affordable drugstore moisturizer that doesn't break me out & keeps my skin moisturize LOVE IT !
I have used this product for years and love the results no lines or wrinkles and get told all the time that I look so young. I love this product and now my girls are starting it too.
"I have used this product for over 30 years, and love it! Very good moisturizer! I'm having a hard time finding it in the stores, so had to order it online. Wonder why it's not in the stores anymore?"
I have been using this moisturizer since I was 25; I am now 44 and everyone I meet thinks I'm in my early 30's. It has helped to reduce any kind of wrinkles and made my skins smooth and vibrant.
"I have used this moisturizer for more than 4 months and I have noticed blackheads and hard sebum on my pores, I dont recommend this cream if you have acne prone skin or big pores since it will make you break out."
"I have been using this cream for about a month, and my skin looks better. This cream is not oily. It goes on so smoothly. It soothes the dryness and relaxes the fines lines on my face and neck."
I just love the soft scent of this moisturizer! I am very sensitive to smells and this is to die for...I just wish you had a body lotion with this soft fragrance as well. Although I have been using this on my arms and hands as well :)
I love this stuff I know Im only 20 years old but out of everything I've used I honestly have to say it's the best!! non irritating to the skin very gentle and creamy!! I could use this all my life and really does diminish lines!!!
I gave this 4 stars because it doesn't have any SPF in it. It really needs some for it to be a proper daytime moisturizer. Other than that it is a great moisturizer.
I have super dry skin around my nose and forehead area especially around this time of year when its bitter cold out. So I got this to try out and it definitely moisturized my dry spots and makes my skin feel super soft!
"This moisturizer is a great deal for the price! It has a nice consistency that is not too thick, and a light clean fragrance. I put this on at night before bed and wake up with the softest skin in the morning!"
"Love this moisturizer, I always have a had a difficult time looking for a good moisturizer since my face is oily. But I like this one plus it's a pretty good size jar and lasts a very long while. I recommend it."
Hard water can really take a toll on the skin but this cream moisturizes it right back up. I love to put it on in the morning and evenings right after a shower or bath. I would totally purchase again.
Been using this for about two weeks now. It seems to add a nice moisture to my skin and it's keeping that dry winter skin at bay. I don't see any drastic fine line changes but hopefully with more use I will see some big changes
I use this on my hands and face. Its nice and lightweight and very mousturizing. I tried using CeraVe on my face and it always makes me break out. This hasnât made me break out at all yet. Iâm hoping it stays that way.
"I think this product is really good for dry skin, it adds a glow to your skin and makes it look hydrating especially using it with fresh skin apricot scrub!"
"This product arrived damaged. The plastic container cracked in half, along with the cap. Cream all over box. I'm so disappointed. I live in NY so there are no Walmart stores here to return it to, unless I travel to a neighboring state. Uggggh :-("
"This is a pretty good, light moisturizer, it sinks in pretty quick and it's very gentle on my sensitive skin. It lasts forever and for $5.44, you can't beat it! I have noticed that it can be a bit much if you have oily skin but it's perfect if you have dry skin! I have bought this many times and it is the only moisturizer I use. I do wish it came with a pump though.... Overall, I would recommend this product."
Loved this product for the price! Hands down my favourite budget moisturizer. The St. Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer was my go-to while travelling (to both colder and warmer climates). This moisturizer helped my skin cope with the climate change by keeping it calm and refreshed. Definitely a staple in my skincare regime.
Bought as Xmas gift. Wife loved it!
I love this moisturizer!!!!! Feels sooooo good on my skin.
Will keep using this product!
Ive been using this for one week and I can already feel the difference in my skin
My skin feels smother than ever before at just one week using this cream OMG!!
Absorbs well. Smells great love this
"Great cream for a great price, also use it on my arms & legs for soft skin"
Used the product for years. Thumbs up!
Great product arrived timely. I order from Walmart all the time. Highly recommend
Great product and good price
"This stuff is fluffy & makes dry skin have some moisture. It keeps going up in price I have noticed in the stores. It is a great moisturizer for for the price. I use different ones & this is one of them. One for the day, one for the night, one for under my make-up & one because during the winter the heat dries out your skin. They did have a great buy for 2 of them. At least in this jar you get A LOT, not like the 1.7 which is a very small amount & some cost too much & does NOTHING PROMISED! Great product!"
"I absolutely love love this cream it makes my skin feel smooth, and soft to the touch and my skin is more radiant. I usually go for the brand names with the you get what you pay for attitude, but this definitely takes them out! And for less than 5 dollars! If your debating this product stop and buy it already!!"
I had the worst experience ever from the moisturizer. It was my first and last time I used it for two weeks and ended up with the biggest break outs in my life. So bad that I'm embarrassed to even leave my house. I'm so disappointed in the results as I'm still trying to recover from the breakouts . 
"I've used this facial moisturizer for almost 10 years now, on my face and neck.It's non-greasy, and works great under makeup, everything about it feels good. The price is a bargain.I credit the quality of this product every time I get a compliment on having ""a youthful look"", and have recommended it to family members. When my local Walmart is "" out of stock"", I order it online, because I don't want to use anything else."
"I have really sensitive eczema prone skin and this has been my favorite facial moisturizer for the past few months I've had it. I used to have dry flaky skin in certain spots, but a combination of exfoliating and using this has taken care of that issue. Also it's not too heavy to use in the morning and during summer for me. I might get something a bit thicker when winter comes but this might be fine to use. We'll see (:"
"This moisturizer is amazing! I have tried many different brands (including high end) and nothing works like this. It leaves my skin so soft without being oily or greasy. Doesn't break me out, in fact it tightened my pores! It doesn't feel heavy and goes perfectly under make up! For the first time I feel confident with my skin!! Even my friends saw the results and have purchased this moisturizer for themselves. I have no complaints!!!"
"Absolutely Amazing!! Feels terrific, smells good, lasts forever!! As to the reviews about sunscreen... I'm a VERY fair skinned Red head :) I wash my face, put this on and let it soak in while I get dressed, then I put my sunscreen on OVER it!! Works GREAT!!"
I've had this same moisturizer for about 3 years now and I am completely in love with it! It makes my face feel so soft and I do not have a single wrinkle. I love all the st.ives products and I will continue to purchase this moisturizer. Thank you for making such a great and affordable cream!!
"I just bought this so haven't used it long but dd want to out there that I tried this on some stretch marks I have( had a son last june2014) and it instantly worked wonders! They don't seem as prominent. They aren't completely gone with one use of course but after seeing just ten minutes on some of the looser skin, I am in love. I feel with regular use it will help drastically change my tummy! Love it! Haven't used on my face yet since I am prone to breakouts I may not. But love it for other areas that need firming."
I have been using this product as long as it has been on the market; I say maybe 35 to 40 years. I am 70 years old and get compliments all the time about how wrinkle free my complexion is. I am impressed myself with the texture and tone of my skin. I will continue to use this product because of those reasons and for as long as I can purchase it. I can't find it on store shelves anymore so that's why I ordered two jars. Thanks St. Ives for a great product!
"I tried this lotion after using the timeless apricot face wash. While it is the best facial moisturizer I've been able to find in the US I do not think it is as effective with the face wash no longer around. It still however is very compareable to the Korean brands I used to use. It's non oily, doesn't leave your skin shiney, and leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed rather the heavy and weighed down."
"This moisturizer is great! It smells good! I'm only in my teens and I use this, because it is the only moisturizer that won't break me out. You only need a little bit. :) I usually only use it 3 times a week, because it can give your face a little bit of a oily feel if you use too much, and if you use it too often. I use it after I wash my face with St. Ives Pink Lemon and Mandarin Orange face scrub."
Good moisturizer
This made my face break out...I do have sensitive skin...would probably be fine on my body but not my face.
"These bottles are smaller than the ones you generally see in stores but they do cost less. I prefer the larger bottles, but these are the same product and will be easier to travel with so I am not disappointed. This body wash smells nice, does not cause allergic reactions and helps with dry skin."
If you get super dry during the winter time this will defiantly be your best friend!
I have been using this St. Ives product for years.
This moisturizer is very lightweight with no oily after feel! It absorbs quickly too!
"Love this stuff,feels great on my skin not to greasy,just perfect and it absorbs fast leaving my skin feel so soft"
"I'm 26 years old and I've been using this moisturizer for about a year now, I think this is better than a lot expensive moisturizers"
The old formula in the pink jar was far superior to anything else on the market for over ten years and I cannot find it anywhere.
Please what is in this jar is amazing. I bought it because of tiny wrinkles on my smile line this clears my uneven skin tones.
This moisturizer is simply amazing!!! My skin is soft and smooth and wrinkle free at 51. I would love a lotion with an SPF and an eye cream please!
Seriously love this product! I've been using it for about a year now and love the fragrance and how my skin feels after every use!!
"I always use this product right out of the shower, and it leaves my face feeling wonderfully refreshed without being oily!"
"I have been using this for years, and love it! It has the best non-greasy formula, and absorbs so quickly. PLEASE, MAKE ONE WITH SPF!!!!"
This product is magical. Amazing scent and hydrates the skin perfectly. it does not clog pores. I will definitely purchase another jar. Love.. love!
THIS FACE CREAM IS THE BEST! IT'S NOT OILY GOES ON SMOOTH AND FEELS GREAT EVEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY. I DEFINETLY RECOMMEND!
Have been using for many many years. I don't need makeup due to my even skin tone and firmness. I look 10 years younger.
It's light weight and absorbs quickly. Leaves my skin feeling like silk. I hope they NEVER stop making this wonderful cream.
Excellent for day and night. Contains colagen which is crucial to nice firm skin. I have been using it for years and my skin looks great.
It leave your face moisturized all day long.... I can say no more...Two thumbs up...Thanks a lot St. Ives!
"while living abroad i met this facial cream, i bouhtg in my country, Chile, but it isnt selling no more WHY???!!! :("
I am in love with this product;my eye Doctor cant believe that I am 67 years younger. In love for ever. Lu.
Love the feeling of this cream. It soaks in and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. Skin is so soft. Can tell a real difference. Love it
"great product for everyday use, not heavy but not too light either, great for day or night and it makes my skin look and feel great"
"I love everything about this produc, I have a really dry skin and I recommend this product for everyone it's very good"
"I love this moisturizer, because not only does it make my skin super soft, it's a great price even though it's hard to find at your local store."
"Its not greasy on my skin. I love what it does to my face when I wake up in the morning, it gives me that fresh looking skin that I always wanted."
"I have been using this product since I was about 20 years old, I am now 71 and I have very few wrinkles."
Great product. Makes my skin tight and firm. Doesnt leave my feeling greasy or oily. I would recommend this to my friends
The BEST can honesly compare to Le Mer!! I have tried them all. St Ives is the finest most well kept secret that needs to be known!
I am in LOVE with this moisture. I have been using it for years. I have gotten so many compliments on how beautiful and youthful my skin looks.
Just started using this. Was very confused as to why there was no protective seal. Seems super weird. But i like the product.
"I've been using this for over a year.Nongreasy,does not clog pores.I use morning and night.Great product!"
This moisturizer leaves my face feeling fresh and soft without feeling heavy or greasy. It also has a lovely light scent.
This moisturizer smells soooooo good and has such a good consistency. So hydrating and moisturizing!!
This is a light soothing and refreshing cream. I find the collagen elastin the ideal cream to use after derma rolling
This leaves my skin feeling not oily. It also has reduced some little wrinkles I've had! I'll be using this for as long as they make it
This is the only moisturizer I have ever put in my face. I used to combine it with the cucumber toner that I cannot find anymore.
My wife is trying this out to compare to oil of olay. She may like olay better but this works fine also. The jury is still out.
This is such a great moisturizer! The price point is awesome! Its almost a dupe for the hope in a jar. Its so great and hydrating!
"No better or worse than any other similarly priced product. Use sparingly though, can be a bit heavy. Mild scent."
I love love love this moisturizer! It keeps my complexion soft and smooth and light enough to wear under makeup. The jar lasts me forever!
I read the reviews before I bought it. My face very dry I put it on and after about two hours doesn't even feel make my face feel soft or hydrated.
The perfect moisturizer for hydration without the heaviness of other creams. Great for your body too
"Breakouts like I haven't had since I was 14. Which, granted, is a more youthful appearance, but not the one I was going for!"
I have been using this product for 3 years I love it.. it is refreshing not greasy at all the price is great
This product is amazing works well on my face and I use it on my body. It makes my face feels and look fresh all day long and makes my skin soft.
I started using this when I entered my 30's to help with anti-aging skin care. I could not pass up the value! The jar last forever. I even used it on my loose areas after my c-section. I will always continue to buy this product.
I like this so far. Its very thin feeling so I use it under my makeup. Works well. The price is great for the amount you get. Its not my favorite moisturizer but its good.
I actually use this on my stomach at night. It's a great product with a great scent at a great value. I use it for some extra skin from having kids and it keeps everything tight. Love it and would recommend!
"I came across this cream a few years ago and fell in love with it. It is leaves your skin hydrated and glowing. I am never without it. I apply it all over. Face, neck, arms... I apply it right after my shower and in the morning. Love it!!!!"
"I have used St. Ives colleges elastin face moisturizer for many years. Now I can't find it anywhere....CVS, Walgreens, supermarkets. Why are they not carrying it anymore?"
This product works well. I noticed a difference in my skin.it smells good. I haven't had no recent break outs. Good value seems like it will last awhile. A little product goes a long way
St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Moisturizer met my expectations. It did leave me feeling a bit greasy though. It is very gentle and has nice packaging too. I will definitely buy this again when I run out.
"It smells great and it's somewhat gentle on the skin (however I am very careful not to rub too hard either, so o my use gentle motions). It's a good exfoliant to keep by. I also leave it on for 5-10 mins after exfoliating."
"Fabulous aroma, gentle, and packed with moisture. Absorbs well into skin. Light weight, leaves skin baby soft and smelling clean. Affordable and the product last for months. My to go to moisturizer. A must have in everyones cabinet."
Bring back the timeless formula it was so much better i don't think I will be using this one
"One of the best products I've used. Silky smooth, absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft all day."
Purchased this for me and my mother. Works great so far. Leaves skin soft and not greasy.
I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am so disappointed. The texture feels like water and my face and neck don't feel pampered. I would compare this to moisturizer to the dollar store quality.
"I see positive results, after just a few days use. I really like the light consistency and very subtle scent of this moisturizer. Highly recommend it."
I have used this since I was 16 and I am 48 now. I do not have a lot of wrinkles. I love this moisturizer. Not to thick like some others I have tried. Can't beat the price. I will always use this!
I am using that product more than five years and I am so happy with it!
"It feed your skin enough, not to be greasy, not to be too oily, just enough to feel and look great!"
"This is by far the best moisturiser I have ever used and I'm 60 and have tried them all! This holds up against the most expensive of moisturisers and then some! It's true,y amazing!"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a few years and it is amazing. It makes my skin so soft and it feels so hydrated, without feeling greasy. You get beautiful skin for an amazing price."
"I use this miracle skin cream everyday! You are never too young or old to start using it , It will meet you where you are at. Works great in giving a clearer bright Soft smooth complexion!! Wow I sound like an ad lol, but it is true!!"
Good product wife loves
Great product.
it works very well
"On my quest for an economical facial moisturizer, I bought this because of the brand and the type. Also, it was a good price for the quatity. I have proudly used St. Ives scrub and mask products since I was teen. I am aware of the Avoid the eye area warning, and have been doing so, yet, my eyes have been watering for the two days. My eyes are just too sensative. Better luck next time."
"I love this- it makes my skin feel great. One thing I worry about is that it isn't oil based so it's quick to be absorbed, but when the wind blows on my face, I feel like my face is losing moisture again. I would buy again. it smells clean and fresh."
I have used this product for many years and I love it. It has kept my skin soft and wrinkles less noticeable. I would recommend this product to any age group. Do not spend your money on products that cost a lot. Try this one. It may work for you like it has for me.
"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! Now, I have combination skin and I use a drying face cleanser. This moisturizer significantly minimizes the dryness and yet to have a single dry patch on my face. Also the price is so right with how much you get (I got mine for around four bucks). Totally worth it!!!"
"This is one of my favorite moisturizers! It is available at most drugstores for a reasonable price. It is only lightly scented, and it goes away within minutes of application. It feels like it moisturizes deep, and it's definitely not sticky. My skin feels plump and supple the day after applying this moisturizer."
"I'm 23 and finally realizing that all my hours working and not sleeping, too much sun exposure, and not enough moisturizing are all going to catch up with me. My skin feels amazing. I have combination skin and this helps my dry areas and doesn't over-do it on my oily areas. And it smells absolutely amazing!"
"St. Ives is a product that I used years ago and recently re-discovered. After trying the more expensive products, I found that paying more in cash doesn't always equal more in benefits. This 10 oz jar priced at under $5.00 dollars is worth every penny."
"Since I hit my 30's, my face has become very dry. This moisturizer works wonderfully at keeping my skin soft and moisturized all day. I've tried expensive items that don't work as well as St. Ives. For the price and the outcome, I'll be sticking with St. Ives."
"This moisturizer is great! It's lightweight, but does the job! It leaves my face feeling soft. My face can be sensitive to a lot of products, but this one is gentle. I like the fact that the container allows you to use ALL of the product! Yay!! The amount is generous and lasts a long time...I'm a big fan and a big fan of the same hand lotion - I've used the hand lotion for years!! A great product!!"
"Probably one of the better facial moisturizers I have used and good value (it'll probably last me a year). Like that it didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. However, fact that it doesn't have SPF protection is annoying. Would be fantastic product if they added that."
"Feels rich at first but disappears into the skin with no heavy greasy feeling. Skin feels soft and moisturized and causes no breakouts. I will be using this cream for my face, neck and body and maybe my hands too, though in the winter i use their oatmeal moisturizer for my hands. Love this brand!"
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer and pray that it NEVER changes or is discontinued!!! at almost 50, it has made my skin soft, clear and silky. I have used every cream, lotion and potion ever made and THIS is the one I know I can count on. please keep it comin!!"
"I noticed my skin was getting very dry and was looking for good inexpensive moisturizer. I loved the apricot scrub from when I was a teenager so when I seen this product I was figured I give it a try since I already trust this brand. All I gotta a say is since using this product my skin has not been dry at all, it's very light weight, leaves skin looking healthy and youthful, and absorbs quickly. Really loving this product so far and will continue to use and recommend to my family and friends"
I like your products. so I was looking for a new moisturizer. and sent I already know and use your other produce I decided to try this one and fell in love with it and makes my face so soft. I use it at night and in the morning. and does not make my face fell oily.
"I was really rooting for this product, but it fell so short for me! The smell is awful and overwhelming, it even made me nauseuos. It also wasn't very hydrating for a moisturiser, my skin still felt dry even after a thick application. Overall, this product did not meet my expectations and was a product I regret buying."
Absolutely amazing. Moisturizes and leaves skin feeling so soft with no greasy feel.
Love Love Love my skin using this product. I will never switch to anything else.
"Good moisturizer if you have dry skin , and very refreshing smell and it is gentle on the skin ."
I have many years using st. Ives
Love all products. ❤️❤️❤️
Its very light and easily absorbed by my skin it leaves my skin soft and smooth
Love this stuff but can't find it on the shelves anymore. Where can I buy it?!
Love the way my face feels after I put it on. Will never use anything else.
I love my moisturizer early in the morning and at night. It' smooth and clean.
Have used for years. Always get compliments on my skin.
A nice light facial moisturizer that makes my skin glow I have this on hand all the time
"I love this product. I use it every day, and nobody believes me when I tell them how old I am."
This facial product makes my skin feels and looks great. I use it every day.
It smells and feels so awesome. The skin feels kind of silky with no oily texture
Do not know how to add photo. Love the item. Am age 77 with no wrinkles.
Love this cream. Not oily and I like that it has no sunscreen.
This is my number one moisturizer! I love it and I feel like ill never run out! Worth it!
Its light and feels good on the skin
"Doesn't clog up my pores, soaks into my pored immediately, goes on smooth onto my face."
Wonderful facial moisturizer! Very light and not greasy at all.
"The products leave my face feeling smooth ,soft and pores looking smaller."
"It is a very good moisturizer for the price, and it does not make your skin oily."
"Greatest product keeps me looking young, gets rid of wrinkles immediately!"
"Second to none, and I would use no other product on my face."
I've used this for two days now and I can't believe how soft my skin feels. Absolutely love this!
This product is great I will be repurchasing it again.
I love it. It's not greasy. Goes on smooth and dries fast. My face looks a lot better
I would not recommend this product as it is too much like a lotion consistency not a face cream.
"This product stings my face a little when I put it on my face, but it goes away the more I rub it in. I use it as a night moisturizer and it works."
I really like this product I do have oily skin so I don't use it daily but when I do it leaves my skin so soft.
"Loved it, it goes into your skin so easy and I personally use it as a primer. It make makeup go on so smooth and adds a nice finish."
I love this. It makes me feel refreshed. I believe my skin is getting the moisture it needs this winter!
I am a great fan of this brand ..... This product is amazing and I like the formula and texture of it ... love it
I like this moisturizer and it gets the job done. It is very gentle on the skin and it makes my skin look very moisturized and dewy.
The absolute Best moisturizer for your money! This one product has replaced about 5 other moisturizers I had been using previously.
"My facial Face skin super dry.now I'm using this product it's great for me.I'm Happy now,thank you for Walmart."
I love EVERYTHING about this moisturizer ❤️ From the smell to how it makes my skin feel. Love love love it.
I have sensitive skin. This product in not irritating to my skin & it moistureizers without being greasy!
I'm really upset it took me so long to realize this product does not work with my skin. It was fine for the first week I used it and then all of a sudden I started getting so many pimples all over my cheeks and neck.
"This face moisturizer is something I would definitely buy out, after cleansing my face it gets dry sometimes but this moisturizer helps hydrate my face and gets rid of the dryness. I would most definitely recommend this to people."
This product is absolutely amazing for anyone who has dry skin and cannot find anything to work for them. I absolutely love it! Definitely would give it more stars if I could!
"I agree with all the reviews.I already see the softing of my crows feet by the eye area,and the skin tone.i like everyone spent a lot of money on skincare,not anymore this will be added to my reorder items thanks"
"This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever tried! ... my skin loves it, I'm pregnant and my skin suddendly got so dry!!! I was using this before and I love it!! I'm still using it now and my skin feels so good after every use!!!"
Just buy it 2days ago and hesitate because its a face product and didnt have a protection seal. At the first application you feel a difference in the skin and it feels comfortable. I trust in having good results.
"I've used expensive, mid priced, and cheap moisturizers, all of which have made me break out. This is a light feeling moisturizer and so inexpensive! I will recommend this to friends!"
"Last a very long time and a little goes a long way. Also, I really like the smell, don't know why it doesn't smell like flowers or anything but I like it."
I am a 60 year old man with sensitive skin especially after shaving. My girlfriend bought St Ives facial cream really felt great after shaving. Added benefit of tightening wrinkles really like this product
This face cream is wonderful!! So light and very fresh feeling to skin. Not heavy at all. Great under makeup in these hot summer months. Thanks St Ives
I have been using this product for about 2 years. I am only 23 years old when I started using this. It is important to keep you skin hydrated by adding this and drinking a lot of water. This product leaves my skin nice and it not oily !
"I have used this moisturizer for many years. I love it because it doesn't have a heavy perfume. I goes on easy and absorbs into my skin. I sometimes combine it with the expensive moisturizers, that works nice. It's the onlu one buy again and again."
"I use is right after I pat my face dry from washing it. I use it in the morning and at night. It makes my skin I irresistibly soft. I love this product, and reccomend it greatly."
I have dry mature skin. This moisturizer immediately makes the skin feel hydrated and continues for most of the day. It also has no odor and not greasy. Exceptional buy!
" ok, so I usually use cetaphil because it's fragrance free. However, despite the rather pronounced smell, I do like how light this is and how easily it sinks into my skin. One thing though: along with the tub, could you guys produce a smaller bottle or pump for travel and hygiene? Other than that, I like this one. Thanks! Maybe you could also create a scentless version."
Love this lotion very moisturizing but doesn't leave a greasy residue. Leaves your skin soft like a baby and very light feel on your face. I live in a humid state so I have to wait a bit before going out so my face don't feel like it's melting. But all in all perfect lotion and a great price for the amount you get since you only use a pea size of it.
I've been looking for a facial moisturizer for about a month so after all this looking my girlfriend recommended st ives the 1st day I used it I never felt so new so clean and so hydrated . Please st ives keep this product in the stores and always on my drug store shopping list and in my heart . Finally found you
I don't care for this product because it makes my pores look BIGGER!! the cream itself is Very thin almost like it's been watered down. Also doesn't help with dryness my skin looks worse. Well like the saying goes you get what you pay for. Only bought it because of the price Never Again.
"This is my favorite moisturizer to use. I use this every night as my moisturizer all over my face, neck, chest, and sometimes even my elbows. It's not sticky or greasy and it sinks into be skin quickly. I've already gone through an entire container and have already repurchased!"
"I like the scent, the texture and how easily it absorbs BUT... I have used this product for a couple of weeks and after a few hours my skin feels tight/dry. I assume I have dry skin then. I was using Clinique's moisturizer and I didn't have this problem. I will finish this jar and once out I will have to go back to Clinique's. Maybe more oil or more moisturizing ingredients would make this product better for people with dry skin like me."
"Have used more expensive cream for years, decided to try after reading the reviews. I really like it. A little dab will do ya so it goes a long way. Just bought a jar for my daughters, wish I could find it in the stores but by mail is fine because of no postage charge."
"I wouldn't say this facial moisturizer was a miracle worker. It didn't change the firmness of my skin on my face. However, I do use it as a body lotion and seems to moisturize ok. The price is great and the scent is very light. I might repurchase this as a body lotion but not as a facial moisturizer."
"I went to Walmart to pickup two other face products that I wanted, and I just picked this up to try it out. It was very inexpensive, so if it didn't work oh well. To my surprise, this product feels very nice on my skin. It's not greasy, and not thick, and smells very nice. I have my favorites that I use nightly, but I use this when I want to do something different for my nightly face cleansing. You get a lot of product for the price. I don't know if I will purchase this in the future, but I will use up the jar that I purchased."
"For the price, it is an acceptable product. Nothing too great. Doesn't do much for my dry skin. However the scent is too overwhelmingly strong and unpleasant. That's why I only give it 2 stars. If they didn't put fragrance it it, I would give it 4 star because you can't beat the price."
Love this product so much! Would recommend to anyone! Defiantly worth the price! :) love!
it makes my skin so soft and moist without greasy feeling.
Awesome
Recommend
I would give 10 stars if possible. Great product. I like the light texture and scent too.
"I love this product, price and quality can't be beat."
"I love this! Works just like the expensive ones, but naturally...."
I enjoy buying St Ives body products but this was a miss for me. My skin is sensitive and reacted to this moisturizer.
I love this product! I used it 1-2 times daily and I am never disappointed. I saw this product on Pinterest over a year ago and have used it since.
"Damaged skin after few days of use, with severe dryness and red. Been over a month and redness hasn't gone 100% away!"
"I love this moisturizer! It leaves my face feeling hydrated, firm, and soft. I've used this for years!"
I have been using this product for years. Love it. I have a hard time finding it in my area. Not sure why.
I love the texture and scent. It feels amazing going onto your skin and a little goes a long way. The scent is nice and light
"I been using this product for a week , i see and fell a big difference , dry super fast and is not oil at all . I would buy again."
My skin feels soft and does not look or feel oily. And the scent is fresh but not too much fragrance to the point where i get tears. Love it!
"I bought this product after reading all the good reviews about it, but to my horror after 2 -3 applications only, it made my face red with rashes and even more dry than before. It's a moisturiser but it made my skin flaky."
This is my everyday face moisturizer. I love it! It goes on smooth and doesn't leave a greasy or oily feeling after. My skin is combination (oily and dry) and this cream works for both aspects. This is my brand!
Make shin on face and neck feel firmer and smoother then before use of St. Ives Facial Moisturizer cream. I used it for years but all of a sudden couldn't find it in stores Finally Walmart started selling it .
"I really like St. Ives and their products. This is a great daily moisturizer to use. Helps keep in moisture and clear up dry areas, giving you a natural glow. Affordable and easy to find in department stores."
Excellent. The best product I have ever use for my face and skin. It works amazing. Your wrinkles are disappeared in your eyes. You look younger and have a radiant skin. This product is amazing. I have been using for several years.
This cream did not seem to irritate my skin but it did not give me enough moisturization and I did not see any results from the collagen it supposedly has. It is very thin and seems like a very cheap made product.
"This moisturizer is so much better than other creams that I have used. The smell is good and it is so lightweight. With some of the other creams, the smell is horrible and the creams are so heavy. However, this moisturizer is simply perfect."
Me and my sister just started using this product about 4 weeks ago. And we see a difference In our skin. My sister lost a lot of weight and this lotion has really helped her firm the neck and face area..
Really like this. It feels awesome on my skin. Not greasy and it smells good. Not a strong smell. This is not for oily skin and I have oily skin so I stopped using this.
"Makes your skin feel like when you were a baby , holds moisture into the skin, I've been using St. Ives for years, for the low price, top , top quality . If your tierd of trying a zillion creams, you'll love this !!"
"not oily, not greasy, very soft , lightly and silky, very good for summer use. and it's not expensive at all. I wish it can be more moisturized for longer hours."
I've only been using this product for a few weeks and so far the results are good. Ppl tend to ditch a product without finishing it so with that being said I'm going to finish a whole jar before I'm fully impressed!
"I worry about trying new products because I have very sensitive skin, but this is great as a before bed cream. They recommend using it twice a day, but if I use it twice a day I do get some little breakouts. I recommend using it once a day."
"This is a wonderful product, works as well as Olay Regenerist or Avon Anew at 1/10th the price. Everyone I've recommended it to loves it too. Hope they NEVER stop making this at this price point."
"LOVE.....LOVE THIS CREAM. I ALWAYS BOUGHT EXPENSIVE FACE CREAMS, JUST BOUGHT TO FILL IN WHILE I WAS WAITING TO GET TO MACYS.. I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY A FACE BUT THIS ONE. IM USING IT A WEEK AND MY DRY SKIN FEELS LIKE SILK."
Great product! Wish I found this a long time ago as I've spent way too many $ on more expensive department store mosturizers & this works way better! Will definately buy again!
"I am 60 years old and have no wrinkles. I massage St Ives into my face, neck and around eye area. Before applying, make sure face is very warm and moist such as after a shower, or put a very warm damp face cloth to face before applying, then massage into face. An added benefit is to add IQ Naturals Retinol facial serum containing vitamins A&E and hyaluronic acid to St. Ives, or apply seperately. The combination is theraputic and far less expensive than department store prices. Good practice to start early in life."
"My face gets extremely dry during the winter and I had to find something that would keep my skin from looking dry and flaky. I gave this a try because I saw all the great reviews and saw how affordable it was. It's been two weeks and I have tiny breakouts on my forehead, and two zits on my chin and even on the sides of my cheeks (which I never broke out on). I really wanted to love this product because of all the rave about it, but it didn't work for me and everyone's skin is different."
"This moisturizer made me develop a terrible rash that took about eight days to clear up. I do have sensitive skin, but I've used other St. Ives products and had no problems. I was disappointed that I got a rash from this product, especially considering all of the great reviews it has."
"I wasn't overly impressed with this moisturizer. I'm generally a fan of St. Ives products but within minutes of using this product, my skin feels dry again. It's not horrible, I just don't feel like it moisturizes enough for my taste. Nice light scent."
"Love this product. It makes my skin feel smooth and toned, The only thing I would ask is if you could put sunscreen in it. I have fair skin and worry about skin cancer. This is the only product that has worked for my face. Every other product has made my face break out or made my face feel greasy. This product is the best."
I have used st. Ives products before with no problems but this cream did not agree with me at all. Within 2 days of using this product my pores became blocked and I broke out with a rash and horrible acne. I stopped using it a week ago and am still dealing with blocked pores and rough patchy skin. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin
"I really like the way this moisturizer makes my skin feel, but I agree with many others, it needs a sunscreen, preferably 30+ and then it would be PERFECT!!! I'm 54 years old and just started using this based on my 25 year old daughter's recommendation. I LOVE the way it makes my skin feel, soft, non-greasy, just lovely! I like it so much I want to use it twice a day, it feels that good! Just need to add sunscreen! Thank you!"
I'm only in my teens but I've used this for a couple years--- ever since my mom started using it. It is never to early for prevention am i right? :) The product is so moisturizing and nourishing. I love how it gives me a full glow and leaves my skin so supple. I do not have wrinkles and I never want to. I think this moisturizer is the right step in that direction.
"Bought this help combat my dry face post-cleanser two years ago, but I use it every morning between cleanings. My facial skin feels hydrated and plump. Since I am mid 20s, I cannot say anything about lines/wrinkles... OR one could say I don't have any due this moistureizer. Two demands: 1. Add SPF for anti-aging addition! PLEASE. 2. Formulate it paraben free (the other lotions have pampered me)."
I have used this product for over 20 years and have to say it really hydrates and firms up my facial skin. I use it day and night. Also the cost is really reasonable compared to other facial moisturizers. Thanks St Ives. I feel and look 20 years younger or so my family and friends say!
"I bought this stuff after reading some reviews. It is an amazing product. I love its light, pleasant scent. It is easy to apply. It absorbs into the skin very quickly and leaves the skin smooth and very well moisturized. It is so reasonably priced too. I'll definitely keep using it."
"It gave red , bumpy itchy rashes on my face."
"My face turned red after first and second use, did not feel comfortable and had to return it."
Love it!!!! First time buying and I will definitely continue to use.
I would recommend pretty much any St. Ives product to anyone!!
My skin is noticeably softer and more moisturized!
I have been using this product for about a year now and I absolutely love it.
"I have used this moisturizer for years. It is light, not oily, and makes my skin feel great!"
Good product! So far I like it!
not greasy at all...perfect for all seasons
"Finally, a moisturizer that works and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. And so reasonably priced."
Really nice moisturizer and it's a huge amount for the price. Really great value.
I use it to moisturize my leg skin. It really is useful.
make you feel new and refreshing soft skin .
First time buying this and will continue to purchase it. Leaves my skin feeling soft and plump very moisturizing.
I absolutely love this product. It makes my skin so soft. It smells wonderful. I would definitely recommend.
This works so great on my mom. It helps with her laugh lines and the wrinkles. I use it more as a preventative measure.
"Am 27, been using this for years. Isn't greasy or too thick. Doesn't cause breakouts. Time will tell on the aging process."
It leaves my skin moist. It smells good and absorbs into my skin. I also like that it leaves my skin moist but not greasy.
I like the way it moisturize my face and keeps it moisturizer.. I have. Been using this product for years and love it.
"Very light and non greasy,big jar lasts forever,barely any fragrance to it and makes skin satin smooth, 4 stars because not found in stores much."
This moisturizer is wonderful. It works just like any of the high end creams. I highly recommend this product!
"This stuff is great, I add about a tablespoon of coconut oil to the tub of cream, stir it in and its even better!!"
I am sick that I can't find this product anymore. It seems every time I find I find something I love it is discontinued. Hope this is not the case!!
This product does not moisturize any better than their lotions.I would not recommend this for over 40 skin.
"I've been using this lotion for months and I love it. I have really dry skin and this works well to combat that issue. Great price, too."
"Wonderful face cream, no matter how much money you spend on products, this cream is by far the most effective and I would not be without it."
makes your skin feel so good especially your face really we're starting to see the lines decreasingI totally recommend
I just love this face cream.I can tell a different in my skin already. thank you Walmart I found it in the store.
Provides skin with much needed moisture. Creates a smooth surface for makeup application. Truly feels like you are smoothing and softening your skin with every use.
This product smells like lavender and lemon. I don't like putting scented products on my face. It was also too thick for my face. It made my face break out. I use it as a body lotion when I get out of the shower.
"The shelf is always empty cause this product is so in demand. So, I ordered it online and picked it up at customer service desk. WOW, perfect solution. Thank you for this service!"
"Excellent,moisturizer soften my skin my skin, younger looking face"
"I love it,it don't make my face oily at all."
Not slimy or sticky - drys fast feels amazing. Especially for the price
This cream feels very nice on the skin:)I'm just not thrilled about it having Paraffinum in it.
"Absorbs quickly. I can feel my skin getting softer, and I've only had it for about a week now"

I love this product. Great for dry skin. I absultely love it and just ordered another tub.
I was quit please with this item it is the first time trying it so surprise that I like it so much.
"So inexpensive, it can be effective when generously applied to thoroughly clean skin."
Great product and price
Really like this product but will have to stop using it because there is no sunscreen. St. Ives folks--hope you are paying attention!
"I wish this product had SPF! With this being a major concern nowadays, I am looking to switch moisturizers for this specific reason."
"It says it's a moisturizer, but it made my skin so dry it flakes and makes my skin looks so ugly and looks old."
I am 42 and have been using this face cream for about a year now. I love how it makes my skin feel and it does not cause breakouts on my oily skin.
This product actually made my dry skin worst after using it for a week. I will go back to the previous face cream I used before I purchased this one.
Good product
Perfect product!Love it!
Affortable
feels so good on skin
Good Price!!
Loved it!!!!!!!!!!
Makes skin texture worst..
A lot of it does not sink into your skin but lays on top
"This product isn't much different than any other mosturizer, but it is cheaper!"
Consistency wasn't what I expected
Love it
