I'd tried so many things with no luck. After having my second child I developed horrible cystic acne and I tried this after almost a year of dealing with it. Decided to try something different and saw this in the store with collagen written big on the front. Id heard that collagen is good for skin and hair. So I bought it and within 2 weeks my cystic acne was GONE. Pictures attached are 3-4 weeks apart. Have noticed my scarring is also improving. So glad I found this.
"This is my first week of using this product, and I'll never go back! I was able to replace 3 other products with one jar of the Collagen moisture filler."
I always used a very expensive face cream till the company stopped making the products I liked. I found this and tried it. I squeeze a little bit of Borage Oil out of a capsule and mix it with this cream. It makes the best face cream I've ever tried. I'll be 80 in two months and my skin is very smooth with great tone. I sag a little but hardly any wrinkles.
"Although I really like the feel, price, texture, smell, etc. of this product, it is probably for younger skin. I am in my 70s and the creme doesn't seem to moisturize as much as I would like. However, that being said, this product is definitely worth a try. I will probably continue using it some because it is really nice; I just need a little more moisturizing for my older skin."
Two weeks in and my forehead lines are barely noticeable and the lines around my eyes are gone.
"It's a very good day/night creme. I used it each morning and night over a skin serum to hold in the moisture. After using for a few days, my skin felt soft and smooth."
"Love this product for several reasons, one being that it can be used both daytime and nighttime. It does the job on my senior complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer and there's not a better price anywhere than here on Jet (THANK YOU JET!) I have very dry skin and this gives me the moisture I need to keep my skin smooth and supple without feeling greasy. Pleasant scent too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Years using it and I like it...especially for my dry skin...thanks!
My skin is more moisturized and hydrated every day
And I rate this between Good and Excellent . I feel it really has helped with my skin. I am 50 yrs old.
I use this cream daily & it keeps my skin hydrated & smooth. I tend 2 soak up any cream I use. This cream lasts all day. Smells good too.
"This is a product that I sort of lucked up on. The smell is pleasant aroma. It's not fragrance free which I was skeptical of but there have had no break outs or issues at all. It's a very light fragrance, I don't smell anything if it afterwards at all. I wear it at night alone. Daytime is under makeup. Left to dry there is no issues applying my makeup."
I use this at the start and end of my day to keep moisture in my skin.
I have used this product a little over a week and I already can see the difference.
Works well and is non greasy for a night cream.
"Still on the fence on this cream. LâOreal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Facial Day Night Cream. Iâm about one and half weeks into it and i canât get used to the sticky feeling on my face from the cream, it��s so bad that it even made me break out. Iâm 64 years old and never in my life have I had even a zit and here i get broken out. Iâm thinking all these good reviews are because you all got the product for FREE!! Not fair to the rest of us. Iâm not happy at all, i really wanted to like it."

I love this wonderful Collagen creme! It leaves my face so soft and smooth! The first week I noticed improvement and realized I was hooked!
This is a great moisturizer. I really like the way it goes on and how it makes my skin feel as it absorbs. I would recommend this to everyone.
"This is a wonderful cream. I have sensitive skin, and have used this daily for years with no problems. Feels great and I think it has helped lessen wrinkles."
Moisturizing cream leaves skin soft I'm normally on the oily side and I have not had an issue with this cream making my face feel greasy or anything of that nature it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave you feeling tacky.
Purchased this the day before yesterday. Applied as the directions said. it has only been two days. but yes it is helping a lot! I didn't even say anything to anyone. My husband noticed its well as a friend saying how great and young and well rested I looked. Very satisfied with this product. I would recommend it to everyone
"I have been using this product for several months and for the price, it is one of the best moisturizers around. It is, however, very heavy and very greasy. I am not able to use it in the morning under my make up. Additionally, I have found that I need to apply it at least an hour before bed unless I want my pillowcase clung to my face all night. I can't say that it has miraculous anti-aging properties, but it certainly is the best heavyweight moisturizer I have ever used...and I've tried them ALL!!"
"For many years I have had small bumps on my face, especially on my cheeks. I have tried almost everything to get rid of them (microdermabrasion by an aesthetician, peels, masques, moisturizers, etc.) I can honestly say after using this product for the last month my face is finally smooth for the first time that I can remember and I am 52 years old. It's been a miracle for my skin and I as busy as I am, I had to write a review like this for the first time."
"I love this cream!!! I've been using this cream for a few months and can definitely tell a difference when I run out, as my fine lines reappear around my eyes. Whenever I use it regularly, my face appears much younger and plumper. I only use this cream at night, as it is much too thick and greasy to wear as a day cream. This will definitely be my permanent night cream."
"I purchased this product a week ago, not for my face but for my hands!!! I'm 40 years old and my hands have been the first to ���show my age”. This product has been amazing! I could tell a difference the very first time I used it. Looking forward to using this daily as skin care for my hands (and will definitely be using it for my face as well). Thank you so much!!"
"I absolutely love this product. I can see the difference every day when I apply it. One thing I really love is that it doesn't sit on my skin--no pilling up and turning into ugly clumps like so many other moisturizers, including expensive department store brands. If they could add an SPF component it would be just about perfect."
"I bought this cream about a month ago and have been using it night and day. I feel this cream is a bit towards sticky side. Smells mild which is good. I am a loreal person, and was a bit disappointed after using this particular product. Since it's just a month, not sure yet if it does what it claims."
"I came across this product a couple of months ago. Previously, I was a long time user of a moisturizer that was only available online but has now been discontinued. I am very happy with this product! I noticed results right away. The lines around my eyes and mouth are gone and the lines on my forehead have really diminished. I use it on my neck as well. I have difficulty finding it in the stores sometimes so I am hoping it is not going to be discontinued. Thanks for a great product!"
Honestly this filler has definitely improved my skin within days. My face was so so so so dry. And as soon as I started putting this on..it was like wala! Nice smooth supple. I'll let you guys know if it reduces any line or wrinkles but this is for sure one of my go 2 ..and favorite products now:) I absolutely love it. And it smells so go0o0d!!
"I bought this about a week ago and I absolutely love it. I use it as a night cream since it's too heavy to wear under makeup. I start by using an exfoliating face wash then this. It makes my face so smooth and hydrated. I live in harsh winters/sit in a dry aired office, so this moisturizer has been a lifesaver!!"
"I use this at night after using my face wash and toner. I find that it has greatly improved the appearance of my skin, on the rare evening when I forget to use it before bed my skin feels extremely dry the following morning. I have very sensitive skin-- this product does not case any irritation thus I am truly happy. I am writing this review as I am almost done with my second bottle."
"Best moisturizer I ever used. Plumps wrinkle immediately upon use. Dissolves quickly. I have sensitive skin , but this cream does not bother my skin at all. I have been using this product for 2 years now. Love it! I would like to try Collagen Lotion, but can't find it on drugstore shelvs. It can only be bought online. Please never discontinue this product. Thanks Loreal!"
"My skin is really sensitive and dry, I use to buy an expensive product cost me almost $100 per a month, but after I try this product I never go back to my expensive product again...save me a lot of money and the results are the same, yes I would recommend this product."
"I have very very dry skin. No acne, but nothing seemed to moisturize my face enough and my wrinkles were becoming more noticeable. This product has been amazing! I never feel or look oily. My skin does not dry out throughout the day anymore. And maybe I'm crazy, but I could swear my wrinkles are less noticeable! I love this product and can't believe how inexpensive it is. I can't imagine what their more expensive products are like, but I'm sure I'll be giving them a try this winter!"
"I am about 2/3 of the way through my first jar. The only positive is that it does add volume. The negatives: doesn't hydrate, my smile lines are now prominent whereas they weren't before, bleaches the face to a white and the texture is very off putting and hard to work with. I don't understand why they replaced the original rich cream formula and replaced with this failure."
"I use to use expensive creams, and they have done nothing for me. I started using this loreal"
"Collagen, cream and its only been a month and I have seen a big difference, that even my coworkers are sking me what I'm using on my face. I truly recommend this cream. I even have my husband using it as Well."
"I have been using Collagen Filler every day and night to reduce wrinkles. My skin responds very well to collagen. L'Oréals collagen cream is affordable and works great! My wrinkles are greatly reduced. I use this product first and then apply Rosy Tone. My 50 year old face looks beautiful, fresh and so much smoother! Thank you L'Oréal!"
I have used this for a very long time and I love how it makes my skin feel. The feeling of silky smooth skin last me the entire day. I use it mostly during the day and only some nights because I use another cream at night but I like how it feels and I will continue using it as long as it is on the market.
I have used alot alot of different kinds of face lotions this is the best I would never switch it took me along time to find a goood one and this is the one it diminished completly all dry spots on my face without leaving it oily it feels like I just left the spa so clean so fresh I recommend it for everyone its for all just try it if you don't like it I will be surprised cause I'm very sensitive about my face so for me to absolutely love it just wowed me thanks loreal for another great product
"I've been using this for about 3 months now , I cannot say enough good things about it ! I have combo oily and dry skin and it makes my skin feel so smooth and moisturized and beautiful , I use it not only as a moisturizer but as my primer under makeup , looks so flawles . If you haven't tried it your missing out ❤️"
I absolutely adore this product! I'm writing this review because I'm having a hard time finding this and the age perfect cleanser in any stores. Please tell me these products are not being discontinued! It's amazing when a person finds something that truly works for their skin it gets discontinued without anyone knowing. Please someone let me know.
I love this product. I bought it 2 months ago and apply it at night it hasn't improved my skin tremendously. I used to have dry skin and excessive dry patches but this moisturizer has helped my skin get back to normal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Yes. Good skin care technology. I sell high end skincare for a huge company. I'm not spending $75 on a face cream. I tried this after trying hyaluronic acid moisturizer. This helps wrinkles. I'm buying a 2nd jar but will start looking for a drugstore brand to compare with Loreal.
"I really like this face cream, not as much as the old discontinued Neutrogena Ageless Essentials but I'm not having any allergic reactions to it like I've had to every other brand trying to find a replacement. So I'm very happy to find something I can use daily and at a reasonable price."
"This is the least expensive option with highest quality that I've found. I use at night after I've washed my face and again in the morning. I let it soak in a bit before applying makeup. When I've switched brands just to try something new, the vertical lines between my eyebrows look worse! I'm 43 and also use heavily on my neck."
I love this product. It definitely moisturizers your skin to perfection!
"Nice, decent, subtle scent."
I use this moisturizer daily. It doesn't work miracles but it is a great product that doesn't clog my pores and allows my skin to breathe. Recommend.
I feel like I'm getting good results and I like how it feels on my face and neck. High quality product at a reasonable price.
I bought this product and since using it have seen a significant difference
in the creases around the eyes.
"I've tried MANY creams and never been very satisfied, but this cream is great. it's not greasy and makes my skin so soft. I'll be using this from now on."
I've been using this cream for about 3 months and my skin has responded well. It keeps me hydrated and I have combination skin and it's not greasy.
I have been using this product for 2 months. I have definitely seen an improvement on my crow feets. They used to be very apparent and now they are very fine. I love it and would recommend it.
I am 36 and have been looking for a good moisturizer for my extremely dry skin. This product is perfect. It keeps my skin hydrated all day and the price was great compared to similar products!
I have been using this for a few weeks. The appearance and texture of my skin has really improved. It is lightly scented. So far it has not caused any itching or breakouts.
I absolutely LOVE this product. I have purchased it over and over again. I love how light it feels and smells good compared to others I have tried. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
I ve been using this cream for a week now. I can see huge difference. My skin is radiant and plumped. Wrinkles are disappearing. Price is very reasonable. My dermatologist told me I have beautiful skin. Thank you again L'Oréal.
"I love this moisturizer!! I have used a lot of products but nothing worked like this does. My face feels soft, plump and glowing. Loved it from day one. Please don't ever quit making this moisturizer."
"I have some fine lines on forehead and after using it they would disappear temporarily and next day when I wash my face, lines would come back, price is very affordable."
I purchase this product on a regular basis and it absorbs quickly and reduces the fine line around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Skin feels smooth and tighter. It is thick, so it is best at night or as a primer under makeup. I exfoliate prior to using and then apply cream. My skin feels so good! I am over 40 so love when people ask me if I have been to a spa because my skin looks younger!"
"Very strong smell and soaks in so quickly that I didnt notice moisture benifit. Iâll go to Macys and buy my usual Clinique, at least it doesnât gave such a strong smell and I feel moistuized. 2 stars because I could use it over my makeup without it wiping it off too much, it wasnt greasy and its better than using nothing at all. Just hate that strong of a smell."
I have only used this product for a few days but I do notice some improvement in my face already.
Wife loves it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Works well and is non greasy for a night cream.
"Have used before, it works for me."
Well-priced moisturizer for night time.
I would recommend this product to anyone.
"Good product, great price"
I live it it helps with my puffy eyes and my crows feet and helps moisturize my skin.
One of the better moisturizers I have used. Makes my skin feel soft and well hydrated.
I received it and have been using it for a few days and like it very much.
"This face cream is a really good moisturizer & I tend to use it for a daytime cream. There's only one drawback. After applying, my face tends to feel pretty greasy but once it has time to absorb it feels so good. I don't have wrinkles yet even though I'm 51 so I only use it for a moisturizer."
"My thirsty skin basks in this moisturizer. I wish I had found this in 2009, when I realized my skin was needing moisture. A Clinique specialist sent me to the Elizabeth Arden counter for help back then and little help it was as I had to layer two expensive products that seemed to disappear quickly. I now use Collagen Moisture filler twice a day, layering it with Revitalift Face and Neck cream."
Nice hydrating cream. I use this both day and sometimes night. For day use I apply it under my Youth Code spf 30 lotion and they work great together. One of the very few creams I can use without my skin breaking out and I have tried many! Thank you Loreal for using quality ingredients!
"I HIGHLY recommend this product especially for women over 40. It's absolutely amazing and I love it! I can't say enough good things about it. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but it is amazing how my skin looks after using it. I'm so glad I tried it because I have purchased several times now and will continue to do so."
"It's almost winter in the North, and walking to class each day in college really takes a toll on my skin. Every year around fall my skin starts to get red, blotchy, and peely. I went into the store to buy another product L'Oreal had, but couldn't find it. Skeptical I bought this one, as it was in my college level price range. I loved it! My skin is no longer flakey, and it is very soft. I have sensitive skin, but don't have a problem with this product, or breaking out from it."
"I've used this cream for three months now and it is the first cream of many that I've tried that I actually purchased a second jar of! I usually break out from everything even sensitive face creams, this is the only cream that does not do that. A little gos along way and I avoid the chin area because its a thicker cream. thank you loreal for making a simple cream for my dry skin!"
Always use it!!
"I bought about a month ago, and it is wonderful I have noticed a difference in my skin, softness, and how well my skin looks"
"love it! feels cool and reviving. definitely softens and makes the dry feel of my skin feel much better--very soothing and VERY,VERY affordable"
I've been using for a month now and I can tell a difference especially under my eyes. Will definitely continue using. Thanks
I love this face moisturizer!!! It starts working right away and has a nice light scent!! I wear it both day and night.
"Good product, works on my skin better than more expensive brads products. I recommend to women 35 and older"
"Love the product. It's working for me soften up the face puts a glow on it , softened up the wrinkles. Very satisfied."
This face cream is so soft and goes on very smoothly. It's like putting liquid silk my face.
"I have used this and other L'Oreal products and feel that this moisturizes and stays on even in sleep. (If anything can erase age wrinkles, I'll buy it.) Collagen is a must for aged skin which I have."
"I'm 31 and needed something for some fine lines I'm starting to notice. This product smells and feels great when applied. I've only been using this for a few weeks, but like it enough to continue use and hope to see positive results soon."
"I love everything about this cream. Great price too! This cream works wonderfully on my face. Some people have said it was greasy, but I find if you use just enough, not too much, it is fine."
Excellent!!!
This has really helped to plump and soften my skin. I have noticed a difference in just a few days. I'm in love! Please don't stop making this!! A little goes a long way.
"it is tack/sticky and stays that way. I bought it to use on both of my arms which have some creping and it does do a good job there. But it does not work into the skin and I had to put long sleeves on. I'd never put it on my face unless a super thin application. thought of throwing it away, but I'll save it for the winter"
"I have been using Loreal since I was in my 20's I am now in my late 50""s and this product is the only one you should trust for keeping your skin at it's best! Everywhere I go someone will ask my age when I tel them they are speechless....! I have always used this product and will contiue to use...I tell all my friends and family use this one and you will be amazed !"
"I have been using this stuff for a week and a half and I have noticed some results under my eyes. It has helped with the fine lines so far. The only downfall with this product is that if you have oily skin, it does have a greasy feel after a while. So I mainly use it at night for an all over moisturizer and under the eyes during the day under my makeup."
"my absolute favorite cream. i'm in my 20's and i was looking for something to hydrate my skin day and night and this just does it. it makes my skin so soft i cannot stop touching it. it smells beautiful. the only thing i do not like is that it comes in such a small amount. other than that, i love it."
"Great Product for both genders...Accountability, Reliability & Dependability..."
"Looked and felt like a very bad sunburn, and I had not been in the sun."
"Great quality and the results are noticable within a week, Will buy again"
"Love it. Texture, absorbles quickly. The Loreal Collegen face and neck cream really worked for me."
Wonderfully moisturizing and makes my face feel wonderful!
"This did nothing for my skin. In fact, it made my wrinkles more obvious."
Really love how it makes my skin feel I can't go with out it.
I've been using for several month and I really like it. I love this moisturizer.
"I have many years using this, i feel great with it."
love this. I use it at night and again during the day. mainly under and around my eyes. I can see big improvement in that area
"Sensitive skin friendly, pleasant, not overwhelming smell, doesn't clog pores/cause acnes. A little bit too greasy for a day moisturizer."
I bought this 2 weeks ago I am 51 it is to sticky my face is sticky all day. The other day I was outside and it was windy my face got dirty from dust sticking to it. You definitely can't wear it under make up you will sweat and I use bare minerals. I bought ROC after couple weeks so much better. I do have other liberal products that I love just not this one.
My mom wanted to try one that wasn't $40+ so I bought her this loreal one and she says it feels nice on her skin and instantly feels her skin softer and does not feel greasy or heavy And she likes how she could use it day or night I'd say its good for the price (: smells nice too
"I have used this morning and night for about six weeks. Just reordered another jar. I am beginning to see positive results and I am pleased so far with how nice my face feels. I am 72 yrs.. old and wear little makeup on a daily bases. Rated 4 stars only because it takes awhile for it to absorb into your skin, thus it leaves your face tacky feeling for awhile. Not a problem for me as I do not apply makeup usually."
"I'm 61 and have used this product for 3 years 3 nights a week, and daily under my makeup. I like how it makes my skin feel, and helps fill in small wrinkles. Under my makeup, it feels like a primer, although I do use a primer on top occasionally. Walmart has the best price by far. Would recommend !"
"The original Collagen Moisture Filler was perfect. L'Oreal has changed the formula and added ingredients that don't need to be there. Now, it doesn't moisturize as advertised. I have dry skin and need extreme hydration. I will continue my search to find something to replace the original collagen moisture filler as this doesn't fill the bill."
"I purchased this product thru another site that reviews mosturizers for aging skin. I am however, just seeing the results. When I started using this product, my sking around the ( ) around my mouth started to peel! and my skin on my cheeks became red and my skin became extremly dirty! So I stopped washing my face in the mornings , using only a toner and the Loreal Mosture Filler, Day/Night Cream, so far its has stopped the red, dry patches that were occuring and the redness has subsided!."
"I have absurdly tempermental skin, but I've been using the Day/Night moisturizer for about 6 months now, and am a huge fan. I use it day and night during the dry New England winters, just at night in the shoulder seasons, and only a couple of times a week during the summer because it is a little thick. It works a tiny miracle any time my face is looking a little... haggard... definitely helps to plump up those little wrinkles that can make me look ""old and tired""!"
"Being from the northeast and as the fall and winter seasons hit I needed a moisturizer that kept my skin soft, supple, and also worked on my wrinkles. (I'm knocking on forty's door!) This product really stepped up to the plate. Even my husband is using it for himself after he began complaining about his skin. It absorbs quickly and I can use this moisturizer for day or night cream. And I don't have to pay a large amount of money or sign up for a monthy billing program. Great Job Guys!"
I've a lot of different moisturizer and really like this because it helps decrease my wrinkles!
"This cream leaves the skin moisturized, is not sticky and has a pleasant perfume."
It helps my skin a great deal. I only wish it came in a pump and larger size
It's really good moisturize keeps my skin soft all day. Plus it could work like a primer.
It helps smooth your skin and is a great pre-makeup base during the day and a nice textured night cream at night.
Have just been using this since January 2018 but have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. Not as many lines and smooth complexion. I am 72 but everyone thinks i am younger.
"Smells pleasant, but the results are not great. I was hoping to diminish my 11 lines a little, but this product did not work for me. I liked the moisturizing aspect of it though."
"This smells nice and so easy going on . Is not thick goes into the skin. Too soon to see any results , but I have tried many and I already like this one."
"I love this product and would have given it a 5 except for the smell. I cannot wear heavily perfumed face creams as my skin is very sensitive, and for this I am very sad. I have tried several L'Oreal face products because they are wonderful for my skin, but I cannot wear them for more than a day or two. Please, please L'Oreal make a hypoallergenic version of your creams!!!!"
"i have been using these product for a year, i like it cause is light, and you can use day and night, my friends have notice a difference on my skin, they ask me what i was using , acctually the same day we went to target , and my friend bought 3 jars . i love it."
Called Customer Service and found L'Oreal Wrinkle De-Crease was discontinued. Asked for the closest alternative. Suggested to try the Collagen Moisture Day/Night Cream in the Blue Container. It works fine... lots of moisture if your skin is dry. I still miss the Wrinkle De-Crease product though.
This is fantastic! Finally found something to help my dry red skin.
"I bought this product a month ago and I'm very happy to the result of my skin, especially now it's winter."
Started using this product a couple of days ago. Very satisfied with the purchase. It keeps my face very soft and moist.
Very light. skin feels fresher and looks somewhat brighter after using. This is always on my face and goes well under makeup. K
This is the best cream I have ever used for my dry skin. My skin is in better condition at 59 than it was in my 20s!
"I started using this cream a few months ago. It feels rich to the touch. It goes on so smooth, it doesn't feel greasy. It is great! As far as wrinkles, well you reach a certain age not much will help. I do notice the smaller ones look better."
I bought this cream and thought it would make my skin feel great. I used it and my face didn't feel soft and hydraded it felt dull. i didn't like the way my skin felt so i returned it.
Leaves your face feeling hydrated without that greasy feeling
"I have been using Regenerist for the last 4 years,"
Wonderful skin care product
Definitely good for dry faces
"Nice moisturizer, although I have not really seen any difference with the collagen part."
Have used this product for three months and love it!
I like to use Loreal product always I feel confident regarding that.
Love it Not greasey good night Cream I have used for day under makeup Works for me no need for drawer full of moisturizers
Good so far!
Goes on smoothly
good but thought it would be better than it was
It does fine
