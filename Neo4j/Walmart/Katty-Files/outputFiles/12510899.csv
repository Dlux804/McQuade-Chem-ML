I love this cream! I apply it at night after I cleanse and tone. When I wake up my skin is baby soft! For the price it's the best on the market!
Remember this product has SPF 15 so it applies more like sunscreen with high absorbency but easy to see if you missed a spot. I wear this daily and will purchase it again.
"Obsessed with this moisturizer! I used it for 5 days straight at the shore for a facial sunscreen and no sunburn in sight but still got a nice color! My daughter used it too. I use it as my daily facial moisturizer as well, my face is soft and smooth. I also use the complete night cream by olay. I have oily skin, so I do end the day and wake up in the morning with a slight oil on my t-zone, but that's to be expected. I use a toner with it and it helps."
I love this moisture cream. It contains a sunscreen but doesn't have a sunscreen smell. I have been using it for a few years but it recently became very difficult to find in the stores. I'm excited to have an easy way to buy this product.
"I love the nice thick, creamy texture of this cream. I use it every morning, all year round. I love that it is much more economical than the other brand name cream I was using. It also does clump on my face, like my old brand. Great price at Walmart."
Omg! This cream Is very smooth silky even I love it u use it twice a day morning night nd I love it
"I have only used for a few days, but I do like it so far. Sinks into skin and has no smell. I tend to have redness and some moisturizers seem to aggravate my skin and just leave it shiny AND RED! This one doesn't. Best of all, it's affordable. It's a good, basic moisturizer."
Purchased for wife...On sale at time of purchase..Sometimes hard to find.....She has excellent results with this product.......Purchased three for own stock.
"I have been using expensive moisturizers for a while and I found that they always made me break out. While this cream is thick and has a nice consistency, I have not had flare ups in my face since I began using it... My skin feels great and perfectly moisturized."
"This is an excellent product. It leaves the skin smooth and soft, and a little goes a long way. When I first used this product I was quite desperate after trying many other products that where either to harsh for my skin or left my skin to oily. Now that I've tried it I can't imangine buying a different product. Yup! This one is a winner."
"This new formula is of lower quality, less effective, and overall inferior to the previous formulation which contained aloe juice (not 'extract'), green tea, and before 2010, chamomile. Please bring back the better formulation and do your consumers and company a favor and clearly state when you change a product. If you change an ingredient or formula, you are in fact SELLING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT."
Im so glad that Oil of Olay listened to its consumers and brought back the classic gentle formula because it is the best spf moisturizer out thier for people with sensitive skin. It doesnt burn my eyes and doesnt feel greasy at all.Love that its oil and fragrance free. Reading the reviews before PLEEEASSSE Oil of Olay don't change the formula of the product again Ive tried everything else and this is the best Ive ever used. Oil of Olay for life.
"This is great for daily use. My skin likes this produt. I'm not out in the sun a lot, so the SPF 15 suits me."
"I have used this for about month now. It is AMAZING! I have extremely sensitive skin (mild rosacea). This is very hydrating, non irritating, light, not greasy, and I love that is has an SPF!"
This is the worst moisturizer I have ever bought. It feels like glue on skin. Very poor absorption. No moisturizing effect. My skin is superdry even after trying to use a greater amount.
"This is my winter-use moisturizer with sunscreen. Since it is only 15 SPF, I only use it for quick errands when I hop in and out of the car as I run in to a store. I like the extra moisture this cream provides during the dryer months."
Nice and thick. I use it in the morning and I apply makeup over it and I have had no problems.
This product works well with my skin type. I had acne prone skin and it was very dry. I have tried many brands with little to no results as i am getting with Olay complete. It really does the job and i have soft smooth skin and it has spf balance. I would reccommend it to anyone who has dry skin.
I had higher hopes for this lotion but it doesn't really moisturize like I need. I won't be purchasing this again.
Great moisturizer. Leaves my face looking and feeling hydrated. If you need an oil free moisturizer I highly recommend this.
This is a nice day cream---No too heavy but gives your face the moisture needed even during dry winter months!
I bought this to keep my little one's face moisturized and protected on the playground. Works very well & it's gentle.
"Fabulous! Wonderful for my sensitive skin, no smell, divine consistency, feels amazing, water-based (doesn't get into my eyes with contacts and irritate), and has spf. Please keep making this!!!"
Regularly used item

"I use a CPAP and it leaves ""tracks"" on my face which is a bit embarrassing if I have to go out in public before they become less noticeable. This cream helps to smoothe out the tracks somewhat sooner. My wife has been using Olay products for years which proved to me the products are of top quality and do work."
I bought this cream because my skin is sensitive. I like the fact that it is fragrance free. Unfortunately it made me break out a bit and it makes my skin feel dry. I used it 3 years ago but in the lotion formula. Perhaps I should have bought the lotion not the cream formula.
This is a very good moisturizer. It makes my skin so soft and smooth.
I have used it for 15 years.
Makes my face look oily throughout the day.
"Provides great moisturizing for my face! Better than any others I've tried, including prescriptions."
"I've always loved Oil of Olay products. I use this product with a few drops of coconut oil and my skin looks bright and remains fully hydrated all day! However, I must admit I go back and forth to the high end products and revert right back to using Olay. What can I say, my skin has a thirst for their products! Truth be told, Olay never disappoints. Never. Thanks so much Olay!"
"I've been using this product since my 20's. Switched to a different more expensive moisturizer, but switched back over to this one. Great product, will be using this for a very long time. But please do not change the formula. When formulas are changed consumers tend to look to other great products."
"This has been my favorite face cream/moisturizer to use. It's very light and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily as other products have, and the fact that it includes SPF 15 is great! There is also no odor with the lotion (this is a plus as other face creams can have the ""sunscreen smell""). Overall it's a great product and good bang for your buck! #contest"
"This product is the norm for me, over 50 years. I started in my teen because my grandmother used it and she had almost no lines in her face. I said I wanted skin like my grandmother when I get her age. I put Olay complete lotion on each morning and will continue to use it forever. Great, great product. Thank you Olay for a product that works as you say. I live in a very hot state and this product is so needed."
"Been using this product for 30 years and will never stop using it. Perfect for my skin type -- is light, not greasy. I went to a new doctor who said she couldn't believe my age -- I look so young. She then asked if I had ""work"" done. I laughed and said no -- only use my Oil of Olay! Thanks for a great product -- please do not change it!"
I love this moisturizer!! Been using this for many years. Will not use anything else. This is perfect for my combination face needs. Provides enough moisture leaving your face feel fresh and light.This is one of the very few face creams I can use. I use this both day and night. Only wish this came at a higher SPF. Can Olay please raise the SPF in this moisturizer?
I live in the Middle East where it's air cons everywhere you go. My skin is parched and couldn't find any cream that suits my dry-combination sensitive skin that won't clog my pores or break me out. I tried all sorts of expensive brands and none of them worked. Finally bought this from a local supermarket and I'm stoked to see the results from such an inexpensive product. It didn't break me out nor clog my pores. Super happy with how well it moisturizes my skin and leaves the skin plump.
"I love this product. It keeps my sensitive face, neck and d√©colletage area soft and supple. As it also contains a broad spectrum sunscreen I don't have to worry about my delicate, sensitive skin being exposed to the harmful rays of the sun. I especially like that when I wear/use it before/when I go swimming in the pool/ gulf as it protects my skin. As a woman in my 60's, these attributes are very important to me.

I have used this product for last 15 years and just switched to total effect bc of anti aging ..because i needed to use some anti-aging product but still every now and then i still use this...and still love it as always .. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used complete for years .its the only cream I can use as I have severe skin eczema.this is the first time I have used it with the sunscreen,per doctor because of meds I am on. I love it .Thank you !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Easily blends in every morning. It feels clean and refeshing without leaving any residue on my neck and face. Easy to reapply when the heat of a dry day wears on my skin, refreshing me so that I may continue my activities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Oil of Olay for 20 plus years. At 50 years old, I look much younger than my counterparts due to the moisturizing and sunscreen protection. I love the fact that I can use it for a foundation and I don't have to use any other heavy make-up. It's been my go to staple and it's my one and only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live this product , have been using it for over 20 years , I've been looking at other okay products and I want to try some of them, I know I'm getting older and should use another okay product but the one I've been using has been great for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for at least 40+ years. This product has made my face more softer and smoother. I use it every day for moisturizing my face and neck. Also, my late Mother used the original Oil of Olay all of her life and when she passed away at the age of 82 she had the most beautiful skin. Kudos to Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the sensitive facial lotion for decades. It keep me hydrated and youthful for an excellent value. i treat myself to regenerist about 2 times a year and am glad to see more products with sunscreen. I am an Olay woman for life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the Olay moisturizing cream with sunscreen, for sensitive skin for years. I have a twin sister who does not regularly use sunscreen or moisturizer and the difference is really showing. I am fair skinned and this product protects me from the sun, keeps my skin feeling nice and hydrated and gives me a fresh looking face. If there is one beauty product I'd recommend, this is it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I' ve used this product since my 20's and it is still the best I have eve used .It is always consistent and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean with no residue or side effects. It is a great make-up base or to use alone. I would recommend it to anyone and have on many occasions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using oil of olay for close to 40 years and I contribute my younger looking skin to this product. I get compliments all the time on how good my skin looks. The thing I like the most about the moisturizer is that it is not heavy feeling and it protects my skin. I have a bad reaction to the PBA's in most moisturizer so I am very happy olay does not have it. Please keep making this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It has taken me years to find a good moisturizer that I don't break out from. This is it. Since I've found this product I will never go back to or try anything else. Great product I can't say enough about it! Also love my Oil of Olay body wash, it's wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay products for 35 Years . Love Them and have introduced to my daughter and granddaughters and many friends. My grandmother introduced me to normal Olay then sensitive came out and feel in love with it. I always use the night cream for days too. Thank You to all the makers for olay.

"I have been using this product for many many years I have never thought about switching, It keep my skin looking smooth and helps with that youthful glow at age 45. I get so many compliments that I don't look my age. That's the best compliment a girl could hope for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this since I was a teenager. I am 40 and people still think I am in my twenties. People are surprised when I tell them I am a grandma. I use this every day. I do recommend this product to people. I have thought about contacting the company to do commercials for it, but my small voice may make it not believable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've struggled with break outs, extreme combination skin, and redness for as long as I can remember. I bought the cleanser and this lotion and my skin hasn't been the same since. Since switching I've found my break outs to be purely hormonal and minimal at that. My skin is much more even in terms of tone and texture and I have noticed the redness I used to experience and stress over is not that noticeable now!"
"I love All Day Moisturizer-normal. Seems my skin can change from oily to dry in a matter of hours. The normal is perfect! I've been using Olay products for 0ver 30 years-and my mother before that. Tested, tried, true! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love complete all day moisturizer I use it everyday. I started using it about 12 years ago and never had to buy a different brand.This moisturizer works great and does not make my skin red as I have very sensitive skin. Thanks for the great product!!

"I've been using Oil of Olay since my 20's. I am 63, spent a lot of time in the Sun and proud to admit it my age. I tell every young lady I know to use it. Someday when they're my age they will remember me and thank me for having the beautiful face they'll be proud of also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My sister and I have been using this moisturizer for years I never thought much about it having sunscreen. Then my sister and I went on vacation on a cruise to Mexico. We totally forgot to put on sunscreen and we got burned pretty good only thing not burned our face and neck thanks to our Olay moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am up at 5AM and selling fishing bait till 7 PM. I do not have time for skin regimens- Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen is applied after I wash my face in the morning and keeps working all day long till I wash my face in the evening.I am sixty eight years old and I look ten years younger since I am using this product.

I've been using Olay moisturizer since I was 8 or 9 . I love the non greasy feel. I only use a drop to moisturizer my face. I love the extra protection from the sun. I highly recommend this product. My husband and kids use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 51 and I have been using Oil of Olay since I was 15. My mother used it before me. People constantly tell me I don't look my age. Some have told me they thought I was only in my late 30's. Some say it's good genes but I give all the credit to Oil of Olay. You have such a wide variety of products for all skin types and no greasy feel. I have always loved Oil of Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this for a light moisturizer under my makeup. Keeps my make up from filling up creases in my face and doesn't feel oily. Great for giving me that extra protection from the sun's damaging UV rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works wonders. I had a very deep frown line in my forehead. I had tried other products, but there was no change. I finally chose Oil of Olay moisturizer. I liked that it had sunscreen because I was in the sun a lot and wanted the protection. In only about 2-3 weeks I started noticing that the frown line was not as deep. Before long it was basically gone. I will swear by this product forever ( as long as it continues to work so well). Thank you for such a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of my ""go to"" skin care products. It absorbs quickly, smells heavenly & is a simple way to keep my skin moisturized & protected. It's great on its own, but I also like to use it under makeup. I've loved Olay for decades & hope they never stop making this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer. It is quick to use and the coverage is great! I live in Florida and don't always remember to use sunscreen. I am diligent about using this moisturizer though. This gives me reassurance that I am getting SPF 15 on my face daily. The feeling is light and not greasy. This product is tried and true! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product since I was a teenager and I'm in my fortys now,and I also shared this product with my daughter when she was a teenager and she will not use anything else. Thank You for keeping our skin looking great!!!!!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Complete All-Day Moisturizer since the 1970's - I started with the sunscreen - Sensitive as soon as I became aware of them. I am now 70+ and no one believes me when I tell them my age. I give all the credit for my skin condition to Oil of Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF- Sensitive. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was used by mother-in-law who had beautiful skin. She used it faithfully every night and never showed her age. She died at 82 and was alway complimented on her beautiful skin. I'm trying to do that so I use it every day and usually 2 to 3 times. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it! I will be 58 this August and feel that if I DIDN'T use this product my skin wouldn't be healthy as it is! I started using Total Effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer with sunscreen and love this as much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I always loved the way my Grandmothers face felt. I loved hugging her and smelling that familiar smell. It wasn't until I was a young adult that I found her secret. Oil of Olay! From that day on I started using Oil of Olay and when my daughters got older I shared my secret with them and they too have become fans of this wonderful product. We are an Oil of Olay Family!

I have used Olay moisturizer for years it is just part of me! I love that I get the added SPF! I have tried other brands in the past and always come back to Olay so now it's not even a question of what brand I will purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product can be very well absorbed very quickly. It doesn't make your face oily at all. I am a person who needs sun protection daily, so I put on some high SPF sun screen cream over this product. The product doesn't mess up your make up either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay Complete since it came out. I love the fact that it is safe for sensitive skin, the SPF 15 sunscreen and the fact that it is so light I often forget I have even put it on. This is the BEST product I have ever used on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wouldn't go without my Oil of Olay moisturizer daily. My face is sofa and supple. It makes me feel younger-- and everyone tells me I look younger than I am. It's the only moisturizer I have used since Oil of Olay has been sold in stores. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used their products for 20 years. My skin is clean and smooth. I have had little problems with aging and I am often told I look younger than I am. I attribute this to the great skin care lines of oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My mom has used Oil of Olay for many years so I thought I would start using it and I'm in love with it. I'm 49 yrs old and realize I should've started using Olay long before now but I'm hooked on now. I've been using it for a few weeks and can see and feel the difference already and the fact that is has an SPF of 15 is a plus. It's a wonderful product and I will continue to use it. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In the line of products for sensitive skin by Olay, this is daily moisturizer is another success. It is unscented, which makes it perfect to use on my skin with fragrance allergy. It is great ti use either in the morning or in the evening, after cleansing. The SPF15 is another great benefit for use during the day, to protect from sunburn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can really tell a difference when I use this product compared to some other products that claim to do the same. My skin looks and feels hydrated and younger looking when I use the Complete All Day Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoy this light moisturizer, and have been using it for many years. It is low priced and does the job. I don't particularly require a lot of moisture to my skin, so I appreciate the lightness of this moisturizer. I do have sensitive skin, and am allergic to many products, so I appreciate Olay making a sensitive skin moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15-Sensitive is easy to put on. With some sunscreen you have to do a lot of rubbing to get it worked into your skin but this product is not like that. You only have to use a little to go a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Olay products over 40 years. They have always been great. And they just keep getting better. This product is light weight and absorbs well. This moisturizer has kept my skin looking great, I use it daily. Thank you for making such great affordable products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product quickly absorbs into skin as a lightweight moisturizer and does not leave an oily residue following application. The built in sunscreen adds extra protection against the damaging effects of the sun's rays. Living in a year round sunny and tropical climate makes this a vital part of my daily skincare routine! This is an excellent product for women of all ages to maintain smooth skin under their normal makeup routine. A definite A+ rating from this user!!!

I have been using this moisturizer since I was in my early 20s. I am now 50 and I am constantly being told I don't look my age and that my skin is beautiful. I owe these wonderful results to this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's not too heavy but very effective. I use it everyday and haven't gotten sunburned on my face, at all! Plus with the moisturizers people rarely come close when guessing my age! I'll be 58 soon and am often guessed to be in my 30's! Thanks to Oley!, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer since I was 17 years old, now at 55 I'am still using it every single day, it's gentle on the skin but it works really good at the same time, my skin has always felt soft and clear I have tried other cream but always come back to Oley.

"As children, we are greatly influenced by our parents. Growing up, I watched my mother routinely moisturize her face with Oil of Olay. I remember the incredibly soft feel of her face. Even as a child playing dress up, I knew I needed to put Oil of Olay on my face before I put my moms makeup on. Jump 30 years later and I still put it on my face everyday. My skin is as soft as I remember my moms being. I hope someday I will be able to pass that tradition on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used oil of Olay for years and plan not to ever try change. I have many people compliment me on how nice my skin looks. I tell them I owe it to Oil of O'lay I use it daily and a regenerist micro-sculpting cream at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have used Olay products for many years. Each face lotion seems to improve. I love that it already has SPF 15 in it. Wouldn't mind if it was SPF 30. It's not greasy. Doesn't smell funny. Goes on smooth. Of course I would recommend this product. It has stood the test of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this moisturizer every day for years. The first thing I do when I get out of the shower is moisturize my face. It feels great and lasts all day. I will continue to use this as long as it is produced. I am told many times that I do not look my age (70) because I have very soft skin and no lines. Thank you, Olay!

"I have used this product for over 40 yrs before it became ""complete"" w/sunscreen. Even my dermatologist confirmed my opinion that this was good for my skin- and the sunscreen makes it even better. I use it in morning after cleansing and at night after cleasening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is amazing! It is not oily or creamy. My coworker has great skin and she recommended it to me.

"I am sixty-four years young & will not trade my Olay Moisturizer with SPF 15 protection for any other product. I have used it for many years & my skin looks great, feels soft & I am told there is no way I am sixty-four years of age. I know the SPF will protect my skin when I am out in the sun & this to me is so important. Thank you for making it a priority for women of all ages to feel there best & also look there best. I truly love my Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using Oil of Olay in college and switched to this product for the SPF when it became available. I love the way it absorbs quickly and I think my skin looks great for 53. I've tried other brands but I keep coming back. It doesn't burn my eyes if I sweat and it's economical enough to use on my arms and legs in a pinch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing. It provides the perfect amount of lasting light moisturizing with absolutely none of the oiliness often found in all day moisturizers. The addition of sunscreen, combined with a budget conscious price, make this an intelligent choice for women everywhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE Olay products. I have been using them faithfully for 30 plus years! I constantly receive compliments on my ""beautiful skin"" at age 51, I look like I'm 31!! OLAY is my first pick for beautiful, affordable, healthy skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer since my mother had recommended this to me. I have been using this product for 4 years now and I love it. The reason I have repurchased this over and over again is because of it's moisturizing effects and the fact that it has SPF 15 is a plus. It isn't too oily and it gives my face a dewy moisturized look. I have combination skin and it doesn't break me out, I think the formula is really gentle for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for years. I have tried others and always go back to this one. Very reasonably priced and I use it daily and at night. Feels great on your skin and is not too thick or too light. I recommend it to all my friends. Wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I find this product absorbs in seconds and leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day. It is light and fluid and you really don't need more than a tiny amount each time. It makes a nice base before applying my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product for individuals with sensitive skin. You can still get protection from the sun and keep your skin soft and smooth without perfumes or other ingredients that clog your pores. I highly recommend it!! It is much better than other name brands that cost much, much more. Thank you Olay. :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use other Olay products day and night, but when I find myself out in the sun during the day, I put on this lightweight moisturizer with SPF. This is the same shaped bottled I remember my mom (who lived to 98!) using sans the SPF in her heyday! I love the texture and I feel confident in the SPF factor which is so important for general skin care! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank goodness this product has stayed the same throughout the many years I've used it........I've often asked how can they make something so perfect and wonderful for your skin any better! Each time I used it the more I love how it makes my skin silky smooth. You know what's so great......it felt like this in my 20's and still feels like this in my 50's! Keep up the great work......I love all of your products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have used this product since I was 15yrs old (I am now 35). I love that it is not heavy or oily. And the little bit of sunscreen has saved me on sunny days from burning. Even though I have olive skin, I tend to burn. It smells fresh too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used All Day Moisturizer for a great many years. I am 70 years now and I think I have used it since I was 40. I have been without it once and my skin was so dry and cracked that I cried. It keeps my skin so smooth and soft that I think I am going on 30 years. I will never change moisturizers, I am Olay branded. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've tried many facial moisturizers including professional brands that cost 2-3 times as much as Olay. I keep coming back to the Complete All Day Moisturizer. My skin feels great without feeling greasy or heavy. It's light enough to wear under make up or alone. And the spf is a must. Great product, great price. You can't go wrong.

"I have used Oil of Olay since I was 19 years old. Having dry skin it has become essential to protect my skin especially in the winter. I am now 65 years old, my skin looks great and I intend to use it for a life time because it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product since I was in my thirties (I'm in my fifties now) and I love it! It's one of the only non-greasy products I've been able to find and I think my skin looks much younger than it's fifty four years :) I would (and have) recommend this product for anyone who needs a facial moisturizer and is not happy with greasy feeling moisturizers!!

Forty (40) years of use! I call that a FANTASTIC product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My face sustained major skin damage many years ago and is very easy to chap today. I depend on this moisturizer to give my skin the added layer of protection that it needs. It works so much better than other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for over 10 years and have not found one comparable both in product and price. Love the way it feels on my skin. Goes on quickly and smoothly. I know I have the added benefit of SPF. Does not clog the pores or leave me greasy feeling. Use under my BB cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For over forty years I have been using Olay complete Moisturizer. When it came out with sunscreen added, I changed to that. As I aged I changed to Olay Complete Moisturizer with SPF 15 for sensitive skin. It has never failed me and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay moisturizer since I was a teenager and I am know 52. It is not greasy and is kind to my sensitive skin. The added sunscreen is a benefit since I spend alot of time outside and don't always remember to use sunscreen on my face. I love Olay and really can't say enough good things about it!

"My grandmother., mother, myself and now my daughter use Olay moisturizer. My grandmother looked wonderful at 90 when she passed away and she used Olay for as long as I was old enough to remember.

I have been using Olay moisturizer since I was in high school and once they added the SPF it was even more of a necessity. I am now in my fifties and this product is terrific. I use it every morning after I wash my face and at night before I go to sleep. It never goes on greasy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I have introduced this product to my daughters as well and they use it as part of their daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love my Oil of Olay! I am 51 years old and I use the All Day Moisturizer every day. It nourishes my face and neck without leaving my face feel oily. Living in Vegas is really tough on your skin.

"I have been using olay of olay moisturizing cream for over 30 years, it has kept me from getting dry wrinkling skin. I never have to worry about my face feeling greasy or too perfumed after I have applied it. I will continue to use this for may more years people usually cant believe my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried other products, however none compare to Oil of Olay. I love how it makes my skin feel. And I especially love that it has sunscreen in it too. Most women would cringe at the thought of putting sunscreen on their face, but this is amazing. Goes on smooth and isn't greasy. I have very sensitive skin, and Olay makes a Complete lotion for sensitive skin. By far, the best skincare line that's on the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Oil of Olay products for over 15 years. The Complete All Day Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Unlike other products, it does not leave an oily residue on my skin. I take comfort in knowing I am also protected from UV lights. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A few years ago I found that sunscreens were ruining all of my clothing. I learned from Olay that it's because Avobenzone is now used in most of them. Olay All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Sensitive doesn't have avobenzone and doesn't stain my clothes like other sunscreens. Since sunscreen is essential, I am committed to using Olay Complete, which feels good on the skin and helps me avoid skin cancer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this every day after scrubbing with the complete cleanser. It moisturizes my skin like no other lotion has. It isn't greasy and I can put my makeup on right over it immediately after applying. I love what it is doing for my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this moisturizer for 10+ years in combination with Olay cleansers, toners, Olay regenerist serum and eye roller. I am 58 years old and have no wrinkles. I believe Olay has played a huge part in that! The products are great and comparable to many department store products that are much more expensive. I recommend them to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product everyday underneath my makeup; it makes my skin feel hydrated and soft. I like the fact that it has an SPF of 15 because I want my skin protected as much as possible from sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using Complete All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - Normal for 20 years! I love how it is light, not greasy, goes on my skin so smoothly. I believe that it has prevented wrinkles as well. The sunscreen is very important to me as I have had skin cancer in the past. (all is fine) I not only use it on my face.. but my neck and chest as well. I will always be an Oil of Olay lady!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product since 2 years ago and I love it. It not only helps to protect my skin from sunlight, but also moisturize and make my skin tone evenly and brightly. I don't need to wear foundation to cover my dark spots or imperfections on my face because this olay's product does all those jobs. I just apply it first, then eyeliners, and then lipstick. It's quick, simple and perfect look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the fact that Olay makes moisturizers for sensitive skin, as my skin is very sensitive to fragrance! The sunscreen is also a big plus. This moisturizer makes my face feel soft but goes on clear and doesn't go on gloppy. A great overall moisturizer for daytime! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has been a staple product for me most of my life. I love the formula and how it takes care of my skin and keeps my face looking fresh. I count on this daily as my base moisturizer even when I might apply something else for extra moisture as I have gotten older, like Total Effects or Regenerist also by OLAY. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the only moisture cream I use. It goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed by my skin. At my age I have a few wrinkles, but Olay complete makes them less noticeable. I can use it morning and/or night, and it doesn't interfere with other cosmetics. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer never lets me down. It leaves my skin soft, never oily, and smaells fresh. I feel confident that I'm protected from the sun's damaging Rays. I use it everyday, have for years and years, and highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Olay products for many years. I especially like the Complete All Day Moisturizer since it has SPF15 so I know I have some protection if I don't remember to apply sunscreen.

"what can I say, my grandmom started me on Pink Oil of Olay that came in a glass square bottle. I've been using this standard ever since. I am always getting compliments on my skin and how young I look. Is it Olay or good genes? I think it's both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Excellent lightweight moisturizer with sunscreen for morning. It's the only lotion i have found with a sunblock that is also unscented for sensitive skin. I use all Olay products and have been very happy with them for years. Tried other brands but always go back to Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My 92 year old grandmother had been using olay for at least 30 years and nobody can ever say she looks her age. Her skin is flawless. She taught me about Olay and swears by this product.

I love this product!! It makes your skin so soft and I get great results when I'm in the sun. I'm always recommending it to family and friends.

Great product that I will use for a long time!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have used this product for over 15 years and could not imagine a day without it. Not only does it keep your skin looking young, it helps protect against the sun's harmful rays.

"Years ago (and I do mean years) I started using Olay Complete and it has been the best. From time to time I have tried something ""new"", but I always come back to Olay. It is a light moisturizer not heavy like some of the others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My mom used this product and I use it and now my daughter has started using it. I find it hydrates my skin without clogging my pores and even though I use a bit of sunscreen, I think this product provides additional sun protection. After coming home from Florida last week, my friend wanted to know if I was using botox for crowsfeet. I told her no, and recommended Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay moisturizer for what seems like forever. My sister recommended this to me when I was very young and at age 71 I still use it. I always get told that I look years younger than I am. I like that it is a light lotion and not heavy on the skin. Will use it forever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have an issue with a sun allergy on my face. I have tried many high SPF suntan lotions, including those for babies. The only thing that works is the Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with SPF 15. You'd think it wouldn't be enough, since it is only SPF 15, but it works better than the 60+ I have tried. Great to use every day as a moisturizer, too!

I have used your product for over 30 some years. I am 81 years old now. I have had many women tell me what nice skin I have and I tell them I've used Oil of Olay for many years.

"I've been using Oil of Olay since I was a teenager, & since they came out with the daytime formula, I've been using that ever since as well, and I'm 52-1/2 (but I'm told I look like I'm 42-45). It works great, and it soaks right in without leaving a residue or oily feeling. I love this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay for years. Way back when it was called Oil of Olay. My sister sold another product and tried to get me to change but it didn't happen. Just really like how Olay treats my skin.

I have been using Oil of Olay moisturizer every day for as long as I can remember. I always have a bottle waiting; I can't run out. It is part of my daily ritual and my only one. I am not one for makeup. I am 72 years old now and figure I have been using it for about 50 years. People think I am younger than my years. It is all because of my daily use of Oil of Olay!

I have been using this lotion for the last several years. I spend a lot of time out doors and this is the only sunscreen that I need. It does not cause problems with stinging my eyes. It is not at all greasy. The other thing a I like is that it makes my skin soft. Have tried a few others and always come back to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this product because when it is applied to the skin does not leave the skin feeling oily.

I have used Oil of Olay moisturizer since I was 29 years old. (I'm now 71.) It completely moisturizes my skin but is not greasy at all. People continually tell me I don't look my age and I attribute a lot of that to my use of Oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Olay for years and it's the only thing that moisturizes my face and doesn't soak in too much.

At 35 I know I needed to start using moisturizer and I asked a friend I thought my age what she used and it was Oil of Olay. She was 46 and no wrinkles and looked 35.

"I first tried this product over 10 years ago when the name changed (from ""Oil of Olay"" to just ""Olay"") since I was familiar with the old ""Oil of Olay"". It was good that P & G improved alot for this brand since it already had a following. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has been a favorite of mine for years. It feels good going on and I always have a bottle on hand even though I switch off with other Olay products. It may be the combination of Olay products, but at age 72, and even with the harsh winters where I live, my skin is soft to the touch and people say I don't look my age.

Olay Moisturizer is the best! I am 42 and I have been using this moisturizer since I was 15years old. This product has been passed down from my grandmother and mother.

"I have been using Olay products since my early twenties. I use the moisture bars, Daily and Nightly moisturizers. No one can ever believe how old I am, and the few wrinkles I have at 46.

"I have been using Olay products since I was a teen ( my grandmother got me in the habit). I have always loved that Olay moisturizers made my skin feel soft and smooth.

"I have used Olay Moisturizer for a long time and made a change to a cheaper brand.

Olay's Complete All Day Moisturizer with SPF15 is a fantastic value. I use it everyday. It's a great foundation with sunscreen protection. It comes in a variety of skin types.

"Although this product seems a little watery, it absorbs very quickly and does not clog pores. It goes on very smoothly, again a little watery, but seems to work very well. I would use it again and recommend it to others. I picked the sensitive skin kind, so it would be a little less harsh and it does not cause any irritations.

I loved how it smelled and every time I use it today it takes be back to being a kid. This product is the only product that works for me. Other products would not do the job and my face would flake from being so dry. Not Olay. I just love, love Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has been my go-to moisturizer for years...and the one I always come back to after trying others from time to time. It is light yet penetrating, and the sensitive skin formula has no fragrance or irritants, making it safe to use around eyes. I can use it alone or as a base under make-up, and it does not clog my pores or make my face shiny. A classic product for a reason! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm 62 years old and have been using Oil of Olay since my 20s. The product keeps my skin moist, and the sunscreen is a major plus. People often comment about how great my skin looks for my age. A major factor is that I never smoked (Tobacco gives you wrinkles.), but Oil of Olay certainly helped. People try to sell me more expensive products, but I say Oil of Olay works fine for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best moisturizer and sunscreen combo that I have ever used - not only a wonderful moisturizer but a very adequate sunscreen protector - I have used Olay products for a number of years but this is my favorite and will continue to be so.

This is a Must for me to use everyday!! I use it as soon as I get out of the shower and it really helps my dry skin. The SPF is great too because we all need protection from the sun every time we step outside and the sunscreen in this product works! It feels good knowing when I go outside that my face is protected from the sun and we know that not only can sunscreen help protect us from skin cancer but also help premature aging.

Enter Oil of Olay Complete! I've been happily using it and recommending it ever since. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have bought 2 bottles of this moisturizer so far and it lasts a really long time! I see myself making this my holy grail face lotions for years to come.

"As a swim instructor, I am constantly moisturizing my face. I've found this is a conveniently sized cream to tote around, sensitive for my face, and easy to slather on. It's smooth and easy to apply, non-greasy, and effective. I appreciate the SPF factor in this well."
Another great product from Olay. Leaves skin soft and silky smooth.
I bought this thinking it was a moisutrkzer. This is really a sunscreen protector. When ur a lady who wears make up and this only last 2 hours not a good Option for me at all since I wear make up everyday
I've only been using this for a week ... but I know it makes my face feel smoother and softer. Not greasy at all and a small pea goes a long way. The jar is small so I hope it would late me about 2-3 months !
This moisturizer is amazing for me. I have very sensitive skin and truest mamy moisturizers incliding high end and did not work but this one is amazing! I love it. I've repurchased it so many times already.

"I bought this moisturizer/sunscreen to use daily under my makeup. It is not as thick and creamy as I would have liked it to be. The texture is more like a thin sunscreen and it doesn't moisture very well at all. Also, the directions state that you should reapply every 2 hours. I don't think that is feasible for someone who is busy throughout the day or for someone who is wearing makeup."
