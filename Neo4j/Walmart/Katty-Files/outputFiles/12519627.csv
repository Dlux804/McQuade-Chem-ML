"I think good skin care shouldn't be difficult or expensive! Pond's makes talking good care of your skin easy and affordable. I love this nourishing face cream. I use it after I cleanse with Pond's cleansing balm. My skin is nourished, soft and looks fantastic! I LOVE POND'S ❣️"
"My skin has recently become VERY dry. I've researched, I've sampled, I've done it all. I've even put Vaseline on my face (not proud of that one). I think this was mentioned on Refinery29 as a great treatment for dry skin. My friend said she also uses this and loves it. It doesn't make your skin greasy either."
I bought several different kinds of Ponds creams in samples sized. I really like them all but liked one over the rest. This nourishing moisturizer feels so silky and goes on so easily and absorbs into my skin making it feel replenished but never greasy. I'm hooked! Give it a try and see how much you like it.
"It's hard to give a review on a product I've only had for a week but I must say my skin is not as dry after using Ponds Crema. The cream is thick so use it in other places besides my face, i.e. Kneecaps, elbows, arms and feet as well as my hands. It's affordable to recommend and try for yourself; and I get better results faster than I do with more expensive products."
My skin is not only smooth but its younger looking as well. I've been using for over five (5) years.
"Been using Pond's since I was a kid, it's always been our family favorite. People ask, me what I'm using on my face. I tell them Ponds."
"I've been using Ponds for years. I love the originals but like trying the newer products when they come out. This one feels amazing on my dry skin & the scent is a clean, fresh and pleasant smell. I highly recommend this product"
works well on the feet in the Winter.
"I thought I would try some of the new face creams by ponds, since the classic is GREAT! The texture was nice, but the smell was different and I did not like it. Its not real strong, but I will not be purchasing this again! I hate to throw it away, so I am trying to use it up in beween other products. The classic is still the best!"
I have tried multiple facial moisturizers and none have work this awesome! I have a random dry patch of skin that is flaky across my forehead and along side my nose. The patches are completely gone after 3 days of use. The moisturizer last 24 hours and has my skin looking phenomenal!
Ponds Crema This is an excellent face creme. It has a very light scent and is non greasy. You can use all over your body. I like to even use on my hands and feet before getting into bed! Excellent on the face. . Great for after shaving your legs too. I always have a second jar on hand so I donât run out.
"This cream goes on beautifully. I put it on my face when I get out of the shower. It really hydrates and adds a nice sheen to my skin without making it look oily. It works well with my foundation and appears to make the foundation stay put longer. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate it at all. My only complaint is the scent reminds me of flowers at a wake (sorry, that was my first impression). The scent lessens after a few minutes, so I can deal with it. Overall, I am very impressed with this product and you can't beat the price."
"At 50 years of age, I am less concerned about skincare products making me look younger but more about the products making my dry skin more comfortable. Crema S does just that, and at a terrific price. Never leaves my skin feeling greasy and the scent is not overpowering. I find that I can use it even after shaving without irritation. I'm recommending it to everyone."
"This cream is WONDERFUL! I tried small version-50 ml first and then bought full size. The jar is HUGE -400 ml, will last at least 1-1,5 year and my skin absolutely loves this cream. I have dry skin sensitive type. I like the smell (very light), the consistency, the feeling on the skin. I use it as a night cream now (summer) but I believe it would be also great as a day cream in winter when my skin is especially dry. I will repurchase and highly recommend this cream."
"After using Estee Lauder, Chanel & Dior face lotions needed to switch to a more economical face lotion; this was the one that works for my face. At first, it's a little oily (I have an oily T zone) but if you use kleenex to tap your nose before putting make up that will make the trick. It really worked and everyone says my face looks like porcelain. I hope Walmart carries all the time, at all their stores!!"
It's good but I would rather have the dry skin cream from Ponds. Its feels better on the skin. My skin with this one doesn't quite feel the same or as soft as with Ponds Dry Skin Cream. But it's good for a moisturizer. It does feel like it leaves a film on your skin.
"I am currently 28-29 weeks pregnant and I received this product as a gift, and I have used this product for over a few months and I have not gotten one stretch mark since I have been using this product! I love it!!! I thank my wonderful mom for giving me it!"
"This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used! I am 50 years old and have used my share of products, so I can honestly say, this is the only one that has actually made a difference. It has made my skin soft and clear, but most importantly has left it feeling very hydrated. Even my makeup goes on smoother. I would recommend this product to everyone with dry skin."
"I recently bought the travel size cream for a trip and fell in love with the cream. I have very dry skin and eczema. I apply this cream after the shower and it leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. I have tried several creams over the past 10 years (Clinique, aveeno, neutrogen) all $25+. You can't beat the price. It doesn't clog any pores, and causes no pimples on my face."
"bought the Crema today and it feels great on my face, not heavy, greasy but, it smells like cucumbers. I love to eat them but I don't want to smell them constantly. its been about an hour and the smell has diminished a touch. with this smell im afraid it may give me a headache but we'll see. wish all Pond's products offered ""no"" smell in them :)"
Me age 38 and my mom 70+ we both use it and it excellent!
Works great... keeps skin smooth and soft without spending a fortune!

"Best product ever! Love it, you can tell the difference when your first time use. It fells soft and moisturizers."
"After purchasing a trial size of this cream and just after 48 hours,my face feels smoother, looks healthier. I will be purchasing this product from now on. Thank you"
"Just got this, and my face is smooth aaaall day! I have very sensitive Asian skin and this works perfectly for me, and the sent isn't all senty which works best for me."
"I really like this product. I was purchasing really expensive products and didn't see much of a result - so on a whim - I bought Pond's Crema S. The results are wonderful, my skin is so much softer and well hydrated - and I'm a diabetic!"
i have used pond's cream for dry skin for 15 years and i'm only 29. i have to say that this product is my everyday moisterizer because my face feel so smooth and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have terribly dry skin, and I've struggled with some texture issues around my nose and redness. I finally found a cream online that I thought was my miracle product--until I found this. I WILL NEVER LOOK BACK."
My wife started using this product after we tried multiple products. She has a dry skin and applies it twice daily. It made her skin very smooth and it has got nice fragrance. She not only uses it for her face but also for her body.
I ran out of my good moisturizer and rather than drive to the only surviving drugstore to purchase the moisturizer I usually use I reached for the Ponds at the local Dollar General Store. Was I ever surprised! I was expecting this rich heavily scented perfume type of moisturizer I remember my grandmother using when I was very young. I must say I was very pleased to find Ponds has changed their formula and their scent. It's very light with a sort of woodsy scent. Big improvement. I think I may give it a serious try.
"I did too many days in a row of retinol product, and the skin around my mouth started to peel and flake, it was so dry it almost hurt. NOTHING helped until I bought Crema S. I have break out prone and sensitive skin, it hasn't bothered my skin at all. Favorite new moisturizing product!"
"This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. And I have used a lot. Have used the Dry Skin Cream and really liked it. However, this moisturizer is beats the dry skin cream hands down. I love the scent and the texture of this product. It feels wonderful on the skin. I use it in the morning on a freshly cleaned face. Then apply SPF and at night after cleansing. My face has never felt so good. I also think it makes my makeup last longer. Just for reference I am 52. Thank you for the beautiful product."
"Picked up a travel size jar of this for no particular reason, just wanted to try something new. I have been using extremely expensive skin creams, yet my husband saw the difference immediately when I used Crema S. Also, I love the scent. It reminds me of freshly cut grass. Thank goodness it doesn't smell like fruit!"
"Nice light consistency. Not greasy, yet moisturizing."
I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer! It is the best I have ever used and I have tried expensive to cheap! Especially having eczema. Highly recommend:)
I have been using Pond's crema S for 20 years and I still love this Nourishing. Pond's crema S is the BEST!
I love this nourishing moisturizing cream. My skin feels so moist but not greasy. My only problem is I cannot find it in a large jar....I only find it in the 1.75 ounce sample jar so therefore I am buying many little jars. Thank you Ponds for this incredible cream.
I bought the Ponds cream S of 200g. I was looking for a moisturizer for my face especially now that we are in fall and winter. My face skin gets really really dry and when I found ponds cream S it worked beautifully into my skin and face I have sensitive dry skin and I break out but with this cream I feel my skin very hydrated and soft glowing with no breakouts. My mother and grandma has use ponds products since forever and still use it. Thank you Ponds please keep making these products never stop it is amazing love it
"this product didn't work for me. I tried it for 2 weeks and it gave me irritation and break out every other day. It has nice aroma and very nice creamy texture which absorbs fast and skin looks fresh but it doesn't suit my skin. I read reviews that it gives break outs to few sensitive skin people. I never had any skin problem so I thought it would work for me. But it did not. You can give it a try, It might work for you or thanks to walmart return policy you can always return it. I am going to return it too."
I love this cream! I can't live without it! And you can't beat the price!
This is a good cream to help keep young skin looking young. I bought it for my granddaughter who uses it daily.
"I love this product, and I mean love it! I'm a black African American women and this product suits my skin perfectly! I have dry skin all year long and most products are super greasy, but this one is not! I'm so in love and you should to!"
I've never had a product work so well for moisturizing my extremely dry skin! Within days I noticed a considerable difference in the dryness of my skin. This product really works!
"Its verry nice cream,real nourishing and moisturizing fillings"
This is a clean moisturizer not greasy
"A little greasier than I like, and I am not a fan of the smell."
"Love the large size of the jar, and so far, it's been keeping my skin soft and hydrated beautifully! Just what I needed to balance out my skincare routine!"
"I love this cream. I have dry skin on my hands, arms and legs. This is the best product. It is thick and it is slightly greasy, but it WORKS. My skin feels great."
This moisturizer makes my face feel so smooth and hydrated! I have tried so many different creams for my dry skin and most leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable. This moisturizes beautifully and it smells amazing.
I have been tried many creams until I found this one This is the best. It moisturizer my face better than any other. Feels very light. It stay the all day. Great product. Great price
"The consistency of the cream is absolutely amazing. It hydrates my skin, without leaving oily like other brands! Perfect for dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love this product! My grandmother and mother introduced me to the Ponds family more than 20 years ago. I have recommended the products to others

"I have used Ponds since I was a young woman. I love this new, improved Ponds and it smells really good. I highly recommend it and will continue to always use it"

Makes your skin so soft and does well on dry skin.
Good. As expected. No oiliness.
