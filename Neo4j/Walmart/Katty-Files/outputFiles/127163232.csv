"I love using the Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch when I have a sudden breakout as it seems to work miracles! I put these on overnight and when I wake up, any blemish that I have is significantly reduced and ends up healing much faster than when I forget to use one. These are game changing!"
I suffer from cystic acne and these patches are the most effective way to get rid of it. They don't dry out your skin like other treatments do. I put one patch on at night
amazing! it may take a couple of days for it work but it completely vanishes acne and leaves no scarring or hyperpigmentation behind!
These patches are a life saver for people with acne. They are even nice to put on your acne if you are really red the flesh tone color helps hid and heal. Such a relief!
"I LOVE these and tell all my friends about them. For those who haven't used these little patches before, you place them on a pimple, leave it on overnight and voila your pimple is 10x flatter the next morning. Each pack comes with a sheet of pimple patches in varying sizes (small, medium, large) which is super convenient. FYI these work best on pimples that have come to a head already so that it can suck out all the stuff inside! Give these shot, they honestly are so amazing and I always stock up when I can."
"Love these patches, I typically put them on at night right before i go to bed and boom, pimple gone by the morning! I'll also occasionally wear them during the day when i have an event that night and due to them being fairly clear, I don't think people notice it (much better than wearing thick white acne spot cream that can be seen from miles away)."
"There are only 5 in here that are a usable size. The smaller ones are too tiny; I can barely fit them on my finger. And a lot of times they'll fold because it's hard to get off the sheet. And the bigger ones are too big. Definitely can't wear them out. So for the money, I'm not sure it's worth it."
Did not work. I have used many other brands with great results. These did not absorb anything. I only bought these because my usual brand was out of stock. It is almost if the patch was just a sticker or piece of tape not a hydrocolloid patch.
Arrived fast and appears as described but as a product it didn't work for me at all. Used for Acne
These are useless.... did not work at all. I would give the zero stats if i could
"The Cosrx patch takes the cake over other ones on the market -- I like how thick they are compared to thinner acne patches that tend to slide off the skin more easily. They make a big difference after I pop my zits! They're great for post-extractions , to prevent scarring and potential new pimples)"
"I've tried a few of these, but I really like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Matches! They stay on for a while, and I feel like my blemishes are totally protected from any outside dirt/bacteria/etc, so they subside within a much shorter time! Great brand and product."
"Works great! I have oily skin and at 47, still get pimples. I put these on and they absorb the oil and help them heal. They work overnight and you see results the next day. I hope they never stop making these! Buy them, you'll be hooked. Also, another reviewer said they don't stick to her skin. I can't speak to that, they stick fine on my skin (caucasian, oily). I have trouble getting breathe right strips to stick on my skin overnight but with these, no trouble at all."
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. Literally can't even get it to stick to my skin and when it does stick it will not stay on. Instead of these, buy the acne dote pimple patches they are 100 times better, they're thin and they actually stick, these are way too thick and will not stick."
"Amazing product - trust it and buy it! Cosrx Acne Pimple Patch really works. I would recommend to anyone who has acne problems, this will work perfectly and solve your problems :)"
I will be buying these over and over again - they stick onto your pimples and help heal them so much more quickly (also they get you to stop touching
Love these patches. They're easy to use and seem to zap pimples overnight. I use them as soon as I see acne pop up and the patch takes care of it.
