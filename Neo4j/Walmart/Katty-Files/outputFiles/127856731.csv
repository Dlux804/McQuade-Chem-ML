"I absolutely loved the Lumene day cream. My hands are very dry and crack sometimes however, this moisturizer worked wonders for my hand. I use this product 3-5 times a day and my hand are no longer cracked. I will buy this product in the future and probably the rest of my life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the MOISTURIZER every morning on a clean face. This is light enough to wear under makeup. Easily absorbed into skin after application i couldnt feel it was there but i could see it working, leavingmy skin soft & luminous . i like how pure this product feels and the intense protection agaisnt cold and UV rays! The scent is light and clean like a fresh spring day and i will include this MOISTURIZERER in my daily beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love every single Lumene product I have ever tried but this moisturizer is now gonna be part of my daily routine. It's super creamy and absorbs into the skin so easily. The best part is it leaves your skin feeling soft and supple. I'm a truck driver and I take it on the road with me every trip! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this product when I get out of the shower to moisturize my face. This is such a good moisturizer you don't have that oily feel. It smelled so good and it made my face feel fresh. I don't have anything bad to say about this product it worked really well for me. Would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really am in love with Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream. I love the fresh scent of this moisturizer and the smooth texture of the cream. My favorite thing about this day cream is that you only have to apply it once. Other moisturizers i have to apply more than once a day. This day cream has my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day. I will definitely but replacing my old moisturizer this this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream because I have combination skin and this does NOT leave my skin feeling oily or greasy! I've been using it everyday for 2 weeks now and will definitely be buying more when I run out! It is lightweight and goes on smooth. Does not leave that heavily greasy feeling like other moisturizers I have tried! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this Lumene, Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream after washing my face in the morning. I love it! I live where it's pretty dry year round, so winters are extra harsh. I'm always looking for a great moisturizer. This one is creamy, yet somehow very light. I loved that it was quick to absorb, and left my face feeling fresh. The scent is floral and kinda strong if you are sensitive to smell. It didn't bother me, and wouldn't stop me from using it daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This daycream is amazing ! My skin feels hydrated throughout the day . This moisturizer had great ingridents like cotton and water that moisturize my skin in so many healthy ways . My skin feels more supple, more clear, better looking. I enjoy this under makeup as well. Doesn't make my skin oily or dry ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a thicker moisturizer but it doesn't feel greasy or leave a residue on your face. The smell is nice too. I would definitely buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the moisturizing day cream. It's not as heavy as other creams I've used. I love the lightness of it as you barely feel it as it is absorbed into your skin. It definitely keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I will definitely be buying this again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product in the morning and I've noticed how much it helps me wake up. My skin feels clean and refreshed after I use the day cream. I've started using Klassikko as part of my morning routine and I think it'd be hard for me to wake up without it now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizing cream. I wanted to try something new and I am so happy I did. I have seen great results from using this cream for a few weeks now. It doesn't make your face feel greasy. The scent is also a light clean smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this sample to test and review. I get dry patchy looking skin in the winter on my face. I was happy to be able to test a product that helps with that problem. This lotion made my skin feel super soft and fresh. There was no burning either, The scent of this moisturizing cream is amazing. I will be buying more of this product, and will defenatly be sharing this with my friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Lumene brand has lived up to expectations again. This Lumene Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream goes on a little heavy but absorbs quickly leaving you with a soft smooth feel. Once ii absorbs you can either go natural or put your makeup over it. The winter weather and home heating are very hard on my skin. I love the scent and love how it makes my face feel. It is defensively been a pleasure adding this to my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great daily moisturizer! It smells lovely and feels very soft on my skin..the only reason I took off one star is because I noticed when my skin is really super dry..the moisturizer burns a little bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really loved how light and non-greasy this moisturizer is. I have oily skin and live in the South, so a heavy day moisturizer is not an option. This soaked in quickly and left my skin feeling light, airy, and soft. I will definitely continue using this project and recommend it to friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It feels light and has nice texture. It has very pleasant mild sent. My skin feels very soft and smooth and refreshed after very first use. I have used several Lumene products and like them all. I would definitely recommend this one too. Only complaint is that it doesn't include sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not usually one to switch up my face cream but I was really looking forward to trying this moisturizer! It smelled so fresh and clean, great velvety texture! It went on smoothly and not a lot is needed! It did what it's supposed to do which is moisturize! Only down fall is my face broke out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream. This day cream smells amazing. I used it every morning after washing my face and before applying make-up. The cream itself was not greasy and didn't leave a ""heavy"" feeling on my face like other day creams I have tried. After about a week of using this product my skin felt soft, smooth & overall looked healthier. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm really happy with these cloths, though at times the lavender scent can feel too strong. I don't know that they actually calm me. But they take off my eye and face make up and that's what's important! I'll keep packs on hand for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Klassikko day cream. I put it on in the morning and my face feels so soft! I also love the smell. Winter is really harsh and my face usually feels really dry. But not anymore! I typically only moisturized at night, so I'm so happy I found this cream. I'll definitely be starting a new routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the feel of the cream. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It doesn't make my face feel greasy at any time. I'm not sure if I would buy this particular cream ONLY because it doesn't have any SPF added in it. With my skin history, I must have SPF on daily. If it wasn't for that one detail I would probably switch to this brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I put this cream on every morning after I shower and wash my face. I have had dry skin a lot grouch winter and this has really helped it. The cream isn't a heavy thick oily pasty cream! It's light and soft. Runs on nice and smooth and soaks in good. Doesn't leave a film or nasty feel on my face. It has really rejuvenated my dry skin! Love this day cream! Happy to have smooth pretty skin again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream is a wonderfully light, nourishing moisturizer that is perfect for everyday use. It has a nice, light scent and doesn't leave a greasy feel to the skin.

"I really enjoyed using this product. I have sensitive skin and was impressed with the very fact this product did not irritate my skin.

It would be ok to use in a pinch - on holiday and need a moisturizer but I was not completely satisfied with the product. Lumene Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream feels heavy and not fond of the scent. I think I would be more inclined to use as a night cream putting in on 15 minutes before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This daycream has a good feel on my face and didn't leave behind a greasy residue, but I couldn't get past the scent. I may consider purchasing if there is a non-scented version or possibly even just a different scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its a good moisturizer, absorbs quicky and provides long lasting moisture in this extreme cold without givinv oily feel to skin. Only thing is that it has a very strong floral smell which sometimes can be annoying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was so nice to use! I used it in place of my current moisturizer and can't say I miss my old ways! It's easy to use and smells great. It applies to the skin with ease and wears comfortably. My face feels fantastic all day, and I didn't have to reapply. I would absolutely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried a couple other Lumene brand products like micellar water, and I like the brand alot! this moisturizing day cream is my favorite Lumene product yet, it is absorbed easily into the skin and has a great scent and texture along with a nice bottle and a comforting ingredient list. I use it every morning! it gives me moisture all day. I would recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not really used to using a Day Cream, because I mistlyvapply at night. I've been slowly transitioning. I like that this is light weight and has a light smell. My skin looked refresh all day. The only con I would give is it's a tad bit greasy and takes a minute to absorb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is a great moisturizing day cream. I love that it is lightweight enough to put it on underneath my makeup for the day and my face doesn't feel oily. This product is amazing for keeping your skin moisturized and soft during winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoy this day cream. I use it every morning after I was my face, as well as after my shower. The moisturizer is very light. I am not a fan of the thick moisturizer creams. When you apply the cream you only need a tiny amount. A little bit goes a long way so I anticipate being able to use this cream for quite awhile before I have to restock. I've been using this product for a couple weeks now and I can feel a difference in my skin. It feels a smoother and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this cream.After trying so many brands from drug store to some higher brands my skin didn't such good as this cream.I use it after after washing my face with foam cleanser.My skin feels soft and this cream has very nice smell and absorbs quickly.Doesn't feel greasy.Would definitely recommened to all others who have dry skin like me.

This Lumene moisturizer feels so good when I put it on my freshly cleaned face. I have combination skin. Some parts of my face are dry and some oily. This cream seems to even me out. I only wish it had a sunscreen. Great for day and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this product before I go to sleep after I wash my face and in the morning under makeup. I LOVE it. My skin is very hard to please as it's quite sensitive. This soaks in right away, leaves no residue.. it's not thick. Smells nice, it may be my new Holy grail for moisturizer. I would and have recommended to others.

This day cream is great. The scent is not too strong and it works well. A little goes a long way. I was not aware of this before recieving the sample. I think it actually works better than the cream I was using before. It softens skin and makes your facial skin look healthy immediately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very impressed with this moisturizer. First of all, the package is easy to use and not messay at all. The cream itself smells amazing. It has a strong scent, but I like that about it. It's a very premium scent that really makes you think this is not a cheap product. The best part about this product it that it effectively moisturizes my (oily) skin without making it look greasy! The ingredients are unique and they really do work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the texture and smoothness of the cream. it felt great going on my face. it was light and really soft and luxurious on my skin. however I didn't ilke the scent. its way too flowery and powdery for me. I am sensitive to scents though so to me it was just too much. for someone else though they may really like the smell. and the benefit of the product of moisturizing and skin nourishing seems to come through [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a good moisturizer and seems to be fragrance free, so that's a plus. I have oily skin, and this didn't seem to make it much more oily. I think it would work better for dry skin though. Overall, not too bad! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As I tried this product I thought that it would be the best product for my face. But because I have sensitive skin this product broke my face out. This product have ingredients that I am allergic too and the products that I normally use work wonders for my face If I wasn't allergic to the ingredients that is being used in the product I would purchase it. No I wasn't aware of this product before I got it I would recommend it to anyone that would like to try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the face cream for 5 straight days and can see a huge difference. It has been so cold and dry in Illinois this winter and it has taken a toll on my skin. It smells like roses to me and makes my skin super soft. No more flaky dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very satisfied with the quality of Lumene Klassikko Moisturizing Day Cream. I've used a lot of different high end brands and found this one to be excellent. It doesn't leave a greasy film at all, but I don't have oily skin. My skin looks great and I like that it is 80% natural and has a nice light scent that quickly fades. My skin looks great. This did not cause any problems. I would purchase it myself in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
