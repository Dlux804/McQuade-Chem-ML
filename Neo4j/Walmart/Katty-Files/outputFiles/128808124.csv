"I use this lip treatment in the morning and in the evening when I go to bed. I wear it alone and sometimes I put it on prior to applying my lipstick. My lips are softer and they look healthier since I started using this product. There is no scent or color, and the treatment leaves my lips looking shiny (it's shinier than Neutrogena's lip balm, and less shiny than Neutrogena's lip gloss.)"
I just love this lip treatment! It makes my lips so smooth and shiny!
This is my second purchase in the last two months. Highly receommend!
"I got this as a sample for free from pinchme and its my new go to ""chapstick"". I went to the dentist the other day plus freezing weather and my lips were DESTROYED afterwards and I used this before bed and woke up with like baby soft lips its truly amazing!"
"This balm is so fantastic, can't believe it! I thought it would be stiff, like chapstick. After putting it on, it gives a great shine to lips and your lips feel so soft and well hydrated. I used it overnight but am going to start using it during the day when I don't want to wear color. Didn't see the 'plumping"" effect. Please never stop making this!!!! It seems that I've bought the ""caviar"" of lip treatment!"
"This is a nice lip treatment. I gave it 3 stars because for the amount it's expensive. Also, it would have been better if it came in a tube where you didn't have to use your finger to apply."
"I use it when I go to bed. I haven't seen any ""plumping"" of my lips, but it stays on."
"I am super disappointed that this product contains hydrogenated palm glycerides. The product itself works well, but I won't be repurchasing until Neutrogena takes the palm oil derivatives out of the product."
I haven't received my order and I can't get anyone in customer service to find out where it is.
"I got this yesterday and applied it twice, once before bed. Woke up with dry lips so I put it on again. Applied several times from 8am to 12pm and over that time my lips started peeling and hurting. Cracks formed at the corners of my mouth. I wiped this off and applied a different lip balm and it's finally soothing the discomfort this treatment caused. Very disappointed and concerned."
"I received a sample of Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment from #pinchMe back in January and it's still going strong. During the dry winter season this lip treatment became a part of my nightly routine. My best friend noticed how supple my gob was and is now hooked. Smith's Rosebud Salve has been my go-to balm for 10 years but, after I finish up this sample, I may consider swapping to Hydro Boost. It would be great to have a larger size or a more portable packaging, though!"
"I can not say enough about this product!! I use it every night and morning and I now have fuller, incredibly hydrated lips AND the fine lines on my upper lip have disappeared!! This product, plus the hydrating lip shine are the only products I use anymore...thank you neutrogena!!"
"I usually never buy Neutrogena products. As I was walking by the cosmetics I seen The Neutrogena Hydro boost hydrating lip treatment, it caught my eye. So I decided to buy it and try it. I was surprised that I actually liked it and have been using it for over a week. I go through lots of different lip balm's and Chapstick's. I believe I found my new go to lip treatment."
"From the first time I used this product 5 months ago until now, it's always hydrated and smoothed my lips. I use this immediately after I brush my teeth, when my lips are their softest to keep them soft and ready for any lipstick I put on. The only issue I have is that it doesn't taste the best, as sometime it gets in my mouth when I put too much on."
"I was really having trouble with allergic reactions and chapping until I discovered this product. It manages to be soothing and moisturizing, without being sticky or waxy. A little goes a fairly long way, but that being said there is not a lot of product in each package, so if you find that you like it as well as I do, plan on buying multiples!"
"I like the Hydrop Lip Treatment for hydrating and adding a shine to your lips. I always appreciate having two steps in one like this. However, I didn't feel like it didn't keep my lips moisturized as long as products I've used in the past. I don't think I'd run out the door to get this one. I received free sample from PINCHme."
"This product severely damaged my lips!! I used it several days in a row hoping for improvement, but with each use my lips became more and more dry, cracked, and painful. I am now having to use medicated ointment to try and relieve the discomfort, redness, and swelling. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
"I have legit tried multiple lip products over the years I've spent hundreds of dollars to find that perfect balm! This product is amazing I am so impressed I will never switch it's not sticky it's smooth it looks great on clean lips and I swear my lips have gotten plumper no lie, best product I've found in years"
"I have very dry, cracked lips, so I'm always looking for something that will help. The Hydro Boost Hydrating lip treatment is great for several reasons, such as it's easy application, its non overpowering smell, and it moisturizing ability. I've used it several times; alone or with the Neutrogena lip shine lip gloss. It works great either way, it's not greasy, and it leaves your lips hydrated and soft."
I received this sample free from Pinchme.
I got a sample of this product from PINCH Me. I'm always in the quest for finding the best lip balm I can use for my dry and chapped lips. During winter my lips would be extremely flaky and dry making it hard for me to apply my favorite matte lipsticks. This product is so amazing that I always use it to prime my lips while I finish the rest of my makeup.. by the time I need to apply my lipstick..my lips are extra soft. smooth and plump!
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this lip treatment! Plumps up lips and makes them soft and hydrated. Don't change a thing on the formula. Works great the way it is ! just wish I would've bought more than one container to begin with ... can't find it anywhere now and it's out of stock online. Hopefully it will be back in stock before long !❤️"
Lots of HA that actually moisturizes the lips and just doesn't sit on top. No taste or smell. Love it!
"Love this,but needs to be in squeeze tube. Neutrogena sold a lip product in 2005 that was in a squeeze tube and I bought it all the time. Please consider packaging it differently."
"I love this product, however, as it is a lip product, I felt it should be in a tube. I don't use my fingers to apply it, I'm kind of a germophobe that way. I use a cotton swab, and the product gets absorbed by the swab, therefore I need to use more."
I was skeptical at first when it came to trying this treatment as a free sample but it was amazing. My lips felt sooo hydrated after the first use. It felt like I had a whole new set of lips.
"I have purchased a number of Neutrogena products that I find superior to the department store brands I've used in the past. I love the price and the convenience. This is an excellent lip treatment for stubborn dryness. I am glad I gave it a try. The texture is silky, I like to apply with a lip brush. I use it at least twice a day. I use a generous amount before I do my makeup so it can absorb a little before I apply hydro boost gloss. It has made my lips look and, more importantly, feel better."
"Sort of pricey , but good. It is real soft so you have to touch it lightly"
"I bought this product 1 week ago, and I was so excited to use it. Lips immediately felt soft and hydrated when I initially put it on, but as the day goes on, my lips start to feel more dry and flakey. I tried wearing the lip treatment overnight and noticed that my lips became even more dry and my skin started to peel. I gave it a few tries, but so disappointed that it didn't work out. Wish it worked for me! Objectively speaking, the packaging and amount of lip treatment for the price is great."
It comes in a clear square compact. It is small in size and easy to store and take it with us. It is nice and it is highly moisturizing lip balm. It keeps lips soft and smooth and also well hydrated. I am happy that i got a chance to try the product and it worked well for me. I received a free sample from PINCHme.
"Love this product, but it gets used up VERY quickly. So it isn't a great value."
"My lips feel softer than before. I usually have dry cracked lips, which lead to cold sores. Hydro boost hydrating lip treatment has helped significantly."
I got mine from pinchme.com for free.
"It feels great on my lips! Its great for winter in Florida because it stays creamy and doesn't get waxy in this cool weather. I like to wear it during the day and at night, right before I go to sleep. I need to buy this in multiples, one for the purse and one for the nightstand. I'm not sure if this will be good when the heat hits in Florida but will see what happens, might not be good for the purse in the summer hear. I would give this a 5 star if it was in a bigger container! Love this lip treatment!"
"The hydro boost moisturizing treatment does not feel thick or greasy on your lips. Due to the weather, my lips have been chapped, dry, and cracking. The hydro boost treatment has moisturized my lips so that cracking is no longer a problem. I highly recommend this product. I received this product as a free sample from pinchme."
"I love this lip treatment! I am constantly using chapativk because I hate when my lips feel super dry, so this is an excellent lip moisturizer to help with my dry lips in winter. It also helps mouisturize my lips before I put on lipstick."
I got this free to try through PinchMe and I'm so excited!
"I received a sample of the Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment from PINCHme. I wasn't sure about the product once I first tried it, I found it to have a slight gritty texture, but I actually really love it. It does seem to smooth out and loose the gritty texture after it has been on for a bit. It gave my lips great shine without any stickiness which I really liked. It does seem to last quite a while but I did have to reapply a few times thought the day. Overall, I really liked the product and enjoyed using it."
When I received this sample from pinchme I never thought I would find a use for it. Let's just say this winter has been brutal and with this product my lips are soft and supple. Which I absolutely love! Thank you Neutrogena and thank you pinchme. I definitely will be buying this item when my sample runs out!
"I received this product as a free sample from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. During the winter, my lips are often dry and cracked so I am constantly putting on chapstick, but I feel like my lips were getting immune to chapsticks. This lip treatment was a good change. It has different ingredients so my it actually worked to keeps my lips smooth and soft for a long time (only put on twice a day compared to 8-10 times for chapstick)."
"This product is nice temporarily, and is nice as a clear gloss. As far as the hydrating aspect, I didn't feel like it did much. It didn't dry my lips, which makes me happy, but as far as maintaining moisture in my lips I will continue to use plain 'ol chapstick."
"I love Neutrogena hydrating lip treatment. I received a sample from Pinchme and am so glad I did. My lips stay dry and I've tried several different lip moisturizers and nothing compares. I would apply others several times a day, with Neutrogena only 2-3 times a day. I do wish it came in a tube or with an applicator."
"Great product. I use it several times a day, it has kept my lips soft and hydrated during these dry days here in Florida. I received this as a sample from PINCHme, honestly I wasn't excited about the pot design, however this product doesn't leave your fingers sticky."
"I received this as a free sample from Pinchme. I'm not surprised that the Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment is an amazing product. Neutrogena really knows how to make quality products. This has a butter-like texture that melts with the heat of your finger, little product is needed and though the container looks small, it should last a very long time. I found that patting it onto my lips made me feel like it wouldn't be as ""slippery"" on my lips. There's no taste nor scent, I'm a fan!"
After using the Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment I can see a noticeable difference in my lips. They feel softer and with a more smoother texture. They also seem to get a little more plump while I am wearing it. It is not sticky or thick it is creamy and kind of melts to the touch. I will definitely keep on using this lip treatment as I love how it leaves my lips.
Works on contact and lasts for hours. Great product and great value.
Please dont EVER EVER stop making this. <3. What a fantastic product
I LOVE LOVE THIS. I HAVE VERY DRY LIPS ANS WHEN I USE THIS MY LIPS FEEL SO SOFT . MY LIPS NEVER FELT SO SOFT
"This lip treatment hydrates immediately, plumps, & lasts for hours! I normally suffer from severely dry lips but they have felt wonderful since I started using this."
I was using this mainly at night before I went to bed. It worked pretty nice not overly greasy and absorbed a little into my lips. Using during the day I felt as if I had to keep re-applying to keep my lips moist. Will keep using it at night
"I'm very picky about lip balms, this lasted a good while, felt good on my lips, and wore down nicely/dried down nicely. I received this product free for review purposes."
I received this free samples from PINCHme.
"I have very dry lips especially in the Winter, My lips get so chapped and dry that they even bleed. Since I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now I have noticed how my lips are softer and not as much chapped as they before trying this product."
"I have a problem with chapped lips, especially during the winter. I started using Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment and my chapped lips instantly went away. I love this product. It has made my lips softer and they haven't cracked at all in the cold."
I recieved my sample of Hydro Boost Hydrating lip treatment from Pinchme in exchange for my honest review.
"Since using my lips have felt super soft! I'm a chapstick kind of girl and wasn't sure how I would like this. But it was awesome!! My lips were hydrated all day, didn't feel gunky, it was moisturizing! I will definitely keep using!"
"I was so nice to receive the Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment by Neutrogena for free courtesy of PINCHme. I always like to give an unbiased review because I want to see if these product reviews are legit. Well, first off I would like to say thanks Neutrogena for making this lip treatment pocket size without me losing the cap off of the tube. This really makes my lips smooth and soft. I definitely love the convenience and this lip treatment."
I was able to get this free sample from Pinch Me. I really liked the way it felt on my lips and how it moisturized them. It would be nice to have an applicator but my finger did just fine. Will be purchasing this in the future. No gunky feeling or residue left behind.
After using this for about a week i noticed a huge difference in my lips. My lips this time of year get really dried out. even after the first day my lips felt healthier and more moisturized. after the first week my lips felt healthier than ever before!
i recieved this as a sample from pinchme to try for free.
"After using this for several days, I found my lips to be much softer and better hydrated than they have been for a long time. This formula really works well, lasts a really long time after application, and comes in a very conveniently shaped package, easily fitting in a purse, clutch, or pocket. It's also scentless, so can be used under scented glosses that can be drying."
I received this as a free sample from PINCHme.
"I received this product for free from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. In winter, my lips get very dry and this product definitely provided much needed hydration. My lips feel smooth and moisturized. I like that the product is unscented and sheer, with a subtle shine. My lips experienced no tingly feeling, which is something other products that claim they ""plump"" have caused. My only wish is for the product to come in a tube instead of the pot style because I don't like using my finger to apply."
"I received a free sample of Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment from PINCHme and it works really well to rehydrate dry lips and keep my lips soft and moisturized when they aren't overly dry. I'm not a huge fan of smearing my finger with the lip treatment, but it absorbs quickly and lasts for hours. I feel like other lip balms and mosituring products last for a little while and then need to be reapplied. One application in the morning before I leave the house lasts all day."
I recieved this product from Pinchme as a sample. I was very impressed with how well hydrated my lips were all day long after one application. I also loved using it as a base before lipgloss or lipstick. I highly recommend this product and will be a repeat customer.
"I received a free sample from PINCHme for my honest review of this product. I normally don't like applying lip stuff with my fingers but I like the way this feels on. Not too thick and heavy, it has a silky feeling on the lips and really does feel like its hydrating"
I received this product as a free trial. My lips were already a little chapped and it's not like it healed anything but that's not its purpose. It's lightweight and not overwhelming and has a nice gloss while adding needing moisture. Overall a nice product.
"This lip balm is light weight, has no smell and is great alone or on top of your favorite lip color. I use this at night as a lip moisturizer and when I wake up my lips are smooth and silky. When I wear on top on my favorite all day lip color, lip gives it a smooth feel w/o being sticky!"
Loved my new Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment i got to try for free from PinchMe . I fell in love with this product just after the very first use. Its goes on easily and conditions and smoothens lips flawlessly. Excellent base for lipstick or can be used as is in these wintry months. Thank you.
I have been using this everyday since I received it. It has been super helpful during the Midwest winters in keeping my lips moisturized. I also recently had a cold and this helped with the dry areas around my mouth and nose as well!
Really like the packaging too!
"I received a sample of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment from PINCHme, in exchange for my honest review. I absolutely love this product. It leaves my lips feeling moisturized all day long. There is no sticky feel or residue, just soft kissable lips. I apply in the morning & it stays with me till almost bedtime. I highly recommend this product."
"I have chronic dry lips, and I live in a very dry and cold climate as well. I am always looking for new and better lip products to keep my lips healthy. The Hydro Boost lip treatment is a great addition to my lip collection. It goes on smooth, and leaves my lips feeling hydrated and nourished."
I received a free sample of Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment in exchange for my honest review. I love using this product when I need to moisturize my lips. I use it about once a day. It's not waxy or sticky. It leaves my lips feeling soft and hydrated. It also gives my lips a nice glossy shine so it's also great to put on top of a lip stain.
"I'm not a fan of pot-type containers for lip products. This is no exception. That said, the product itself is incredibly moisturizing without being sticky, and has a nice clear shine to it. I received this as a free sample from PINCHme, but I would purchase the product again."
"I've used a lot of lip products to help the dryness, especially in the winter. I've used this for about a week and so far I think it has helped. I don't like that you have to use your finger or a separate applicator to apply the product, so this is a use at home product for me."
I did receive this product as a free sample from PINCHme.
"I received a sample of Hydro Boost Lip Hyrdrating Lip Treatment from PinchMe in exchange for an honest review. And I can honestly say I love this product! It has kept my lips soft & hydrated, and gives them a nice shine! I will definitely be using this product in the future"
I received a sample of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment courtesy of PinchMe. The lip treatment has done wonder for my dry winter lips that normally crack and peel during this time of the year. I like to sometime rock it solo dolo or use it as a primer for my lip color. My lips are looking and feeling moist.
"The hydrating lip treatment by Neutrogena has worked great for me. My lips are really bad during this winters season. The lips got dry after few minutes and i was applying lip balms again and again. But, with this lip treatment i son't need to use it again and again. The product stays on your lips for many hours. I also love the packaging .... It was a little different from brands"
"Got this from a pinchme box. This product was pretty decent. I wasn't super impressed by it, it didn't do anything more for me that chapstick does. I like that it didn't have a strong scent like some lip treatments do. But otherwise, I don't know that I would purchase this when I finish it."
"I was super lucky to be able to try the Hydro Boost for free as a Pinchme member. I started using it the 1st day I received it, and I literally use it daily. My lips were dry and cracking from this cold weather, and my usual go to product was not working as well lately. Hydro Boost literally eliminated the dryness and cracking. My lips feel and look great now! Definitely recommend!"
This treatment is just awesome for dry lips. I was having some dry lips issues due to being out in the cold last week and was applying chapstick every few hours but it was not helping much until I applied this dry lip treatment. My dry lips were cured within a few hours and were back to normal. So glad I had this.
"I received this item from PINCHme in exchange for an honest review, and honestly, this is exactly what I needed going into Winter. The formula is healing and coats the lips well, but it's not heavy or greasy like some lip treatments. I usually put it on right after the shower and let it sink into my lips as I put my makeup on. Since I've been using it the last few weeks, I can tell my lips (which are usually dry and cracked from December to March!) are softer and more hydrated. Would certainly recommend!"
The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment is an essential item for dry winter lips. I received this as free sample from PINCHme and it has been a life saver! This goes on smooth and glossy and saves my lips overnight. I apply nightly and use as needed throughout the day. It never feels tacky and a little goes a long way. The hydro boost really helps keep my lips moist throughout the day. Love this product and will be buying more of it in the future!
"I have a hard time with any type of lip gloss or balm. Most often it either leaves my lips dryer or it cakes up and looks gross. The Hydrating Lip Treatment helps so much, and feels great. I love it and have been using my sample every day since I received it."
I received this product from Pinchme for sampling purposes. I am very glad I was chosen to sample this. My lips feel hydrated and look it too. I like the shine it gives my lips and that it doesn't have a smell. I wish the application was different. I'm not the biggest fan of having to use my finger for applying. So if I had to change one thing it would be the pot style container. Other than that I really enjoyed this product.
A little bit of shine and ultra moisturizing. I use this daily now as it keeps my lips feeling so soft and healthy. This lip treatment plumps up my lips as well as hydrates them. Great by itself. Also great underneath a matte lipstick.
I was able to try this product for free thanks to PINCHme.
i received a free product in return for this honest review this product left my lips feeling great. my lips felt full and plump it didn't feel like i had anything on my lips at all. my lips were dry and kind of chapped from the weather but after i put this on i didn't have that problem anymore. i am satisfied and happy
I am not kidding when I say this Neutrogena Lip Moisturizer is AMAZING. It's winter now in New England wear I live and when PinchMe asked me if I would like to try this product out for free for my honest review I said yes. I am in love with it. Its not something that works until it wears off. It keeps working even after. You don't have to keep applying like a chap stick. My only issue is I hate applying with my finger but I will get creative. Great product.
I received this product to try from PinchMe and I love it! It leaves my lips so soft and they stay that way all day. I use it as a primer before I put on my neutrogena hydro boost lip shine. It keeps my lips looking dewy and feeling amazing all day long!
I loved the hydro boost lip treatment sample I received from PinchMe. It left my lips feeling soft and not in the least bit dry. I always have dry skin issues and suffer from chapped lips year round. Normally I have to resort to Vaseline to keep my lips from cracking. But this product kept my lips hydrated just as well as Vaseline without any of the nasty taste or grease slick texture. I will definitely be using this alot in the future! Cannot recommend it enough!
"I used this product to keep my lips moist over night. When I woke up the next morning, it was still moist. The one thing I didnt care for, is the how you have to put it on. I dont like that I have to use my finger. I wish it came in a stick or with an applicator."
I received this product for free to test for review.
I want to first thank PinchMe for allowing me to try a free sample of this miracle in a bottle!!! I love this stuff and would buy this treatment every chance I got. It completely hydrated my lips to the max. Allowing them to feel completely refresh and moist.Neutrogena you really have a winner with this one!!!
I really like this product! I received this try from Pinchme and I absolutely love it! It's so hydrating and smooths my lips. And it adds a little shine too if you're just trying to throw something on that's quick and easy. It's definitely a great product!
"I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme, but I will be purchasing this once the sample runs out. The consistency of the balm is perfect, and my lips were softer after one use (quite the accomplishment in the dry winter climate). It also gives a nice shine as well."
"I received a free sample of this product from PinchMe and I'm really happy that I did! This product is really hydrating and gives my lips a really nice shine. My lips are constantly dry, especially in the winter months, but this product really helps hydrate them. I will definitely continue using it!"
"Received this product free through PinchME, and i am extremely grateful for giving a chance to try it before i buy it. And i must say, i am not disappointment. I use the treatment at night as i am licking and apply Neutrogena Naturals on my lips all day. When i wake up in the morning, my lips are not stuck together, they aren't moist or dry but they feel perfect."
"It glides on so smooth. It is non greasy, not scented and not sticky. To me that is what I look for in a moisturizer for my lips. I would love a small lip applicator though as I don't like having to put my finger in it. I would apply all day if it had an applicator. I received this free as a sample through pinch me."
Who would have thought... this little lip treat makes my lips both feel & look great. I don't wear much lipstick & this highlights my lips natural color with a slight sheen. Love it! I received the Hydro Boot Hydrating Lip Treatment as a sample from PinchMe.
"Loved this product so much! During the winter I am always battling dry, cracked lips. Within a day of using the hydrating lip treatment my lips were no longer cracked and dry but rather soft and well hydrated. Really appreciated that it was not scented and left no funky taste ."
This was by far the best thing that has been given to me all winter!!. I loved that this product made my lips feel so soft and I felt that not only were my lips being moisturized but protected as well. Looking forward to purchasing this in the near future.
I received this product to try for free from PINCHme.com in exchange for an honest review.
"I use this product mainly in the mornings before applying lipstick or gloss, and at night before bed. After using the product, my lips are soft and hydrated. I like that it's. It sticky and there isn't any additional scent or flavor that I can detect. Works well."
I wasn't sure how I felt about this product when I first tried it. I have very dry lips in the winter so I like using lip balm. After a couple days I really loved using this product it hydrated my lips and gave them a nice shine no gloss needed. I received this product for free from PinchMe for testing purposes.
"I received a sample of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment through PinchME in order to facilitate my review. This review is my 100% honest opinion. I really enjoyed this lip balm. It's extremely wet and I feel like it needs an applicator. I use lip balm daily, sometimes twice a day and this seems as though it would run out in a week because there's so little in here. It's amazing and feels like an instant treatment when you apply it."
I received this as a free sample from PinchMe and I am so glad I did! I love how moisturizing this is to my lips without being sticky. This treatment looks like a clean gloss but leaves your lips so hydrated! I only wish that it was in a tube instead. Even though I received this for free all opinions are my own.
"I was so pleased with the texture and quality of this lip treatment. I live in the desert where the cold dry winter air can be so harsh. Keeping my lips hydrated can be hard! I spend a lot of time outdoors hiking and cycling, so my lips can get chapped easily. This truly is a great treatment to prevent and treat chapped lips. I received this product for free from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. This is really how I feel about this product :)"
I have dry skin and lips mostly all the time and I was so excited to get to try this product from Pinchme for my honest opinion. I have never had such supple and soft lips I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I really can tell a difference. My lips are so smooth. I can wear any lip product without them cracking. Neutrogena has shocked and amazed me once again. Very pleased with this hydro boost line I love hoe soft my lips and skin feel.
"I recently received this as a free trial from Pinchme and I must say, it's amazing! It came at just the right time, I've been sick and my lips had started hurting because they were so dry. Lo and behold, I used the product and within a day I could tell a major difference. I love this product!!"
"I received the hydro boost hydrating lip treatment as a free sample through PINCHme and love it! It comes in a sleek package easy to fit in your pocket or purse, and goes on smoothly with no greasy feel. My lips feel great even with winter starting and it doesn't get sticky. Definitely getting more so I don't run out."
"I received a sample of Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment, in exchange for my honest review, from PinchMe. Living in the Northwest United States, it gets extremely cold. The cold really can take a toll on your skin, especially on your lips. Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment really has made a difference. It does a great job of keeping my lips moisturized and supple. It doesn't leave my lips greasy or sticky, not does it leave an after taste. I highly recommend this product for those who want supple, healthy lips."
This product hydrates decently and feels nice on the lips. It has a slight blue shimmer which I enjoy. It makes lips look plump and full. I don't like the packaging though. I would much prefer a lip balm in stick or squeeze tube form so I don't have to get any on my finger. I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme.
"The Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment is amazing! It is smooth and not gritty at all like some lip treatments. Makes your lips instantly feel hydrated and silky smooth. Its great to use everyday, any time of year! I received the Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment as a sample from #PINCHME in exchange for an honest review of the product. Try it you'll love it!"
I really enjoyed using this product. It made my lips soft but it seems I was still having chapped lips. This lessened throughout the course of my use but I would have liked more of an effect. I do love the case it came in; very convenient and of course the brand is one of my favorites.
I have never tried this product before until I was given a sample. And I have to say it this product is amazing.. I have dry lips especially during winter time and I only had to put this on maybe twice throughout the whole day and it kept my lips hydrated and so soft. I will continue to buy this item..
"My lips are chronically dry, and chapped. I live in a climate that is very dry and cold in the winter (Northern California). I have a hard time finding lip treatments that actually do more than temporarily or superficially moisturize my lips. This Neutrogena lip treatment works, and it lasts. I would repurchase this product, and recommend to a friend."
"Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment does exactly as described. I always keep it with me during the winter as my lips are always drying out, but with this lip care treatment I never have dry lips anymore. My lips are also very smooth after use. I recommend this to anyone looking for great lip care."
"I struggle with dry lips often, especially during quick weather changes. I started using this every morning and my lips haven't been peeling and feel smooth and hydrated for most of the day. I am a mom on the go so this is a great simple product for me to use and small to throw into my bag or even a pocket. I received this product for free from PINCHme in exchange for my honest review."
"I received a sample from Pinchme. I liked the feel of the product on my lips (would prefer a different application though, I don't like having to stick my fingers in it to rub it on my lips). The treatment keep my lips moisturized and soft. I was impressed with how they felt the next morning."
"I received this as a free sample from PinchMe and I love it!! Neutrogena outdid themselves with this product! My lips were super dry and cracked, so much that they would burn. I tried this product, and within a few hours, my lips were almost back to normal! This is definitely my new go-to product for my dry lips! Thank you!"
I love how this lip treatment will use my lips feeling so well hydrated especially in the winter time I use the best lip treatment as a moisturizer and a prep and prime my lips right before I put on the hydration lip shine I didn't think I would like it but I actually love it it does not smell funky and leaves your lips feeling so soft and smooth I did receive it this free from pinch me.com but all my opinions are my own
I am a big fan of this product. I used this at night before bed to help treat my lips while I slept or during the day when my lips felt dry. This made my lips so soft and helped relieve any chapping that I had. I wouldn't say that this lasts 24 hours but it does a great job while it's on. I also think this would be great before applying a lipstick especially any matte lip products. I am definitely going to purchase this when I run out. I received this product from PINCHme for my honest review.
"My lips were chapped and rough feeling, I applied the Hydro Boost Hydrating lip treatment, and instantly my lips felt smooth and silky. I received this sample free from Pinchme.com, after using this I will definitely be purchasing in the near future. This is now my everyday lip treatment! I also like that this doesn't dry out fast, like most other lip treatments. I don't have to repeatedly apply very often, now I can go a longer stretch of time before needing to reapply."

"This product came in the mail at the perfect time. My lips were dry from the dry air in my house and because I was sick leading to slight dehydration. My lips were cracked and ""ouchy"". I put the lip treatment on and could feel and see the difference almost instantly. By day 2 my lips were almost back to normal and soft."
"Hydro Boost Lip Treatment really helped my dry, chapped lips! Made them feel so soft and smooth ALL day long. I really liked it a lot. My lips feel so wonderful now, this is really great for the winter/cooler months to help keep your lips hydrated, soft, and smooth. My hubby even noticed a difference when he kissed me :) I received this as free samples from PINCHme!"
I have severely dry skin all over and my lips are no exception. I have tried all types of lip balms and creams but none of them seem to help. This Hydro Boost lip treatment is exactly what I have been looking for! It has made a significant difference in the dry skin on my lips and for once they don't look cracked and dry. I put it on several times a day and it makes my lips feel amazing.
I received a free sample of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Lip Treatment from the PINCHme website. I was very pleased with this product. My lips were usually dry but gummy.

It's also very compact and easily slides into your purse or pocket!
