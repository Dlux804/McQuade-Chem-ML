Received a sample of this product in the mail. Found out WalMart carries it so I ordered three jars. I love this product. It is a great moisturizer without being sticky or greasy. My order arrived on time and in perfect condition.
I received a sample as a gift. This is by far the BEST moisturizer I have ever used. After using for less than a week I could see a definite difference. Lines were far less noticeable and my face feels so soft. I love this product.
"I have used this on my face and areas of my body with great results, and I bought this because of the anti-oxidant and hyaurlonic acid, but until recently did not know that it also will ease skin irritation and itching from allergic reactions to hairspray and even bug bites! I will always buy this product, so do NOT discontinue it, please!"
I absolutely love this cream! It makes my skin feel soft and replenished in an instant. I can see results within a couple day. And I especially love the blue color and the smell :))
"I have Crohn's Disease and all the medications leave my skin ultra dry its so frustrating! I tried the sample of this from a Cosmo magazine after washing my face, which left my face Painfully dry. Straight off the smell was very pleasant and pretty and just after a few dabs spread on my face my skin was soft and bright. I am Mommy with a small budget but going to start saving up starting today. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I NEVER write reviews......but I HAD to for this product! I am 35, and my skin randomly became extremely dry. I spent months trying to find something that would help. I spent lots of money on high end products that just couldn't do the trick. I saw a coupon for this and decided to give a try. I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. It hydrated my face over night! I couldn't believe it. I have been using for a week and all is well. My skin stays hydrated all day long, it actually has a dewy feel to it. I LOVE it, THANK YOU!!!!"
"I have super dry skin and I have tried many different lotions and creams. None have held moisture and kept my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I bought this product not expecting anything special, but luckily I was wrong. This product is hands down the best way to moisturizer your face. Worth every single penny. I will never use anything else."
"This is by far one of the best moisturizers I have found, including more expensive products at department stores. HOWEVER. Why ruin a great product with artificial Blue 1 coloring and overpowering parfum? I wish they had this exact same formulation without those two unnecessary chemicals."
Why can't companies make products that are unscented. I purchased today and tried it on my hand before applying to my face. The floral smell for me is too much. I read the ingredients and not sure where it is coming from but I'm returning. I won't use due to the scent.
"Gel moisturizers > liquid moisturizers for dry skin like mine! I've tried everything from Neutrogena to clinical moisturizers but no amount of layers could keep my skin from peeling. This was the first gel moisturizer I've ever used--HOLY COW!!! I could not believe the difference!! My skin feels supple, smooth, and there's no hint of dryness anywhere. It's also gentle enough that I can use it on my eyelids as an eye cream, and it doesn't break me out. Love it."
"I tried this on a whim, and am glad for my whims! I am 54 and inherited ""crepe"" skin on my hands and forearms. So this was the first place I applied this product. While my crepe skin is not smooth entirely, my hands and arms appear less wrinkled than before! This product truly hydrates and claimed!"
"I am 57yrs old and never took care of my skin in my younger years,hitting 50 I had no choice and have used so many and I mean MANY products.I had a coupon so I bought the moisture bomb moisturiser and have used it daily now for a week,I'm in love with it,my skin has not looked this good in a long time,tomorrow I plan on buying more and trying the masks.ThankYou Garnier!Please do not change the ingredients!

I am 52 and my skin was starting to feel very dry. I've tried so many creams and while some worked didn't give me that fresh look and feel. This product does! I can see and feel the results instantly. Just bought my first jar after trying a sample from a magazine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product smells great and moisture my skin. It is great to use both in the morning and at night before sleep. Goes on easy and not greasy, and apply easy and feel light. My face feels great after use. I feel it will be great for both summer and winter use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is definitely oily skin friendly! It'a more water based than oil, so it kept my pores from getting clogged and causing a breakout. A little also goes a long way, which makes the price seem more reasonable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this in a WalMart Beauty box a few months ago and I am so glad I did! This moisturizer has literally saved my face and it smells fantastic! It's not heavy but it sure packs the moisture in. I have combination skin, this doesn't make my face oily, it feels so lightweight and amazing."
"I was hesitant to try this moisturizer because I usually struggle with an combo/oily face and I thought it would make my skin too oily, but this stuff is pure magic. My face is so soft and my blemishes have cleared. I would even go as far as to say my skin is less oily. I don't wear foundation at all anymore because of how great this moisturizer has made my skin. BUY IT!"
I bought this product a few days ago. I usually use biore moisturizer and not very often due to my skin usually being naturally soft and young looking at 38. This winter has been especially harsh and drying on my skin and i was looking for some intense hydration but light weight. This is exactly what i was looking for!!! I discovered instant results as well. Its even perfect for my oily parts of my face as mine is combination. Thank you Garnier!!! I won't be using any other moisturizer anytime soon!!!
After a month of moisture bomb I'm in love with my skin and I'm 51!!
I love it on my face! Feeling Fresh! Supper great...
"I'm in my 50s and I never give reviews, but this is absolutely the best hydrating, light feeling cream ever! Better than any I���ve ever used. Thank you thank you for this amazing product. It's my new love!"
IS THIS PRODUCT GOOD FOR
OILY SKIN? IM OILY ALL OVER. THIS IS ONLY MY 3 DAY USING. I DO FEEL OILY. I'm not sure if it the gel? Or my oily skin? IS THIS OIL FREE PRODUCT? PLS ANSWER THIS
I have super sensitive skin that is dry. This moisturizer has been amazing. No clogged pores just lightweight moisture. Definitely a must have for skin care [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had received a sample and told myself I had to have it. I am so happy I bought it. It's a light weight moisturizer and it doesn't leave a greasy feel. I LOVE IT! And the scent is just wonderful. Thank you, thank you!!"
"I love this moisturizer, for the past 5 years I have tried to find the best moisturizers, by far this is one of the good ones. We need to moisturize our skin twice a day, I will be buying this from now on."
"I've never tried any of Garnier products before, but I am so glad I finally tried their SkinActive Moisture Bomb. I tend to have skin that is on the drier side, especially during winter. My current product went on as normal but within 10 minutes my skin felt dry and patchy. So, I tried the moisture bomb. It lasted through work, under makeup, and a football game. I'm really glad I tried it and Garnier has now replaced my current moisturizer of the last 3 years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have have bad acne and goes to the dermatologist for face cream. Usually i dont like trying anything that isnt presribe to me but this moisturizer works it magic!!! I have oily skin but for somw reason this doesnt make ur face oily at all!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer reminds me so much of the belief moisture bomb, but at a quarter of the price. It is a water base so my oily skin absorbs it but my pores are not clogged. My favorite way to use it is like a night mask, just put on more than usual and go to bed. You wake up with your skin baby soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer, I have super dry skin and it just help me hydrate my face before applying my make up."
Gave me a nasty skin rash. Bright red and bumpy. First time in my whole life this has happened to me. I am 38 and have fair normal skin type. I'm embarrassed to go out in public!
"LOVE this stuff! And I love the tea rose scent too--if you do decide to make a scent-free version, that's fine, but please keep the original scent as well. It just makes me so happy!"
I have chronic dry skin. This moisturizer has been the best I've ever used from all price ranges!' My skin has a dewy glow since using it and stays that way all day. People have been complimenting me left and right. I'm absolutely obsessed!
"I was a little apprehensive about the scent at first. My fears however, subsided as quickly as the light scent dissipated. The SkinActive Moisture Bomb has a gel like quality that goes on easily and evenly. It absorbs quickly. In other words: there is no sticky feeling . My face did not get that dry pulling feeling that so many other moisturizers leave. Overall, I am pretty happy with the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample in a couple of the magazines that I subscribe too. I was at my son's baseball games over the weekend and got burned on my face. This product saved me and gave me a since of cooling and refreshment that my face and neck really needed. I 100 percent recommend this product!
Thank you for making it affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Let me start off by saying this stuff honestly smells amazing. It really truly is moisturizing , I put this little bad boy in my purse an use it whenever my hands feel dry or ashy an this stuff last all day long. Highly recommended it to everyone . even got a couple of my coworkers to buy their own bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought a moisturizer from this brand years ago and it made me break out, however I love this stuff! How the Winter has cursed my supple skin into a dry Savannah!! I leave this jar by my bed and love smothering my face with it! Within minutes my skin is bouncy, plump, and hydrated! Lightweight and smells AMAZING! I would recommend to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to love this product! It smells absolutely amazing and with winter right around the corner who can't use just a little extra hydration to their skin? But sadly, it did nothing for my oily skin, I felt like a grease-ball within a couple hours. Definitely not for a daytime moisturizer, it would be great for nighttime though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product. Put as a Facebook status: a must get! Smells great, works great and love it. Always liked Garnier hair products decided to try the skin care and like it. I like Garnier because it's not a over priced name. Good quality but fairly priced. Skin feels great. Had dry spots that it covered but also didn't make other spots too greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really love Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb it feels like luxurious creams, it leave your face feeling so soft. Definitely a good buy!!"

"When you open the jar the amazing smell hits your nose and its a pretty blue color too! I use this right before I put my foundation on, and never have any problems with it being greasy or sticky. The only downside is that there's a tiny chemical smell to it after you rub it in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've been using this product for a couple weeks already and now I have a very hard time deciding how many stars to give this Moisture Bomb, because I feel that it moisturizer pretty well, but after couple of minutes my face got very sticky and it happen the same all the other days. So I couldn't use it as a day time moisturizer. I'll probably finish the tub , but applying cream Just before bed time. I think it's a good product but not for my skin. However I'll give 3⭐️⭐️⭐️!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garner Moisturebomb is absolutely amazing. It is light, refreshing and soaks in leaving your face feeling fresh all day. I have my hands in water and many detergents all day leaving them rough and so dry that they crack. So I tried this product on my hands and was amazed at how much better they felt. LOVE IT!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always get dry skin in the winter, but many moisturizers make me break out. I have sensitive skin. Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb smells very fresh. It moisturizes without making skin greasy or causing breakouts. It does say super moisturizer, and I'm not quite sure why it is ""super"" moisturizing, but it is a great moisturizer and I would buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I started using this cream, I was'not excited with the results the first day, but with the days I noticed better look, my face look now more hidratated, it's a great base for makeup too, the only thing that I don't liked it's that I'm very oily skin and it make me feel more oily, for that I recommend it if you have dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a person who has dry skin, to the point that I receive special medication from my dermatologist. I'm very impressed with this product. It moisturizer my skin without it looking oily, it also has a great smell. The fact that it is a well known brand that is easily accessible helps as well! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a moisturizer that actually moisturizer your skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product did exactly what I expect from a lightweight moisturizer. It's more like a gel so it goes on super smooth and doesn't leave any sticky feel on my skin. It soaks in immediately leaving my skin hydrated and literally feeling like silk. I love everything about this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely fell in love with the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb!!! Just like it's name implied it feels like a bomb of moisture from the second it touches your skin. I love that a little goes a long way! With a small dip of my fingers I apply to my entire face and neck. My face has never looked so good and I even noticed that I have been breaking out way less since using this product. I will definitely continue to use this for many many years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have fallen in love with the moisture bomb moisturizer. I have a very oily face and this is the only cream/gel that soaks into my skin. It is not greasy nor sticky. I will totally recommend this to my friends and I will also share a review on my blog. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really liking the formula as an everyday moisturizer after my acne specific facewash. The cold is bringing in dry skin and this product works great as a daily moisturizer. Stays matte and unoily which is perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this Garnier moisture Bomb. Non gresy and made my skin smooth and nice looking. My sister said I looked great while wearing it. What I would want to know before buying or trying this product would be is it affective amd yes it is is it greasy? No not at all. Does it break you out if you have sensitive skin? No it doesn't because I have sensitive skin and didn't bother me at all [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a good moisturizer and smells great. I have oily/combo skin and this moisturizer worked great. The only downside was it left my face feeling sticky until it dried but overall it really moisturizer my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product two days ago and I already see changes in my skin. I love that it does not leave the skin greasy and it absorbs rather quickly through the skin. Also has a good smell. I definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I LOVE this product. I added it into my daily routine both in the evening before bed and then in the morning before I do my makeup. With winter coming up my skin usually gets very dry and irritated. The Moisture Bomb not only has added moisture to my skin but as also my my skin less irritated and flaky! Not to mention when you massage it into your face it feels so luscious, like you're at a spa. P.S. Girlfriend tested. Boyfriend approved! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the first time I've ever tried a Garnier product, this one impressd me! I have combo skin and it is not easy for me to find a product that is moisturizing enough and not too oily at the same time. However, I've been using this for few days and I notice it is a great product for combo skin, it keeps the balance between moisturizing enough and not too oily on combo skin. I loved it! I will buy it when this one run out！ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a nice smell and texture. At first I found it to be fine, but when I showered the next day my face felt sticky and slippery as if it had been sitting on top of my skin rather than actually absorbing into my skin. I have rather sensitive skin and it didn't seem to irritate me. But based on the way it didn't seem to absorb, it just didn't work for me. I'll stick with my usual oil-free moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I know in fall weather dry skin is a daily situation. I always hydrate by drinking water. When I applied the MOISTURE BOMB my skin instantly felt hydration. More like a serium going into the pores of my dry skin. It did not feel greasy or sticky. Just a great relaxing product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I personally love this new skin active moisture balm from garnier so much!it makes my skin super soft and oh so hydrated!I would chose this over my other moistures because unlike the others,it leaves my skin looking beautiful and naturally smooth!even my mother tries to use my new moisture balm from garnier all the time!I'm almost out of it and need to definitely buy another! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product. I've been trying it for a little over a week now and my skin stays so moisturizer all throughout the day. It leaves your face extremely soft. It's great to use also once you take your makeup off at night after you wash your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Normally my skin is extremely dry and starts to be scaly around my nose, forehead and chin. I've tried numerous store brands some which help but for onky a limited time and then proceeds my skin more dry. After 2+ weeks of using this product, I must say I think I finally found my go to moisturizer. It is extremely lightweight (watery like substance), makes my skin soft and can instantly feel my skin feeling hydtrated and refreshed. I will definitely purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin very soft and smooth. It absorbs very quickly into my skin and leaves me moisturized for a long time. I love the way it smells and a little goes a long way. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the sticky feeling it left on my fingers but that was easily fixed by running my hands under the water for a second. Overall this is an excellent product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's not super heavy, it's more of a gel which I like. The smell is little strong but not bad. It absorbed quickly into the skin and felt light. I have oily skin so it absorbing quick and leaving me greasy feeling is important, this was nice for that! I'd probably only use it at night and not before makeup or anything but I did like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The garner moisture bomb is truly a revitalizing experience. Not only does it provide a refreshing tingling skin sensation, but provides long lasting moisture throughout the day. This, coupled with the fact it moisturizes without leaving your skin feeling greasy, makes this product ideal for all skin types. If you want healthy, smoothie skin without feeling greasy, then I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pros: the consistency is amazing and it smells great Cons (for me): I have sensitive dry skin I did get quite a few clogged pores, I don't like putting perfumes on my face. It would more like work with ""normal"" skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb for 2 weeks now. My face is usually really dry after showering and this moisturizer helps restore the moisture back into my face. My face is soft and stays hydrated all day. The cream is light and doesn't have an overpowering scent. Even though the jar may seem small, a little goes a long way. I've been using a dime size amount with no issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this Garnier Moisture Bomb! I have been using this for a little over 3 weeks and I cannot wait to try other Garnier products. This product goes on smooth and feels great, somewhat cool feeling and non greasy. I love the clean, fresh smell. I like the simple, easy to use jar without all of that fancy stuff that doesn't add any value to the actual product. I will definitely continue to use this and will more than likely add other Garnier products to my regimen as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer. My akin is changing with the weather and this Moisture Bomb is exactly what I needed. I get very dry in the winter and before I started using the moisture bomb my skin was so dry and flaky but I can see a clear difference after using it. My skin feels so supple and moisturized and it's also helping with my dry breakouts which I love. I just wishared I could find it in stores.it seems to be non existent where I live [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for over a week and please to say I really like it. First it smell great kinda tropical. It glides on your skin and is very light weight in texture. You skin will feel very moisturized which is good especially if you live in a cold climate like me. Also it works great under your foundation! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer is a great way to hydrate. My skin is oily in the T zone but dry in other areas. I need a moisturizer that won't make my skin extra oily and Garniers SkinActive moisture bomb is perfect. It's light weight and a little goes a long way. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is due to the fragrance. The fragrance is a light pomegranate which isnt unpleasant but I would prefer a non scented moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this was a really great idea! It comes in a very sturdy packaging, which makes me feel like it is much more high-end than the price. The cream is thick and thin at the same time, gives the skin a luxurious feel, and really sinks in for a deep moisturization! Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been enjoying using the Garnier SkinActive Moisture bomb face gel ! My face is so dry ,so I was very skeptical if this would make a difference ! But I have noticed its a lot softer an feels more hydrated !! I looked up close with my magifying mirror to see if I still had dry flakes but super happy to see they where gone !! So with the colder temps I'm happy to know will not dry out using this product ! Thank you Garnier !! SkinActive Moisture Bomb is the ""BOMB "" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I wasn't sure how well I would like this product since I have never tried any Garnier skin products, only hair stuff. First impression was: The packaging is very nice and great quality, also the cream smells soooooo good! Initially I was using it every day like it said to, but then my skin was getting way to oily so I switched to every other day and I ended up really liking the results. My skin felt soooo soft and my makeup seems to go on much smoother! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. This is my first time using Garnier and from the packaging to the after effect I was satisfied throughout. The texture was just right, not too heavy, not oily, cool, refreshing and very moisturizing. When I didn't use it for a couple of days I could quickly see that my skin was thirsty and instantly my fine lines were replenished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this moisturizer. It went on smooth it wasn't too thick. It went into the skin quickly. It helped my dry patches a lot. With winter my skin gets more dry and this really helps. It went fine under makeup and didn't make it look greasy. I really enjoyed it and think it be a great everyday moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for almost two weeks now. I use it mainly at night and not as indicated in the instructions. So far, i must say that I like the smell (it does not smell chemically) and the color of the cream. I like the smooth texture. Before this cream, i've used the more higher end products from la prairie and i can certainly see some similarities. Before purchasing this cream I would have wanted to see the full list of ingredients and how well it is rated on the safety index. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product, it creates a super soft moist barrier on my skin that doesn't go away after a few minutes. I've even been using it on my legs to keep the winter rough skin away. It is not a heavy / thick cream either, which makes it perfect for under my foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This gel/cream is one of the best I have ever tried,if not the best.It smells like the ocean and soap,and is cooling and relaxing .It is still good for winter nights,and relaxes dry skin.I love the container too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the way this lotion feels on my skin, it's not heavy or greasy. I feel like it does a good job moisturizing, but absorbs quickly without making it feel like you have a heavy lotion on your face. It's light enough to use in the morning under makeup without feeling like you have layers of stuff on your face. My skin tends to get really sensitive in cold weather like we are currently having, so many lotions and moisturizers tend to irritate my skin, but this did not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I been use this for a wall and it make my skin fill so soft I love this you must try..my skin love this I use it in the moring and night and love The way my skin fills so soft you just have to try get it at gariner or your loco store it's good for you won't regat it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this moisturizer. I've always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that actually worked and didn't make my face feel pasty or clog my pores. This one just dried quickly and it didn't feel like it was even there! The moisture it gave my face was amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is amazing it makes my skin feel so refreshed. I put it on at night and again in the morning.I normally have sensitive skin the gets easily irritated by facial products but this did not irritate my skin at all. The scent is not strong and it goes on great not leaving the greasy feeling behind. I will buy this product again in the future. I am considering buying other Garnier skin products as a result of falling in love with Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face gets really dry and having a face login that can last all day is hard to find. I would apply in an morning and night and it felt great. You only need a small amount. One thing that I did not like is that it has a heavy scent. It does not smell bad I would only prefer an unscented option from a facial lotion. Great facial lotion otherwise! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thought I had was ""wow, this is a huge container."" There is a good amount of product in there that will last a long time. My second thought was how good it smells! Seriously, I can't get enough. It's gel-like and creamy, a nice clear blue color. It goes on smooth and makes your face smell great! I used it overnight a bunch and woke up with silky smooth and very moisturized skin. It's great for an at-home spa day and a perfect easy addition to your everyday skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb for over a week now and I love it. Most moisturizes feel ""heavy"" while this one is so light I can't tell I've put it on. It works wonderful and I don't have to wait long for it to dry before I apply my make-up in the morning. I believe I've found THE moisturizer for me. I've already thrown out the one I was using before I trying Garnier SkinActive. Thank you Garnier for making the best moisturizer out there! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Light, effective, and didn't cause me to break out. Could use twice a day, every day, and get good results without clogging pores. The scent is pleasant, but reminded me a bit too much of Garnier hair products; the similarity was weird for me. Really like that it's in a jar; I'm sick of squeeze tubes where product gets left behind in the end. Definitely a very good value and effective product for its price point. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product that worked really well for my skin. Not only did I see a different but my family noticed it also. It has a really nice smell, it's fresh and light which is important for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. I have tried other Garnier products, for face, that were not as good as this. It is very moisturizing and you don't need a lot to go a long way. It makes your face soft and radiant! There is a slight tingle when you first put it on, which I have found is normal for good moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is amazing. I suffer from oily skin and alot of moisturizers I've used in the past just made it worse. but not this one, it doesn't feel oily nor does it feel heavy. My skin has been smooth and moisturized since I started using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is so light and smells great! It has hyaluronic acid and anitioxidants which are amazing for your skin. I use it after I cleanse my face and my face is super soft and hydrated.

"I love this product, love the light scent and non greasy texture. The moment I put on my skin, I feel instant refresh and long last moisturized. I prefer to use it at night then wake up feeling fresh. It is heavenly bomb for my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is great. It boasts long lasting hydration and lives up to it. It also claims to reduce the appearance of fine lines and it does just that. It has a pleasant smell and is very light when putting it on. You can instantly feel smoother skin. I would recommend using a cleanser to get maximum results. This is a product that I would be happy to buy. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"During this time of year my skin is really sensitive and dry. But with this product my skin is so soft and smooth and hydrated! This doesnt cause my sensitive skin to break out, it's actually clearer since I started using it. I would recommend this to any and everyone! Plus is smells so good too!! It's good for both men and women as my boyfriend uses it too and has said he is less likely to get razor burn when using this aftering shaving. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It gives you moisture that lasts all day. I loved the light fruity scent to it. I have tried to find a good moisturizer for my face that doesn't make me break out or irritate my skin. This worked great and didn't irritate my skin at all. It comes in a nice jar too. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin feels moisturized after using this product! The reason why I didn't give it a perfect score was a few reasons. One, it smells like hairspray to me. I don't smell anything after I put it on, but it smells like hairspray. Second, a little goes a long way, and it takes a little while to rub in. But other than that, it's great.

"I feel that this lotion is very hydratant, i just have to use it once a day and my skin is perfectly soft and hydrated. One day i forgot to use it and my skin still hydated with out use it the lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisture is okay for my skin, I put it on early in the morning before work and mid day by noon i found my skin becoming a bit dry. You're suppose to use it twice a day but I only put mine on once a day only because the jar is not that big so I would run out very soon if I applied it twice a day. I have the Goji Berry and it smells really good. I would recommend this product to others its not a bad product at all just wish the jar was a bit bigger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"OK so first thing i noticed about this product was the packaging it was so sleek and pretty. I love the glass container with the blue tint so gorgeous. It smells so good much like a fruity perfume, which made me worry about it irritating my skin. To my surprise i have been using it the past few days and no redness or breakout which is great. My skin feels soft and hydrated. I'm very impressed with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has become my go-to daily moisturizer. I have been using it twice a day for about two weeks, and have really noticed a difference in my skin. My skin looks and feels much more hydrated. I have acne prone skin and I haven't noticed an increase in breakouts since using this product, which is great! I love the fresh scent and it doesn't feel greasy on my skin. I will be repurchasing this product when it runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cream. It soaks into skin amazingly and so quickly. I like this feature about the product because I don't feel like the product is wiped away by my pillow. I also like that while it is lightweight, it is also very moisturizing. There is a fresh scent but nothing too heavy that bothers my nose. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to say after getting Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb in the mail and trying it. It is the best moisturizer I have ever tried. After 1 day of using I saw a difference. Putting it on feels like a peel mask but after it dries my face is healthier looking and so soft! I love that you only have to put it on twice a day for the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Let me start off by saying, I am in LOVE with this product. I have never used a gel moisturizer before so i was kind of skeptical about it but i fell in love. I use this every morning /night. Super moisturizing without leaving your face greasy. It hasn't broken me out like other moisturizers did in the past. I have to say I will definitely be buying more of this as soon as I run out .

"I just received this a few days ago, so I haven't had a lot of time to test out the product but so far, it provides superior moisture to my neck area, which is where I need it the most. I need more time to properly test out the product. A few days is not enough time to really give a good opinion, but so far so good. I am liking the results early on and hope they get even better with time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the Garnier skin active moisture bonb. The gel is so light weight and smells amazing it leaves my skin feeling soft and silky smooth. I've had the pleasure of using it for about five days now and can already tell a difference in the texture of my skin. I will definitely buy this product !

Love this product! Impressed they packaged this product in heavy blue glass container. Moisturizer has a very light scent which I love. It feels cool when applying to my face. I noticed my face feels smooth and soft. Only thing I have issue is that it leaves a weird residue on my fingers which I have to wash every time. Other than that I have been extremely pleased with this product . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tested this and my skin feels so awesome ! I washed my face and applied this before I put makeup on and it made my skin super moisturized . I was worried my skin would feel tacky but it soaked into my skin and dried flat ! I really liked it ! After a day of makeup my skin didn't get oily like it does sometimes with other moisturizers .

"I struggle with dry, flaky skin on my face and heading into winter it only gets worse. Enter Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb...I was hesitant that this wouldn't be any different than the zillion other face lotions I've tried but it's fantastic! It's super light and has a pleasant but mild scent. I've been using it for about a week and it hasn't irritated my skin at all. It's very moisturizing and doesn't leave my skin oily or shiny at all. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using the product for a week now and I can say that the product does make a difference. It's weighless but yet gives you that moisture you need that is not over done . I'm a combination skin so it does really work well with my foundations as I use it as a moisturizer before everything. It's antioxidant so it does protect my face and make it look fresher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have blemish prone dry skin, so finding a product that balances my skin problems is very difficult. This has improved the texture of my skin without making me breakout. It isn't greasy or sticky, and has a light, pleasant scent. I am not sure if it will be enough for very dry winter weather, but I am hopeful so far. I have used Moisture Bomb for just a week, but I could see this becoming a regular part of my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the consistency of the product, a little but goes a long way. When you first apply the product the smell can be a little strong. I think this product is mainly directed to dry faces. Even though the product says no oil if you have an oily face after a couple hours of the product application your face will become extremely oily, even on a freshly washed face. Still overall a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a Clinique person for over 30+ years. I never tried any other face moisturizer. This stuff is GOOD! It smells fantastic, smooths right into my face and you don't need a lot so the jar will last a long time! Surprisingly impressed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Garnier's Skin Active Moisture Bomb on my face for a few days now. Every morning I wash my face, then apply the moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling soft for the whole day, without feeling oily. The only thing I don't like about it is the smell, while pleasant and fruity, is a bit strong for my taste. Overall a good moisturizer. Will definitely continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was somewhat sceptical because I have patches of dry skin on my face, and I was concerned about would this actually work without being heavy, but this moisturizer is Awesome! It's not heavy or greasy and my skin looked healthier after two uses. It also smells great, highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using Garnier Skinactive Moisture bomb 1 week ago and my skin feels great. I typically get very dry skin this time of year once the weather starts to turn cold, but ever since I started applying this moisturizer before I go to bed every night my face has been moisturized and I haven't seen dry skin once! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is for people with moderate to significantly dry skin. I'm one of those people and I have to say I'm loving this product. Super stoked that it came full size. I suffer with dry skin in the colder months so this product is great with keeping my skin hydrated and I absolutely love it and its great that I don't have to use more than a dime size for my whole face. Only down-side for me I'm not a big fan of the Goji Berry fragrance. Other than that great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product twice daily and my skin looks & feels amazing! The packaging of the moisturizer looks very classy and is durable. This container should last a few months, you don't need much to feel the difference. The texture is a mix between a lotion and oil, I love it! Not only does it moisturize and make your skin super soft but it smells really good too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Garnier Moisture Bomb has a gel-like texture that quickly sinks into the skin. It doesn't feel heavy at all. I think people with oily skin would enjoy this especially. Now that the weather is getting colder, I like to use this under a heavier cream to lock in the moisture. This also wears under makeup well in the morning. The scent is pretty light and not overpowering, reminding me of cucumber. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved this product. It made my skin look revived and feel very moisturized. The product didn't leave my skin feeling oily like most of the other products that I have tried. I would definitely recommend it to consumers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been looking for face cream for some time now. I have dry in some spots and oily in others on my face. So I haven't used any...til this...this didn't make my skin oily at all. My pores looked ao much smaller and my skin looked smooth and soft. I just absolutely loved this and will be buying more... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far so good. I've used this product 2x a day for the past week, and it it's working as advertised. I normally have very sensitive skin, but this is very gentle. It really does moisturize and I've noticed my fine lines are less notable even after only one week. My skin was softer after only one use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am completely in love with this product. I have dry patches on my face that no other moisturizer has been able to help and this product helped so much. The smell isnt my favorite but it is light when you first apply it then it begins to feel like a wonderful light powder. I have been raving about this product to all my friends. I would love to know the price on this item so I can buy more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product does exactly what it says! It doesn't feel greasy or heavy, just leaving my skin with a silky feel. Trying a gel cream for the first time was different. I wasn't sure if it could moisture very well, but I was wrong. I loved that it helped keep my makeup looking fresh all day, almost like it is a primer too. I also loved the light, fresh scent, which didn't bother my very skin sensitive. The only thing I would change is adding a little sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my new favorite moisturizer! I have severely oily and sensitive skin. Most moisturizers make me a grease pit. I put this on at night and my face feels good and moisturized the next morning. The scent is a little over powering right at first but it quickly goes away and you don't even notice it anymore. It also hasn't broke me out at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is great for daytime and I would recommend it to individuals with slightly dry to oily skin. It is moisturizing but not greasy at all! However, if you have very dry skin you may not find this moisturizing enough. Overall I would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product is a great product that has a great texture. Most moisturizes I have tried almost leave a dry crackle feeling on the skin. This product truly does leave a smooth silky finish on the skin. It does not leave a sticky feeling on the skin. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good moisturizer. Only reason for 4 stars out of 5 stars is I would prefer a little more fragrance to the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this moisturizer. It came in a glass container and I immediately fell in love with the smell when I opened it. Made my face feel very soft. Not sure if this is just because my skin is oily, but I did notice a bit more oil around my nose after using it. would buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is pretty good. It doesn't smell so my husband likes that. It's not greasy so I like that. It made my skin feel very hydrated and added healthy moisture to my face. My skin appears to be a little younger looking. I like using this and I found my new favorite moisture bomb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer feels so refreshing on my skin. I have oily/combination skin with a few dry spots. I have been using this in the morning under my makeup and in the evening after cleansing my face. My face has not gotten oily during the day, and I can see my skin becoming brighter. I see a reduction in the lines around my mouth. I look forward to putting this on every day because it feels so nice on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is nice, it doesn't leave a residue on your face, and feels nice to apply. After 5 minutes of having it on it felt very light, almost like it wasn't there, I'm sure over time it would help with long term moisturization. It is a decent portion size. The packaging is nice, it's not something you'll find at Sephora, but it does the job. There is no SPF in it, so would not recommend as a daytime moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used it for about a week now and it's been really good. I was nervous at first to use it because I have sensitive skin but it did just fine. It's really light weight and doesn't feel like anything is on your skin. My skin is super soft from using. It also did not make my face feel oily which is a huge win in my book! Definitely will buy more once I'm out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really thought this would be oily or heavy, which I would absolutely hate. It wasn't at all. It absorbed into my skin quickly, left no residue. When I showered in the morning however I did feel a bit of a residue and did not like that slimy feeling. Skin is oily halfway through the day with it, so I would prefer only using it at night.

"I had been struggling to find a great moisturizer that really seemed to give me long lasting moisture without feeling sticky or weighed down. This product is the perfect, light weight texture and it feels so luxurious when I am putting it on. I have noticed that my skin overall looks great and it's even been helping prevent breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer. Unlike many others that make my face oily, this one hydrates it and moisturizes my face perfectly. I like that I only have to use just a little bit twice a day and it doesn't make my hands oily either. My face is a lot smoother and it combines well with my make up. This one I definitely recommend to anyone to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Soft to the touch and light on the skin when in use. Smells wonderful and is simple to use. With real ingredients that truly do wonders. Keep hydration in to help your skin feel amazing all day long. Work best when applied after a shower [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My daughter and I both have very dry skin and its very hard to find things that work all day.

"This stuff is AMAZING!! And a TINY bit goes a LONG way! What I love most about this product is it last ALL day long. I'm also very sensitive to smells, but this has a pleasant smell that isn't over bearing. I'm excited about being able to continue using this product and will definitely continue using it in the future!! all I can say is BRAVO Garnier, you definitely have won me over with this one!

This moisturizer is awesome ! The first thing you notice is the glowing blue color when you open it. It is smooth and shiny. It absorbs immediately into your skin without any residue or stickiness. I have always had trouble with dry flaky skin when the weather turns colder. This moisturizer worked wonders in just 3 days . No more flakes or redness. I will be buying it when mine runs out and I recommend it to anyone with dry sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisture cream is perfect for my skin! It doesn't have too much oil that leaves my face feeling like it can't breath. Nice and light and does the job beautifully. My face feels so soft and no acne from clogged pores! My skin dries out in the winter and I really need a moisturizer to help. This gel cream is definitely the bomb! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
For years I've had dry skin. I've tried many products looking for a moisturizer that quenches my dry skin. Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb Is the product that solves that problem. It moistures without leaving my skin feeling sticky or goopy. It leaves my skin soft to touch without leaving any residue. The gel cream makes application fast and easy. The moisture does seem to last all day. I will continue repurchasing this product and recommend to anyone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is amazing. I have really dry skin and I struggle finding a moisturizer that actually lives up to the hype. This actually made my face so soft and silky. It gave me a nice glow. It soaked into my skin without making it feel greasy or leaving a residue. My skin didn't look as tired as it used to. I am definitely going to buy more of this. It doesn't have a weird smell or irritate my face at all. I just can't say enough good things about this skin cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that this stuff has hyularaonic acid in it! Whenever I'm buying moisturizer or anything like it I always make sure that it has HA in it. This moisturizer has a nice consistency which makes it feel like an overnight mask. I feel like it's a little too thick for wearing under makeup but it still works. I just prefer a lighter moisturizer during the day. Overall this is really great to hold moisture in your skin overnight! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first I thought it wasn't going to work because other brands have failed me before, But this one made my face feel moisturized and the next day i felt way better about my skin.

"This stuff is fantastic!! For starters it smells amazing and a little goes a long way!! It's quick drying, and doesn't leave a sticky/oily residue like some other products. It hasn't broken my face out at all, and has kept it perfectly hydrated. I've also used it as a primer for my foundation and it's worked beautifully.

"Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb Moisturizer is wonderful. I usually have very dry skin, but using this product for a couple of days now and my skin feels silky smooth.

"I have dry acne prone dehydrated skin. This is by far the best moisteriser I have ever used! It does not clog pores, it sinks in so easily and nicely and it really hydrates and plumps up the face! I have even been using this during the day under makeup and I swear it's the best thing to use under makeup. It makes my makeup look so much more flawless. Also this does not cause break outs atall! Try it and you will see for yourself :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It really does leave your face feeling soft and moisturized. I bought my first facial moisturizer this past summer and only used it for about a week before I gave up on it.

"Wow, this is not what I expected, I don't think I've experienced a moisturizer quite like this. Most moisturizers are very thick and heavy but this one has body and movement to it, it's a thinner moisturize but it's not greasy or runny. It rubs in well without and residue left over. It is very breathable and light I feel bare faced all day and night. The smell is clean and fresh but not overpowering. This is pretty revolutionary.

"After using the product the first night I thought my face felt a little rubbery, but it dried fast and that feeling was gone in minutes! my skin felt so soft right after that. When I woke up my face get JUST as soft. I washed my face and put some on in the morning and this stuff makes a GREAT base for make up. Wow. I have also noticed my skin tone evening out a bit. Great lightweight moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have dry skin with bumps on my cheeks and this is the perfect remedy. It has made my skin look so healthy in just two days. It gives it that glow that brightens up your face you see on commercials. I've also noticed a decrease in bumps on my cheeks which is caused by dry skin with oil trapped beneath. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"As someone who suffers from dry patches of skin on my faces, I gotta say that this moisturizer worked amazingly! 12+ hours later and my skin is still fairly moisturized and hasn't reverted back to being extremely dry and flaky. Made my skin feel very smooth. This product also has a nice and light berry smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer! I have very dry skin in the spring and summer months and very oily skin during the fall and winter. I love that i can use this same moisturizer all year round because it adds moisture without adding oil, unlike other moisturizers ive used, and it lasts and doesnt leave me dried out at the end of the day. I also love that Its a nice light formula and i can wear it under my makeup without it feeling cakey and gross. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Garnier SkinActive Moisture Bomb is now my new favorite mosturizer! When I first put this on it does have a little bit of a sticky feeling but goes away once you stop running it into the skin. The scent is perfect it's light and not too strong. It certainly last all day and I have really dry skin and I found I don't have to do another layer later in the day which is awesome! I definetly recomendamos this product especially if you have very dry skin like me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Garnier Skin Active Moisture Bomb works pretty well. My face is half oily and half dry, so I liked that this is a non-greasy formula. This made my skin feel smoother and cleaner for the first half of the day, but after 3 it felt gross again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing! I have severely dry skin and have tried product after product and nothing works. Garnier skin active moisture bomb does the trick! It smells really good and before you even get it to your face you can feel how moisturizing it really is. I washed my face first and put this on and I immediately saw a difference. You couldn't tell I had dry skin before and the fine lines around my eyes disappeared. I would definitely recommend this product for everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is my first time really using a moisturizer specific for your face and I got to say I like this! It doesn't feel oily! My skin feels alot softer and it is super light! Gives my face a fresh feeling! It also has a light scent that is not too much as I personally don't care for really heavy perfume or chemical smells!

I think this product is amazing . I been trying it out for the past couple days and it does it exactly what it says it's suppose to do . It's so light weight on the face it makes it comfortable to wear all day ! I have serious dryness around my nose and it made such a difference . I will defiantly be repurchasing this product again . Also the smell of the product is so satisfying it's not to over powering . I highly recommend ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this moisturizer! I've tried many other things and by far this has worked the best for me! I suffer from mild breakouts and tend to dry my skin out attempting to treat my breakouts.

"I love this product!! It gives your skin an instant burst of hydration with out the greasy feel...love the fact that it has goji berry, vitamin c&e & pomegranate! It also helps reduce the appearance of fine lines [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am actually impressed. This has the feel of an expensive serum but at a reasonable price. I like the way it makes my skin feel and the scent is ok. It only takes a few uses to notice softer and nicer skin. I am happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have super sensitive skin, even foundation aggravates it. So I have tried a number of face moisturizers with most leaving an oily feel on my skin that I feel I need to wash again. The moisture bomb is different from the other moisturizers I have tried because it is a gel and not a cream; goes on light and actually absorbs into the skin leaving an instant glow and smooth, soft skin that feels like nothing was even applied. Love that there is no think residue feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I wanna try this again and would buy soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
