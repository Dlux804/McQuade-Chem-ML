This is the third jar I've bought because of my old skin tearing so easy. After using the retinol for awhile I seldom have problems with torn skin. I definitely recommend this product.
"To me, this is a thicker (but not heavy) moisturizing cream. I use it before bed on my hands, arms, and décolleté. My skin is looking a little better taken care of."
I really like this cream. I have been using it for about a month and have noticed a refining of my skin texture. Will buy again!
It's thick and creamy....doesn't leave a residue like most lotions and doesn't have a scent to it which I like! I've given 3 away to those going through chemo and they love it too! Feels good on your skin with no residue!
"This is great moisturizer for your skin. I use it on my face too. It really is worth the money and Sams has a great price. The pump works well, but you need to use your hand when you are running low."
"I almost hate to post such a good review because this cream sold out so fast in the store. Thankfully, I was able to order 3 jars online at Sam's club! I have only used this cream for a few months, but my face is no longer dry & feels so much smoother. I am 67 yrs old and did not take care of my skin when I was younger. I have tried so many expensive cream that did not work. I am not expecting miracles, but this cream has made a big difference. Since I was able to order more, I am now trying it on the rest of my skin!"
"This is my favorite body cream. Super rich, absords fast and not heavily scented. Would have given 5 stars but it could use different pachaging - it's so thick that the pump stops working when the jar is still about 1/3 full. A squeezeable tube woul better"
This leaves your skin feeling just fine at first but after a few days My skin became overly dry! I've never experienced dry skin before and have flakes all over and can't seem to get it under control. Very disappointed in the product and the high reviews that I read. Haven't even noticed a difference in skin tone or anything.
"Cant use it on my face. It makes me break out. I have been suing it on my arms and thighs about the knees. I am 70 and have some crepy skin. On the jar it says ""improves skin tone and texture. boots firmness"" I have been using the cream for about 6 months and see no improvement. I will keep using it for a while more."
Originally purchased to smooth out hand skin but found that it works wonderfully on my elbow psoriasis too. I live in Flagstaff & the environment is very very dry so finding a lotion or creme that moisturizes well has been a struggle until I found this. I use it on my face & I can still feel it hours later although not in a greasy/oily type of way. Would purchase again & again.
I bought this after reading everybody‘s reviews. It is awesome it will make your skin so soft. It is unreal. I have used the First Aid cream what retails around 30.00 Dollars for 6 oz jar. This cream is similar in the softness it will give your skin. Not as heavy as the cream I have been using. It also is very absorbing which I love ❤️.Try it out you can't go wrong. I ordered two more the next day :)
This moisturizing cream is awesome!! My skin has already changed!!! It feels like it's a live again with elasticity and moisture!!!! I love it!!! My dryness isn't as irritating any more as well as my wrinkles aren't as deep but a softer line after only a couple weeks!!!!
"This is one of the best creams I've ever purchased. I started using it only as a face cream but love it so much I use it as a body lotion after a shower, as well. The jar lasts a long time"
"So far I am glad I bought this. Haven't really used it long enough to know for sure but so far I really like it. It goes on so easy, it is not grease, and it feels good on with no order."
It is an average product. Not happy with the feel
of it on my skin and I personally do not like the smell of product. I am still using product to see if it will help get rid of wrinkles on arms.
I have been using this product over a year now and will continue to use this during the cooler months. I recently tried the cocunut lotion which I will use during the summer months. My skin thanks me!
This is an excellent product I always by 2 at a time. I will continue to buy this. My skin looks younger.
"I absolutely love this product, the smell is clean and fresh. My only complaint is that the pump doesn't work!"
"My husband and I both love this moisturizer so much! I bought one for my son, who is now sold in it."
"I buy this for myself and as gifts for all my friends and family. Best cream for neck, rich and contains anti-wrinkle retinol."
"Non greasy, light, and very pleasant light odor. Love how it makes my skin feel. The store was out so I bought 2 online-I don't want to run out!"
I have been looking all over for this cream and finally found it Online it is the best cream around it is not greasy and leaves my skin feeling great!
I started using this product in May of this year...LOVE IT! It really makes my skin feel nice and does help with some signs of aging. Let's face it though...I'll never have the skin of my youth again.
"I'm 78 yrs old and when I say I don't have time for experiments or delays, I'm serious...this stuff is so soothing. It may not fix my wrinkles, but it will make my skin happier while I endure them."
"Very hydrating, absorbs quickly, love how it makes my skin look. I mostly use it on my face and neck. Great price, lasts a long time, convenient pump. I liked it enough to buy it again."
"Have only used this for a couple weeks. It goes on smoothly, leaves skin feeling soft and has no offensive odor. I can't speak to long term, but happy so far."
I REALLY LIKE THIS retinol cream and was disappointed when the store stopped carrying it a couple of months ago. So I was happy to be able to get it in line at Samsclub .com
"Bought this after reading a review about moisture & skin tightening effects! So far for moisture it's fabulous, I can feel a sort of skin tightening when I first apply, so we'll see!"
I think I see am improvement under my eyes and face using this. The wrinkles under my eyes seem more faint than before. It goes on smooth and absorbs fairly quickly.
"Great product for harsh weather climates. Love the texture, a little goes a long way and doesn't feel oily. My skin was glowing after about a week of once a day use. Will definitely be a repeat buyer."
"I like the lotion, but I can't yet tell if there are any retinol benefits after using a couple of weeks. The lotion doesn't tell how much retinol is in there, but the other ingredients are natural so it seems good either way."
I bought this in December when it was on sale and have been using it almost daily. This is a great retinol cream that I use on my face and it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. I like the pump on the container that allows for easy dispensing.
"I began buying this about 9 months ago as a daily body moisturizer, and have loved it. Recently I also began using it as a facial moisturizer, and am so pleased with the results! It's not greasy, soaks in immediately, and leaves my face feeling plump and smooth! Recently visited my friend out of town, and she started using it on my recommendation, and also loves it!"
"I have sensitive skin and will break out with almost anything, except this! It's really helped my face!"
I bought this & surprisingly I love; it feels so good on skin & the dryness is gone texture o f skin much better!!!
"Not greasy at all, has a great fragrance and makes your skin look better, so fast. Highly recommended."
Not nearly as good as Cherry Blossom Moisture Cream! Bring it Back and at an affordable price!!
Resupply from previous purchase...
We will definitely buy this again!
I bought this item a couple of times really like it.
Don't think there's very much retinol in this - it makes skin soft but didn't help lighten the dark spots on my face.
"I originally punched 1 and loved it. Then everyone in the house started using it. I just purchased 2 more, I use it on my body and face. Love it."
I love this moisturizer! It smells great and makes my skin feel soft. It's not greasy and you can use it on your whole body plus your face!
"I really haven't used any other retinol products to compare, but this cream works great. Not oily when putting on...overall great product."
This is a very nice moisturizer - absorbs quickly and is not greasy or sticky. It has a very slight floral scent which dissipates very quickly. I will definitely purchase it again.
"Excellent body moisturize, definitely helps exfoliate dry skin while softening it as well. Won't be without it, I keep a supply on hand. Thank You for adding a pump in jar as well."
A friend bought this once in a Sam's store and I got one also. I love this cream. My husband even uses it for extremely dry skin. I just bought my friend two of these for christmas!
"I have very dry skin and love this as my body lotion. Has a nice fragrance and soaks in and is not greasy. It feels silky or powdery, I Love it and will buy again."
I've been using the Nature Well Clinical Retinol Advanced Moisture Cream for ove a year and I am very satisfied with this cream and have recommended to my friends.
I purchased this a couple weeks ago with my doctor's recommendation as I have thin skin on my forearms. Having tried so many lotions for this problem with no success I was amazed. My leathery skin is softer now.
It's not greasy and my skin readily absorbed the lotion. The retinol is an added bonus.
I can feel such a difference in my skin. Please don't discontinue carrying this.
I bought this a few weeks ago and after 2 weeks I can tell it does exfoliate my skin.
Works so good leaves skin moisturized with out feeling slick. Will buy again
"Still using my first jar, and already purchased a second jar so I don't run out."
I love this stuff I'm going 2 purchase 3 more when I return today 2 get my online order
I love this moister cream! I use it in the morning and before bedtime to moisturize my face
"I 'd like this cream, buying not first time."
It worked good in some areas but in others it clogged up my pores.
Works well not oily and keeps skin moist
I like the feel of the cream but I wish the scent was not so strong.
"My wife uses this and it really moisturizes her skin, I wish they had not taken it off the shelf"
Love this lotion. Perfect balance of moisturizer with anti-aging properties. Win win!
THE SMELL IS RANSID AND ITS VERY OILY CANNOT USE BEFORE U GO GO BED
I'm very happy with how well it mositurizes!
"This is a non-greasy, nice smelling lotion I use all over and am very pleased!"
"Light and very moisturizing, but not greasy feeling at all! I love this!"
This product really helps the dryness and flakes that appear on my forehead occasionally.
I purchased this a few weeks ago and love it.
I think it works better than Iroc and it gives you the moisture you need as well.
This product is not greasy.
Love it. Not greasy. Moisturizers & soaks in quickly.
Love the way my skin feels after applying the Moisture Cream.
Great product..
Love this cream! It feels great and hydrates my skins like nothing else has. Will buy again.
I especially like that the jar has a pump to dispense lotion.
My wife said this cream is as good if not better then most.
I purchased this item in store and liked it so much that I recommended it to all my friends.
I bought one for myself and LOVED it. My teenagers tried it and now they LOVE it. It doesn't feel oily or heavy. Perfect face cream!
Love that it had Retinol in it. I use it on my face neck and arms. My “creepy” skin looks and feels much better.
Very good product!!!
Everything good
"I saw immediate results,"
I bought this three weeks ago after seeing some women on YouTube say how great it was and I'm not disappointed. I love it. I will buy this moisturizer over and over again.
I needed a face cream with retinol that would help my face. So thought I'd give this one a try. Used it morning and night. Also before I put on my makeup. Not greasy at all. Seen a huge difference after a week.
I have tried everything for my aging skin. This is the best product I have ever used. It is scent free too. A little goes a long way and no sticky yucky feeling left behind.
I love this lotion so much! I have oily skin but this lotion doesn't make me break out and keeps my skin very moisturized. The pump is terrible though...as other reviewers have said it stops working when it's about 1/3 left so you are left to just open the entire jar to get some. But the product itself is very good. I'm almost done with my first jar and will keep purchasing more.
"Over the past year I've been trying to use more natural oils like jojoba and almond for my body 'lotion'. They take a lot of work to rub in and be absorbed. Within hours my skin seemed to need another application. When I decided to try Nature Well Retinol Cream and I was amazed. It doesn't take very much, absorbs quickly and easily, and leaves my 65 year old skin silky smooth for most of the day. I went back and bought 4 more jars when it was on sale!"
I bought my first jar a month ago and just reordered two jars. One for me and one for a friend. My husband even uses it on his hands and face because he works outside and his face use to get chapped. With this cream it doesn't. I could tell a difference in my hands and face in one day.
"I cannot say it turned back time, but my skin feels so much better when I use the Nature Well Retinol Advanced Moisture Cream. My arms are not so dry nor is the skin broken or bruised as easily when it is bumped. I am a confirmed user, plus the cost is so much more affordable than most other products saying they will do the same things."
Best cream I've ever bought
Am so happy I bought this online
This firms your skin. I noticed an improvement after using for 2 weeks. Love it!
"I love Samsclub, great price and shipping."
I'm very pleased with how this product makes my skin look and feel.
"Second bottle I've bought. I use it on every part of my body. Love, love."
Really adds moisture to dry skin. Great price for such a large container.
Enough said; use it at night and just watch the results.
Happy I bought this. Will repurchase it.
This cream is fantastic and Sam's made it easy for me by offering great prices and home delivery!
Skin looks and feels better after use
"Although the lotion is decent.... the pump is a nightmare... only works about the first FOURTH of the jar... then pumps ""dry"" and you have to keep taking the entire top off to get any lotion.... very poor design..... a test in patience. if nothing else they need to lower the price and take off the pump completely... it is a 'waste'. Lotion is 'okay' (not outstanding.. .but average. ) :"
"I've been using this moisture cream for about 6 months now and being I'm 70, i really need the extra moisture. This gets adsorbed quickly and doesn't just ""lay"" on my face. I haven't noticed any wrinkle reducing but at my age I really didn't expect to see any, I live in the AZ desert and need a good moisturizer and this fits that purpose!"
Purchased about two weeks ago and I love the way it feels on my face. I apply my Neutrogena over the top of it for sunscreen...........
Loved this moisture cream! One of the best I've ever tried. Was so disappointed when my local Sam's Club stopped caring it. Had to go online to order more.
Please try this lotion....you won't regret it!!
I have very sensitive skin especially after shaving my legs. This lotion has changed my life. Please keep it in stock!
In 3 weeks I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin! Had a few scratches from yard work and it healed them much faster than on their own! Awesome product. I will certainly continue to purchase it!
This is a rich creamy lotion that is great for aging skin. It softens and firms the skin. You can actually tell it's working! I love it. I wish it were in the Sam's stores all the time.
"This product makes my skin glow and it feels soft! I use it on my face, neck, arms and hands, in particular the backs of my hands. They also feel soft and don't look like they belong to a 100 year old woman! Great for the face and neck! You don't need a lot, so this should last quite a while!"
"I love this product. It's so much better than very expensive brands. Love that it's in a jar as the pump failed about 1/2 way thru the jar. I am extremely irritated with our local sams club because when they moved into a bigger and new store, they quit carrying this. Now I'm forced to order online AND pay shipping. makes me want to not shop at Sams club anymore"
very good
"I jyst got this yesterday and I love it! I already can feel a huge difference in my skin. I have used every lotion out there for my dry itchy skin and either the are watery, oily, or just dint do anything. I hope you continue to carry this product as I hate to finally find something that works and its gone :( so please keep stocked."
"I've only been using this product for a few days, and the results are already noticeable. Wrinkles and crease lines are filling �n nicely. I'm using it on my neck, too, and it appears that my developing ""turkey neck"" is less apparent. I'm a guy turning 67 next week, and nobody can believe it from my looks. (I was using a different collagen/retinol cream before, but the manufacturer discontinued it. This cream seems to be working just as well, if not better.) And it's a really good deal for the price, too!"
I gave my 73 yr old mom some for Mother's day. She loves it. I purchased my own the following week. I use it after my shower before I dry off. I'm amazed at the difference I can see all over from head to toe. Reading the other reviews tells me I need to stock up before my Sam's Club stops carrying this lotion.
Tried this product for the first time a few weeks ago. Love the way it makes my skin feel. I have seen a noticeable difference in the appearance and feel of my skin. Highly recommend for any age. I am 61. Local Sam's is out and having to order. Hope they get it back in stock for future purchases.
I love NatureWells Shampoos & Conditioners so I gave this a go. I woke up the next morning an kept looking at my face then proceeded to toss my other skin treatments in the trash (honestly) This product did my skin good. Sometimes the simplest products give the best results
"I have been using this for 2 months and even at over 60 this has improved my skin tone, tightness and wrinkles. I use it on my face, neck, chest and arms. I love it. I wanted to buy more but the Sams in my area are out of it. I hope that they keep stocking it.."
"I'm on my second jar and there is 16 oz of product in this jar. I have used very expensive creams at least 40 yrs. I am 70 now and I've never used anything better than this. I use it morning and night on my face, neck, and arms. I hope they NEVER stop carrying this cream, but just in case I'm stockpiling it!"
This product has made such a difference to face since starting to use it about a month ago. My face feels smooth and soft just from using this product. I apply the product two times a day. I was worried it would make my face oily throughout the day and it hasnt. Overall great product and I will be getting more.
"The size of this lotion is great. It comes with a pump and you get a great amount for the price. I have been using mine at my work desk. I am very pleased with this lotion. I can use it as body lotion and face lotion. My skin gets dry in the winter and this helps keep it smooth. What I like most about this lotion is how firm it made my skin. It leaves it firm, smooth and glowing. Only thing that caught me off guard was how thick it was at first but it smooths out nicely. All together, great product!"
"Got this cream last time at Sams. Was shocked how great this cream is. Had a dark sun spot on the side of my cheek, and its almost gone from applying this cream. Have tried many Retinols but this is the best one I have ever tried!! Please Sams dont stop handling this cream, cause Im telling all my friends!!!! Love IT!!"
I use it every day on my chest and arms. Keeps that area smooth and makes red marks go away quicker.
Love this cream. Will continue to use it. It makes my skin so soft. The only issue I had when it came in the mail the bottle was damaged.
I bought this recently with the coconut cream and love both of them. They really go on your skin nicely and give a lot of moisture.
After using this product on my hands and arms for 3 months I was surprised to notice my age spots were looking lighter. I hadn't expected this. I just liked the way it made my skin feels.
I have very dry skin. This cream is just the right consistency to smooth on with some of my essential oils. It soaks in to my skin great and leaves it feeling soft and smooth!
This is the best Product and keep my skin smooth and moisturized. I have very dry skin and tried most of the Branded Creams but none of them worked. We need it in every Sams Club.
"Started uses this product about a month ago. My husband asked me today, what are you putting on your face, your skin looks younger and soft. It passes."
"This cream help the skin feel soft but there is a light scent when first applied to skin, later on the fragrance got stronger and I didn't like it. I had to wash it off."
"This is a wonderful product! I will be buying again before I run out. I use it as body lotion , sure helps keep my skin soft and great for creepiness!!"
"I'm so happy I tried this moisture cream. I was very skeptical when the container said to use it on your face and body, but I tried it and was hooked after the first use! I applied to my body after a shower and it felt so nice and silky on my skin, like an expensive cream, that it made me comfortable to try it on my face and neck. Your skin feels smooth and supple, not greasy or tacky and I've noticed an improvement in my skins appearance. Grab a jar. You're not going to find such a nice cream at a better price."
I bought this on the recommendation of my 78 year old cousin that was raving about it helping diminish her scars and keeping her skin from drying out in their severe winters. I absolutely love it! I also have noticed it seems to help smooth out my scars. I also have eczema and this does not irritate it and my sharp dry skin is no more! Absorbs pretty quick too.
"I just came across the tester yesterday at the store and bought it. Loved the scent. It instantly makes skin feel moisturized, non greasy and blends in quickly. Doesn't leave a heavy feeling on skin. Haven't used it before so do not know what it will do with wrinkles etc, but very happy to find a lotion that actually moisturizes!!!"
It works well enough but the smell is terrible. Like wet molded towels. So bad I can't use it.
Only been using it a couple weeks but love it. Hope to feel some results in a few more weeks.
"This is my third bottle, it good for the face"
I am very happy with this cream
Soft skin that last the whole day.
"Great creme, I use it all over"
I am happy with this vream
I bought this a couple of weeks ago and I like the way it glides on my skin. It is soft and light.
Love the moisture is has without feeling greasy!
I bought this a month ago and I am glad I did. Smooths my face. Even skin. Much younger face.
Excellent product for very dry skin.
Best skin cream I've ever purchased
"Excellent moisturizer, will keep in stock at my house for a very long time."
This product contains mineral oil. Mineral Oil is a comedogenic: causes acne by blocking the pores of the skin.
"I purchased this and use on my face, neck and hands. I particularly see a difference on my hands and I am very happy with this product."
"I was sad when my club stopped carrying this cream, it is rich, but not heavy, feels good. I still have wrinkles, but fee better!"
I have dry sensitive skin with hyperpigmentation. This product moisturizes all day long and adds a healthy glow! Love it..definitely ordering more!
I use this head to toe
Good product
I loved this cream the first time I used it.. My skin feels moisturized and smoother.
This is a great value and love the way it makes my skin feel.
Example: I bought this a month ago and am so happy that I did...
"First time, Spots and Wrinkles are less and continued use continues to improve the looks."
"I am on my third jar of this cream and I love it, however, the dispenser quit working about half way through the jar on every single one. Its still usable but very annoying"
I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks and so far i think it is great. It is a very light moisturizer with no oily feel. It absorbs quickly and I have been not just using it on my face but my chest and arms as well. My husband has also starting using it! I do wish it had a smaller pump as it can pump out more than you need if you're not careful but it is not a hard adjustment to get used to. Overall I am very happy with this product!
Love it
I love the way my skin feels after using this cream. It has made a difference. I?m getting ready to order a second jar.
"Me and my husband use this 2 times a day, we both can tell the appearance of fine lines has deminished and I had 2 dark sun spot's on my upper chest - almost gone now.."
Good product....... Generous amount for a reasonable price.
I have used this daily on my neck and chest area to fight the signs of aging. I actually noticed an improvement in my skin in those areas.
I've only used it for a few days but I did find that my skin feels more supple. Time will tell. It's goodbye. I use it all over my body.
It's light and moisturizing! Love it! Will definitely buy more!
"Love this cream,, will buy again"
i love their products they are super!
