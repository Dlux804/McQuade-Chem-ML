"Although my lines are extremely fine, i decided it was time (age 57) to start using something before they got more pronounced. I've been doing some research as to what to try and came up with Roc as a good one. I noticed a marked improvement in my skin with the first useage, very impressed! You should give this a try, definitely worth it!"
"I'm 24yrs old and decided to start maintaining my youth...this product has done the trick, my skin is soft and in the morning has a little glow. I also have acne scars and this has helped with them also. If your in your 20s give it a go!!!!"
I lost 30 lbs from thyroid activity. My face felt dry and wrinkly. This helps the dryness and hopefully will keep skin supple until I regain some weight`
"I have used the RoC line of products for years as part of my daily skincare routine. Several months ago it was suggested I try a new line of anti-aging cream. I bought a three month supply of the recommended products and the results were not what I expected and did not compare to the results I had from the RoC products. I have returned to my favorites - deep wrinkle night cream, deep wrinkle daily moisturizer and correction eye cream! Absolutely love these products and will not stray again."
"This cream doesn't work for me. I know it is rated highly and many, many people love it due to its content. I supposed I expected more BECAUSE of all the positive reviews. For me, it is just another waste of time. Sorry. You see, I haven't seen the softening of lines after regular use for a month. What I have seen is my pores get clogged. Ugh! Oh well, it is usually so true that you get what you pay for."
I tried this product for three days. It has been two days since I stopped. I was at work when the reaction began. My face is bright red with raised areas and flaking painful areas. I finally tried some burn cream that is helping but as I type this there are several areas that are painful. I actually feel ill. I am super frustrated and disappointed. I feel like I came in contact with a chemical that was not meant for skin.
"I'm 72, and strangers don't guess I'm more than 48-50 (nice people)! I've been using ROC Deep Wrinkle Night and Day Serum for 10+ years. PLEASE don't stop providing these GREAT products. THANK YOU!"
"I'm only in the third week, but noticed a difference the first week. I don't (or didn't) have really deep wrinkles, but under or near both sides of the skin near my mouth. I also had a wrinkle I got a long time ago due to over exposure to sun. That completely disappeared. My husband noticed the difference already. Great product!"
"It is still early to see what will happen, but I am hopeful. It is my new night cream"
This is a great product and I couldn't believe the price. Will be back for more.
i've used this product for many years. I actually wear it under my make-up. I tell people i'm 29 and everyone believes me... im actually 41..
"Its been d/c'd from the store i bought it in canada, and now im desperately trying to find more!!!"
"I am 29 with few light forehead wrinkles. I have used this for one week now. Since the first night I noticed my forehead wrinkles were worse! I thought maybe it was just coincidence but I'm on day 6 of using it and my wrinkles are much deeper than before using it. I have read reviews making these claims too, I don't understand how this could happen."
"I found that this product has definitely helped with the wrinkles. I'm 60, and I have used this product for a few years now and people do say that I look younger than 60."
"Roc Retinol is awesome! I'm nearly 42, but people are surprised to learn I'm over 32. I tell them Retinol is the secret and that I swear by Roc Retinol."
Good product and service
"Amazing stuff! I'm only in my 30's but I have deep crow's feet and lines across my forehead. I used this night cream along with Roc's serum during the day under my usual moisturizer, and within about 2 weeks I swear my wrinkles were fainter and my skin was smoother and clearer. My only caution would be to take a week off every once in a while; after 4 weeks I had some dryness that a break seemed to alleviate."
"I have been using this for 2 years and am finally doing a review. You can take all my makeup away, my hair products... all my beauty ""stuff""... but you cannot take my RoC. I LOVE this stuff. It has made a huge difference in fine lines. I'm almost 60 and can use the help. It does not irritate my skin. It has refined my pores and removed uneven skin tone. I use it during the day (even though this is the nightime version. the day version gave me a slight rash...it's oilier) under spf 15 sunscreen."
I just started using the roc Pro correction cream just after Christmas and this stuff actually works.I've tried over 100 of creams over the years and never saw a difference. I was so amazed I ordered the deep wrinkle one tonight.I have before and after pictures and can't believe the difference in my lines and skin.So yes this is awesome skin care cream
"I had read from a trusted dermatology source that results would not be as fast as a prescription retinol such as tretinoin. Rather, it would take 2-3 months. Sure enough, within 90 days of consistent use, my skin had improved noticeably. It is not as thin, has more elasticity, and appears healthy and more youthful. I have been using it for about 2 years now and love it. I am 62, and told every day that I look 10-15 years younger. Although my goal was not to look younger, it makes me feel good to know my skin is healthy."
"Based on reviews I have read, I decided to have an experiment on my face. I saw the difference the next morning that my expression line reduced a little bit on the right side of my face. One week later, I can tell the difference even on the left side of my face. I tried many kind of products to reduce the wrikles and expression lines, but only this product makes a dramatic change."
"I noticed a positive improvement in my skin after just one use. My skin felt smoother with less redness, smaller pores and blemishes by morning. Felt a little irritation the following day but very minimal. Retinol will irritate your skin when you first start using it, so use it every other night when starting out. So far I am very impressed with this product."
"Roc's Deep Wrinkle Night Cream does an amazing job of reducing lines and wrinkles. I rotate it with Roc's Wrinkle Resurfacing System as part of my night regimen. After finishing one product, I switch to the other so my skin doesn't get too used to the same product.The results are visibly noticeable with or without makeup!"
I started using ROC years ago around my eyes and I still don't have visible wrinkles. I also diminished a deep wrinkle between my brows! People think I am 10 to 20 years younger. They make me show my ID to prove I am not lying about my age because I look young!
"Sadly, my mouth has little wrinkles showing up. I should have used ROC there too. Never too late to start."
Have used this as well as other Roc products for years and took my skin for granted. Several months ago after running out of the lift creme and having difficulty finding it I ended up trying a more expensive department store line. I was mortified to see my skin getting progressively worse! I went back to the creme and immediately saw improvement!
"This is wonderful for wrinkles. Please help me with sagging skin, you no longer sell the lift creme."
Have used product for 4 nights and noticed some tingling around my eyes the first night. On the third day I had a little redness under my eyes. Today I look like I have a sunburn under my eyes and had burning when applying my regular moisturizing lotion! Strange that it does not burn on the rest of my face or my throat! Will discontinue using around my eyes.
I read reviews about burning of skin so I don't use every day- about three times a week. I notice an overall improvement in skin tone but I've had serious acne breakouts in past few weeks. Not sure if related but seems to be clearing up now. If I overuse it will dry out skin too. Notice forehead stress lines less visible. I've been using for 10 weeks.
"This product is the best night cream I have tried in my quest to fight aging. I normally only buy from Walmart or similar stores, but I have tried Cindy Crawford's Meaningful Beauty program and Roc's cream is better than all. I have been using it for about three weeks and my husband has even mentioned that I have a ""glow"" now. My skin has better tone and I am excited about what results I will see with prolonged use."
"As many other reviews claim, this burnt my skin after the 3rd application. And it aged under my eyes about 15 years. Haven't used for 4 days and my skin is still sagging under my eyes (which was never a problem before!) and my skin has red patches all over it. Seeing my doctor Monday. Hoping this clears up. Very disappointed and worried that my skin will not get better from the damage."
"This is such a good product. I stopped using it for about a year while I tried other more expensive serums and lotions. I had to switch back. The difference in the way my skin feels was almost immediate. The difference in appearance took about a week to see, but kept on improving after that. I wish I hadn't stopped using this to try anything else. I won't again."
I've been using the product for about two weeks. My face burned for a short time after each use. Small red bumps developed but dried up and flaked off shortly after appearing. I'm willing to continue using it through the first tube to see what the results will be.
I've used this for 3 nights & my face is very red in places but especially around my eyes. I have puffy eye lids. My face & neck stings & itches. This is the first time I've used this cream although I've used other Roc products that have not caused any issues. Is this to be expected or should I stop using it? Thank you for your response!
"I am 54 years old and I have been using this for the last month. Many of my friends have noticed the difference in my face and commenting. Face looks very bright , clear and fresh. I had slight pigmentation on sides of my cheeks , it has lightened but not totally diappeared. There was no unbearable or bad smell. I am totally happy with this product."
"I purchased the product and followed the instructions as stated on the packaging and the website. I brought the cleansing pads, eye cream, day cream and night cream. I had to stop using the products on the 4th day as my face was on fire with a red rash and swollen. Not only did I lose the cost of all the products, now I have the added expense of doctors visits and lost time at work. The rash did not come on gradually it was like I woke up on the fourth day and BAM there it was."
"I've been using this for about 4 months, and am just finishing up with my first 1oz tube. It took about a month to really see the results. For me it is the deep lines coming from my nose to the edges of my mouth that are going away. On one side the line is almost gone, and on the other side it is greatly diminished. I'm 65. This is a great product. At the start I found my skin a little sensitive, but I just used it every 2 or 3 days, and within about 10 days or so I could use it nightly."
This product is improving the look and texture of my shin. And it makes my skin feel great too. My only issue is that I waited so long to start using it. I am truly getting better results with various ROC products than the department store products that I have been using for so many years. I am pleasantly surprised and ashamed of thinking I had to use the fancy brands. I am so happy with ROC. My skin feels firm and hydrated.
"I have purchased every product under the sun. Some have worked and others not so much. I kept seeing dermatologists recommending ROC on TV however I thought the more $ you pay the better the product. Well, everyone put your money back in your wallet. Get this line. IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!"
"I love this cream. I just turned 40 and my skin has changed a bit, this cream even helps reduce the appearance of my smile lines on the sides of my mouth as well as the crows feet and wrinkles under my eyes. If these products dry your skin or irritate it please try the formulas for sensitive skin. I recommended this product to my mom and it made her skin too dry for her liking, so she switched to the sensitive skin formulas and said she likes that formulation much much better"
"I began using this product and the eye cream and it immediately turned my skin red. It looked as if I had severe rosacea. There were small itchy patches under my eye and on the side of my cheek, and now under my neck. My face ended up looking splotchy. The areas that were burned are now extremely dry and tender, as well as flaking. I'm not sure this is a typical reaction, but it has not been a pleasant one for m."
"I use this product every night and I can't say enough good things about it. It's FANTASTIC. It takes years off my face. I have tried prescription level retinol and have not had as great results as I do from RoC. I have very sensitive, dry skin, so at first I was afraid it would be harsh. But it was NOT. My skin has never looked better and my make up goes on better than ever before in the morning after using it the night before. I tell everyone I know who wants their skin to look younger to go to the store and buy this straight away."
I used this once and experienced burning and redness. The instructions say this is not unusual so I assumed it would get better and used it a second time. I had a horrible reaction - burning/swelling/redness/roughness. Using the daily moisturizer and cleaner pads made it even worse. My skin looks and feels horrible. The cream seems to have migrated around my eyes and caused redness and puffiness. I've used many face creams and never had any reaction to any of them.
"I agree with the other reviews that the product has a distinct smell. I actually like it. The smell wears off once it absorbs. This product is so creamy and smooth. I love the texture of this stuff! It doesn't leave your face greasy. My skin looks brighter, more even, and my fine lines are going away. I use the daily moisturizer and eye cream too. I'm pretty happy, especially with the cost."
I believe this cream does work wonders for your skin but I cannot stand the smell of it. It reminds me of the smell that your skin has after using a self tanning lotion. Gives me a horrible headache. Very bummed because the cream works very well. PLEASE MAKE AN UNSCENTED VERSION OF THIS!! :)
"I used this product and it burned my skin, it left it scaly, dry and sore. I have a raised heat rash all over my cheeks and neck. This product wasn't cheap, but I will be throwing it away. If you like your skin soft and not up in flames, I would say stay away from this. Also, I don't have sensitive skin, so if you do, be warned!"
I'm 60 years old with normally pretty tough skin. I've used this product for a week and all was going fine. Then yesterday my neck broke out in a bad rash. I used it tonight but didn't but it on my neck. Just having it on my face though increased the rash on my neck. I'm only giving it 1 star because I had a bad reaction. Just be careful using it. I'm going to let the rash clear up then try maybe using it ever 3rd day instead of every night and see what happens.
I started to use this product to replace my Clinique night cream. My skin feels silky smooth when I wake up. I am in my mid-30's and I struggle with occasional break-outs due to hormones and stress. I really contribute the over all improvement to my skin to this night cream. I still get the monthly large zit but it heals and clears up so much quicker. And I have never noticed the smell.
I am 28 years old and started to notice wrinkles forming on my forehead. I am very fair and have sensitive skin. I have been using the product for only 3 nights and already see a HUGE difference. I have not had any flaking or burning... However I only use a thin layer on my forehead. Great product!
"I use the serum first, wait a second for it to dry then put this on- I didn't find any weird smell- it smells clean to me- I found a few really good products from Roc that work for me- this, the serum, eye cream & BB cream with SPF in it- VERY nice products, even better for the price-"
I put this product on and immediatley noticed a burning sensation under my eyes i went to bed and thought maybe it took some getting used too. I woke up with my under eye area red and tender. I have burn marks on my under eye area from this cream and its been 2 days. I would not recommend this to anyone
I have been using Roc products forever. I am 82 years old and my skin looks great..My problem is the cap.. Is there any way you can improve the cap.. I find it difficult and sometimes I drop it.. Hate to think it is my age but maybe you can improve on it if you have had any other suggestions about this.
Thank you
I'm 52 years old and I tried everything to get rid of my age spots on my face.I did peels you name it I did it.I had age spots for about maybe twenty years.And now since I started useing ROC night time one for wrinkles my age spots as faded a lot now when I put on makeup you can't see my age spots and I just started useing Roc about three months but notice right away my face was starting to glow.And for wrinkles I had one deep one on the top of my nose and now it's not as deep.So now I'm a Fan of Roc.
"I bought this product after using the RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® MAX Wrinkle Resurfacing System and RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Eye Cream for a month. I had wonderful results (and loads of comments on how great my skin was looking) with those products and decided to buy this product for night time use. Today, after using this for three nights, my skin is red, stinging with dry hive blotches in spots. Not the way I wanted to look for my 50th birthday on Monday. :("
"My wife was so happy to get this product. After reading reviews, it seemed to be the best thing for her. After a few night's use her face was red, swollen, and very painful. She is a natural red head. So I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. She is so very disappointed. If this doesn't go away soon we may need to see our doctor, or go to the emergency room if the pain gets to be too much."
I am 77 years old and no one ever guesses my age! They are amazed at how wonderful my skin looks and always asks my secret and my answer is always ROC. I have been using ROC night cream for fine and deep wrinkles now for many years and KNOW it really works. Thanks for a wonderful product and keeping me looking much younger than my actual years.
"Its true that this product contains parabens but FDA has declared its safe to use in cosmetics from what I read online..So that's that but this product is amazing, I mean even if I miss applying this for a couple of days and then apply, my husband says I glow that day. I noticed a visible difference, my skins just glows, I do not have wrinkles so can't say for that. I love this product and also gifted it to my mom and sisters."
"I started using Doc several years ago. And loved it, but it stopped working after several years in a row. So I switched to a competitor and hated it! I'm back on my Roc and here to stay! This is the number one 1 product on all the review sites, and for good reason! I love you Rock!"
"This is my 12th week of using and OMG, I'm glad I stuck it out. My crow's feet, gone! Skin is tight. Forehead wrinkles were deeper and those are smoothed out. I do pair it with the eye cream. Now that cream is amazing!"
I too read the reviews after I purchased and used this product. I used it at night after washing my face and two days later had redness and burning on cheeks and area under the eye. I only used it twice.....will return to store.
I've been a ROC customer for years. I've used this product since I was 45 and I'm 59 years old. It works wonders! It's great for those fine line and wrinkles. I can't wait to try the Serum. Rock on ROC!
"After using this product I became very ill, when I read the ingredients it contains Lactose, im Lactose intolerance, there is no warning on the box so please be aware if you are Lactose intolerance as I nearly ended up in hospital."
"Have been using this for at least 4 months three times per week. No irritation , dry skin or peeling. Works well for fine lines but have not noticed much improvement in hyperpigmentation. Will purchase again!"
"I started to use it and on the third night my face burned, today I woke up with my face burning all over my skin and red, I also have red spots, I'm scared, I have pictures."
"I used this cream for a week, yesterday my skin started to burn, is all red and i have horrible burning feeling."
I am terrified.
What can I do to stop this?
Wow I can't rave enough about how great this product is. I saw a change in my skin the first week of using it. Lightened age spots and Sun damage as well as a drastically reduced deep lines . This is my favorite product of my daily regiment..
"I srarted using roc night cream 6 weeks ago. My skin is still red and irritated I knew this would happen , but thought it would be better by now. I am 77 yrs old , perhaps too old for this product."
I love this system how it makes my skin feel. I have a question about what place the retinol is in your ingredients list. sometimes it's near the top and sometimes its near the bottom. which is the correct ingredient list?
Terrible burning over entire face...third application and can barely wash face..red areas...I have never had a product do this to me have no idea what to use to stop the pain...
Extremely nervous about any damage it may have done..
After using the correxion eye cream and noticing a real difference i researched this. I'm using it in combination with the deep wrinkle filler ans have noticed a difference in my deep forehead lines in only a few weeks. Customer for life!
my Husband brought this cream for me. I was very happy for it. I follow the direction and how to use it.It burns my face and my neck . I still have the marks on my face and neck waiting for it to heal.
Pro: Love the product. The skin feels smooth and very soft after a week use. Con: too strong perfume in the product. Wish manufacturer can stop put the perfume in it or to come out with the Sensitive line product with no perfume.
"I have been using this product for two weeks and I am a little disappointed. My skin has actually become very dry especially around my eyes. It has ,however, eliminated some acne I had on my cheeks that no other product had been able to disappear."
"If you have sensitive skin this is not for you. it burns my face every time I use it. and after 2 weeks I have not seen any difference. for what it cost I feel like I should keep using it. maybe it is just me, but I don't see any change yet."
ROC IS SO WORTH EVERY DROP.USED IT FOR YEARS BUT NOT ABLE TO AFFORDED NOW..LOVE IT AND LOVE THAT THEY DONT USE AN Y SUPER YOUNG PERSON ON THEIR COMMERCIALS
"I have been using this products for a week or so and I feel a burning, tingling sensation around my eyes... I bought this product for my eye area and now I can't use it."
Too much fragrance. I have used ROC for years and it seems lately they have added unnecessary fragrance to their formula. Is there any ROC product that is definitely fragrance free?
I have been using this product for 6 months and I see the results.
Have to use this for several months before a noticeable difference.
Have used for years. Works great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this stuff! Silky smooth skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for a year now. Not only have I seen wrinkles disappear, but no new ones have formed. At age 69, I consider this a miracle! For the first time in my life, complete strangers tell me what beautiful skin I have. It took about six months to actually see the improvement begin. But, if you stick with it, you will be very pleased with your skin."
"I've been using ROC skin products for years and get many compliments on my skin. I'm 52 years old, drink lots of water (!) and use lots of sunscreen to try and help my aging skin keep some semblance of a youthful glow! This night cream is just right for aging skin needing extra help with moisture and elasticity."
I have been using this product for about 10 days. I have noticed a difference in the expression lines in my forehead however my face all over has broken out. Should I continue to use the product and the acne will subside after using the product for a while?
"This stuff is amazing! If you have wrinkles that are deep enough to actually leave scars, this is for you! My foread got hit with deep wrinkles and using this every night coupled with massaging the areas resulted in major improvement! Repeat buyer, recommended."
"I bought the day and night cream. I used both as a skin care regimen and by the fourth day my skin was patchy and scaly. The skin on my face was peeling all over but there were significant red patches where the skin was raw. I didn't put anything on my face after that but you could see the areas where the skin was raw starting to lightly scab. Unfortunately, my face is now scarred. Disappointed."
"I used this for a few days, then when I put my foundation on one morning, my skin felt like was on fire! It wasn't just “tingly”, it hurt. A lot! Im afraid to continue using it near my eyes. I expect a little sensitivity due to the nature of the product, so maybe I will use it sparingly and only once a week."
I like this product. As good as pricer items at Sephora or Ulta. It is a bit oily feeling when applied.
Used this product for 4 consecutive days and it created redness and flakes on my face. And everytime i put it on my face it feels like its burning.
I have been using your deep wrinkle and correction eye cream for 3 months and see no difference...using twice a day most times...
"I recently had someone tell me in the doctor's office ""There is *no* way you're 46 because I'm almost 50 and you look nothing like me."" Thanks!"
Used for weeks with no visible difference other than redness. Skin burned for days after discontinued use.
My face was burning for more than 8 hours .even after i washed my face. The next day my face continue to burn
I have only used it for a week but everyone is asking if I have had a face lift.. So worth the price
"I have been using this product for a long time , really love it its helping with my sun damaged skin."
"I have only used ROC's products for a short time, but I am already noticing a positive difference! My wrinkles are diminishing and my skin glows. I love this product!"
"Great product, I love it"
I love the product and have had good results. My only wish is that you discontinue the addition of fragrance to the product. I don't understand why fragrance is added to a product that is made to be used on your face and is applied around your nose. The scent is strong and a negative.
"I used this once on 8/7/15 at night, when I woke up in the morning my face was Red & Swollen. It looked terrible! Under my eyes is still very swollen and I'm scared it want go down. What should I do? I do not have sensitive skin and have used many products before and never had this happen before."
"I Wrote an earlier review and said I have been using this Product for over a year. I actually realized I have been using this Product since 2015; three years now and it has done nothing. If anything, It is causing me to brakeout and it is burning my face. I am 46 years old and I now have bumps all over my face as if I am a tenaager just starting maturity. I have discontinued and will throw away the last tube I have."
I've been impressed with how soft my skin has been skin took around 3 weeks to see results!!!
Saw results after about a week of use...wonderful!
I've used it for 2 years now and I love it big difference in wrinkle reduction
I love it using it since my 20's
No wrinkles beautiful
"After a week,my neck creases are improving! Impressed! It is not greasy at all."
Very noticeable difference! And totally affordable! Thank you RoC!
I love this product I saw visable results in 1 week
"After a few days, my cheeks and chin became swollen and red so had to discontinue."
non greasy and light on skin. good around eyes and mouth.
Why include the smell? The product may be great but I am allergic to artificial fragrances.
"I put this on before bed. Woke up to burning snin at 5 am. Tried to tolerate but could not stand it anymore longer . My fave was red, swollen and on fire. Ended up in urgent care, had chem burn / allergic."
I've been using this product for many years. The forehead lines were gone within two weeks of use. The crowsfeet are mere whisps! I love my ageless look!
"I have been using the daytime version, and my skin looked and felt great for weeks, so I decided to try the nighttime cream , I applied at night and the following day I thoroughly washed my face and put on the daytime version with suncreen. I went on about my day and in the evening, after removing my makeup, i noticed i had a shadow on my upper lip area and bridge of nose! And still now, 12 hrs after, i still have burning sensation in those areas. Hoping my skin will recover and my sun mustache go away!"
My skin is in pretty good condition because I started taking care of it early. Taking this challenge reinforced the belief of how important it is to nurture and love your skin...particularly aging skin. I'm.47 years young and appreciate the benefits I experienced with this product in just 4 short months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like ROC Retinol Correxion, it absorbs really well into my skin without leaving a residue. I to my wrinkle prone areas and it seems to be slowly working. It is not something that you need a lot of, so it last for a while. It doesn't leave any adverse reaction on my skin and even though it takes time, if you use it everyday you will start seeing differences. I really like this product so far and look forward to continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed trying this product. It was easy to use, and I have such a busy life, I don't have a ton of time for a long night time routine. It felt great going on, and I have noticed some subtle differences in just 4 weeks! I will continue to use and hope for continuing results! I love that it is affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream is effective in dramatically reducing the appearance of deep wrinkles and expression lines with an exclusive non-comedogenic, oil-free formula. Its concentration of retinol and alpha hydroxy acid are miracle workers when it comes to firming skin and restoring that youthful glow that every women desperately seeks to portray. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have noticed somewhat of a difference in fine lines therefore I will continue to use the product. I don't really have deep wrinkles yet. I am a night shift nurse and don't get to use the product the way I would like which is my fault. I usually use it before moisturizer under make up. Maybe it would work better if I were able to use it overnight... Idk? I'm usually to tired to take the extra step of applying it after a 16hr shift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Night Cream - I love the light texture and the scent! It makes my face feel so smooth and refreshed right before I go to bed! Time will tell how effective the cream will be on wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed using the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream. From day one, the cream made my skin feel so soft and smooth after each application; 'without' any greasy feeling. Then, after a week or so, I could really start to see some of the little wrinkles begin to disappear. Thank you so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have truly enjoyed using ROC retinal face cream. I have faithfully used this for30 days and I am already seeing results. Fine lines have been lessened and my deep forehead wrinkles are now very minimal and I had absolutely no sensitivity whole using this. I will most defiantly continue to use this product. Thanks #ROC for giving me opportunity to trying something new that will now be a staple in my daily routine. I'm very pleased..thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"RoC Retinol Correxion dee Wrinkle Night Cream made me feel like I was glowing. I felt like my skin looked better, more moistured and more youthful. The smell of the product is ok and stronger when applied at first but disappears after a little while. o didn't really have any ringly feeling after application which was nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasently surprised with the results I had while using Roc® Retinol Correction® Deep Wrinkle night cream. I noticed my skin becoming more even and then I started noticing diminished wrinkles around my eyes and mouth first at 3 weeks.

RoC works wonderful. The scent is very pleasant. RoC makes your skin feel wonderful every morning. RoC always leaves your skin looking brighter and more youthful than before.

"At 41, I consider myself luMicky not to have deep wrinkles. But, I also don't want them to start! I do have a ton of sun spots and had heard retinol was good to help them go away. 30 days after using RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, the spots are starting to fade and my skin looks a bit brighter. Can't wait to see myself in another 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This works as described. Being that I just hit 50 and live in a sunny state and have dry skin, I do have wrinkles.

"I received a sample of this and was surprised at how easy it was to use. I was hesitant to use a retinol because I have very fair skin and live in FL, so it can be hard to limit sun exposure.

Love this RoC Retinoal Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream which I had received as a free sample in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

"I've been using this for a week now and my skin is red, it burns and it's flaking off. This is not how a product should be and I've used many different wrinkle creams."
This stuff works great. I especially like it in the Winter when my dry skin needs to be shed. I've gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since using this product.
Used this for years. I'm in my senior years now and my face is smooth. I mix products and have always bought this one. Walmart has reduced the prize also. Compare with other stores even Amazon and you can not beat the price. Good product.

"I use the RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Night Cream and after using it for years - I think my skin is in fairly good shape although it still causes acne breakouts on my chin and at the sides of my mouth. I want to know what is the actual percentage of Retinol in this product and what type is it? Retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate, retinyl linoleate ?"
"I gave this product a good try - almost 2 months. No wrinkle correction, not even very fine lines. It tended to dry out my face & make the skin look older! My Aveeno day skin creams & Pond's night creams work much much better in making my skin look & feel younger!!!"
THIS PRODUCT HAS PARABENS IN IT WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CARCINOGENIC AND HARMFUL!!! PEOPLE NEED TO READ ABOUT WHAT IS IN THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE THE COMPANIES OBVIOUSLY DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING; THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT DOLLAR SIGNS....:P THERE IS NO WAY I'LL USE THIS PRODUCT.
"Generally I am not allergic, in fact I never have had allergy from any of the creams. When I applied “Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream” I was shocked from the reaction on my skin. On a second day of using the product my eyes and face got swollen. It created redness around my eyes, dried out my skin and caused flaking. It will take me a while to recover from it. I didn't expect that cream which supposes to help your skin might cause such damage. I am extremely disappointed with this product."
I used this Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream as directed. After the second night I noticed a slight burning sensation but the enclosed information stated that this might happen in the beginning so I continued using the product. By the 4th night the burning was so severe I had to discontinue using it. My skin was red and uncomfortable. I am going to return the product to the store where I purchased it.
"I started using this product for a couple of days ago and noticed a difference with my skin,Theres only one down side i cannot use under my eyes the place were i want to target the most cause it feels like they are burning but its brill on the rest of my face.no problem with burning."
This is a fantastic product. It adds value to my looks.
